 Item 1. Business 

General 

First Financial Northwest, Inc. (&#8220;First Financial Northwest&#8221; or the "Company&#8221;), a Washington corporation, was formed on June 1, 2007, for the purpose of becoming the holding company for First Financial Northwest Bank ("the Bank&#8221;) in connection with the Bank's conversion from a mutual holding company structure to a stock holding company structure which was completed on October 9, 2007. At December 31, 2015 , we had total assets of $979.9 million, net loans of $685.1 million, deposits of $675.4 million and stockholders&#8217; equity of $170.7 million. First Financial Northwest&#8217;s business activities generally are limited to passive investment activities and oversight of its investment in First Financial Northwest Bank. Accordingly, the information set forth in this report, including consolidated financial statements and related data, relates primarily to First Financial Northwest Bank. 

First Savings Bank, organized in 1923 as a Washington state-chartered savings and loan association, converted to a federal mutual savings and loan association in 1935 and to a Washington state-chartered mutual savings bank in 1992. In 2002, First Savings Bank reorganized into a two-tier mutual holding company structure, became a stock savings bank, and the wholly-owned subsidiary of First Financial of Renton, Inc. In connection with the 2002 conversion, First Savings Bank changed its name to First Savings Bank Northwest. Subsequently, in August 2015, the Bank changed its name to First Financial Northwest Bank to reflect the commercial banking services it provides beyond those typically provided by a traditional savings bank. In February 2016, the Bank officially changed its charter from a Washington chartered stock savings bank to a Washington chartered commercial bank. 

First Financial Northwest became a bank holding company, after converting from a savings and loan holding company on March 31, 2015, and is subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board") through the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco ("FRB"). The change is consistent with First Financial Northwest Bank's shift in focus from a traditional savings and loan association towards a full service, commercial bank. Additionally, First Financial Northwest Bank is examined and regulated by the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions (&#8220;DFI&#8221;) and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;). First Financial Northwest Bank is required to maintain reserves at a level set by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") of Des Moines, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System (&#8220;FHLB System&#8221;). For additional information, see &#8220;How We are Regulated - Regulation and Supervision of First Financial Northwest Bank - Federal Home Loan Bank System." 

In February 2016, First Financial Northwest Bank converted its charter from a community-based savings bank to a commercial bank as a way of better serving its customer needs. The Bank's largest concentration of customers is in King County, with additional concentrations in Pierce, Snohomish, and Kitsap counties, Washington. The Bank is headquartered in Renton, Washington where it has a full-service branch, and has a smaller branch focused on efficiency through the extensive use of the latest banking technology located in Mill Creek, Washington and a third similar branch is scheduled to open in Edmonds, Washington in the first quarter of 2016. A fourth office is scheduled to open in the third quarter of 2016 in a commercial development known as the "Landing", in Renton. First Financial Northwest Bank&#8217;s business consists of attracting deposits from the public and utilizing these funds to originate one-to-four family residential, multifamily, commercial real estate, construction/land development, business and consumer loans. 

The principal executive office of First Financial Northwest Bank is located at 201 Wells Avenue South, Renton, Washington, 98057; our telephone number is (425) 255-4400.

Lending Activities 

General. We focus our lending activities primarily on loans secured by commercial real estate, construction/land development, first mortgages on one-to-four family residences, multifamily, and to lesser extent, business lending. We offer a limited variety of secured consumer loans as an accommodation to our customers, including savings account loans and home equity loans that include lines of credit and second mortgage term loans. As of December 31, 2015 , our net loan portfolio totaled $685.1 million and represented 69.9% of our total assets. 

Our current loan policy generally limits the maximum amount of loans we can make to one borrower to 15% of the Bank&#8217;s total risk-based capital, which was $18.2 million at December 31, 2015. Exceptions to this policy are allowed only with the prior approval of the Board of Directors and if the borrower exhibits financial strength or sufficient, measurable compensating factors exist after consideration of the loan-to-value ratio, borrower&#8217;s financial condition, net worth, credit history, earnings capacity, installment obligations, and current payment history. The regulatory limit of loans we can make to one borrower is 20% of total risk-based capital, or $24.2 million, at December 31, 2015. 

During 2015 , the concentration of loans to our five largest lending relationships increased. At December 31, 2015 , loans to our five largest lending relationships totaled $76.1 million compared to $74.2 million at December 31, 2014, an increase of $1.9 million, or 2.6%. Although the total of these relationships increased during 2015, their percentage of total loans, net of loans in process ("LIP") decreased to 10.9% at December 31, 2015 from 11.0% at December 31, 2014 and the total number of loans comprising these relationships decreased to 70 from 97 during 2015. The following table details the types of loans to our five largest lending relationships at December 31, 2015 .

_____________ &#160; 

(1) Excludes construction loans that will convert to permanent loans. The Company considers these loans to be &#8220;rollover loans&#8221; in that one loan is originated for both the construction loan and permanent financing. These loans are classified according to the underlying collateral. At December 31, 2015 , the Company had $21.1 million, or 14.7%, of the multifamily loan portfolio in these &#8220;rollover loans&#8221;, with no commercial real estate or one-to-four family residential loans of this type. At December 31, 2014, the Company had $6.1 million, or 2.5% of our total commercial real estate portfolio, $4.5 million, or 3.7% of our total multifamily loan portfolio, and $500,000, or 0.2% of the total one-to-four family residential loan portfolio in these "rollover loans". At December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014, $8.3 million and $3.0 million, respectively, of commercial real estate land loans were not included in the construction/land development category because the Company classifies raw land or buildable lots where it does not intend to finance the construction as commercial real estate land loans. 

The following table shows the composition of our loan portfolio by fixed- and adjustable-rate loans at the dates indicated.

One-to-Four Family Residential Lending. As of December 31, 2015 , $253.8 million, or 33.8% of our total loan portfolio consisted of loans secured by one-to-four family residences. 

First Financial Northwest Bank is a traditional portfolio lender when it comes to financing residential home loans. In 2015 , we originated $37.8 million in one-to-four family residential loans. At December 31, 2015 , $147.2 million, or 58.0% of our one-to-four family residential portfolio consisted of owner occupied loans with the remaining $106.5 million, or 42.0% consisting of non-owner occupied loans. In addition, at December 31, 2015 , $173.0 million, or 68.2% of our one-to-four family residential loan portfolio consisted of fixed-rate loans. Substantially all of our one-to-four family residential loans require monthly principal and interest payments. 

We also originate a limited number of jumbo loans that we retain in our portfolio. Mortgage loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties originated with balances greater than $517,000 in King, Pierce and Snohomish counties, $483,000 for San Juan County, and $417,000 for all other counties are considered jumbo loans. One-to-four family residential loans classified as jumbo loans totaled $68.3 million and consisted of 79 loans at December 31, 2015 . As of December 31, 2015 , all of our jumbo loans were performing in accordance with their repayment terms. There were no jumbo loans charged off in 2015. 

Our fixed-rate, one-to-four family residential loans are generally originated with 15 to 30 year terms, although such loans typically remain outstanding for substantially shorter periods, particularly in the current low interest rate environment. We also originate hybrid loans with initial fixed terms of five or seven years, that convert to loans whose interest rate adjusts annually thereafter. In addition, substantially all of our one-to-four family residential loans contain due-on-sale clauses that allow us to declare the unpaid amount due and payable upon the sale of the property securing the loan. Typically, we enforce these due-on-sale clauses to the extent permitted by law and as a standard course of business. The average period of time a loan is outstanding is a function of, among other factors, the level of purchase and sale activity in the real estate market, prevailing interest rates, and the interest rates payable on outstanding loans. 

Our lending policy generally limits the maximum loan-to-value ratio on mortgage loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties to 85% of the lesser of the appraised value or the purchase price. Properties securing our one-to-four family residential loans are appraised by independent appraisers approved by us. We require the borrowers to obtain title insurance and if necessary, flood insurance. We generally do not require earthquake insurance because of competitive market factors. 

Our residential construction loans to individuals to build their personal or non-owner occupied residences typically are structured to be converted to fixed-rate permanent loans at the end of the construction phase with one closing for both the construction loan and the permanent financing. Prior to making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the post construction value of the project by an independent appraiser. During the construction phase, which typically lasts 12 to 18 months, an approved inspector or designated Bank employee makes periodic inspections of the construction site to certify construction has reached the stated percentage of completion. Typically, disbursements are made in monthly draws and interest-only payments are required. These loans are converted to fixed-rate permanent loans at the end of the construction phase. At December 31, 2014, there was one non-owner occupied construction loan of $500,000 that converted to a permanent non-owner occupied one-to-four family loan during 2015. No new construction loans were added to our one-to-four residential loan portfolio during 2015. 

Loans secured by rental properties represent a unique credit risk to us and, as a result, we adhere to more stringent underwriting guidelines. Of primary concern in non-owner occupied real estate lending is the consistency of rental income of the property. Payments on loans secured by rental properties depend primarily on the tenants' continuing ability to pay rent to the property owner, the character of the borrower or, if the property owner is unable to find a tenant, the property owner&#8217;s ability to repay the loan without the benefit of a rental income stream. In addition, successful operation and management of non-owner occupied properties, including property maintenance standards, may affect repayment. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. We request that borrowers and loan guarantors, if any, provide annual financial statements, a budget factoring in a rental income cash flow analysis of the borrower as well as the net operating income of the property, information concerning the borrower&#8217;s expertise, credit history and profitability, and the value of the underlying property. These loans are generally secured by a first mortgage on the underlying collateral property along with an assignment of rents and leases. If the borrower has multiple rental property loans with us, the loans are typically not cross-collateralized. At December 31, 2015, $996,000 of our one-to-four family residential loans were in nonaccrual status, all of which are owner occupied properties. 

Multifamily and Commercial Real Estate Lending. As of December 31, 2015 , $143.9 million, or 19.1% of our total loan portfolio was secured by multifamily and $252.5 million, or 33.6% of our loan portfolio was secured by commercial real estate properties. Our commercial real estate loans are typically secured by office and medical buildings, retail shopping centers, mini-storage facilities, industrial use buildings and warehouses. Commercial real estate and multifamily loans are subject to similar 

underwriting standards and processes. These loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. 

Typically, multifamily and commercial real estate loans have higher balances, are more complex to evaluate and monitor, and involve a greater degree of risk than one-to-four-family residential loans. In an attempt to compensate for and mitigate this risk, these loans are generally priced at higher interest rates than one-to-four family residential loans and generally have a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price. We generally require loan guarantees by any parties with a property ownership interest of 20% or more. If the borrower is a corporation or partnership, we generally require personal guarantees from the principals based upon a review of their personal financial statements and individual credit reports. 

The average loan size in our multifamily and commercial real estate loan portfolios was $872,000 and $1.5 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2015 . At this date, $16.1 million, or 11.2%, of our multifamily loans and $47.1 million, or 18.6%, of our commercial real estate loans were from outside of our primary market area. We currently target individual multifamily and commercial real estate loans between $1.0 million and $5.0 million. New loan originations exceeding this limit must receive prior approval from the Bank's Board of Directors. The largest multifamily loan as of December 31, 2015 &#32;was a 161-unit apartment complex with a net outstanding principal balance of $7.9 million located in Franklin County, Washington. As of December 31, 2015 , the largest commercial real estate loan had a net outstanding balance of $12.7 million and was secured by a self-storage facility located in King County, Washington. Both of these loans were performing according to their respective loan repayment terms as of December 31, 2015. 

We also make construction loans for commercial development projects. The projects include multifamily, retail, office/warehouse and office buildings. These loans typically have an interest-only payment phase during construction and generally convert to permanent financing when construction is complete. Disbursement of funds is at our sole discretion and is based on the progress of construction. Generally, the maximum loan-to-value ratio applicable to these loans is 90% of the actual cost of construction or 80% of the prospective value at completion. At December 31, 2015 , $21.1 million, or 14.7% of our multifamily loans and none of our commercial real estate loan portfolio consisted of these "rollover" construction loans. 

The credit risk related to multifamily and commercial real estate loans is considered to be greater than the risk related to one-to-four family residential loans because the repayment of multifamily and commercial real estate loans typically is dependent on the income stream from the real estate securing the loan as collateral and the successful operation of the borrower&#8217;s business, that can be significantly affected by adverse conditions in the real estate markets or in the economy. For example, if the cash flow from the borrower&#8217;s project is reduced due to leases not being obtained or renewed, the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. In addition, many of our multifamily and commercial real estate loans are not fully amortizing and contain large balloon payments upon maturity. These balloon payments generally require the borrower to either refinance or occasionally sell the underlying property in order to make the balloon payment. 

If we foreclose on a multifamily or commercial real estate loan, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than for one-to-four family residential mortgage loan foreclosures because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Our multifamily and commercial real estate loans generally have relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Accordingly, if we make any errors in judgment in the collectability of our multifamily or commercial real estate loans, any resulting charge-offs may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred in our one-to-four family residential or consumer loan portfolios. At December 31, 2015 , there were no multifamily or commercial real estate loans past due 90 days or more or in nonaccrual status. There were no commercial real estate loans charged-off during the year ended December 31, 2015 , as compared to charge-offs of $311,000 and $98,000 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Multifamily loan charge-offs totaled $281,000 in 2015, compared to no charge-offs in 2014 and $346,000 of charge offs during the year ended December 31, 2013. 

Construction/Land Development Loans. We originate construction/land development loans primarily to residential builders for the construction of single-family residences, condominiums, townhouses, and residential developments located in our market area. Our land development loans are generally made to builders intending to develop lots. Construction/land development loans to builders generally require the borrower to have an existing relationship with us and a proven record of successful projects. At December 31, 2015 , our total construction/land development loans were $86.6 million, or 11.6% of our total loan portfolio. The $35.5 million or 69.5% increase in construction/land development loans over the past year reflects our strategic decision to continue our focus on increasing construction loan origination activity in 2015 as real estate values and general economic conditions in our market areas continued to improve. Current plans include continuing efforts to increase our balances of construction loans in 2016, while remaining within our guideline that total acquisition, development, and construction loans not exceed 100% of risk-based capital, or $121.2 million. At December 31, 2015 , our one-to-four family speculative residential construction loans were $52.2 million, an increase of $32.4 million or 163% during 2015 and our multifamily speculative real estate construction loans were $25.6 million at December 31, 2015 as compared to $17.9 million at December 31, 2014. There were no construction/ 

land development loans classified as nonaccrual at either December 31, 2015 &#32;or 2014. There were no construction/land development loan charge- offs during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $223,000 and $582,000 for the years ended December 31, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

Loans to finance the construction of single-family homes and subdivisions and land development loans are generally offered to builders in our primary market areas. Many of these loans are termed "speculative" because the builder does not have, at the time of loan origination, a signed contract with a buyer for the home or lot who has a commitment for permanent financing with either us or another lender. The buyer may be identified either during or after the construction period, with the risk that the builder may have to fund the debt service on the speculative loan along with real estate taxes and other carrying costs for the project for a significant period of time after completion of the project until a buyer is identified. The maximum loan-to-value ratio applicable to these loans is generally 100% of the actual cost of construction, provided that the loan-to-completed value does not exceed 80%, with approval required from the Chief Credit Officer ("CCO") for loan-to-value ratios over 80%. In addition, a minimum of 20% verified equity is generally also required. Verified equity refers to cash equity invested in the project. Development plans are required from builders prior to committing to the loan. We require that builders maintain adequate title insurance and other appropriate insurance coverage, and, if applicable, appropriate environmental data report(s) that the land is free of hazardous or toxic waste. While maturity dates for residential construction loans are largely a function of the estimated construction period of the project and typically do not exceed one year, land development loans generally are for 12 to 18 months. Substantially all of our residential construction loans have adjustable-rates of interest based on The Wall Street Journal &#32;prime rate. During the term of construction, the accumulated interest on the loan is either added to the principal of the loan through an interest reserve or billed monthly. At December 31, 2015, the LIP balance on construction/land development loans was $43.4 million, including $41.5 million set aside for interest reserves. When these loans exhaust their original reserves set up at origination, no additional reserves are permitted unless the loan is re-analyzed and it is determined that the additional reserves are appropriate, based on the updated analysis. Construction loan proceeds are disbursed periodically as construction progresses and as inspections by our approved inspectors warrant. Total outstanding net loan amounts for land development loans at December 31, 2015 ranged from $115,000 to $2.9 million with an average individual total loan balance net of LIP of $1.4 million. At December 31, 2015, our three largest construction/land development loans had outstanding principal balances, net of LIP, of $5.6 million, $3.1 million, and $2.9 million, of which none are impaired. 

Our construction/land development loans are based upon estimates of costs in relation to values associated with the completed project. Construction/land development lending involves additional risks when compared with permanent residential 

lending because funds are advanced upon the collateral for the project based on an estimate of costs that will produce a future value at completion. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the completed project loan-to-value ratio. Changes in the demand, such as for new housing and higher than anticipated building costs may cause actual results to vary significantly from those estimated. For these reasons, this type of lending also typically involves higher loan principal amounts and is often concentrated with a small number of builders. These loans often involve the disbursement of funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or obtain permanent take-out financing, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If our appraisal of the value of a completed project proves to be overstated, we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project and may incur a loss. Because construction loans require active monitoring of the building process, including cost comparisons and on-site inspections, these loans are more difficult and costly to monitor. Increases in market rates of interest may have a more pronounced effect on construction loans by rapidly increasing the end-purchasers' borrowing costs, thereby reducing the overall demand for the project. Properties under construction are often difficult to sell and typically must be completed in order to be successfully sold which also complicates the process of working out problem construction loans. This may require us to advance additional funds and/or contract with another builder to complete construction. Furthermore, in the case of speculative construction loans, there is the added risk associated with identifying an end-purchaser for the finished project. 

Business Lending. Business loans totaled $7.6 million, or 1.0% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2015 . Business loans are generally secured by business equipment, accounts receivable, inventory or other property. Loan terms typically vary from one to five years. The interest rates on such loans are either fixed-rate or adjustable-rate. The interest rates for the adjustable-rate loans are indexed to the prime rate published in The Wall Street Journal &#32;plus a margin. Our business lending policy includes credit file documentation and requires analysis of the borrower&#8217;s background, capacity to repay the loan, the adequacy of the borrower&#8217;s capital and collateral, as well as an evaluation of other conditions affecting the borrower. Analysis of the borrower&#8217;s past, present and future cash flows is also an important aspect of our credit analysis. We generally obtain personal guarantees on our business loans. The largest business loan had an outstanding balance of $7.2 million at December 31, 2015 &#32;and was performing according to its repayment terms. At December 31, 2015 , we did not have any business loans delinquent in excess of 90 days or in nonaccrual status. 

Repayments of business loans are often dependent on the cash flows of the borrower, which may be unpredictable, and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Our business loans are originated primarily based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee, if any. As a result, in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. The collateral securing business loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise, or may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. 

Consumer Lending. We offer a limited variety of consumer loans to our customers, consisting primarily of home equity loans and savings account loans. Generally, consumer loans have shorter terms to maturity and higher interest rates than one-to-four family residential loans. Consumer loans are offered with both fixed and adjustable interest rates and with varying terms. At December 31, 2015 , consumer loans were $7.0 million, or 0.9% of the total loan portfolio. 

At December 31, 2015 , the largest component of the consumer loan portfolio consisted of home equity loans, primarily home equity lines of credit that totaled $5.1 million, or 73% of the total consumer loan portfolio. The home equity lines of credit include $3.4 million of equity lines of credit in first lien position and $1.8 million of second liens on residential properties. At December 31, 2015, unfunded commitments on our home equity lines of credit totaled $12.5 million. Home equity loans are made for purposes such as the improvement of residential properties, debt consolidation and education expenses. At origination, the loan-to-value ratio is generally 90% or less, when taking into account both the balance of the home equity loans and the first mortgage loan. Home equity loans are originated on a fixed-rate or adjustable-rate basis. The interest rate for the adjustable-rate second lien loans is indexed to the prime rate published in The Wall Street Journal &#32;and may include a margin. Home equity loans generally have a ten year term with a balloon payment due at maturity. 

Consumer loans entail greater risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciating assets. In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation. The remaining deficiency often does not warrant further collection efforts against the borrower beyond obtaining a deficiency judgment. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower&#8217;s continuing financial stability, and are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, 

the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans. Home equity lines of credit have greater credit risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans because they are generally secured by mortgages subordinated to the existing first mortgage on the property that we may or may not hold in our portfolio. We do not have private mortgage insurance coverage on these loans. Adjustable-rate loans may experience a higher rate of default in a rising interest rate environment due to the increase in payment amounts when interest rates reset higher. If current economic conditions deteriorate for our borrowers and their home prices continue to fall, we may also experience higher credit losses from this loan portfolio. Since our home equity loans primarily consist of second lien loans, it is unlikely that we will be successful in recovering our entire loan principal outstanding in the event of a default. At December 31, 2015 , consumer loans totaling $97,000 were delinquent in excess of 60 days and $89,000 of these loans were in nonaccrual status. Consumer loan charge-offs totaled $54,000 during the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;compared with charge-offs of $30,000 and $101,000 during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.

Loan Solicitation and Processing. The majority of our consumer and residential mortgage loan originations are generated through the Bank and from time to time through outside brokers and correspondent relationships we have established with select mortgage companies. We originate multifamily, commercial real estate and construction/land development loans primarily using the Bank&#8217;s loan officers, with referrals coming from builders, brokers and existing customers. 

Upon receipt of a loan application from a prospective borrower, we obtain a credit report and other data to verify specific information relating to the loan applicant&#8217;s employment, income, and credit standing. All real estate loans requiring an appraisal are done by an independent third-party appraiser. All appraisers are approved by us, and their credentials are reviewed annually, as is the quality of their appraisals. 

We use a multi-level approval matrix which establishes lending targets and tolerance levels depending on the loan type being approved. The matrix also sets minimum credit standards for each of the loan types as well as approval limits. 

Lending Authority. The Directors&#8217; Loan Committee consists of at least three members of the Board of Directors. The Directors&#8217; Loan Committee has the authority to approve: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Aggregate borrower relationship in excess of $15.0 million, up to 15% of total risk-based capital; and 

&#8226; 

Each loan request in excess of the loan approval authorities assigned to the Chief Lending Officer ("CLO"), Senior Credit Approval Officer ("SCAO"), and CCO. 

Officer Lending Authority . Individual signing authority has been delegated to three lending or executive officers. Our CLO has authority from the Board of Directors to approve loan requests for both individual loans and aggregate relationships up to and including $1.0 million. Our SCAO has authority from the Board of Directors to approve loans and aggregate relationships up to and including $2.5 million. The Board of Directors has given our CCO authority to approve individual loans up to and including $5.0 million and aggregate relationships up to and including $15.0 million. 

Loan Originations, Servicing, Purchases, Sales and Repayments. For the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014, our total loan originations were $229.8 million and $154.5 million, respectively. 

One-to-four family residential loans are generally originated in accordance with the guidelines established by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, with the exception of our special community development loans originated to satisfy compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. Our loans are underwritten by designated real estate loan underwriters internally in accordance with standards as provided by our Board-approved loan policy. We require title insurance on all loans and fire and casualty insurance on all secured loans and home equity loans where real estate serves as collateral. Flood insurance is also required on all secured loans when the real estate is located in a flood zone. 

The following table shows total loans originated, purchased, repaid and other changes during the periods indicated.

Loan Origination and Other Fees. In some instances, we receive loan origination fees on real estate-related products. Loan fees generally represent a percentage of the principal amount of the loan and are paid by the borrower. The amount of fees charged to the borrower on one-to-four family residential loans and multifamily and commercial real estate loans can range from 0% to 2%. United States generally accepted accounting principles require that certain fees received, net of certain origination costs, be deferred and amortized over the contractual life of the loan. Net deferred fees or costs associated with loans that are prepaid or sold are recognized in income at the time of prepayment or sale. We had $2.9 million and $2.6 million of net deferred loan fees at December 31, 2015 , and 2014, respectively. 

One-to-four family residential and consumer loans are generally originated without a prepayment penalty. The majority of our multifamily and commercial real estate loans, however, have prepayment penalties associated with the loans. Most of the multifamily and commercial real estate loan originations with interest rates fixed for the first five years will adjust thereafter and have a prepayment penalty of 2 - 3% of the principal balance in year one, with decreasing penalties in subsequent years. Longer initial fixed rate terms generally have correspondingly longer prepayment penalty periods. 

Asset Quality 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had $1.3 million of loans past due 30 days or more. These loans represented 0.2% of total loans, net of LIP, and consisted of nine one-to-four family residential loans (all owner-occupied) and three consumer loans. We generally assess late fees or penalty charges on delinquent loans of up to 5.0% of the monthly payment. The borrower is given up to a 15 day grace period from the due date to make the loan payment. 

We handle collection procedures internally or with the assistance of outside legal counsel. Late charges are incurred when the loan exceeds 10 to 15 days past due depending upon the loan product. When a delinquent loan is identified, corrective action takes place immediately. The first course of action is to determine the cause of the delinquency and seek cooperation from the borrower in resolving the issue. Additional corrective action, if required, will vary depending on the borrower, the collateral, if any, and whether the loan requires specific handling procedures as required by the Washington State Deed of Trust Act. 

If the borrower is chronically delinquent and all reasonable means of obtaining payments have been exhausted, we will seek to foreclose on the collateral securing the loan according to the terms of the security instrument and applicable law. The following table shows our delinquent loans by the type of loan, net of LIP, and the number of days delinquent at December 31, 2015 :

(1) &#32;&#32;&#32;These loans are also included in the appropriate loan category above under the caption: &#8220;Loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis.&#8221; 

When a loan becomes 90 days past due, we generally place the loan on nonaccrual status unless the credit is well secured and in the process of collection. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual status prior to being 90 days past due if there is an identified problem such as an impending foreclosure or bankruptcy or if the borrower is unable to meet their scheduled payment obligations. 

&#160; 

Our three largest nonperforming loans at December 31, 2015 &#32;were as follows: 

&#8226; 

A one-to-four family residential loan with an outstanding balance of $336,000 secured by an owner-occupied single family residence in Snohomish County. The purpose of this loan was to refinance an existing lien with improved terms. 

&#8226; 

A one-to-four family residential loan with an outstanding balance of $170,000 secured by an owner-occupied single family residence in King County. The purpose of this loan was to refinance an existing lien with improved terms. 

&#8226; 

A one-to-four family residential loan with an outstanding balance of $166,000 secured by an owner-occupied single family residence in King County. The purpose of the construction-permanent loan was a new primary residence. 

We have reduced our nonperforming loans at December 31, 2015, by $254,000, or 19.0% as compared to December 31, 2014. This reduction was accomplished by transferring one nonperforming loan to OREO, accepting short sales, and charging off uncollectible portions of loans. Because of our structure, we believe we are able to make decisions regarding offers on OREO and the real estate underlying our nonperforming loans very quickly compared to larger institutions where decisions could take six to twelve months. This distinction has worked to our benefit in reducing our nonperforming loans and disposing of OREO. 

The following tables summarize our total nonperforming loans, net of LIP and OREO, at December 31, 2015 , by county and by type of loan or property:

_______ 

(1) &#32;&#32; Of the six properties classified as commercial real estate, three are office/retail buildings and three are undeveloped lots. 

Construction/land development, commercial real estate, and multifamily loans have larger individual loan amounts that have a greater single impact on asset quality in the event of delinquency or default. We continue to monitor our loan portfolio and believe additions to nonperforming loans, charge-offs, provisions for loan losses, and/or OREO are possible in the future, particularly if the housing market and other economic conditions do not continue to improve. 

&#160; 

Other Real Estate Owned. Real estate acquired by us as a result of foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is classified as OREO until it is sold. When the property is acquired, it is recorded at the lower of its cost or the fair market value of the property, less selling costs. We had $3.7 million and $9.3 million of OREO at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014, respectively. At December 31, 2015 , OREO consisted of $3.5 million in commercial real estate properties and $173,000 in construction/land development properties. Our special assets department's primary focus is the prompt and effective management of our troubled, nonperforming assets, and expediting their disposition to minimize any potential losses. During 2015 , we foreclosed or accepted deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure on one property totaling $141,000 as compared to six properties totaling $1.8 million during 2014. 

We anticipate continued foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, and short sale activity while we work with our nonperforming loan customers to minimize our loss exposure. 

&#160; 

Troubled Debt Restructured Loans. We account for certain loan modifications or restructurings as TDRs. In general, the modification or restructuring of a debt is considered a TDR if, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, we grant a concession to the borrower that we would not otherwise consider. These loans are all considered to be impaired loans. At December 31, 2015 , we had $42.3 million in TDRs as compared to $54.2 million at December 31, 2014. 

&#160; 

Prior to 2012, we utilized a strategy for a limited number of our lending relationships of establishing an &#8220;A&#8221; and &#8220;B&#8221; note structure. We created an &#8220;A&#8221; note representing a reduced principal balance expected to be fully collected and at a debt service level and loan-to-value ratio acceptable to us. The &#8220;A&#8221; note was classified as a performing TDR as long as the borrower continued to perform in accordance with the note terms. The &#8220;B&#8221; note represented the amount of the principal reduction portion of the original note and was immediately charged-off. The &#8220;B&#8221; note is held by the Bank and when the &#8220;A&#8221; note is paid off, the Bank may proceed with collection efforts on the &#8220;B&#8221; note. At December 31, 2015 , 99.7% of our TDRs were classified as performing compared to 100.0% at December 31, 2014. Of the $42.1 million of performing TDRs at December 31, 2015 , $20.4 million were related to an &#8220;A&#8221; note as a result of an &#8220;A&#8221; and &#8220;B&#8221; note workout strategy. 

The largest TDR relationship at December 31, 2015 totaled $11.6 million and was comprised of $10.9 million in one-to-four family residential loans secured by rental properties and a $769,000 owner occupied commercial property, all located in King County. At December 31, 2015 , there was no LIP in connection with our TDRs. For additional information regarding our TDRs, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report on Form 10-K.

Classified Assets. Federal regulations provide for the classification of lower quality loans and other assets as substandard, doubtful or loss. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and payment capacity of the borrower or of any collateral pledged. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. 

When we classify problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, we may establish a specific allowance in an amount we deem prudent. General allowances represent loss allowances that have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but unlike specific allowances, have not been specifically allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as a loss, it is required to charge-off those assets in the period in which they are deemed uncollectible. Our determinations as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation allowances are subject to review by the FDIC and the DFI that can order the establishment of additional loss allowances or the charge-off of specific loans against established loss reserves. Assets that do not currently expose us to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the 

aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as special mention. At December 31, 2015, special mention loans totaled $7.8 million. 

&#160; 

In connection with the filing of periodic reports with the FDIC and in accordance with our loan policy, we regularly review the problem loans in our portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. The decrease in our classified loans during the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;was a result of loan charge-offs, loans transferred to OREO, and short sales, as well as our efforts to work with our borrowers to bring their loans current when possible or restructure the loan when appropriate. During 2015 , we continued our aggressive approach to reduce nonperforming assets and improve asset quality. 

Classified loans, net of LIP, consisting solely of substandard loans, were as follows at the dates indicated:

&#160; 

With the exception of these classified loans, of which $1.1 million were accounted for as nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2015 , management is not aware of any loans as of December 31, 2015 , where the known credit problems of the borrower would cause us to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with their present loan repayment terms and which may result in the future inclusion of such loans in the nonperforming loan categories. 

&#160; 

Allowance for Loan Losses. Management recognizes that loan losses may occur over the life of a loan and that the ALLL must be maintained at a level necessary to absorb specific losses on impaired loans and probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Our methodology for analyzing the ALLL consists of two components: general and specific allowances. The general allowance is determined by applying factors to our various groups of loans. Management considers factors such as charge-off history, the prevailing economy, the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay, the regulatory environment, competition, geographic and loan type concentrations, policy and underwriting standards, nature and volume of the loan portfolio, managements&#8217; experience level, our loan review and grading systems, the value of underlying collateral, and the level of problem loans in assessing the ALLL. The specific allowance component is created when management believes that the collectability of a specific loan has been impaired and a loss is probable. The specific reserves are computed using current appraisals, listed sales prices and other available information, less costs to complete, if any, and costs to sell the property. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events differ from predictions. In addition, specific reserves may be created upon a loan's restructuring, based on a discounted cash flow analysis comparing the present value of the anticipated repayments under the restructured terms to the outstanding principal balance of the loan. 

&#160; 

Quarterly, our Board of Directors' Internal Asset Review Committee reviews and recommends approval of the allowance for loan losses and any provision or recapture of provision for loan losses, and the full Board of Directors approves the provision or recapture after considering the Committee's recommendation. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses which is charged against current period earnings. If the analysis of our loan portfolio indicates the risk of loss is less than the balance of the ALLL, a recapture of provision of loan loss is added to current period earnings. 

As a result of payoffs of larger loans and improvement in credit quality of our loan portfolio, we recorded a $2.2 million recapture of provision from our ALLL for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to recaptures of $2.1 million and $100,000 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The improvement in the quality of loans was reflected in reductions in the levels of nonperforming loans, classified assets, and charge-offs, as well as our efforts working with our borrowers when possible to bring their loan payments current. When this option was not feasible, we promptly initiated foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure proceedings. We also utilized short sales as an option to liquidate properties prior to foreclosure. The continued focus that we placed on reducing our nonperforming loans during 2015 &#32;resulted in a reduction of $254,000 in nonperforming loans. The ALLL was $9.5 million, or 1.4% of total loans net of LIP at December 31, 2015 &#32;as compared to $10.5 million, or 1.6% at December 31, 2014. The level of the ALLL is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from the estimates. Management reviews the adequacy of the ALLL on a quarterly basis. 

&#160; 

A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due, according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, market conditions, rent rolls, and the borrower's and guarantor's, if any, financial strength. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower&#8217;s prior payment record and the amounts of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Loans are evaluated for impairment on a loan-by-loan basis. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014, impaired loans were $43.3 million and $55.7 million, respectively. At December 31, 2015, there was no LIP in connection with our impaired loans. 

The following table summarizes the distribution of the ALLL by loan category, at the dates indicated.

We believe that the ALLL as of December 31, 2015 &#32;was adequate to absorb the probable and inherent losses in the loan portfolio at that date. While we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the ALLL are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will be proven correct in the future, or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions, or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Future additions to the ALLL may become necessary based upon changing economic conditions, the level of problem loans, business conditions, credit concentrations, increased loan balances or changes in the underlying collateral of the loan portfolio. In addition, the determination of the amount of the ALLL is subject to review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process that may result in the establishment of additional loss reserves or the charge-off of specific loans against established loss reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination. 

The following table sets forth an analysis of our ALLL at the dates and for the periods indicated.

Investment Activities 

General. Under Washington State law, savings banks are permitted to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies, certain certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions, banker&#8217;s acceptances, repurchase agreements, federal funds, commercial paper, investment grade corporate debt securities, and obligations of states and their political sub-divisions. 

The Investment, Asset/Liability Committee ("ALCO"), consisting of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Controller of First Financial Northwest Bank, other members of management and the Board of Directors, has the authority and responsibility to administer our investment policy, monitor portfolio strategies, and recommend appropriate changes to policy and strategies to the Board of Directors. On a monthly basis, management reports to the Board a summary of investment holdings with respective market values and all purchases and sales of investment securities. The Chief Financial Officer has the primary responsibility for the management of the investment portfolio and considers various factors when making decisions, including the marketability, maturity, liquidity, and tax consequences of proposed investments. The maturity structure of investments will be affected by various market conditions, including the current and anticipated slope of the yield curve, the level of interest rates, the trend of new deposit inflows, and the anticipated demand for funds via deposit withdrawals and loan originations and purchases. 

The general objectives of the investment portfolio are to provide liquidity when loan demand is high, to assist in maintaining earnings when loan demand is low, and to maximize earnings while satisfactorily managing risk, including credit risk, reinvestment risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk. 

At December 31, 2015 , our investment portfolio consisted principally of mortgage-backed securities, municipal bonds, U.S. government agency obligations, and corporate bonds. From time to time, investment levels may increase or decrease depending upon yields available on investment opportunities and management&#8217;s projected demand for funds for loan originations, net deposit flows, and other activities. At December 31, 2015, we did not hold securities of any single issuer (other than government-sponsored entities) that exceeded 10% of our shareholders' equity. 

Mortgage-Backed Securities . The mortgage-backed securities in our portfolio were comprised of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities. These issuers guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest in the event of default. The mortgage-backed securities had a weighted-average yield of 2.09% at December 31, 2015 . 

U.S. Government Agency Obligations . The agency securities in our portfolio were comprised of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and FHLB agency securities. These issuers guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest in the event of default. At December 31, 2015 , the portfolio of government agency securities had a weighted-average yield of 1.54%. 

Ginnie Mae is part of a U.S. government agency and its guarantees are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks are U.S. government-sponsored entities. Although their guarantees are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, they may borrow from the U.S. Treasury, which has taken other steps to ensure these U.S. Government-sponsored entities can fulfill their financial obligations. 

Corporate Bonds. &#32;The corporate bond portfolio was primarily comprised of variable rate securities issued by various financial institutions. At December 31, 2015, the corporate bond portfolio had a weighted-average yield of 2.53%. 

Municipal Bonds . The municipal bond portfolio at December 31, 2015 was comprised of both taxable and tax-exempt municipal bonds. The weighted-average yield on the municipal bond portfolio was 2.90% at December 31, 2015 . 

Federal Home Loan Bank Stock. As a member of the FHLB Des Moines, we are required to own capital stock. The required amount of capital stock is based on a percentage of our previous year-end assets and our outstanding FHLB advances. The redemption of any excess stock we hold is at the discretion of the FHLB Des Moines. The carrying value of the stock totaled $6.1 million at December 31, 2015 . During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we received FHLB cash dividends of $69,000 and $7,000, respectively. During 2015, FHLB stock was repurchased from us as a result of the merger of FHLB Seattle and FHLB Des Moines and also as a result of our payoff of an FHLB advance. During 2015 and 2014, 6,074 shares and 2,729 shares, respectively of FHLB stock were repurchased from us by the FHLB Des Moines at par value.

At December 31, 2015 , 2014, and 2013 there were no investments held to maturity. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015 , gross proceeds from the call and sale of investments was $27.3 million, with net realized gains of $92,000. 

Management reviews investment securities on an ongoing basis for the presence of other than temporary impairment ("OTTI") or permanent impairment, taking into consideration current market conditions, fair value in relationship to cost, extent and nature of the change in fair value, issuer rating changes and trends, whether management intends to sell a security or if it is likely that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis of the investment, which may be maturity, and other factors. For debt securities, if management intends to sell the security or it is likely that we will be required to sell the security before recovering its cost basis, the entire impairment loss would be recognized in earnings as an OTTI. If management does not intend to sell the security and it is not likely that we will be required to sell the security, but management does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security, only the portion of the impairment loss representing credit losses would be recognized in earnings. The credit loss on a security is measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected. Projected cash flows are discounted by the original or current effective interest rate, depending on the nature of the security being measured for potential OTTI. The remaining impairment related to all other factors, the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and fair value, is recognized as a charge to other comprehensive income (loss). Impairment losses related to all other factors are presented as separate categories within other comprehensive income (loss). There were no losses related to OTTI at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014. For additional information regarding our investments, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8. 

The table below sets forth information regarding the carrying value and weighted-average yield by contractual maturity of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2015 . Mortgage-backed securities have no stated maturity date and are included in the totals column only.

Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds 

General . Deposits and loan repayments are the major sources of our funds for lending and other investment purposes. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are influenced significantly by general interest rates and market conditions. Borrowings from the FHLB are used to supplement the availability of funds from other sources and also as a source of term funds to assist in the management of interest rate risk. 

Our deposit composition reflects a mixture of various deposit products. We rely on marketing activities, customer service, and the availability of a broad range of products and services to attract and retain customer deposits. 

Deposits. We offer a competitive range of deposit products within our market area, including noninterest bearing accounts, NOW accounts, money market deposit accounts, statement savings accounts, and certificates of deposit. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the development of long-term profitable customer relationships, current market interest rates, current maturity structures, deposit mix, our customer preferences, and the profitability of acquiring customer deposits compared to alternative funding sources. As part of our strategy to shift our deposit mix to lower cost funds, we continued to better align our pricing with competitors in our local market to meet our goals. To supplement local deposits, funds are also generated through national brokered certificates of deposit. Brokered certificates of deposit were added in 2014 as a source of funds for the $70.0 million dividend paid from the Bank to the Holding Company and as part of our asset/liability objectives. At December 31, 2015, $66.2 million, or 9.8% of total deposits were brokered certificates of deposit, with remaining maturities ranging from 2.5 to five years. These funds cannot be withdrawn early except in the case of the death or adjudication of incompetence of the depositor. However, the Bank has a quarterly call option six months after issuance that allows the Bank to close the certificate of deposit and return the deposit to the customer if the Bank determines it is in its best interest to do so. The longer term nature of these brokered deposits, along with the enhanced features of these deposits as compared to retail certificates of deposit, assists us in our interest rate risk management efforts. 

The following table sets forth our total deposit activity for the periods indicated.

At December 31, 2015, deposits totaled $675.4 million. We had $225.4 million of jumbo (greater than $100,000) certificates of deposit, which were 33.4% of total deposits at December 31, 2015. At that date, included in the jumbo certificates of deposit, were public funds totaling $16.0 million, or 2.4% of total deposits. Under Washington State law, in order to participate in the public funds program, we are required to pledge 100% of the public deposits held in the form of eligible securities.

Risk Factors contained in this report. 

Borrowings. Customer deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities. We use advances from the FHLB to supplement our supply of lendable funds, to meet short-term deposit withdrawal requirements and to provide longer term funding to better match the duration of selected loan and investment maturities. In addition, at December 31, 2015 we had available a total of $35.0 million lines of credit between two other financial institutions as supplemental funding sources. 

As a member of the FHLB, we are required to own capital stock in the FHLB and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of that stock and certain of our mortgage loans provided certain creditworthiness standards have been met. Advances are individually made under various terms pursuant to several different credit programs, each with its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based on the financial condition of the member institution and the adequacy of collateral pledged to secure the credit. We maintain a credit facility with the FHLB that provides for immediately available advances, subject to acceptable collateral. At December 31, 2015, our remaining FHLB credit capacity was $217.0 million and outstanding advances from the FHLB totaled $125.5 million. 

The following table sets forth information regarding FHLB advances at the end of and during the periods indicated. The table includes both long- and short-term borrowings.

Subsidiaries and Other Activities 

First Financial Northwest, Inc. &#32;First Financial Northwest has two wholly-owned subsidiaries, First Financial Northwest Bank and First Financial Diversified Corporation. First Financial Diversified Corporation currently holds a loan portfolio of one-to-four family residential, commercial real estate, business, and consumer loans. At December 31, 2015, First Financial Diversified's net loans receivable of $3.8 million represented less than one percent of the Company's loan portfolio. 

First Financial Northwest Bank. First Financial Northwest Bank is a community-based commercial bank. The Bank primarily serves the greater Puget Sound region of King and to a lesser extent, Pierce, Snohomish and Kitsap Counties, Washington through our full-service banking office located in Renton, Washington and branch office in Mill Creek, Washington. We are in the business of attracting deposits from the public and utilizing those deposits to originate loans. 

Competition 

We face competition in originating loans and attracting deposits within our primary geographic market area. We compete by consistently delivering high-quality, personal service to our customers that results in a high level of customer satisfaction. 

Based on the most current FDIC Deposit Market Share Report dated June 30, 2015, we ranked 16th in terms of deposits with a deposit market share of 0.97%, among the 47 FDIC-insured depository institutions located in King County. The top five banks in the market (comprised of Bank of America, Wells Fargo Bank, U.S. Bank, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Key Bank) controlled 75.5% of the King County deposit market with deposits of $53.5 billion out of the $70.9 billion total deposits in King County as of June 30, 2015. Aside from these traditional competitors, credit unions, insurance companies and brokerage firms also compete for consumer deposit relationships. 

Our competition for loans comes principally from commercial banks, mortgage brokers, thrift institutions, credit unions, and finance companies. Several other financial institutions, including those previously mentioned, compete with us for banking business in our targeted market area. These institutions have far more resources than we do and, as a result, are able to offer a broader range of services, such as trust departments and enhanced retail services. Among the advantages of some of these institutions are their ability to make larger loans, finance extensive advertising campaigns, access lower cost funding sources, and allocate their investable assets in regions of highest yield and demand. The challenges posed by such large competitors may impact our ability to originate loans, secure low cost deposits, and establish product pricing levels that support our net interest margin goals that may limit our future growth and earnings potential. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015, we had 107 full-time employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. We consider our employee relations to be good. 

How We Are Regulated 

The following is a brief description of certain laws and regulations that are applicable to First Financial Northwest and First Financial Northwest Bank. On March 31, 2015, First Financial Northwest rescinded the 10(1) election made by First Financial Northwest Bank and converted from a registered savings and loan holding company to a bank holding company. As a bank holding company, First Financial Northwest is subject to examination and supervision by, and is required to file certain reports with, the FRB. First Financial Northwest also is subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC under the federal securities laws. First 

Financial Northwest Bank, which changed its charter from a Washington-chartered savings bank to a Washington-chartered commercial bank effective on February 11, 2016, is subject to regulation and oversight by the DFI, the applicable provisions of Washington law and by the regulations of the DFI adopted thereunder. First Financial Northwest Bank also is subject to regulation and examination by the FDIC, which insures its deposits to the maximum extent permitted by law. 

The laws and regulations affecting depository institutions and their holding companies have changed significantly, particularly in connection with the enactment of The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ("Dodd-Frank Act"). Among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB") as an independent bureau of the FRB. The CFPB assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations and has authority to impose new requirements. In addition, the regulations governing us may be amended from time to time by the respective regulators. Any such legislation or regulatory changes in the future could adversely affect us. We cannot predict whether any such changes may occur. 

Regulation and Supervision of First Financial Northwest Bank 

General. As a state-chartered commercial bank, First Financial Northwest Bank is subject to applicable provisions of Washington state law and regulations of the DFI. State law and regulations govern First Financial Northwest Bank&#8217;s ability to take deposits and pay interest, to make loans on or invest in residential and other real estate, to make consumer loans, to invest in securities, to offer various banking services to its customers and to establish branch offices. Under state law, commercial banks in Washington also generally have all of the powers that federal commercial banks have under federal laws and regulations. First Financial Northwest Bank is subject to periodic examination and reporting requirements by and of the DFI. 

Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC. &#32;First Financial Northwest Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured up to $250,000 per separately insured depositor by the DIF of the FDIC. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, FDIC-insured institutions. The FDIC also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the deposit insurance fund. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against commercial institutions and may terminate the deposit insurance if it determines that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition. 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC's deposit insurance assessments to be based on assets instead of deposits. The FDIC has issued rules which specify that the assessment base for a bank is equal to its total average consolidated assets less average tangible equity capital. The FDIC revised assessment rates range from approximately five basis points to 35 basis points, depending on applicable adjustments for unsecured debt issued by an institution and brokered deposits (and to further adjustment for institutions that hold unsecured debt of other FDIC-insured institutions), until such time as the FDIC's reserve ratio equals 1.15%. Once the FDIC's reserve ratio reaches 1.15% and the reserve ratio for the immediately prior assessment period is less than 2.0%, the applicable assessment rates may range from three basis points to 30 basis points (subject to adjustments as described above). If the reserve ratio for the prior assessment period is equal to or greater than 2.0% and less than 2.5%, the assessment rates may range from two basis points to 28 basis points and if the reserve ratio for the prior assessment period is greater than 2.5%, the assessment rates may range from one basis point to 25 basis points (in each case subject to adjustments as described above). No institution may pay a dividend if it is in default on its federal deposit insurance assessment. 

In addition, federally insured institutions are required to pay a Financing Corporation (&#8220;FICO&#8221;) assessment in order to fund the interest on bonds issued to resolve thrift failures in the 1980s. At December 31, 2015, the FICO assessment equaled 0.58 basis points of the assessment base, computed on assets. These assessments will continue until the bonds mature in the years 2017 through 2019. For 2015, the Bank incurred approximately $48,000 in FICO assessments. 

The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including First Financial Northwest Bank, if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible capital. If insurance of accounts is terminated, the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC. We are not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of First Financial Northwest Bank&#8217;s deposit insurance. 

A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. There can be no prediction as to what changes in insurance assessment rates may be made in the future. 

Standards for Safety and Soundness. The federal banking regulatory agencies have prescribed, by regulation, guidelines for all insured depository institutions relating to: internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Each insured depository institution must implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the institution&#8217;s size and complexity and the nature and scope of its activities. The information security program also must be designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any unanticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information, protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer and ensure the proper disposal of customer and consumer information. Each insured depository institution must also develop and implement a risk-based response program to address incidents of unauthorized access to customer information in customer information systems. If the FDIC determines that an institution fails to meet any of these guidelines, it may require an institution to submit to the FDIC an acceptable plan to achieve compliance. We are not aware of any conditions relating to these safety and soundness standards that would require submission of a plan of compliance by First Financial Northwest Bank. 

Capital Requirements. Federally insured financial institutions, such as First Financial Northwest Bank, are required to maintain a minimum level of regulatory capital. 

Effective January 1, 2015 (with some changes transitioned into full effectiveness over two to four years), First Financial Northwest Bank became subject to new capital regulations adopted by the FRB and the FDIC, which create a new required ratio for common equity Tier 1 (&#8220;CET1&#8221;) capital, increase the minimum leverage and Tier 1 capital ratios, change the risk-weightings of certain assets for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios, create an additional capital conservation buffer over the required capital ratios, and change what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting the capital requirements. These regulations implement the regulatory capital reforms required by the Dodd Frank Act and the &#8220;Basel III&#8221; requirements. 

Under the new capital regulations, the minimum capital ratios are: (1) a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets; (3) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets; and (4) a leverage ratio (the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total adjusted assets) of 4.0%. CET1 generally consists of common stock; retained earnings; accumulated other comprehensive income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;) unless an institution elects to exclude AOCI from regulatory capital; and certain minority interests; all subject to applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions. Tier 1 capital generally consists of CET1 and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital generally consists of other preferred stock and subordinated debt meeting certain conditions plus an amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses up to 1.25% of assets. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. 

There are a number of changes in what constitutes regulatory capital compared to the rules in effect prior to January 1, 2015, some of which are subject to transition periods. These changes include the phasing-out of certain instruments as qualifying capital and eliminate or significantly reduce the use of hybrid capital instruments, especially trust preferred securities, as regulatory capital. Mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets over designated percentages of CET1 will be deducted from capital. In addition, Tier 1 capital includes AOCI, which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities . However, because of our asset size, we are eligible for the one-time option of permanently opting out of the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities in our capital calculations. We elected this option in the first quarter of 2015. 

For purposes of determining risk-based capital, assets and certain off-balance sheet items are risk-weighted from 0% to 1,250%, depending on the risk characteristics of the asset or item. The new regulations make certain changes in the risk-weighting of assets to better reflect credit risk and other risk exposure compared to the earlier capital rules. These include a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and for non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise in nonaccrual status; a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable (currently set at 0%); and a 250% risk weight (up from 100%) for mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital. 

In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1, leverage ratio and total capital ratios, First Financial Northwest Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, repurchasing shares, and paying discretionary bonuses. The new capital conservation buffer requirement is to be phased in beginning on January 1, 2016 when a buffer greater than 0.625% of risk-weighted assets will be required, which amount will increase each year until the buffer requirement is fully implemented on January 1, 2019. 

&#160; 

To be consider &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; a depository institution must have a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a CET1 capital ratio of at least 5% and a leverage ratio of at least 5% and not be subject to an individualized order, directive or agreement under which its primary federal banking regulator requires it to maintain a specific capital level. As of December 31, 2015, First Financial Northwest Bank met the requirements to be "well capitalized" and met the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer requirement. 

The table below sets forth First Financial Northwest Bank&#8217;s capital position at December 31, 2015 and 2014, based on FDIC thresholds to be well-capitalized.

The FDIC also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon a determination that an institution's capital level is or may become inadequate in light of particular risks or circumstances. Management of First Financial Northwest Bank believes that, under the current regulations, First Financial Northwest Bank will continue to meet its minimum capital requirements in the foreseeable future. 

For a complete description of First Financial Northwest Bank&#8217;s required and actual capital levels on December 31, 2015, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report on Form 10-K. 

Prompt Corrective Action. Federal statutes establish a supervisory framework for FDIC-insured institutions based on five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. An institution's category depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to relevant capital measures. The well-capitalized category is described above. An institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits, including restrictions on the rates it can offer on its deposits, generally. To be considered adequately capitalized, an institution must have the minimum capital ratios described above. Any institution which is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered undercapitalized. 

Undercapitalized institutions are subject to certain prompt corrective action requirements, regulatory controls and restrictions which become more extensive as an institution becomes more severely undercapitalized. Failure by First Financial Northwest Bank to comply with applicable capital requirements would, if unremedied, result in progressively more severe restrictions on its activities and lead to enforcement actions, including, but not limited to, the issuance of a capital directive to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels and, ultimately, the appointment of the FDIC as receiver or conservator. Banking 

regulators will take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. Additionally, approval of any regulatory application filed for their review may be dependent on compliance with capital requirements. 

At December 31, 2015, First Financial Northwest Bank was categorized as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under the prompt corrective action regulations of the FDIC. For additional information, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this report on Form 10-K. 

Federal Home Loan Bank System. &#32;First Financial Northwest Bank became a member of the FHLB of Des Moines in connection with the merger of the FHLB of Seattle and the FHLB of Des Moines in May 2015. The FHLB Des Moines is one of 11 regional FHLBs that administer the home financing credit function of savings institutions. The FHLBs are subject to the oversight of the FHFA and each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. The FHLBs are funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System and makes loans or advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB, which are subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Board. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB. In addition, all long-term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing. See &#8220;Business &#8211; Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds &#8211; Borrowings.&#8221; 

Upon completion of the merger between the FHLB of Seattle and the FHLB of Des Moines, First Financial Northwest Bank received stock in the FHLB of Des Moines equal to the same number of shares held in the FHLB of Seattle prior to the merger. Subsequently, the FHLB of Des Moines repurchased excess stock to bring First Financial Northwest Bank's stock ownership in compliance with the required holding levels, which fluctuates based in part on the level of outstanding FHLB advances. As a result of the Bank's subsequent payoff of an advance, additional shares of FHLB stock were repurchased to maintain our stock ownership at the revised required level. At December 31, 2015, the Bank had $6.1 million in FHLB stock that was in compliance with the holding requirements. 

Other than as noted above, during the year ended December 31, 2015, the FHLB of Des Moines did not repurchase any of its membership stock from First Financial Northwest Bank. The FHLB pays dividends quarterly, and First Financial Northwest Bank received $69,000 in dividends during the year ended December 31, 2015. 

The FHLBs continue to contribute to low- and moderately-priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income housing projects. These contributions have adversely affected the level of FHLB dividends paid and could continue to do so in the future. These contributions could also have an adverse effect on the value of FHLB stock in the future. A reduction in value of First Financial Northwest Bank&#8217;s FHLB stock may result in a decrease in net income and possibly capital. 

Commercial Real Estate Lending Concentrations. The federal banking agencies have issued guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The particular focus is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be sensitive to conditions in the commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). The purpose of the guidance is not to limit a bank's commercial real estate lending but to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The guidance directs the FDIC and other bank regulatory agencies to focus their supervisory resources on institutions that may have significant commercial real estate loan concentration risk. A bank that has experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending, has notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate loan, or is approaching or exceeding the following supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis with respect to real estate concentration risk: 

&#8226; 

Total reported loans for construction, land development and other land &#32; represent 100% or more of the bank's capital; or 

&#8226; 

Total commercial real estate loans (as defined in the guidance) represent 300% or more of the bank's total regulatory capital or the outstanding balance of the bank's commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months. 

The guidance provides that the strength of an institution's lending and risk management practices with respect to such concentrations will be taken into account in supervisory guidance on evaluation of capital adequacy. As of December 31, 2015, First Financial Northwest Bank's aggregate recorded loan balances for construction, land development and land loans were 33.9% of regulatory capital. In addition, at December 31, 2015, First Financial Northwest Bank's loans on commercial real estate, as defined by the FDIC, were 343.6% of regulatory capital. 

Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Financial Institutions. Federal law generally limits the activities and equity investments of FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks to those that are permissible for national banks. An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things, (1) acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary, (2) investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2% of the bank&#8217;s total assets, (3) acquiring up to 10% of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors&#8217;, trustees&#8217; and officers&#8217; liability insurance coverage or bankers&#8217; blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions and (4) acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution owned by another FDIC-insured institution if certain requirements are met. 

Washington State has enacted a law regarding financial institution parity. Primarily, the law affords Washington state-chartered commercial banks the same powers as Washington state-chartered savings banks. In order for a bank to exercise these powers, it must provide 30 days' notice to the Director of the DFI and the Director must authorize the requested activity. Finally, the law provides additional flexibility for Washington state-chartered commercial and savings banks with respect to interest rates on loans and other extensions of credit. Specifically, they may charge the maximum interest rate allowable for loans and other extensions of credit by federally-chartered financial institutions to Washington residents. 

Environmental Issues Associated With Real Estate Lending. &#32;The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;) is a federal statute that generally imposes strict liability on all prior and present &#8220;owners and operators&#8221; of sites containing hazardous waste. However, Congress acted to protect secured creditors by providing that the term &#8220;owner and operator&#8221; excludes a person whose ownership is limited to protecting its security interest in the site. Since the enactment of the CERCLA, this &#8220;secured creditor exemption&#8221; has been the subject of judicial interpretations that have left open the possibility that lenders could be liable for cleanup costs on contaminated property that they hold as collateral for a loan. To the extent that legal uncertainty exists in this area, all creditors, including First Financial Northwest Bank, that have made loans secured by properties with potential hazardous waste contamination (such as petroleum contamination) could be subject to liability for cleanup costs that often are substantial and can exceed the value of the collateral property. 

Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve requires that all depository institutions maintain reserves on transaction accounts and non-personal time deposits. These reserves may be in the form of cash or deposits with the regional Federal Reserve Bank. NOW accounts and other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties fall within the definition of transaction accounts and are subject to reserve requirements, as are any non-personal time deposits at a savings bank. As of December 31, 2015, First Financial Northwest Bank&#8217;s deposits with the Federal Reserve exceeded its Regulation D reserve requirements. 

Affiliate Transactions. First Financial Northwest and First Financial Northwest Bank are separate and distinct legal entities. First Financial Northwest (and any non-bank subsidiary of First Financial Northwest) is an affiliate of First Financial Northwest Bank. Federal laws strictly limit the ability of banks to engage in certain transactions with their affiliates. Transactions deemed to be a &#8220;covered transaction&#8221; under Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and between a bank and an affiliate are limited to 10% of the bank&#8217;s capital and surplus and, with respect to all affiliates, to an aggregate of 20% of the bank&#8217;s capital and surplus. Further, covered transactions that are loans and extensions of credit generally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. Federal law also requires that covered transactions and certain other transactions listed in Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act between a bank and its affiliates be on terms as favorable to the bank as transactions with nonaffiliates. For additional information, see "&#8211; Regulation and Supervision of First Financial Northwest &#8211; Limitations on Transactions with Affiliates" below. 

Community Reinvestment Act. First Financial Northwest Bank is subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) that requires the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency to assess a bank&#8217;s performance under the CRA in meeting the credit needs of the community serviced by the bank, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The regulatory agency&#8217;s assessment of the bank&#8217;s record is made available to the public. Further, a bank&#8217;s CRA performance must be considered in connection with a bank&#8217;s application, to among other things, establish a new branch office that will accept deposits, relocate an existing office or merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of, a federally regulated financial institution. First Financial Northwest Bank received a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; rating during its most recent examination. 

Dividends. &#32;The amount of dividends payable by First Financial Northwest Bank to First Financial Northwest depends upon First Financial Northwest Bank&#8217;s earnings and capital position, and is limited by federal and state laws, regulations and policies. According to Washington law, First Financial Northwest Bank may not declare or pay a cash dividend on its capital stock if it would cause its net worth to be reduced below (1) the amount required for liquidation accounts or (2) the net worth requirements, if any, imposed by the Director of the DFI. In addition, dividends may not be declared or paid if First Financial Northwest Bank 

is in default in payment of any assessments due to the FDIC. Dividends on First Financial Northwest Bank&#8217;s capital stock may not be paid in an aggregate amount greater than the aggregate retained earnings of First Financial Northwest Bank, without the approval of the Director of the DFI. 

The amount of dividends actually paid during any one period is strongly affected by First Financial Northwest Bank&#8217;s policy of maintaining a strong capital position. Federal law further provides that no insured depository institution may pay a cash dividend if it would cause the institution to be &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; as defined in the prompt corrective action regulations. Moreover, the federal bank regulatory agencies also have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks if such payments are deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice. 

Privacy Standards. &#32;The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (&#8220;GLBA&#8221;) modernized the financial services industry by establishing a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks, insurance companies, securities firms and other financial service providers. First Financial Northwest Bank is subject to FDIC regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of the GLBA. These regulations require First Financial Northwest Bank to disclose its privacy policy, including informing consumers of its information sharing practices and informing consumers of their rights to opt out of certain practices. 

Other Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations. &#32;The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB and empowered it to exercise broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority with respect to both new and existing consumer financial protection laws. First Financial Northwest Bank is subject to consumer protection regulations issued by the CFPB, but as a financial institution with assets of less than $10 billion, First Financial Northwest Bank is generally subject to supervision and enforcement by the FDIC and the DFI with respect to its compliance with consumer financial protection laws and CFPB regulations. 

First Financial Northwest Bank is subject to a broad array of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern almost every aspect of its business relationships with consumers. While not exhaustive, these laws and regulations include the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, the Consumer Leasing Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, laws governing flood insurance, laws governing consumer protections in connection with the sale of insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices and various regulations that implement some or all of the foregoing. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans and providing other services. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject First Financial Northwest Bank to various penalties, including but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines, civil liability, criminal penalties, punitive damages and the loss of certain contractual rights. 

Regulation and Supervision of First Financial Northwest 

General. First Financial Northwest, as sole shareholder of First Financial Northwest Bank, is a bank holding company registered with the FRB. In March 2015, First Financial Northwest rescinded the 10(l) election made by First Financial Northwest Bank under the Home Owners&#8217; Loan Act, and converted from a savings and loan holding company to a bank holding company. Bank holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FRB under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (&#8220;BHCA&#8221;), and the regulations of the FRB. Accordingly, First Financial Northwest is required to file quarterly reports with the FRB and provide additional information as the FRB may require. The FRB may examine First Financial Northwest, and any of its subsidiaries, and charge First Financial Northwest for the cost of the examination. The FRB also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to require that a holding company divest subsidiaries (including its bank subsidiaries). In general, enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of law and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. First Financial Northwest is also required to file certain reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC. 

The Bank Holding Company Act. Under the BHCA, First Financial Northwest is supervised by the FRB. The FRB has a policy that a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act and earlier FRB policy provide that a bank holding company should serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary bank by having the ability to provide financial assistance to its subsidiary bank during periods of financial distress to the bank. A bank holding company's failure to meet its obligation to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary bank will generally be considered by the FRB to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the FRB&#8217;s regulations or both. No regulations have yet been proposed by the FRB to implement the source of strength doctrine required by the Dodd-Frank Act. First Financial Northwest and any subsidiaries that 

it may control are considered &#8220;affiliates&#8221; within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act, and transactions between First Financial Northwest Bank and affiliates are subject to numerous restrictions. With some exceptions, First Financial Northwest and its subsidiaries are prohibited from tying the provision of various services, such as extensions of credit, to other services offered by First Financial Northwest or by its affiliates. 

Acquisitions. &#160; The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. Under the BHCA, the FRB may approve the ownership of shares by a bank holding company in any company, the activities of which the FRB has determined to be so closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. These activities include: operating a savings institution, mortgage company, finance company, credit card company or factoring company; performing certain data processing operations; providing certain investment and financial advice; underwriting and acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit-related insurance; leasing property on a full-payout, non-operating basis; selling money orders, travelers' checks and U.S. Savings Bonds; real estate and personal property appraising; providing tax planning and preparation services; and, subject to certain limitations, providing securities brokerage services for customers. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements. &#32;Bank holding companies, like First Financial Northwest, are subject to capital adequacy requirements of the FRB under the BHCA and the regulations of the FRB. For a bank holding company with less than $1.0 billion in assets, the capital guidelines apply on a bank only basis and the FRB expects the holding company&#8217;s subsidiary bank to be well capitalized the prompt corrective action regulations. If First Financial Northwest were subject to regulatory guidelines for bank holding companies with $1.0 billion or more in assets, at December 31, 2015, First Financial Northwest would have exceeded all regulatory requirements.

Acquisition of Control. Under the federal Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the FRB if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire &#8220;control&#8221; of a bank holding company or commercial bank. An acquisition of control can occur upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the voting stock of a bank holding company or commercial bank or as otherwise defined by the FRB. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, the FRB has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the anti-trust effects of the acquisition. Any company that so acquires control would then be subject to regulation as a bank holding company. 

Restrictions on Dividends. &#32;First Financial Northwest&#8217;s ability to declare and pay dividends may depend in part on dividends received from First Financial Northwest Bank. Under Washington State law, First Financial Northwest is prohibited from paying a dividend if, as a result of its payment, it would be unable to pay its debts as they become due in the normal course of business or if First Financial Northwest's total liabilities would exceed its total assets. For additional information, see Item 1.A. &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Certain regulatory restrictions are imposed on us and lack of compliance could result in monetary penalties and/or additional regulatory actions.&#8221; 

Stock Repurchases. A bank holding company, except for certain &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; and highly rated bank holding companies, is required to give the FRB prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding twelve months, is equal to 10% or more of its consolidated net worth. The FRB may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, FRB order or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the FRB. &#32;&#32; During the year ended December 31, 2015, First Financial Northwest repurchased 1,521,817 shares of its common stock. 

Limitations on Transactions with Affiliates. Transactions between banks and any affiliate are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the FRB Act. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the Bank. In a holding company context, the holding company and any companies that are controlled by such holding companies are affiliates of the Bank. Generally, Section 23A limits the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of the institution&#8217;s capital stock and surplus and contain an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and surplus. Section 23B applies to &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; as well as certain other transactions and requires that all transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the bank as those provided to a nonaffiliate. The term &#8220;covered transaction&#8221; includes the making of loans to, purchase of assets from and issuance of a guarantee to an affiliate and similar transactions. 

In addition, Sections 22(g) and (h) of the FRB Act place restrictions on loans to executive officers, directors and principal shareholders. Under Section 22(h), loans to a director, executive officer or greater than 10% shareholder of a bank and certain affiliated interests, may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests, the bank&#8217;s loans to one borrower limit (generally equal to 15% of the institution&#8217;s unimpaired capital and surplus). Section 22(h) also requires that loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons unless the loans are made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that (1) is widely available to employees of the institution and (2) does not give preference to any director, executive officer or principal shareholder, or certain affiliated interests, over other employees of the bank. Section 22(h) also requires prior board approval for certain loans. In addition, the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a bank to all insiders cannot exceed the bank&#8217;s unimpaired capital and surplus. Furthermore, Section 22(g) places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers. At December 31, 2015, First Financial Northwest Bank was in compliance with these restrictions. 

Federal Securities Laws. First Financial Northwest&#8217;s common stock is registered with the SEC under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"). We are subject to information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Exchange Act. 

The Dodd-Frank Act . &#32;&#32;On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank-Act imposes new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions and implements new capital regulations that First Financial Northwest and First Financial Northwest Bank will become subject to and that are discussed above under the section entitled &#8220;- Regulation and Supervision of First Financial Northwest Bank - Capital Requirements.&#8221; 

In addition, among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies, like First Financial Northwest, to (i) provide their shareholders with a non-binding vote (a) at least once every three years on the compensation paid to executive officers and (b) at least once every six years on whether they should have a &#8220;say on pay&#8221; vote every one, two or three years; (ii) have a separate, non-binding shareholder vote regarding golden parachutes for named executive officers when a shareholder vote takes place on mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or other transactions that would trigger the parachute payments; (iii) provide disclosure in annual proxy materials concerning the relationship between the executive compensation paid and the financial performance of the issuer; and (iv) amend Item 402 of Regulation S-K to require companies to disclose the ratio of the Chief Executive Officer's annual total compensation to the median annual total compensation of all other employees. For certain of these changes, the implementing regulations have not been promulgated, so the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on public companies cannot be determined at this time. 

The federal banking agencies have issued final rules to implement the provisions of Section 619 of the Dodd Frank Act commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule. The regulations contain prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of financial institutions holding companies and their affiliates to engage in proprietary trading and to hold certain interests in, or to have certain relationships with, various types of investment funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds. The regulations became effective on April 1, 2014 with full compliance phased in over a period that ended on July 21, 2015. Management believes First Financial Northwest's investment portfolio and investment strategies are in compliance with the various provisions of the Volcker Rule regulations. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. &#32;As a public company that files periodic reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act, First Financial Northwest, is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), which addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems, such as the regulation of the accounting profession, and to state corporate law, such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees. Our policies and procedures have been updated to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 

Taxation 

Federal Taxation 

General . First Financial Northwest and First Financial Northwest Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to First Financial Northwest or First Financial Northwest Bank. The tax years still open for review by the Internal Revenue Service are 2012 through 2015. 

First Financial Northwest files a consolidated federal income tax return with First Financial Northwest Bank. Accordingly, any cash distributions made by First Financial Northwest to its shareholders are considered to be taxable dividends and not as a non-taxable return of capital to shareholders for federal and state tax purposes. 

Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, First Financial Northwest currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a fiscal year ending on December 31 for filing its federal income tax return. 

Minimum Tax. The Internal Revenue Code imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, called alternative minimum taxable income. The alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent such alternative minimum taxable income is in excess of an exemption amount. Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. The Company's alternative minimum tax credit carryforward at December 31, 2015 totaled $1.4 million, with no expiration date. 

Net Operating Loss Carryovers. A financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. This provision applies to losses incurred in taxable years beginning after August 2009. The Company had no net operating loss carryforwards at December 31, 2015. 

Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction. First Financial Northwest may eliminate from its income dividends received from First Financial Northwest Bank as a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Financial Northwest that files a consolidated return with First Financial Northwest Bank. The corporate dividends-received deduction is 100%, or 80%, in the case of dividends received from corporations with which a corporate recipient does not file a consolidated tax return, depending on the level of stock ownership of the payer of the dividend. Corporations that own less than 20% of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend may deduct 70% of dividends received or accrued on their behalf. 

For additional information regarding our federal income taxes, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8. 

Washington State Taxation 

First Financial Northwest and its subsidiaries are subject to a business and occupation tax imposed under Washington state law at the rate of 1.50% of gross receipts. In addition, various municipalities also assess business and occupation taxes at differing rates. Interest received on loans secured by first lien mortgages or deeds of trust on residential properties, rental income from properties, and certain investment securities are exempt from this tax. An audit by the Washington State Department of Revenue was completed for the years 2010 through 2013, resulting in no material tax revisions.
