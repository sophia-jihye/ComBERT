&#160;

Corporate Information 

&#160;

We were incorporated under the laws of State of Nevada on March 27, 2007, as Bio-Solutions Corp. 

&#160;

On October 17, 2012, our Board of Directors and shareholders holding a majority of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock, pursuant to written consents in lieu of a meeting, approved an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to increase our authorized capital (the "amendment"). The amendment was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State on October 17, 2012, increasing our authorized capital from 90,000,000 shares of common stock, to 200,000,000 shares of common stock, with a par value of $0.001. 

&#160;

On January 10, 2014, the Company's Board of Directors unanimously voted to reverse split the Company's common stock on the basis of one share of the Company's common stock for each 10 shares outstanding while maintaining the authorized capital structure of the Company at 200,000,000 shares. The Board resolution set the date of record for shareholder approval for January 14, 2014. As of January 29, 2014, the Company obtained written consent in lieu of a meeting of the shareholders to authorize a reverse split of the Company's common stock. Shareholders owning a total of 100,992,469 shares of the Company's common stock voted in favor of the reverse split. There were a total of 199,611,900 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of January 14, 2014 (the date of record). The number of shares of common stock voting in favor of the reverse split was sufficient for approval. On February 4, 2014, the Company filed a Certificate of Change with the State of Nevada effecting a 1-for-10 reverse split pursuant to which every ten shares of the Company's common stock were combined and converted into one share of the Company's common stock (with all fractional shares resulting there from being rounded up to the next whole share) with the total number of shares of the Company's authorized common stock remaining at 200,000,000 shares. The effective date of the above corporate action was February 26, 2014. 

&#160;

On October 30, 2014, the board of directors of the Company voted to reverse split the Company's common stock on the basis of one share of the Company's common stock for each 50 shares outstanding while maintaining the authorized capital structure of the Company at 200,000,000 shares; to authorize 1,000 shares of preferred stock with "blank check" rights; and to change the Company's name from Bio-Solutions Corp. to Glucose Health, Inc. (the "corporate action"). The board resolution set the date of record for shareholder approval of the corporate action for October 31, 2014 and the effective date of the corporate action for November 19, 2014. As of October 31, 2014, the Company obtained written consent in lieu of a meeting of shareholders to authorize the corporate action. Shareholders owning a total of 30,596,154 shares of the Company's common stock voted in favor of the corporate action. There were a total of 60,132,271 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of October 31, 2014 (the date of record). The number of shares of common stock voting in favor of the corporate action was sufficient for approval. On November 5, 2014, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation, with the Nevada Secretary of State effecting, as of November 19, 2014, the 1-for-50 reverse split pursuant to which every fifty shares of the Company's common stock were combined and converted into one share of the Company's common stock (with all fractional shares being rounded up to the next whole share) with the total number of shares of the Company's authorized common stock remaining at 200,000,000 shares; effecting the authorization of 1,000 shares of preferred stock with "blank check" rights; and effecting the change of the Company's name from Bio-Solutions Corp. to Glucose Health, Inc. On November 20, 2015, the board of directors voted to designate Series A Special Preferred Shares consisting of 1,000 shares of preferred stock with special voting rights whereby the holder(s) may exercise their right to vote on all shareholder matters representing the number of votes equal to all shares of common stock then issued and outstanding, plus an additional ten thousand (10,000) shares. Additionally, the board of directors voted to extend an existing 12 month consulting contract with the Company's CEO, Murray Fleming, for an additional 12 months, through October 1, 2016, without further compensation, in exchange for the issuance to Mr. Fleming, of the 1,000 Series A Special Preferred Shares.

&#160; &#160;

Our Business 

&#160;

From inception through September 25, 2011, we were a manufacturer of Nutra-Animal, a pre-mix anti-oxidant for chicken integrators containing wheat middlings, vitamin E, calcium carbonate, silicone dioxyde, shrimp flour, sodium selenite and fish oil. We were also a distributor of GreenEx TM , a biological larvicide produced from a strain of Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies israelensis (Bti), a naturally occurring bacterium that produces a crystalline protein toxin (cystal) toxic for mosquitoes, vectors of malaria. We were not successful in these business endeavors. 

&#160;

On September 26, 2011, we acquired the "Type2 Defense" product together with all intellectual property associated therewith. Upon the acquisition of Type2 Defense we discontinued our former operations as a manufacturer of Nutri-Animal and distributor of GreenEx TM . Since we discontinued our former operations, we wrote off any inventories attributable to our former operations. Type2 Defense is a dietary supplement made from natural ingredients and formulated to support healthy glucose levels and targeted to consumers concerned about Type-2 and pre-diabetes. 

&#160;

The first production run of the Company's Type2 Defense product was completed in June 2013 with the manufacture of 1764 cases. On July 8, 2013, the Company announced the product was available for on-line sales on Amazon.com. On July 9, 2013, the Company announced the product was available for on-line sales via the www.Type2Defense.com website. Subsequently, the Company encountered significant management, operational and financial challenges resulting in poor product sales and inadequate inventory control. As a consequence, the Company generated only nominal revenues in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 and the Company elected to declare the $200,000 intellectual property for Type2 Defense, recorded as other intangible assets, as impaired at December 31, 2013. 

&#160;

On April 8, 2014, the Company appointed James Hodge chairman of the Company's board of directors. 

&#160;

On April 8, 2014, in a special meeting of the board of directors, the board voted in favor of amending the Company's bylaws to decrease the number of members of the board of directors from three to one. The previous board members agreed to resign from the board and accept other duties for the Company. 

&#160;

On April 21, 2014, the Company appointed Thomas Metzger Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Peggy Knight was appointed Chief Marketing Officer. 

&#160;

On July 22, 2014, Thomas Metzger Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, resigned from the Company. James Hodge, chairman of the board of directors was appointed interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 

&#160;

Current Business 

&#160;

On October 1, 2014, Murray Fleming was appointed the Company's Chief Executive Officer for the 12-month period ending October 1, 2015. Additionally, on October 1, 2014, the Company entered into an Intellectual Property Purchase Agreement to purchase the "Glucose Health Natural Blood Sugar Maintenance" product from a company of which Mr. Fleming is the beneficial owner. Following this purchase, the Company undertook a series of steps to achieve a final product offering that would be considered efficacious as well as pleasant tasting by our target consumer market and would offer a value proposition relative to our competition in order to be considered for stocking by national and regional pharmacy retailers. To assist in achieving our final product objectives, we retained a former head of beverage product development at Nestle. We retained an attorney specializing in compliance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, necessary, in part, to allow our product to be stocked by national pharmacy retailers. We also undertook a number of actions to establish and build our Glucose Health &#210; brand. The Company conducted a design competition related to its packaging artwork and product logo and retained an experienced product packaging graphic artist to assist with all digital and print representations of the product. The Company filed for and received trademark protection for Glucose Health &#210; with the United States Trademark and Patent Office (USPTO). While our primary sales and marketing focus is achieving sales to consumers through national and regional pharmacies, secondarily, we intend to also market the product directly to customers via our dedicated product website and through other online marketplaces. &#160;

&#160; &#160;

Glucose Health &#210; is a dietary supplement formulated from nine natural ingredients shown in certain clinical research such as that published by the National Institutes of Health (see www.glucosehealth.com/clinical-trials), to have a beneficial impact upon blood glucose, insulin, triglyceride and cholesterol levels. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes a National Diabetes Statistics Report annually. The 2014 Report estimates 2 of 5 Americans will develop Type-2 diabetes in their lifetime. We believe the CDC Report and other similar research points to a large and growing market of consumers with pre-diabetes or Type-2 diabetes many of whom are likely seeking natural products like Glucose Health &#210; to proactively maintain good health. 

&#160;

Glucose Health &#210; is currently packaged in a "Value-Size" container format consisting of 384 grams of product formula lasting 60 days. In addition, the Company plans to introduce an "On-the-Go" packaging format of 30 stick packs to a box in fiscal 2016. 

&#160;

On November 20, 2014, the existing 12 month consulting contract with the Company's CEO, Murray Fleming, was extended an additional 12 months ending October 2016, without further compensation, in exchange for the issuance to Mr. Fleming, of 1,000 Series A Special Preferred Shares. 

&#160;

On December 31, 2014, the Company elected to write-off its inventory of Type2 Defense product to -0- and cease all manufacturing and sales activities related to the product. 

&#160;

On January 5, 2015, the Company signed a contract manufacturing agreement for testing, compounding, supply and order fulfillment for the Glucose Health &#210; product and additionally a purchasing agreement to distribute the product in a limited number of Northwest Arkansas pharmacies. 

&#160;

On January 7, 2015, the Company completed its implementation of Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP). The Dietary Supplement (DS) CGMP rule in 21 CFR part 111 of the FDA's regulations requires companies which manufacture, package, label, or hold a dietary supplement to establish and follow current good manufacturing practice to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and to ensure that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record. 

&#160;

On January 26, 2015, the Company filed an initial application for trademark protection related to its line of dietary products, with the United States Trademark and Patent Office (USPTO). 

&#160;

On January 29, 2015, the Company appointed of Chandrasekhar Mallangi, Ph.D., as an advisor. Dr. Mallangi earned a Ph.D. in Food Science from Oregon State University and is an advisor to multinational companies in the development of nutritional products. Dr. Mallangi is the credited inventor and co-inventor for patents in the area of food nutrition, awarded by the USPTO to subsidiaries of Nestle, SA of Vevey, Switzerland. 

&#160;

On February 10, 2015, Murray Fleming, the Company's Chief Executive Officer was appointed the Company's Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Fleming replaces James Hodge the Company's interim Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Hodge will remain the Company's chairman of the board of directors. 

&#160;

On February 24, 2015, the Company completed FDA facility registration, a compliance procedure for manufacturers of dietary and nutritional supplements. 

&#160;

The Company completed the first production run of the product on May 26, 2015 and pursuant to the January 5, 2015 purchasing agreement, the product began to be offered for retail sale through a limited number of Northwest Arkansas pharmacies as well as on the Company's product website www.glucosehealth.com. 

&#160;

On July 7, 2015, the Company received notification from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) that its application for trademark of "Glucose Health" was accepted to the Supplemental Register (Reg. 4,770,720) with first use recognized by the USPTO as of February 1, 2015. &#160;

&#160; &#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

The manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling, distributing, selling and advertising of our products are subject to government regulation, principally by the Food and Drug Administration (hereinafter the "FDA"). In particular, the FDA regulates the safety, manufacturing, labeling and distribution of dietary supplements. The FDA permits "statements of nutritional support" for dietary supplements without FDA pre-approval. Such statements may describe how particular dietary ingredients affect the structure, function or general well-being of the body, or the mechanism of action by which a dietary ingredient may affect body structure, function or well-being (but may not state that a dietary supplement will diagnose, mitigate, treat, cure or prevent a disease). A company making a statement of nutritional support must possess substantiating evidence for the statement, and, for such statements that are not about the effects on the body as a result of a dietary supplement used as a tool for its nutritive value and are not otherwise "health claims," disclose on the label that the FDA has not reviewed that statement and that the product is not intended for use for a disease. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can result in various levels of regulatory actions being imposed on the Company including but not limited to action letters, product recalls and injunctions. 

&#160;

In addition to the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission (hereinafter the "FTC") has additional jurisdiction to regulate the labeling, promotion and advertising of dietary supplements. The FTC is authorized to use a variety of processes and remedies for enforcement, both administratively and judicially, including compulsory process, cease and desist orders, and injunctions. FTC enforcement can result in orders requiring, among other things, limits on advertising, corrective advertising, consumer redress, divestiture of assets, rescission of contracts and such other relief as may be deemed necessary. State and local authorities can also regulate advertising and labeling for dietary supplements and conventional foods. Additionally, there can be no assurance that state and local authorities will not commence other regulatory actions that could restrict the permissible scope of our product claims. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The business of developing and distributing dietary supplements is highly competitive. Our product has direct and indirect competition. We compete directly with Glucerna &#210; Advance, manufactured by Abbott Laboratories; Boost Glucose Control &#210; , manufactured by Nestle; and Enterex &#210; Diabetic, manufactured by Victus, Inc. All of the companies whom are our direct competitors are substantially larger with much greater financial resources and broader name recognition. Although we are a small company, we have a competitive advantage over our direct competitors because they rely upon achieving their product goals principally through the benefits of high fiber content and a broad spectrum of vitamins and minerals; while our product not only has similar dietary fiber content, it is 100% soluble and therefore of greater interest to persons with pre-diabetes and Type-2 diabetes. Instead of a broad spectrum of vitamins and minerals, Glucose Health &#210; also contains targeted plant based extracts and powders, in a proprietary formula, which have been demonstrated in certain clinical studies to have beneficial impacts on healthy levels of serum glucose, insulin, triglycerides and cholesterol. We also compete indirectly with Metamucil, manufactured by Procter and Gamble, because both Metamucil and Glucose Health &#210; have similar fiber content and are both targeted to the pre-diabetes and Type-2 diabetes consumer market. We also compete indirectly with the many individual dietary supplements marketed in pill or tablet form and also targeted to the pre-diabetic and Type-2 diabetic consumer market segment. 

&#160;

There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively compete in such an intensely competitive environment. 

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Our intellectual property consists of the Glucose Health &#210; product acquired October 1, 2014 and our proprietary product formula. Glucose Health &#210; is protected by trademark protection following our successful application to the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We may consider filing patent applications with respect to our product formula and other novel aspects of our business to protect our intellectual property. Future patents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Thus, any patent awarded to us may not provide adequate protection against competitors. The patent applications we file may not result in patents being issued. Also, patents may not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or advantages against competitors with similar or competing products. As a result of potential conflicts with the proprietary rights of others, we may in the future have to prove that we are not infringing the patent rights of others or be required to obtain a license to the patent. We do not know whether such a license would be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. &#160;

&#160; 8 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160;

We also rely on trade secrets and unpatentable know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements. However, it is possible that parties may breach those agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. It is also possible that our trade secrets or unpatentable know-how will otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. There can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement or other claims against us with respect to any existing or future products, or that licenses would be available if our formulas were successfully challenged by a third party, or if it became desirable to use any third-party formulas and/or technology to enhance our products. Litigation to protect our proprietary information or to determine the validity of any third-party claims could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not we are successful in such litigation. 

&#160;

While we have no knowledge that we are infringing the proprietary rights of any third party, there can be no assurance that such claims will not be asserted in the future with respect to our Product formula or future products. Any such assertion by a third party could require us to pay royalties, to participate in costly litigation and defend licensees in any such suit pursuant to indemnification agreements, or to refrain from selling an alleged infringing product or service. 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

We have no employees. We hire consultants and contract with third-party providers to support our business development. We may need to hire employees to support our business development.
