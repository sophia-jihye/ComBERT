 Item 1. Business 

General 

We are a growth-oriented master limited partnership formed in Delaware in 1996 and focused on the midstream segment of the crude oil and natural gas industry in the Gulf Coast region of the United States, primarily Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Wyoming and in the Gulf of Mexico. Our common units are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol &#8220;GEL.&#8221; Our principal executive offices are located at 919 Milam, Suite 2100, Houston, Texas 77002 and our telephone number is (713) 860-2500. Except to the extent otherwise provided, the information contained in this annual report is as of December 31, 2015 . 

We provide an integrated suite of services to refiners, crude oil and natural gas producers, and industrial and commercial enterprises. We currently have two distinct, complimentary types of operations-(i) our onshore-based refinery-centric operations located primarily in the Gulf Coast region of the U.S., which focus on providing a suite of services primarily to refiners, and (ii) our offshore Gulf of Mexico crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation and handling operations, which focus on providing a suite of services primarily to integrated and large independent energy companies who make intensive capital investments (often in excess of billions of dollars) to develop numerous large-reservoir, long-lived crude oil and natural gas properties. Our onshore-based operations occur upstream of, at, and downstream of refinery complexes. Upstream of refineries, we aggregate, purchase, gather and transport crude oil, which we sell to refiners. Within refineries, we provide services to assist in sulfur removal/balancing requirements. Downstream of refineries, we provide transportation services as well as market outlets for finished refined petroleum products and certain refining by-products. In our offshore crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation and handling operations, we provide service to one of the most active drilling and development regions in the U.S.-the Gulf of Mexico, a producing region representing approximately 15% of the crude oil production in the U.S. in 2015. We have a diverse portfolio of customers, operations and assets, including pipelines, refinery-related plants, storage tanks and terminals, railcars, rail loading and unloading facilities, barges and other vessels, and trucks. Substantially all of our revenues are derived from providing services to refiners, integrated and large independent crude oil and natural gas companies, and industrial and commercial enterprises. 

We conduct our operations and own our operating assets through our subsidiaries and joint ventures. Our general partner, Genesis Energy, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary that owns a non-economic general partner interest in us, has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations. 

We currently manage our operations through five divisions that constitute our reportable segments. Our offshore crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation and handling operations are comprised of our Offshore Pipeline Transportation segment. Our onshore-based crude oil and refined petroleum products transportation and handling operations are comprised of the following segments: Onshore Pipeline Transportation, Refinery Services, Marine Transportation and Supply and Logistics. 

Offshore Pipeline Transportation Segment 

We conduct our offshore crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation and handling operations through our Offshore Pipeline Transportation Segment, which focus on providing a suite of services to integrated and large independent energy companies who make intensive capital investments (often in excess of billions of dollars) to develop numerous large-reservoir, long-lived crude oil and natural gas properties in the Gulf of Mexico, primarily offshore Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. This segment provides services to one of the most active drilling and development regions in the U.S.-the Gulf of Mexico, a producing region representing approximately 15% of the crude oil production in the U.S. in 2015. Even though those large-reservoir properties and the related pipelines and other infrastructure needed to develop them are capital intensive, we believe they are generally much less sensitive to short-term commodity price volatility, particularly once a project has been sanctioned. Due to the size and scope of these activities, our customers are predominantly large integrated oil companies and large independent crude oil producers. 

In July of 2015, we substantially expanded this segment by acquiring the offshore pipeline and services business of Enterprise Products Partners, L.P. and its affiliates for approximately $1.5 billion , subject to certain adjustments. That acquired business, which was complementary to our then existing offshore operations, included interests in approximately 2,350 miles of offshore crude oil and natural gas pipelines and six offshore hub platforms. 

As of December 31, 2015, our Offshore Pipeline Transportation Segment owned interests in various offshore crude oil and natural gas pipeline systems, platforms and related infrastructure. We owned interests in approximately 1,437 &#32;miles of crude oil pipelines with an aggregate design capacity of approximately 1,810 &#32;MBbls per day, a number of which pipeline systems are substantial and/or strategically located. For example, we own a 64% &#32;interest in the Poseidon pipeline system and 100% &#32;of the Cameron Highway pipeline system, or CHOPS, which is one of the largest crude oil pipelines (in terms of both length and design capacity) located in the Gulf of Mexico. We also own 100% &#32;of the Southeast Keathley Canyon Pipeline 

Table of Contents 

Company, LLC, or SEKCO, which is a deepwater pipeline servicing the Lucius field in the southern Keathley Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico that became operational in 2014. 

Our interests in offshore natural gas pipeline systems and related infrastructure includes approximately 1,157 &#32;miles of pipe with an aggregate design capacity of approximately 4,863 &#32;MMcf per day. We also own an interest in six offshore hub platforms with aggregate capacity of approximately 2,256 &#32;MMcf per day of natural gas and 167 &#32;MBbls per day of crude oil. 

&#32;Our offshore pipelines generate cash flows from fees charged to customers or substantially similar arrangements that otherwise limit our direct exposure to changes in commodity prices. Each of our offshore pipelines currently has significant available capacity to accommodate future growth in the fields from which the production is dedicated to that pipeline, including fields that have yet to commence production activities, as well as volumes from non-dedicated fields. 

Onshore Pipeline Transportation Segment 

Crude Oil Pipelines 

We own five &#32;onshore crude oil pipeline systems, with approximately 560 &#32;miles of pipe located primarily in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas and Wyoming. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, regulates the rates our four &#32;onshore systems charge their customers. The rates for our other onshore pipeline are regulated by the Railroad Commission of Texas. Our onshore pipelines generate cash flows from fees charged to customers. 

Each of our onshore pipelines has significant available capacity to accommodate potential future growth in volumes. 

CO 2 &#32;Pipelines 

We own two &#32;CO 2 &#32;pipelines with approximately 270 &#32;miles of pipe. We have leased our NEJD System, comprised of 183 &#32;miles of pipe in North East Jackson Dome, Mississippi, to an affiliate of an independent crude oil company through 2028 . We receive a fixed quarterly payment under the NEJD arrangement. That company also has the exclusive right to use our Free State pipeline, comprised of 86 &#32;miles of pipe, pursuant to a transportation agreement that expires in 2028 . Payments on the Free State pipeline are subject to an "incentive" tariff which provides that the average rate per mcf that we charge during any month decreases as our aggregate throughput for that month increases above specified thresholds. 

Refinery Services Segment 

We primarily (i) provide services to ten &#32;refining operations located mostly in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Utah; (ii) operate significant storage and transportation assets in relation to those services; and (iii) sell NaHS (pronounced nash) - also known as sodium hydro-sulfide - and NaOH - also known as caustic soda - to large industrial and commercial companies. Our refinery services primarily involve processing refiners&#8217; high sulfur (or &#8220;sour&#8221;) gas streams to remove the sulfur. Our refinery services footprint also includes NaHS and caustic soda terminals, and we utilize railcars, ships, barges and trucks to transport product. Our refinery services contracts are typically long-term in nature and have an average remaining term of three &#32;years. NaHS is a by-product derived from our refinery services process, and it constitutes the sole consideration we receive for these services. A majority of the NaHS we receive is sourced from refineries owned and operated by large companies, including Phillips 66, CITGO, HollyFrontier and Ergon. We sell our NaHS to customers in a variety of industries, with the largest customers involved in mining of base metals, primarily copper and molybdenum, and the production of pulp and paper. We believe we are one of the largest marketers of NaHS in North and South America. 

Marine Transportation Segment 

We own a fleet of 75 &#32;barges ( 66 &#32;inland and 9 &#32;offshore) with a combined transportation capacity of 2.7 million &#32;barrels and 39 &#32;push/tow boats ( 30 &#32;inland and 9 &#32;offshore). Our marine transportation segment is a provider of transportation services by tank barge primarily for refined petroleum products, including heavy fuel oil and asphalt, as well as crude oil. Refiners accounted for approximately 90% of our marine transportation volumes for 2015. 

We also own the M/T American Phoenix, an ocean going tanker with 330,000 barrels of cargo capacity. The M/T American Phoenix is currently transporting refined products. 

We are a provider of transportation services for our customers and, in almost all cases, do not assume ownership of the products that we transport. Most of our marine transportation services are conducted under term contracts, some of which have renewal options for customers with whom we have traditionally had long-standing relationships. For more information regarding our charter arrangements, please refer to the Marine Transportation Segment discussion below. All of our vessels operate under the U.S. flag and are qualified for domestic trade under the Jones Act. 

Supply and Logistic Segment 

Our supply and logistics segment is focused on utilizing our knowledge of the crude oil and petroleum markets to 

Table of Contents 

provide crude oil and natural gas producers, refineries and other customers with a full suite of services. Our supply and logistics segment owns or leases trucks, terminals, gathering pipelines, railcars, and rail loading and unloading facilities. It uses those assets, together with other modes of transportation owned by third parties and us, to service its customers and for its own account. We have access to a suite of more than 300 &#32;trucks, 400 &#32;trailers, 522 &#32;railcars, and terminals and tankage with 3.3 million &#32;barrels of storage capacity in multiple locations along the Gulf Coast as well as capacity associated with our three common carrier crude oil pipelines. Our crude-by-rail operations consist of a total of six facilities, either in operation or under construction, designed to load and/or unload crude oil. The two facilities located in Texas and Wyoming were designed primarily to load crude oil produced locally onto railcars for further transportation to refining markets. The four other facilities (two in Louisiana, one in Mississippi and one in Florida) were designed primarily to unload crude oil from railcars into pipelines, or onto barges, for delivery to refinery customers. Usually, our supply and logistics segment experiences limited direct commodity price risk because it utilizes back-to-back purchases and sales, matching sale and purchase volumes on a monthly basis. Unsold volumes are hedged with NYMEX derivatives to offset the remaining price risk. 

Our Objectives and Strategies 

Our primary business objectives are to generate stable cash flows that allow us to make quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders and to increase those distributions over time. We plan to achieve those objectives by executing the following business and financial strategies. 

Business Strategy 

Our primary business strategy is to provide an integrated suite of services to refiners, crude oil and natural gas producers, and industrial and commercial enterprises. Successfully executing this strategy should enable us to generate and grow sustainable cash flows. We currently have two distinct, complimentary types of operations-(i) our onshore-based crude oil and refined petroleum products transportation, supply and logistics, and handling operations, focusing predominantly on refinery-centric customers (as opposed to producers), and (ii) our offshore Gulf of Mexico crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation and handling operations, focusing on integrated and large independent energy companies who make intensive capital investments (often in excess of billions of dollars) to develop numerous large-reservoir, long-lived crude oil and natural gas properties. Refiners are the shippers of over 85% of the volumes transported on our onshore crude pipelines, and refiners contract for approximately 90% of the use of our inland barges, which primarily are used to transport intermediate refined products (not crude oil) between refining complexes. The shippers on our offshore pipelines are mostly integrated and large independent energy companies who have developed, and continue to explore for, numerous large-reservoir, long-lived crude oil properties whose production is ideally suited for the vast majority of refineries along the Gulf Coast, unlike the lighter crude oil and condensates produced from numerous onshore shale plays. Those large-reservoir properties and the related pipelines and other infrastructure needed to develop them are capital intensive and yet, we believe, economically viable, in most cases, even in this lower commodity price environment. 

We intend to develop our business by: 

&#8226; 

Identifying and exploiting incremental profit opportunities, including cost synergies, across an increasingly integrated footprint; 

&#8226; 

Optimizing our existing assets and creating synergies through additional commercial and operating advancement; 

&#8226; 

Leveraging customer relationships across business segments; 

&#8226; 

Attracting new customers and expanding our scope of services offered to existing customers; 

&#8226; 

Expanding the geographic reach of our businesses; 

&#8226; 

Economically expanding our pipeline and terminal operations; 

&#8226; 

Evaluating internal and third party growth opportunities (including asset and business acquisitions) that leverage our core competencies and strengths and further integrate our businesses; and 

&#8226; 

Focusing on health, safety and environmental stewardship. 

Table of Contents 

Financial Strategy 

We believe that preserving financial flexibility is an important factor in our overall strategy and success. Over the long-term, we intend to: 

&#8226; 

Increase the relative contribution of recurring and throughput-based revenues, emphasizing longer-term contractual arrangements; 

&#8226; 

Prudently manage our limited commodity price risks; 

&#8226; 

Maintain a sound, disciplined capital structure; and 

&#8226; 

Create strategic arrangements and share capital costs and risks through joint ventures and strategic alliances. 

Competitive Strengths 

We believe we are well positioned to execute our strategies and ultimately achieve our objectives due primarily to the following competitive strengths: 

&#8226; 

We have limited commodity price risk exposure. &#32;The volumes of crude oil, refined products or intermediate feedstocks we purchase are either subject to back-to-back sales contracts or are hedged with NYMEX derivatives to limit our exposure to movements in the price of the commodity, although we cannot completely eliminate commodity price exposure. Our risk management policy requires us to monitor the effectiveness of the hedges to maintain a value at risk of such hedged inventory not in excess of $2.5 million . In addition, our service contracts with refiners allow us to adjust the rates we charge for processing to maintain a balance between NaHS supply and demand. 

&#8226; 

Our businesses encompass a balanced, diversified portfolio of customers, operations and assets . We operate five business segments and own and operate assets that enable us to provide a number of services primarily to refiners, crude oil and natural gas producers, and industrial and commercial enterprises that use NaHS and caustic soda. Our business lines complement each other by allowing us to offer an integrated suite of services to common customers across segments. Our businesses are primarily focused on providing (i) onshore-based refinery-centric crude oil and refined products transportation and handling services and (ii) offshore crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation services in the Gulf of Mexico to mostly integrated and large independent energy companies. We are not dependent upon any one customer or principal location for our revenues. 

&#8226; 

Some of our onshore and offshore pipeline transportation and related assets are strategically located. &#32;Our pipelines are critical to the ongoing operations of our refiner and producer customers. In addition, a majority of our terminals are located in areas that can be accessed by truck, rail or barge. 

&#8226; 

We believe we are one of the largest marketers of NaHS in North and South America. &#32;We believe the scale of our well-established refinery services operations as well as our integrated suite of assets provides us with a unique cost advantage over some of our existing and potential competitors. 

&#8226; 

Our supply and logistics business is operationally flexible. &#32;Our portfolio of trucks, railcars, barges and terminals affords us flexibility within our existing regional footprint and provides us the capability to enter new markets and expand our customer relationships. 

&#8226; 

Our marine transportation assets provide waterborne transportation throughout North America. Our fleet of barges and boats provide service to both inland and offshore customers within a large North American geographic footprint. There are a limited number of Jones Act qualified vessels participating in U.S. coastwise trade. All of our vessels operate under the U.S. flag and are qualified for U.S. coastwise trade under the Jones Act. 

&#8226; 

Our businesses provide relatively consistent consolidated financial performance. &#32;Our historically consistent and improving financial performance, combined with our goal of a conservative capital structure over the long term, has allowed us to increase our distribution for forty-two &#32;consecutive quarters as of our most recent distribution declaration. During this period, thirty-seven &#32;of those quarterly increases have been 10% or greater as compared to the same quarter in the preceding year, although as in the past, future increases (if any) in our quarterly distribution rate will depend on our ability to execute critical components of our business strategy. 

&#8226; 

We are financially flexible and have significant liquidity. As of December 31, 2015 , we had $374.3 million &#32;available under our $1.5 billion &#32;credit agreement, including up to $166.2 million &#32;available under the $200 million &#32;petroleum products inventory loan sublimit, and $89.4 million &#32;available for letters of credit. Our inventory borrowing base was $33.8 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 . 

&#8226; 

Our expertise and reputation for high performance standards and quality enable us to provide refiners with economic and proven services. Our extensive understanding of the sulfur removal process and crude oil refining can provide us with an advantage when evaluating new opportunities and/or markets. 

Table of Contents 

&#8226; 

We have an experienced, knowledgeable and motivated executive management team with a proven track record. &#32;Our executive management team has an average of more than 25 years of experience in the midstream sector. Its members have worked in leadership roles at a number of large, successful public companies, including other publicly-traded partnerships. Through their equity interest in us, our executive management team is incentivized to create value by increasing cash flows. 

Recent Developments and Status of Certain Growth Initiatives 

The following is a brief listing of developments since December 31, 2014 . Additional information regarding most of these items may be found elsewhere in this report. 

Acquisition of Enterprise Offshore Pipelines and Services Business 

In July 2015, we acquired the offshore pipeline and services business of Enterprise Products Partners, L.P. and its affiliates for approximately $1.5 billion , subject to certain adjustments. That business includes interests in approximately 2,350 miles of offshore crude oil and natural gas pipelines and six offshore hub platforms that serve some of the most active drilling and development regions in the U.S., including deepwater production fields in the Gulf of Mexico offshore Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. That acquisition complements and substantially expands our existing offshore pipelines segment and was immediately accretive to Segment Margin and Available Cash before Reserves. 

Houston Area Crude Oil Pipeline and Terminal Infrastructure 

We are constructing new, and expanding existing, crude oil pipeline and terminal facilities in Webster, Texas and Texas City, Texas as a result of expanding our crude oil pipeline and terminal infrastructure in the Houston area. We will construct a new crude oil pipeline that will deliver crude oil received from upstream crude oil pipelines (including CHOPS, which delivers crude oil originating in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico to the Texas City area) to our new Texas City Terminal, which will ultimately connect to our existing 18-inch Webster to Texas City crude oil pipeline. Our new Texas City Terminal will include initially approximately 750,000 barrels of crude oil tankage. Our Webster Terminal is connected to other crude oil pipelines servicing other Houston area refineries. As a part of this project, we are also making the necessary upgrades on our existing 18-inch Webster to Texas City crude oil pipeline to allow for bi-directional flow. The result of this expanded crude oil infrastructure will allow additional optionality to Houston and Baytown area refineries, including the Exxon-Mobil Baytown refinery, its largest refinery in the U.S.A., and provide additional delivery outlets for other crude oil pipelines. We expect these assets to become operational in the second half of 2016. 

Wyoming Crude Oil Pipeline 

In the third quarter of 2015, we completed construction of a new 60 mile crude oil pipeline to transport crude oil from new receipt point stations in Campbell County and Converse County, Wyoming to our existing Pronghorn Rail Facility. This new crude oil pipeline has an initial capacity of approximately 45,000 barrels per day and is supplied by truck volumes and third party gathering infrastructure in the Powder River Basin. 

We are also constructing a new 75 mile pipeline from our Pronghorn Rail Facility to a delivery point at our new Guernsey Station in Platte County, Wyoming. This Pronghorn to Guernsey pipeline will have an initial capacity of approximately 45,000 barrels per day and will allow for connectivity to additional downstream pipeline markets at Guernsey, including regional refineries and Cushing, Oklahoma via the Pony Express Pipeline. This pipeline became operational in early &#32; 2016. 

Inland &#32; Marine Barge Transportation Expansion 

We ordered 20 &#32;new-build barges and 14 &#32;new-build push boats for our inland marine barge transportation fleet. We have accepted delivery of 12 &#32;of those barges and 9 &#32;of those push boats through December 31, 2015. We expect to take delivery of those remaining vessels periodically into 2016. 

Baton Rouge Terminal 

We are constructing a new crude oil, intermediates and refined products import/export terminal in Baton Rouge that will be located near the Port of Greater Baton Rouge and will be pipeline-connected to the port's existing deepwater docks on the Mississippi River. We will initially construct approximately 1.1 million barrels of tankage for the storage of crude oil, intermediates and/or refined products with the capability to expand to provide additional terminaling services to our customers. In addition, we will construct a new pipeline from the terminal that will allow for deliveries to existing Exxon Mobil facilities in the area, as well as connect our previously constructed 17 mile line to the terminal allowing for receipts from the Scenic Station Rail Facility. Shippers to Scenic Station will have access to both the local Baton Rouge refining market, as well as the ability to access other attractive refining markets via our Baton Rouge Terminal. Our Baton Rouge Terminal is expected to be operational by in the first half of 2016. 

Table of Contents 

Raceland Rail Facility 

Our Raceland Rail Facility, located in Raceland, Louisiana, is a new crude oil unit train facility capable of unloading up to two unit trains per day. It will be connected to existing midstream infrastructure that provides direct pipeline access to the Louisiana refining markets. We expect it to be operational in the first half of 2016. 

Forty-two &#32;Consecutive Distribution Rate Increases 

We have increased our quarterly distribution rate for forty-two &#32;consecutive quarters. Thirty-seven &#32;of those quarterly increases have been 10% or greater as compared to the same quarter in the preceding year. On February 12, 2016 , we paid a quarterly cash distribution of $0.655 &#32;(or $2.62 &#32;on an annualized basis) per unit to unitholders of record as of January 29, 2016 , an increase of 2.3% &#32;from the distribution in the prior quarter, and an increase of 10.1% &#32;from the distribution in February 2015 . As in the past, future increases (if any) in our quarterly distribution rate will depend on our ability to execute critical components of our business strategy. 

Organizational Structure 

The following chart depicts our organizational structure at December 31, 2015 . 

Description of Segments and Related Assets 

We conduct our businesses through five operating segments: Offshore Pipeline Transportation, Onshore Pipeline Transportation, Refinery Services, Marine Transportation and Supply and Logistics. These segments are strategic business units that provide a variety of energy-related services. Financial information with respect to each of our segments can be found in Note 12 &#32;to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 

We have a diverse portfolio of customers, operations and assets, including pipelines, refinery-related plants, storage tanks and terminals, railcars, rail loading and unloading facilities, barges and other vessels, and trucks. Substantially all of our revenues are derived from providing services to refiners, integrated and large independent crude oil and natural gas companies, and large industrial and commercial enterprises. Our onshore-based operations occur upstream of, at, and downstream of refinery complexes. Upstream of refineries, we aggregate, purchase, gather and transport crude oil, which we sell to refiners. Within refineries, we provide services to assist in sulfur removal/balancing requirements. Downstream of refineries, we provide transportation services as well as market outlets for finished refined petroleum products and certain refining byproducts.

Capacity figures presented represent 100% of the design capacity; except for Eugene Island, which represents our net capacity in the undivided interest (23%) in that system. Ultimate capacities can vary primarily as a result of pressure requirements, installed pumps, related facilities and the viscosity of the crude oil actually moved. 

(2) 

Represents 100% owned lateral crude oil pipelines which, other than our Viosca Knoll Crude Oil Pipeline, ultimately flow into our other offshore crude oil pipelines (including CHOPS and Poseidon) and thus are excluded from main lines above. 

&#8226; 

Prior to the July 2015 acquisition of Enterprise's offshore pipeline and services business, we owned 50%, 28%, and 50% of CHOPS, Poseidon, and SEKCO, respectively. After the acquisition, we now own 100%, 64% and 100% of CHOPS, Poseidon and SEKCO, respectively. As our SEKCO volumes ultimately flow into Poseidon and thus are included within our Poseidon volume statistics, we have excluded them from our total for Offshore crude oil pipelines. 

&#8226; 

CHOPS. &#32;CHOPS is comprised of 24 - to 30 -inch diameter pipelines designed to deliver crude oil from fields in the Gulf of Mexico to refining markets along the Texas Gulf Coast via interconnections with refineries located in Port Arthur and Texas City, Texas. CHOPS also includes two &#32;strategically located multi-purpose offshore platforms. 

&#8226;

Other owners in Eugene Island include affiliates of Exxon Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Shell Oil Company. 

&#8226; 

SEKCO Pipeline. &#32;SEKCO is a deepwater pipeline serving the Lucius crude oil and natural gas field located in the southern Keathley Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico that was completed in June 2014. SEKCO has crude oil transportation agreements with seven Gulf of Mexico producers, including Anadarko U.S. Offshore Corporation, Freeport McMoran, Exxon Mobil Corporation, Eni Petroleum US LLC, Petrobras America, Plains Offshore Operations, Inc and Inpex Corporation. Those producers have dedicated their production from Lucius to that pipeline for the life of the reserves. We expect the SEKCO pipeline to also provide capacity for additional projects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in the future. SEKCO&#8217;s customers commenced paying fees to SEKCO upon completion of its pipeline and commenced crude oil deliveries to the SEKCO pipeline in the first quarter of 2015. 

&#8226;

&#8226; 

High Island. The High Island Offshore System (HIOS) transports natural gas from producing fields located in the Galveston, Garden Banks, West Cameron, High Island and East Breaks areas of the Gulf of Mexico to interconnects with the TC Offshore system and Kinetica Energy Express. HIOS includes 201 miles of pipeline and eight pipeline junction and service platforms that are regulated by the FERC. In addition, this system included the 86-mile East Breaks Gathering System, which connects HIOS to the Hoover-Diana deepwater platform located in Alaminos Canyon Block 25. 

&#8226; 

Matagorda Gathering System. &#32;Matagorda gathers natural gas from producing fields in the Matagorda Island area of the Gulf of Mexico for delivery to interconnecting onshore pipelines located in Matagorda and Calhoun counties in Texas. This system includes two pipeline junction platforms. 

&#8226; 

Falcon. &#32;The Falcon Natural Gas Pipeline transports natural gas processed at the Falcon Nest platform to a connection with the Central Texas Gathering System located at the Brazos Addition Block 133 platform. In November 2015, we received notice from producers regarding their intent to shut down the remaining producing wells as processed by the Falcon Nest Platform and shipped on the Falcon pipeline in 2016. Such pipeline and processing volumes have been historically insignificant to our offshore pipeline transportation segment.

This system includes three pipeline junction platforms. 

&#8226; 

Nautilus. The Nautilus System connects the Anaconda Gathering system and Manta Ray Offshore Gathering System to the Neptune natural gas processing plant located in south Louisiana. 

Offshore Hub Platforms 

Offshore Hub platforms are typically used to interconnect the offshore pipeline network; provide an efficient means to perform pipeline maintenance; locate compression, separation and production handling equipment and similar assets; and conduct drilling operations during the initial development phase of a crude oil and natural gas property. The results of operations from offshore platform services are primarily dependent upon the level of commodity charges and/or demand-type fees billable to customers. Revenue from commodity charges is based on a fee per unit of volume delivered to the platform (typically per MMcf of natural gas or per barrel of crude oil) multiplied by the total volume of each product delivered. Demand-type fees are similar to firm capacity reservation agreements for a pipeline in that they are charged to a customer regardless of the volume the customer actually delivers to the platform. Contracts for platform services often include both demand-type fees and commodity charges, but demand-type fees generally expire after a contractually fixed period of time and in some instances may be subject to cancellation by customers.

We proportionately consolidate our undivided interest in the Garden Banks 72 platform. 

&#8226; 

Independence Hub. The Independence Hub platform, which was acquired on July 24, 2015, is located in Mississippi Canyon Block 920. This platform processes natural gas gathered from deepwater production fields in the Atwater Valley, DeSoto Canyon, Lloyd Ridge and Mississippi Canyon areas of the Gulf of Mexico. In December 2015 we were informed by producers that the remaining producing wells connected to the platform have ceased. These wells will be shut down and we expect no further processing volumes. Such processing volumes have historically been insignificant to our offshore pipeline transportation segment. 

&#8226; 

Marco Polo. &#32;The Marco Polo platform, which is located in Green Canyon Block 608, processes crude oil and natural gas from production fields located in the South Green Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico. 

&#8226; 

Viosca Knoll. &#32;&#32;The Viosca Knoll 817 platform primarily serves as a base for gathering deepwater production in the Viosca Knoll area, including the Ram Powell development. 

&#8226; 

Garden Banks . The Garden Banks 72 platform serves as a base for gathering deepwater production from the Garden Banks area of the Gulf of Mexico. This platform also serves as a junction platform for the CHOPS and Poseidon pipeline systems. 

&#8226; 

East Cameron. &#32;The East Cameron 373 platform processes production from the Garden Banks and East Cameron areas of the Gulf of Mexico. 

&#8226; 

Falcon Nest. &#32;The falcon Nest platform, which is located in the Mustang Island East area of the Gulf of Mexico, processes natural gas from the Falcon field. In November 2015, we received notice from producers regarding their intent to shut down the remaining producing wells as processed by the Falcon Nest Platform and shipped on the Falcon pipeline in 2016. Such pipeline and processing volumes have been historically insignificant to our offshore pipeline transportation segment. 

Customers 

Due to the cost of finding, developing and producing crude oil properties in the deepwater regions of the Gulf of Mexico, most of our offshore pipeline customers are integrated crude oil companies and other large producers, and those producers desire to have longer-term arrangements ensuring that their production can access the markets. 

Usually, our offshore crude oil pipeline customers enter into buy-sell or other transportation arrangements, pursuant to which the pipeline acquires possession (and, sometimes, title) from its customer of the relevant production at a specified location (often a producer&#8217;s platform or at another interconnection) and redelivers possession (and title, if applicable) to such customer of an equivalent volume at one or more specified downstream locations (such as a refinery or an interconnection with another pipeline). Most of the production handled by our offshore pipelines is pursuant to life-of-reserve commitments that include both firm and interruptible capacity arrangements. 

Revenues from customers of our offshore pipeline transportation segment did not account for more than ten percent of our consolidated revenues. 

Competition 

The principal competition for our offshore pipelines includes other crude oil and natural gas pipeline systems as well as producers who may elect to build or utilize their own production handling facilities. Our offshore pipelines compete for new production on the basis of geographic proximity to the production, cost of connection, available capacity, transportation rates and access to onshore markets. In addition, the ability of our offshore pipelines to access future reserves will be subject to our ability, or the producers&#8217; ability, to fund the significant capital expenditures required to connect to the new production. In general, most of our offshore pipelines are not subject to regulatory rate-making authority, and the rates our offshore pipelines charge for services are dependent on the quality of the service required by the customer and the amount and term of the reserve commitment by that customer.

Onshore Pipeline Transportation 

Crude Oil Pipelines 

Onshore Crude Oil Pipelines 

Through the onshore pipeline systems and related assets we own and operate, we transport crude oil for our gathering and marketing operations and for other shippers pursuant to tariff rates regulated by FERC or the Railroad Commission of Texas (TXRRC). Accordingly, we offer transportation services to any shipper of crude oil, if the products tendered for transportation satisfy the conditions and specifications contained in the applicable tariff. Pipeline revenues are a function of the level of throughput and the particular point where the crude oil is injected into the pipeline and the delivery point. We also may earn revenue from pipeline loss allowance volumes. In exchange for bearing the risk of pipeline volumetric losses, we deduct volumetric pipeline loss allowances and crude oil quality deductions. Such allowances and deductions are offset by measurement gains and losses. When our actual volume losses are less than the related allowances and deductions, we recognize the difference as income and inventory available for sale valued at the market price for the crude oil. 

The margins from our onshore crude oil pipeline operations are generated by the difference between the sum of revenues from regulated published tariffs and pipeline loss allowance revenues and the fixed and variable costs of operating and maintaining our pipelines. 

We own and operate five &#32;onshore common carrier crude oil pipeline systems: the Texas System, the Jay System, the Mississippi System, the Louisiana System and the Wyoming System.

Our Wyoming pipeline system only had throughput for partial year during 2015, as it was placed into service in August 2015. 

&#8226; 

Texas System . Our Texas System transports crude oil from West Columbia to several delivery points near Houston, Texas. We earn a tariff for our transportation services, with the tariff rate per barrel of crude oil varying with the distance from injection point to delivery point. 

&#8226; 

Jay System . Our Jay System provides crude oil shippers access to refineries, pipelines and storage near Mobile, Alabama. That system also includes gathering connections to approximately 49 &#32;wells, additional crude oil storage capacity of 20,000 &#32;barrels in the field, an interconnect with our Walnut Hill rail facility, a delivery connection to a refinery in Alabama and an interconnection to another common carrier pipeline that delivers crude oil into Mississippi. 

&#8226; 

Mississippi System. &#32;Our Mississippi System provides shippers of crude oil in Mississippi indirect access to refineries, pipelines, storage, terminals and other crude oil infrastructure located in the Midwest. That system is adjacent to several crude oil fields that are in various phases of being produced through tertiary recovery strategy, including CO 2 &#32; 

Table of Contents 

injection and flooding. We provide transportation services on our Mississippi pipeline through an &#8220;incentive&#8221; tariff which provides that the average rate per barrel that we charge during any month decreases as our aggregate throughput for that month increases above specified thresholds. 

&#8226; 

Louisiana System . Our Louisiana System transports crude oil from Port Hudson to the Baton Rouge Scenic Station and continues downstream to the Anchorage Tank Farm servicing Exxon Mobil Corporation's Baton Rouge refinery. This refinery is one of the largest refinery complexes in North America, with more than 500,000 barrels per day of refining capacity. 

&#8226; 

Wyoming System. &#32;Our Wyoming System transports crude oil from receipt point stations in Campbell County and Converse County, Wyoming to our Pronghorn Rail Facility. This crude oil pipeline has an initial capacity of approximately 30,000 barrels per day and is supplied by truck volumes and third party gathering infrastructure in the Powder River Basin. This pipeline system became operational in the third quarter of 2015. We have also completed construction of a new 75 mile pipeline from our Pronghorn Rail Facility to a delivery point at our new Guernsey Station in Platte County, Wyoming. This Pronghorn to Guernsey pipeline will have an initial capacity of approximately 45,000 barrels per day and will allow for connectivity to additional downstream pipeline markets at Guernsey, including regional refineries and Cushing, Oklahoma via the Pony Express Pipeline. This pipeline became operational in early 2016. 

CO 2 &#32;Pipelines 

We transport CO 2 &#32;on our Free State pipeline for a fee and we lease our Northeast Jackson Dome Pipeline System, or NEJD System, for a fee.

Our Free State pipeline extends from CO 2 &#32;source fields near Jackson, Mississippi to crude oil fields in eastern Mississippi. We have a transportation services agreement through 2028 &#32;related to our Free State pipeline with a single shipper who has the right to use 100% of that pipeline's capacity. 

Our NEJD System transports CO 2 &#32;to tertiary crude oil recovery operations in southwest Mississippi. We have leased that pipeline to an affiliate of the shipper on our Free State pipeline through 2028 . Our NEJD lessee is responsible for all operations and maintenance on that system and will bear and assume substantially all obligations and liabilities with respect to that system. 

Customers 

Our customers on our Mississippi, Jay, Louisiana, Wyoming and Texas systems are primarily refiners and other large, energy companies. The majority of our onshore crude oil pipeline systems directly serve one or more refiners. 

Revenues from customers of our onshore pipeline transportation segment did not account for more than ten percent of our consolidated revenues. 

Competition 

Competition among common carrier pipelines is based primarily on posted tariffs, quality of customer service and proximity to refineries, production and connecting pipelines. We believe that high capital costs, tariff regulation and the cost of acquiring rights-of-way make it unlikely that other competing pipeline systems, comparable in size and scope to our onshore pipelines, will be built in the same geographic areas in the near future. In addition, as the majority of our onshore pipelines directly serve refineries we believe that these pipelines are not subject to the same competitive pressures as those tied directly to crude oil production. Additionally, the shipper on our Free State pipeline is required to use our Free State pipeline for any transportation of CO 2 within a dedicated area.

Refinery Services 

Our refinery services segment primarily (i) provides sulfur-extraction services to ten &#32;refining operations located mostly in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Utah, (ii) operates significant storage and transportation assets in relation to those services and (iii) sells NaHS and caustic soda to large industrial and commercial companies. Our refinery services primarily involve processing refiners' high sulfur (or &#8220;sour&#8221;) gas streams that the refineries have generated from crude oil processing operations. Our process applies our proprietary technology, which uses large quantities of caustic soda (the primary raw material used in our process) to act as a scrubbing agent under prescribed temperature and pressure to remove sulfur. Sulfur removal in a refinery is a key factor in optimizing production of refined products such as gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel. Our sulfur removal technology returns a clean (sulfur-free) hydrocarbon stream to the refinery for further processing into refined products, and simultaneously produces NaHS. The resultant NaHS constitutes the sole consideration we receive for our refinery services activities. A majority of the NaHS we receive is sourced from refineries owned and operated by large companies, including Phillips 66, CITGO, HollyFrontier, and Ergon. Our ten &#32;refinery services contracts have an average remaining life of three &#32;years. The timing upon which these contracts renew vary based upon location and terms specified within each specific contract. 

Our refinery services footprint includes NaHS and caustic soda terminals in the Gulf Coast, the Midwest, Montana, Utah, British Columbia and South America. In conjunction with our supply and logistics segment, we sell and deliver (via railcars, ships, barges and trucks) NaHS and caustic soda to over 150 &#32;customers. We believe we are one of the largest marketers of NaHS in North and South America. By minimizing our costs through utilization of our own logistical assets and leased storage sites, we believe we have a competitive advantage over other suppliers of NaHS. NaHS is used in the specialty chemicals business (plastic additives, dyes and personal care products), in pulp and paper business, and in connection with mining operations (nickel, gold and separating copper from molybdenum) as well as bauxite refining (aluminum). NaHS has also gained acceptance in environmental applications, including waste treatment programs requiring stabilization and reduction of heavy and toxic metals and flue gas scrubbing. Additionally, NaHS can be used for removing hair from hides at the beginning of the tannery process. 

Caustic soda is used in many of the same industries as NaHS. Many applications require both chemicals for use in the same process &#8211; for example, caustic soda can increase the yields in bauxite refining, pulp manufacturing and in the recovery of copper, gold and nickel. Caustic soda is also used as a cleaning agent (when combined with water and heated) for process equipment and storage tanks at refineries. 

Customers 

We provide on-site sulfur removal services utilizing NaHS units at ten &#32;refining locations. Even though some of our customers have elected to own the sulfur removal facilities located at their refineries, we operate those facilities. We market all of our NaHS as well as small amounts of NaHS for a handful of third parties. 

We sell our NaHS to customers in a variety of industries, with the largest customers involved in mining of base metals, primarily copper and molybdenum and the production of pulp and paper. We sell to customers in the copper mining industry in the western U.S., Canada and Mexico. We also export the NaHS to South America for sale to customers for mining in Peru and Chile. No sulfur removal customer or NaHS sales customer is responsible for more than ten percent of our consolidated revenues. Many of the industries that our NaHS customers are in (such as copper mining and the pulp and paper industry) participate in global markets for their products. As a result, this creates an indirect exposure for NaHS to global demand for the end products of our customers. Provisions in our service contracts with refiners allow us to adjust our sour gas processing rates (sulfur removal) to maintain a balance between NaHS supply and demand. 

We sell caustic soda to many of the same customers who purchase NaHS from us, including pulp and paper manufacturers and customers in the copper mining industry. We also supply caustic soda to some of the refineries in which we operate for use in cleaning processing equipment. 

Competition 

Our competitors for the supply of NaHS consist primarily of parties who produce NaHS as a by-product of processes involved with agricultural pesticide products, plastic additives and lubricant viscosity. Typically our competitors for the production of NaHS have only one manufacturing location and they do not have the logistical infrastructure that we have to supply customers. Our primary competitor has been AkzoNobel, a chemical manufacturing company that produces NaHS primarily in its pesticide operations. Our only competitors for sulfur removal services include refineries themselves through the use of their traditional sulfur removal processes. 

Our competitors for sales of caustic soda include manufacturers of caustic soda. These competitors supply caustic soda to our refinery services operations and support us in our third-party caustic soda sales. By utilizing our storage capabilities and having access to transportation assets, we sell caustic soda to third parties who gain efficiencies from acquiring both NaHS and caustic soda from one source.

We do not have any sulfur removal customer or NaHS sales customer that accounted for more than ten percent of our consolidated revenues. 

Marine Transportation 

Our marine transportation segment consists of (i) our inland marine fleet which transports heavy refined petroleum products, including asphalt, principally serving refineries and storage terminals along the Gulf Coast, Intracoastal Canal and western river systems of the U.S., principally along the Mississippi River and its tributaries, (ii) our offshore marine fleet which transports crude oil and refined petroleum products, principally serving refineries and storage terminals along the Gulf Coast, Eastern Seaboard, Great Lakes and Caribbean, and (iii) our modern double-hulled, Jones Act qualified tanker M/T American Phoenix which is currently under charter serving a customer along the Gulf Coast until 2020.

Customers 

Our marine customers are primarily refiners and some large energy companies. Our M/T American Phoenix is currently operating under a long term charter into 2020 with Phillips 66. We are a provider of transportation services for our customers and, in almost all cases, do not assume ownership of the products we transport. Marine transportation services are conducted under term contracts, some of which have renewal options for customers with whom we have traditionally had long-standing relationships, as well as spot contracts. Most have been our customers for many years and we generally anticipate continued relationships; however, there is no assurance that any individual contract will be renewed. 

A term contract is an agreement with a specific customer to transport cargo from a designated origin to a designated destination at a set rate (affreightment) or at a daily rate (time charter). The rate may or may not escalate during the term of the contract; however, the base rate generally remains constant and contracts often include escalation provisions to recover changes in specific costs such as fuel. Time charters, which insulate us from revenue fluctuations caused by weather and navigational delays and temporary market declines, represented over 90% of our marine transportation revenues under term contracts during 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . A spot contract is an agreement with a customer to move cargo from a specific origin to a designated destination for a rate negotiated at the time the cargo movement takes place. Spot contract rates are at the current &#8220;market&#8221; rate and are subject to market volatility. We typically maintain a higher mix of term contracts to spot contracts to provide a predictable revenue stream while maintaining spot market exposure to take advantage of new business opportunities and existing customers&#8217; peak demands. During 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , approximately 75% , 80% &#32;and 67% , respectively, of our marine transportation revenues were from term contracts and 25% , 20% &#32;and 33% , respectively, were from spot contracts. 

Revenues from customers of our marine transportation segment did not account for more than ten percent of our consolidated revenues. 

Competition 

Our competitors for the marine transportation of crude oil and heavy refined petroleum products are both midstream MLPs with marine transportation divisions, along with companies that are in the business of solely marine transportation operations. Competition among common marine carriers is based on a number of factors including proximity to production, refineries and connecting infrastructures, customer service, and transportation pricing. 

Our marine transportation segment also competes with other modes of transporting crude oil and heavy refined petroleum products, including pipeline, rail and trucking operations. Each such mode of transportation has different advantages and disadvantages, which often are fact and circumstance dependent. For example, without requiring longer-term economic commitments from shippers, marine and truck transportation can offer shippers much more flexibility to access numerous 

Table of Contents 

markets in multiple directions (i.e. pipelines tend to flow in a single direction and are geographically limited by their receipt and delivery points with other pipelines and facilities), and marine transportation offers shippers certain economies of scale as compared to truck transportation. In addition, due to construction costs and timing considerations, marine and truck transportation can provide cost effective and immediate services to a nascent producing region, whereas new pipelines can be very expensive and time consuming to construct and may require shippers to make longer-term economic commitments, such as take-or-pay commitments. On the other hand, in mature developed areas serviced by extensive, multi-directional pipelines, with extensive connections to various market, pipeline transportation may be preferred by shippers, especially if shippers are willing to make longer-term economic commitments, such as take-or-pay commitments. 

Supply and Logistics 

We provide supply and logistics services to Gulf Coast crude oil refineries and producers through a combination of purchasing, transporting, storing, blending and marketing of crude oil and refined products (primarily fuel oil, asphalt, and other heavy refined products). In connection with these services, we utilize our portfolio of logistical assets consisting of trucks, terminals, pipelines, railcars and barges. Our crude oil related services include gathering crude oil from producers at the wellhead, transporting crude oil by gathering line, truck, railcar and barge to pipeline injection points and marketing crude oil to refiners. Not unlike our crude oil operations, we also gather refined products from refineries, transport refined products via truck, railcar and barge, and sell refined products to customers in wholesale markets. For these services, we generate fee-based income and profit from the difference between the price at which we re-sell the crude oil and petroleum products less the price at which we purchase the crude oil and products, minus the associated costs of aggregation and transportation. 

Our crude oil supply and logistics operations are concentrated in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi and Wyoming. These operations help to ensure (among other things) a base supply source for our crude oil pipeline systems and our refinery customers while providing our producer customers with a market outlet for their production. We attempt to limit our commodity price risk in our supply and logistics segment by utilizing back-to-back purchases and sales, matching sale and purchase volumes on a monthly basis and hedging unsold volumes (primarily with NYMEX derivatives to offset the remaining price risk); however, we cannot completely eliminate commodity price risks. By utilizing our network of gathering lines, trucks, railcars, barges, terminals and pipelines, we are able to provide transportation related services to, and back-to-back gathering and marketing arrangements with, crude oil refiners and producers. Additionally, our crude oil gathering and marketing expertise and knowledge base provide us with an ability to capitalize on opportunities that arise from time to time in our market areas. We gather and transport approximately 70,000 &#32;barrels per day of crude oil, much of which is produced from large resource basins throughout Texas and the Gulf Coast. Given our network of terminals, we also have the ability to store crude oil during periods of contango (crude oil prices for future deliveries are higher than for current deliveries) for delivery in future months. When we purchase and store crude oil during periods of contango, we attempt to limit commodity price risk by simultaneously entering into a contract to sell the inventory in a future period, either with a counterparty or in the crude oil futures market. The most substantial component of the costs we incur while aggregating crude oil and petroleum products relates to operating our fleet of owned and leased trucks and railcars and paying transportation fees to our other segments and to third parties. 

Our refined products supply and logistics operations are concentrated in the Gulf Coast region, principally Texas and Louisiana, and in Wyoming. Through our footprint of owned and leased trucks, leased railcars, terminals and barges, we are able to provide Gulf Coast area refineries with transportation services as well as market outlets for certain heavy refined products. We primarily engage in the transportation and supply of fuel oil, asphalt, and other heavy refined products to our customers in wholesale markets. We have the ability from time to time to obtain various grades of refined products from our refinery customers and blend them to meet the requirements of our other market customers. However, because our refinery customers may choose to manufacture such refined products based on a number of economic and operating factors, we cannot predict the timing of contribution margins related to our blending services. 

We own five active crude oil rail loading/unloading facilities located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Walnut Hill, Florida; Wink, Texas; Natchez, Mississippi and Douglas, Wyoming which provide synergies to our existing asset footprint. We generally earn a fee for loading or unloading railcars at these facilities. 

As discussed in "Recent Developments and Growth Initiatives" above, in the fourth quarter of 2013, we began construction on a new crude oil unit train unloading facility in Raceland, Louisiana which will connect to existing midstream infrastructure that will provide direct pipeline access to refineries from the Baton Rouge area to the Gulf of Mexico. We expect this facility to be operational in the first half of 2016. 

Our industrial gases supply and logistics operations supply CO 2 &#32;to industrial customers under four &#32;contracts. We obtain our CO 2 &#32;supply pursuant to our volumetric production payments (also known as VPPs). Our existing customer contracts expire between 2015 &#32;and 2023 . We plan to exit our industrial gases operations as our existing contracts expire. 

Within our supply and logistics business segment, we employ many types of logistically flexible assets. These assets include 300 &#32;trucks, 400 &#32;trailers, 522 &#32;railcars, and terminals and other tankage with 3.3 million &#32;barrels of leased and owned 

Table of Contents 

storage capacity in multiple locations along the Gulf Coast, accessible by pipeline, truck, rail or barge. Our leased railcars consist of approximately 51 &#32;refined product railcars and 471 &#32;crude oil railcars. 

Customers 

Our supply and logistics business encompasses numerous refiners and hundreds of producers, for which we provide transportation related services, as well as gather from and market to crude oil and refined products. During 2015 , more than 10% of our consolidated revenues were generated from Shell. 

Competition 

In our crude oil supply and logistics operations, we compete with other midstream service providers and regional and local companies who may have significant market share in the respective areas in which they operate. In our refined products supply and logistics operations, we compete primarily with regional companies. See "Marine Transportation - Competition" for additional discussion of our competitors. Competitive factors in our supply and logistics business include price, relationships with customers, range and quality of services, knowledge of products and markets, availability of trade credit and capabilities of risk management systems. 

Geographic Segments 

All of our operations are in the U.S.. Additionally, we transport and sell NaHS to customers in South America and Canada. Revenues from customers in foreign countries totaled approximately $12 million , $18 million &#32;and $17 million &#32;in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. The remainder of our revenues was generated from sales to customers in the U.S. 

Credit Exposure 

Due to the nature of our operations, a disproportionate percentage of our trade receivables constitute obligations of refiners, large oil producers and integrated oil companies. This energy industry concentration has the potential to affect our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that our customers could be affected by similar changes in economic, industry or other conditions. However, we believe that the credit risk posed by this industry concentration is offset by the creditworthiness of our specific customer base in the context of our specific transactions as well as other factors, including the strategic nature of certain of our assets and relationships and our credit procedures. Our portfolio of accounts receivable is generally comprised in large part of obligations of refiners, integrated and large independent oil and natural gas producers, and mining and other industrial companies that purchase NaHS, most of which have stable payment histories. The credit risk related to contracts that are traded on the NYMEX is limited due to the daily cash settlement procedures and other NYMEX requirements. 

When we market crude oil, petroleum products and NaHS and provide transportation and other services, we must determine the amount, if any, of the line of credit we will extend to any given customer. We have established procedures to manage our credit exposure, including initial credit approvals, credit limits, collateral requirements and rights of offset. Letters of credit, prepayments and guarantees are also utilized to limit credit risk to ensure that our established credit criteria are met. We use similar procedures to manage our exposure to our customers in the onshore pipeline transportation, offshore pipeline transportation and marine transportation segments. 

As a result of our activities in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore, our largest customers include Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil Corporation, BP PLC, Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Total SA and Anadarko Petroleum Corporation. 

Employees 

To carry out our business activities, we employed approximately 1,400 &#32;employees at December 31, 2015 . None of our employees are represented by labor unions, and we believe that relationships with our employees are good. 

Regulation 

Pipeline Rate and Access Regulation 

The rates and the terms and conditions of service of our interstate common carrier pipeline operations are subject to regulation by FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act, or ICA. Under the ICA, rates must be &#8220;just and reasonable,&#8221; and must not be unduly discriminatory or confer any undue preference on any shipper. FERC regulations require that oil pipeline rates and terms and conditions of service for regulated pipelines be filed with FERC and posted publicly. 

Effective January 1, 1995, FERC promulgated rules simplifying and streamlining the ratemaking process. Previously established rates were &#8220;grandfathered,&#8221; limiting the challenges that could be made to existing tariff rates. Increases from grandfathered rates of interstate oil pipelines are currently regulated by FERC primarily through an index methodology, 

Table of Contents 

whereby a pipeline is allowed to change its rates based on the year-to-year change in an index. Under FERC regulations, we are able to change our rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods. Rate increases made pursuant to the index will be subject to protest, but such protests must show that the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the applicable pipeline&#8217;s increase in costs. 

In addition to the index methodology, FERC allows for rate changes under three other methods&#8212;cost-of-service, competitive market showings and agreements between shippers and the oil pipeline company that the rate is acceptable, or Settlement Rates. The pipeline tariff rates on our Mississippi, Jay, Louisiana, and Wyoming Systems are either rates that are subject to change under the index methodology or Settlement Rates. None of our tariffs have been subjected to a protest or complaint by any shipper or other interested party. 

Our offshore pipelines are neither interstate nor common carrier pipelines. However, these pipelines are subject to federal regulation under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which requires all pipelines operating on or across the outer continental shelf to provide nondiscriminatory transportation service. 

Our intrastate common carrier pipeline operations in Texas are subject to regulation by the Railroad Commission of Texas. The applicable Texas statutes require that pipeline rates and practices be reasonable and non-discriminatory and that pipeline rates provide a fair return on the aggregate value of the property of a common carrier, after providing reasonable allowance for depreciation and other factors and for reasonable operating expenses. Although no assurance can be given that the tariffs we charge would ultimately be upheld if challenged, we believe that the tariffs now in effect can be sustained. 

Our CO 2 &#32;pipelines are subject to regulation by the state agencies in the states in which they are located. 

Marine Regulations 

Maritime Law. The operation of towboats, tugboats, barges, vessels and marine equipment create maritime obligations involving property, personnel and cargo and are subject to regulation by the U.S. Coast Guard (&#8220;USCG&#8221;), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), federal laws, state laws and certain international conventions under General Maritime Law. These obligations can create risks which are varied and include, among other things, the risk of collision and allision, which may precipitate claims for personal injury, cargo, contract, pollution, third-party claims and property damages to vessels and facilities. Routine towage operations can also create risk of personal injury under the Jones Act and General Maritime Law, cargo claims involving the quality of a product and delivery, terminal claims, contractual claims and regulatory issues. Federal regulations also require that all tank barges engaged in the transportation of oil and petroleum in the U.S. be double hulled by 2015. All of our barges are double-hulled. 

All of our barges are inspected by the USCG and carry certificates of inspection. All of our towboats and tugboats are certificated by the USCG. Most of our vessels are built to American Bureau of Shipping (&#8220;ABS&#8221;) classification standards and in some instances are inspected periodically by ABS to maintain the vessels in class standards. The crews we employ aboard vessels, including captains, pilots, engineers, tankermen and ordinary seamen, are documented by the USCG. 

We are required by various governmental agencies to obtain licenses, certificates and permits for our vessels depending upon such factors as the cargo transported, the waters in which the vessels operate and other factors. We are of the opinion that our vessels have obtained and can maintain all required licenses, certificates and permits required by such governmental agencies for the foreseeable future. 

We believe that additional security and environmental related regulations may be imposed on the marine industry in the form of contingency planning requirements. Generally, we endorse the anticipated additional regulations and believe we are currently operating to standards at least equal to anticipated additional regulations. 

Jones Act: The Jones Act is a federal law that restricts maritime transportation between locations in the U.S. to vessels built and registered in the U.S. and owned and manned by U.S. citizens. We are responsible for monitoring the ownership of our subsidiary that engages in maritime transportation and for taking any remedial action necessary to insure that no violation of the Jones Act ownership restrictions occurs. Jones Act requirements significantly increase operating costs of U.S.-flag vessel operations compared to foreign-flag vessel operations. Further, the USCG and ABS maintain the most stringent regime of vessel inspection in the world, which tends to result in higher regulatory compliance costs for U.S.-flag operators than for owners of vessels registered under foreign flags or flags of convenience. The Jones Act and General Maritime Law also provide damage remedies for crew members injured in the service of the vessel arising from employer negligence or vessel unseaworthiness. 

Merchant Marine Act of 1936: The Merchant Marine Act of 1936 is a federal law providing that, upon proclamation by the president of the U.S. of a national emergency or a threat to the national security, the U.S. Secretary of Transportation may requisition or purchase any vessel or other watercraft owned by U.S. citizens (including us, provided that we are considered a U.S. citizen for this purpose). If one of our tow boats or barges were purchased or requisitioned by the U.S. government under this law, we would be entitled to be paid the fair market value of the vessel in the case of a purchase or, in the case of a requisition, the fair market value of charter hire. However, if one of our tow boats is requisitioned or purchased 

Table of Contents 

and its associated barge or barges are left idle, we would not be entitled to receive any compensation for the lost revenues resulting from the idled barges. We also would not be entitled to be compensated for any consequential damages we suffer as a result of the requisition or purchase of any of our tow boats or barges. 

Security Requirements: The Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 requires, among other things, submission to and approval by the USCG of vessel and waterfront facility security plans (&#8220;VSP&#8221;). Our VSP&#8217;s have been approved and we are operating in compliance with the plans for all of its vessels and that are subject to the requirements, whether engaged in domestic or foreign trade. 

Railcar Regulation 

We operate a number of railcar loading and unloading facilities and lease a significant number of railcars. Our railcar operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Railroad Administration of the DOT, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA"), as well as other federal and state regulatory agencies. We believe that our railcar operations are in substantial compliance with all existing federal, state and local regulations. 

DOT and OSHA have jurisdiction under several federal statutes over a number of safety and health aspects of rail operations, including the transportation of hazardous materials. State agencies regulate some aspects of rail operations with respect to health and safety in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law. 

Environmental Regulations 

General 

We are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may (i) require the acquisition of and compliance with permits for regulated activities, (ii) limit or prohibit operations on environmentally sensitive lands such as wetlands or wilderness areas or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species, (iii) result in capital expenditures to limit or prevent emissions or discharges, and (iv) place burdensome restrictions on our operations, including the management and disposal of wastes. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations, the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, typically increasing in stringency through time, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly operating restrictions, emission control, waste handling, disposal, cleanup and other environmental requirements have the potential to have a material adverse effect on our operations. While we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements would not materially affect us, there is no assurance that this trend will continue in the future. Revised or new additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

Hazardous Substances and Waste Handling 

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, or CERCLA, also known as the &#8220;Superfund&#8221; law, and analogous state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons. These persons include current owners and operators of the site where a release of hazardous substances occurred, prior owners or operators that owned or operated the site at the time of the release of hazardous substances, and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. We currently own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, properties that have been in use for many years with the gathering and transportation of hydrocarbons including crude oil and other activities that could cause an environmental impact. Persons deemed &#8220;responsible persons&#8221; under CERCLA may be subject to strict and joint and several liability for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination), for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs they incur from the responsible classes of persons. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. 

We also may incur liability under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or RCRA, and analogous state laws which impose requirements and also liability relating to the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. While RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. Certain petroleum production wastes are excluded from RCRA&#8217;s hazardous 

Table of Contents 

waste regulations. However, it is possible that these wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during our operations, will in the future be designated as &#8220;hazardous wastes&#8221; and, therefore, be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Indeed, legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress to re-categorize certain crude oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes as &#8220;hazardous wastes.&#8221; Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses. 

We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the requirements of CERCLA, RCRA and related state and local laws and regulations, and that we hold all necessary and up-to-date permits, registrations and other authorizations required under such laws and regulations. Although we believe that the current costs of managing our wastes as they are presently classified are reflected in our budget, any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes. 

Water 

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, also known as the &#8220;Clean Water Act,&#8221; and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants, including crude oil, into navigable waters of the U.S., as well as state waters. Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into these waters. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. These permits may require us to monitor and sample the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. The Oil Pollution Act, or the OPA, is the primary federal law for crude oil spill liability. The OPA contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to crude oil spills into waters of the U.S., including the requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs. Under the OPA, strict, joint and several liability may be imposed on &#8220;responsible parties&#8221; for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a release, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of crude oil to surface waters and natural resource damages, resulting from crude oil spills into or upon navigable waters, adjoining shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the U.S.. A &#8220;responsible party&#8221; includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility. 

Noncompliance with the Clean Water Act or the OPA may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties. We believe we are in material compliance with each of these requirements. 

Air Emissions 

The Federal Clean Air Act, or CAA, as amended, and analogous state and local laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants, and impose permit requirements and other obligations. Regulated emissions occur as a result of our operations, including the handling or storage of crude oil and other petroleum products. Both federal and state laws impose substantial penalties for violation of these applicable requirements. Accordingly, our failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations, revocation or suspension of necessary permits and, potentially, criminal enforcement actions. 

NEPA 

Under the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, a federal agency, commonly in conjunction with a current permittee or applicant, may be required to prepare an environmental assessment or a detailed environmental impact statement before taking any major action, including issuing a permit for a pipeline extension or addition that would affect the quality of the environment. Should an environmental impact statement or environmental assessment be required for any proposed pipeline extensions or additions, NEPA may prevent or delay construction or alter the proposed location, design or method of construction.

Climate Change 

In December 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases ("GHGs") present an endangerment to human health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the earth&#8217;s atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings served as a statutory prerequisite for EPA to adopt and implement regulations that would restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. The EPA also adopted two sets of related rules, one of which purports to regulate emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and the other of which regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources of emissions such as power plants or industrial facilities. The EPA finalized the motor vehicle rule in April 2010 and it became effective in July 2010. The EPA adopted the stationary source rule, also known as the "Tailoring Rule," in May 2010, and it became effective in January 2011. The tailoring rule established new GHG emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources must obtain permits under the PSD and Title V programs of the Clean Air Act. On June 23, 2014, in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA (&#8220;UARG v. EPA&#8221;), the Supreme Court held that stationary sources could not become subject to PSD or Title V permitting solely by reason of their GHG emissions. The Court ruled, however, that the EPA may require installation of best available control technology for GHG emissions at sources otherwise subject to the PSD and Title V programs. On December 19, 2014, EPA issued two memoranda providing initial guidance on GHG permitting requirements in response to the Court&#8217;s decision in UARG v. EPA. In its preliminary guidance, EPA indicated it would promulgate a rule to rescind any PSD permits issued under the portions of the Tailoring Rule that were vacated by the Court. In the interim, EPA issued a narrowly crafted &#8220;no action assurance&#8221; indicating it will exercise its enforcement discretion not to pursue enforcement of the terms and conditions relating to GHGs in an EPA-issued PSD permit, and for related terms and conditions in a Title V permit. On April 30, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule allowing permitting authorities to rescind PSD permits issued under the invalid regulations. 

Additionally, in September 2009, the EPA issued a final rule requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the U.S., beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010. Further, in November 2010, the EPA expanded its existing GHG reporting rule to include onshore and offshore crude oil and natural gas production and onshore processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities, which may include certain of our facilities, beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011. In October 2015, the EPA amended the GHG reporting rule to add the reporting of GHG emissions from gathering and boosting systems, completions and workovers of crude oil wells using hydraulic fracturing, and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines. As a result of this continued regulatory focus, future GHG regulations of the crude oil and natural gas industry remain a possibility. The EPA has continued to adopt GHG regulations of other industries, such as its August 2015 adoption of three separate, but related, actions to address carbon dioxide pollution from power plants, including final Carbon Pollution Standards for new, modified and reconstructed power plants, a final Clean Power Plan to cut carbon dioxide pollution from existing power plants, and a proposed federal plan to implement the Clean Power Plan emission guidelines. Upon publication of the Clean Power Plan on October 23, 2015, more than two dozen States as well as industry and labor groups challenged the Clean Power Plan in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. 

Further, the U.S. Congress has considered various proposals to reduce GHG emissions that may impose a carbon emissions tax, a cap-and-trade program or other programs aimed at carbon reduction, and almost half of the states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have already taken legal measures to reduce GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or GHG cap-and-trade programs. The net effect of this legislation is to impose increasing costs on the combustion of carbon-based fuels such as crude oil, refined petroleum products and natural gas. Our compliance with any future legislation or regulation of GHGs, if it occurs, may result in materially increased compliance and operating costs. 

In addition, in December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP-21) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake &#8220;ambitious efforts&#8221; to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of GHGs. The Agreement, if ratified, establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce GHG emissions. 

The effect on our operations of CAA regulations, legislative efforts or related implementation regulations that regulate or restrict emissions of GHGs in areas that we conduct business could adversely affect the demand for the products that we transport, store and distribute and, depending on the particular program adopted, could increase our costs to operate and maintain our facilities by requiring that we, among other things, measure and report our emissions, install new emission controls on our facilities, acquire allowances to authorize our GHG emissions, pay any taxes related to our GHG emissions and administer and manage a GHG emissions program. We may be unable to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged by our pipelines or other facilities, and any such recovery may depend on events beyond our control, including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the FERC or state regulatory agencies and the provisions of any final legislation or implementing regulations. Any GHG emissions legislation or regulatory programs applicable to power plants or refineries could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby adversely affect demand for the crude oil and natural gas that we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our 

Table of Contents 

business, financial condition and results of operations. It is not possible at this time to predict with any accuracy the structure or outcome of any future legislative or regulatory efforts to address such emissions or the eventual costs to us of compliance. 

Furthermore, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that GHG emissions from crude oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common law. As a result, private individuals may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury or property damages. While our business is not a party to this litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Safety and Security Regulations 

Our crude oil and CO 2 &#32;pipelines are subject to construction, installation, operation and safety regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation, or DOT, and various other federal, state and local agencies. Congress has enacted several pipeline safety acts over the years. Currently, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration under DOT administers pipeline safety requirements for natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines pursuant to detailed regulations set forth in 49 C.F.R. Parts 190 to 195. These regulations, among other things, address pipeline integrity management and pipeline operator qualification rules. Significant expenses could be incurred in the future if additional safety measures are required or if safety standards are raised and exceed the current pipeline control system capabilities. 

We are subject to the DOT Integrity Management, or IM, regulations, which require that we perform baseline assessments of all pipelines that could affect a High Consequence Area, or HCA, including certain populated areas and environmentally sensitive areas. After completing a baseline assessment, we continue to assess all pipelines at specified intervals and periodically evaluate the integrity of each pipeline segment that could affect a HCA. The integrity of these pipelines must be assessed by internal inspection, pressure test, or equivalent alternative new technology. 

The IM regulations required us to prepare an Integrity Management Plan, or IMP, that details the risk assessment factors, the overall risk rating for each segment of pipe, a schedule for completing the integrity assessment, the methods to assess pipeline integrity, and an explanation of the assessment methods selected. The regulations also require periodic review of HCA pipeline segments to ensure that adequate preventative and mitigative measures exist and that companies take prompt action to address pipeline integrity issues. No assurance can be given that the cost of testing and the required rehabilitation identified will not be material costs to us that may not be fully recoverable by tariff increases. 

We have developed a Risk Management Plan required by the EPA as part of our IMP. This plan is intended to minimize the offsite consequences of catastrophic spills. As part of this program, we have developed a mapping program. This mapping program identified HCAs and unusually sensitive areas along the pipeline right-of-ways in addition to mapping of shorelines to characterize the potential impact of a spill of crude oil on waterways. 

Our crude oil, refined products and refinery services operations are also subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes. Various other federal and state regulations require that we train all operations employees in Hazardous Communication ("HAZCOM") and disclose information about the hazardous materials used in our operations. Certain information must be reported to employees, government agencies and local citizens upon request. 

States are responsible for enforcing the federal regulations and more stringent state pipeline regulations and inspection with respect to hazardous liquids pipelines, including crude oil, natural gas and CO 2 &#32;pipelines. In practice, states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety. We do not anticipate any significant problems in complying with applicable state laws and regulations in those states in which we operate. 

Our trucking operations are licensed to perform both intrastate and interstate motor carrier services. As a motor carrier, we are subject to certain safety regulations issued by the DOT. The trucking regulations cover, among other things, driver operations, log book maintenance, truck manifest preparations, safety placard placement on the trucks and trailer vehicles, drug and alcohol testing, operation and equipment safety and many other aspects of truck operations. We are also subject to OSHA with respect to our trucking operations. 

The USCG regulates occupational health standards related to our marine operations. Shore-side operations are subject to the regulations of OSHA and comparable state statutes. The Maritime Transportation Security Act requires, among other things, submission to and approval of the USCG of vessel security plans. 

Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. Government has issued numerous warnings that energy assets could be the subject of future terrorist attacks. We have instituted security measures and procedures in conformity with federal guidance. We will institute, as appropriate, additional security measures or procedures indicated by the federal government. None of these measures or procedures should be construed as a guarantee that our assets are protected in the event of a terrorist attack.
