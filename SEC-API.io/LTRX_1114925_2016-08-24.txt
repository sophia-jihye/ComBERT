 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160;

Overview 

&#160;

Lantronix, Inc., which we refer to herein as the Company, Lantronix, we, our, or us, is a global provider of secure data access and management solutions for Internet of Things, or IoT, and information technology, or IT, assets. Our mission is to be the leading supplier of IoT gateways that enable companies to dramatically simplify the creation, deployment, and management of IoT projects while providing secure access to data for applications and people.

&#160;

With more than two decades of experience in creating robust machine to machine, or M2M, technologies, Lantronix is an innovator in enabling our customers to build new business models and realize the possibilities of the IoT. Our connectivity solutions are deployed inside millions of machines serving a wide range of industries, including data center, medical, security, industrial, transportation, retail, financial, environmental and government.

&#160;

We were incorporated in California in 1989 and reincorporated in Delaware in 2000.

&#160; &#160; 

Our Strategy 

&#160;

Today, more and more companies are seeking to connect their machines and electronic devices to the Internet. The growth in the IoT market is being driven by the growing importance of data, and the rapidly falling cost of sensors, connectivity, computing and storage. While the promise of IoT is great, many companies find designing and deploying an IoT project to be complex, costly and time-consuming.

&#160;

Our strategy is to leverage our networking and software development expertise to develop technologies that make it easier for our customers to participate in the IoT. We are primarily focused on the following market transitions:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; the increasing role of wireless networks for IoT communication; &#160;

&#160; &#183; the desire to remotely access, monitor and manage machines and IT infrastructure assets; and &#160;

&#160; &#183; the increasing importance of security in IoT deployments. &#160;

During the third quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, we kicked off a strategic initiative to better position us for growth in the IoT market. We plan to address this market with a combination of new hardware and software solutions that will combine our portfolio of robust and secure connectivity solutions with new advanced data access and management features for enterprise IoT assets. We expect that these new offerings will help companies to simplify and speed their IoT deployments, reduce complexity and assist them in creating value-added business models.

&#160;

Products and Solutions 

&#160; 

We organize our products and solutions into three product lines: IoT, IT Management and Other.

&#160; 

IoT 

&#160; 

Our IoT products typically connect to one or more existing machines and provide network connectivity and are designed to enhance the value and utility of machines by making the data from the machines available to users, systems and processes or by controlling their properties and features over the network.

&#160;

Our IoT products currently consist of IoT Gateways and IoT Building Blocks. IoT Gateways are designed to provide secure connectivity and the ability to add integrated device management and advanced data access features. IoT Building Blocks provide basic secure machine connectivity and unmanaged data access.

&#160;

Our IoT products may be embedded into new designs or attached to existing machines. Our IoT products include wired and wireless connections that enhance the value and utility of modern electronic systems and equipment by providing secure network connectivity, application hosting, protocol conversion, secure access for distributed IoT deployments and many other functions. Many of the products are offered with software tools intended to further decrease our customer&#8217;s time-to-market and increase their value add.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Most of our IoT products are pre-certified in a number of countries thereby significantly reducing our original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, customers&#8217; regulatory certification costs and accelerating their time to market.

&#160;

The following product families are included in our IoT product line: EDS, EDS-MD, PremierWave &#174; EN, PremierWave &#174; XC, PremierWave &#174; XN, UDS, WiPort &#174; , xDirect &#174; , xPico &#174; , xPico &#174; Wi-Fi, xPress &#8482;&#174; and XPort &#174; .

&#160; 

IT Management 

&#160; 

Today, organizations are managing an ever-increasing amount of devices and data on enterprise networks where 24/7 reliability is mission critical. Out-of-band management, or OOBM, is a technique that uses dedicated channels to manage critical network devices to ensure management connectivity (including the ability to determine the status of any network component) independent of the status of other in-band network components. Remote OOBM allows organizations to effectively manage their enterprise IT resources and at the same time, optimize their IT support resources.

&#160;

Our IT Management product line includes console management, power management, and keyboard video mouse , or KVM, products that provide remote OOBM access to IT and networking infrastructure deployed in test labs, data centers and server rooms.

&#160;

The following product families are included in our IT Management product line: SLB &#8482; , SLC &#8482; 8000, and Spider &#8482; . In addition, this product line includes vSLM&#8482;, a virtualized central management solution that simplifies secure administration of enterprise IT out-of-band devices and attached equipment through a standard web browser. vSLM is designed to operate with both our IT Management products and certain other manufacturers&#8217; IT infrastructure equipment.

&#160; 

Other 

&#160;

We categorize products that are non-focus or end-of-life as Other. Our Other product line includes non-focus products such as the xPrintServer &#174; , xSenso &#174; , and WiBox. In addition, our Other product line includes end-of-life versions of our MatchPort &#174; , SLC &#8482; , SLP &#8482; , and xPress Pro product families &#160; 

&#160; 

Net Revenue by Product Line 

&#160;

We have one operating and reportable business segment. A summary of our net revenue by product line is found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Item 7 of this Report, which is incorporated herein by reference. A discussion of factors potentially affecting our net revenue and other operating results is set forth in &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A of this Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.

&#160;

Sales Cycle 

&#160;

Our embedded IoT solutions are typically sold to OEMs, original design manufacturers, or ODMs, contract manufacturers and distributors. OEMs design and sell products under their own brand that are either manufactured by the OEM in-house or by third-party contract manufacturers. ODMs design and manufacture products for third parties, which then sell those products under their own brand. The design cycles using our embedded solutions typically range from 12 to 24 months and can generate revenue for the entire life-cycle of an end-user&#8217;s product.

&#160;

Our IT Management and device IoT Solutions are typically sold through value added resellers, or VARs, systems integrators, distributors, e-tailers and, to a lesser extent, OEMs. Sales are often project-based and may result in significant quarterly fluctuations.

&#160; 

Sales Channels 

&#160; 

Distributors 

&#160;

A majority of our sales are made through distributors. Distributors resell our products to a wide variety of resellers and end customers including OEMs, ODMs, VARs, systems integrators, consumers, online retailers, IT resellers, corporate customers and government entities.

&#160;

Resellers 

&#160;

Our products are often sold by industry-specific system integrators and VARs, who often obtain our products from our distributors. Additionally, our products are sold by direct market resellers such as CDW, ProVantage, and Amazon.com.
