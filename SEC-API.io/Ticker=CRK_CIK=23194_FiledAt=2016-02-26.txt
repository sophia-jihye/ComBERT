Strengths 

&#160;

High Quality Properties. &#160; Our operations are focused in two operating areas: East Texas/North Louisiana and South Texas. Our properties have an average reserve life of approximately 9.4 years and have extensive development and exploration potential. Our properties in the East Texas/North Louisiana region, which are primarily prospective for natural gas, include 80,657 acres (68,331 net to us) in the Haynesville or Bossier shale formations. Advances in drilling and completion technology have allowed us to increase the reserves recovered through longer horizontal lateral length and substantially larger well stimulation. As a result of the improved economic returns that we achieved with our Haynesville shale natural gas wells, and the continuing decline of oil prices, our 2015 drilling activity primarily targeted natural gas in the Haynesville shale. In our South Texas region, our Eagleville field includes 30,219 acres (22,246 net to us) located in the oil window of the Eagle Ford shale. Our oil development program in the Eagleville field in 2015 was limited to the completion of wells that were drilled in 2014. In addition to our acreage in the Eagle Ford shale, we have 87,746 acres (81,537 net to us) in Mississippi and Louisiana that are prospective for oil development in the Tuscaloosa Marine shale. We did not drill on these properties in 2015 due to the low oil prices throughout the year, and we have extended lease terms on key acreage in this area to hold this oil acreage until prices support further development. 

&#160;

Successful Exploration and Development Program. In 2015, we spent $227.7 million on exploration and development activities, of which $196.4 million was for drilling and completing wells. We drilled 15 wells (13.6 net to us) and completed 23 wells (19.6 net to us). We also spent $13.7 million in 2015 on leasehold costs and $31.3 million for other development costs. Of our 2015 capital expenditures, 48% was directed towards natural gas projects. In 2015, our natural gas drilling program grew our natural gas production by 20% over 2014 and increased our proved natural gas reserves by 167 Bcf. 

&#160;

&#160;

Efficient Operator. We operated 98 % of our proved reserve base as of December 31, 201 5 . As the operator, we are better able to control operating costs, the timin g and plans for future development, the level of drilling and lifting costs and the marketing of production. As an operator, we receive reimbursements for overhead from other working interest owners, which reduces our general and administrative expenses. 

&#160;

Successful Acquisitions. &#160; We have had significant growth over the years as a result of our acquisition activity. In recent years, we have focused primarily on acquiring undrilled acreage rather than producing properties. We apply strict economic and reserve risk criteria in evaluating acquisitions. Over the past 25 years, we have added 1.1 Tcfe of proved oil and natural gas reserves from 38 acquisitions of producing oil and gas properties at an average cost of $1.17 per Mcfe. Our application of strict economic and reserve risk criteria have enabled us to successfully evaluate and integrate acquisitions. 

&#160;

Business Strategy 

&#160;

Pursue Exploration Opportunities. Each year, we conduct exploration activities to grow our reserve base and to replace our production. In 2015, we focused on natural gas development as our natural gas projects in the Haynesville and Bossier shales provide us the highest returns within our opportunity set. We deferred further development of our oil properties under the low oil price environment. 

&#160;

In 2015, our Haynesville shale properties were the primary focus of our drilling activity. We have 80,657 acres (68,331 net to us) in East Texas and North Louisiana with Haynesville or Bossier shale natural gas potential. In January 2016, we completed an acreage swap with another operator which increased our Haynesville shale properties by 3,637 net acres in DeSoto Parish, Louisiana. Our 2015 drilling program focused on natural gas development based on a new well design that significantly enhanced the economics of these wells. We spent $109.9 million to drill 10 wells (9.6 net to us) on our Haynesville and Bossier shale properties and to recomplete two wells using the new enhanced completion design. We expect to spend approximately $89.9 million in 2016 to drill nine horizontal natural gas wells on our Haynesville shale properties.

&#160;

From 2010 through 2015, we spent approximately $169.5 million leasing acreage in South Texas, in the oil window of the Eagle Ford shale formation. We have in place a joint venture which allows us to accelerate the development of this field. Our joint venture partner participates for a one-third interest in the wells that we drill in exchange for paying $25,000 per net acre that is earned by its participation. Through December 31, 2015, we have drilled 196 wells (138.2 net to us) in our Eagleville field. Our joint venture partner participated in 144 of these wells and contributed $86.0 million through 2015 for acreage and an additional $9.1 million to reimburse us for a portion of common production facilities. During 2015, we completed four oil wells that were drilled on these properties during 2014, but we did not drill any new wells in 2015 and we are not currently anticipating any drilling activity on our oil properties until oil prices improve. In January 2016, we exchanged 2,547 net acres in Atascosa County, Texas for Haynesville shale acreage.

&#160;

We divested all of our acreage in or near Burleson County, Texas in 2015 which were prospective for oil in the Eagle Ford shale formation. Cash proceeds realized from this sale were $102.5 million. We spent $69.1 million to drill four wells (4.0 net to us) and to complete eight wells (7.8 net to us) on this acreage in 2015 prior to their sale.

&#160;

&#160;

Through the end of 2015 we spent $ 94.2 million to acquire 87,746 acres ( 81,537 net to us) in Louisiana and Mississippi which are prospective for oil in the Tuscaloo sa Marine shale. During 2014 we drilled our first well on this acreage but did not drill any wells in 2015 due to the decline in oil prices . We are not currently anticipating any drilling activity on this acreage during 2016 until oil price s improve . Th e lease terms on our key acreage in this area were modified during 2015 to allow us to defer drilling activity until 2018 . 

&#160;

Enhance Liquidity and Reduce Leverage. With the substantial decline in oil and natural gas prices we experienced in 2015, which have continued into 2016, we have taken several steps to enhance liquidity, reduce corporate commitments and ultimately reduce our leverage. In late 2014 and into 2015 we reduced our drilling activity and released three operated drilling rigs. We substantially reduced our capital spending in 2015 and are further reducing activity in 2016 as oil and natural gas prices have declined further. In March 2015, we refinanced our bank revolving credit facility with $700 million of senior secured notes which mature in 2020. The bank credit facility was subject to a semi-annual borrowing base which was based on current oil and gas prices. During 2015, we repurchased $129.5 million in principal amount of our senior notes for an aggregate purchase price of $42.7 million. The repurchases reduced our annual interest expense by $11.9 million. In February 2016 we repurchased an additional $40.0 million in principal amount of our senior notes through the issuance of 4.6 million shares of our common stock. We plan to continue pursuing strategies to allow us to retire additional debt in 2016. 

&#160;

Exploit Existing Reserves. We seek to maximize the value of our oil and gas properties by increasing production and recoverable reserves through development drilling and workover, recompletion and exploitation activities. We utilize advanced industry technology, including 3-D seismic data, horizontal drilling, enhanced logging tools, and formation stimulation techniques. We spent $4.6 million in 2015 to refrac two of our producing horizontal wells in the Haynesville shale. This pilot program was successful in enhancing production from these wells by 577%. The success of this program supports a future program to re-stimulate many of our 186 producing natural gas shale wells and may also have applicability to our 196 horizontal oil shale wells when well economics support these investments. 

&#160;

Maintain Flexible Capital Expenditure Budget. The timing of most of our capital expenditures is discretionary because we have not made any significant long-term capital expenditure commitments. We operate most of the drilling projects in which we participate. Consequently, we have a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of such expenditures according to market conditions. For 2016 we have one operated drilling rig under contract and plan to drill up to nine wells. We expect to spend approximately $98.0 million in 2016 on our development and exploration projects. We do not have any contractual requirements to drill more than three wells and could reduce the number of wells drilled in 2016 based on industry conditions. 

&#160;

Acquire High Quality Properties at Attractive Costs. Historically, we have had a successful track record of increasing our oil and natural gas reserves through opportunistic acquisitions. Over the past 25 years, we have added 1.1 Tcfe of proved oil and natural gas reserves from 38 acquisitions of producing oil and gas properties at a total cost of $1.3 billion, or $1.17 per Mcfe. In evaluating acquisitions, we apply strict economic and reserve risk criteria. We target properties in our core operating areas with established production and low operating costs that also have potential opportunities to increase production and reserves through exploration and exploitation activities.

Oil is converted to natural gas equivalents by using a conversion factor of one barrel of oil for six Mcf of natural gas based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil to natural gas, which is not indicative of oil and natural gas prices. 

East Texas/North Louisiana Region 

Approximately 79%, or 495.4 Bcfe of our proved reserves are located in East Texas and North Louisiana where we own interests in 921 producing wells (573.0 net to us) in 28 field areas. We operate 644 of these wells. The largest of our fields in this region are the Logansport, Beckville, Toledo Bend, Waskom and Blocker fields. Production from this region averaged 107 MMcf of natural gas per day and 158 barrels of oil per day during 2015 or 108 MMcfe per day. Most of the reserves in this area produce from the upper Jurassic aged Haynesville or Bossier shale or Cotton Valley formations and the Cretaceous aged Travis Peak/Hosston formation. In 2015, we spent $109.9 million drilling ten wells (9.6 net to us), $1.4 million on other development and $0.8 million on leasehold costs in this region. We plan to spend approximately $89.9 million in 2016 to drill nine Haynesville/Bossier shale natural gas wells. 

Logansport 

The Logansport field located in DeSoto Parish, Louisiana primarily produces from the Haynesville and Bossier shale formations at a depth of 11,100 to 11,500 feet and from multiple sands in the Cotton Valley and Hosston formations at an average depth of 8,000 feet. Our proved reserves of 422.6 Bcfe in the Logansport field represent approximately 68% of our proved reserves. We own interests in 250 wells (168.7 net to us) and operate 182 of these wells in this field. In 2015 we drilled nine wells (8.6 net to us) in the Logansport field. Our 2016 drilling program will be focused primarily on drilling additional horizontal wells in Logansport targeting the Haynesville shale formation each with a planned lateral length of 7,500 to 10,000 feet. 

&#160;

Beckville 

The Beckville field, located in Panola and Rusk Counties, Texas, has estimated proved reserves of 24.6 Bcfe which represents approximately 4% of our proved reserves. We operate 187 wells in this field and own interests in 72 additional wells for a total of 259 wells (156.2 net to us). The Beckville field produces primarily from the Cotton Valley formation at depths ranging from 9,000 to 10,000 feet. The field is also prospective for future Haynesville shale development. 

Toledo Bend 

The Toledo Bend field, located in DeSoto and Sabine Parishes in Louisiana, is productive in the Haynesville shale from 11,400 to 11,800 feet and in the Bossier shale from 10,880 to 11,300 feet. Our proved reserves of 18.8 Bcfe in the Toledo Bend field represent approximately 3% of our reserves. We own interests in 76 producing wells (39.3 net to us) and operate 41 of these wells in this field. During 2015 we drilled one well (0.9 net to us) in the Toledo Bend field.

Waskom

The Waskom field, located in Harrison and Panola Counties in Texas, represents approximately 1% (8.9 Bcfe) of our proved reserves. We own interests in 59 wells (35.5 net to us) and operate 43 wells in this field. The Waskom field produces from the Cotton Valley formation at depths ranging from 9,000 to 10,000 feet and from the Haynesville shale formation at depths of 10,800 to 10,900 feet. 

Blocker 

Our proved reserves of 6.9 Bcfe in the Blocker field located in Harrison County, Texas represent approximately 1% of our proved reserves. We own interests in 74 wells (68.4 net to us) and operate 69 of these wells. Most of this production is from the Cotton Valley formation between 8,600 and 10,150 feet and the Haynesville shale formation between 11,100 and 11,450 feet. 

South Texas Region 

Approximately 19%, or 20.0 MMBOE (119.9 Bcfe), of our proved reserves are located in South Texas, where we own interests in 322 producing wells (208.2 net to us). We own interests in 13 field areas in the region, the largest of which are the Eagleville, Fandango, Rosita, Javelina and Las Hermanitas fields. Net daily production rates from this region averaged 8,105 barrels of oil and 20 MMcf of natural gas during 2015 or 11,485 BOE per day. We have no current plans to drill or recomplete wells in South Texas during 2016 due to the continued low oil price environment. 

Eagleville 

We have 30,219 acres (22,246 net to us) in McMullen, Atascosa, Frio, La Salle, Karnes and Wilson Counties which comprise our Eagleville field. The Eagle Ford shale is found between 7,500 feet and 11,500 feet across our acreage position. At December 31, 2015 we had 196 wells (138.1 net to us) producing in the Eagleville field. Our proved reserves in this field are estimated to be 10.2 MMBOE (61.3 Bcfe) (85% oil) and represent 10% of our total proved reserves. We spent $17.4 million in 2015 to complete four oil wells (4.0 net to us) and $24.2 million for other development activity in Eagleville.

Fandango 

We own interests in 17 wells (17.0 net to us) in the Fandango field located in Zapata County, Texas. We operate all of these wells which produce from the Wilcox formation at depths from approximately 13,000 to 18,000 feet. Our proved reserves of 27.5 Bcfe in this field represent approximately 4% of our total proved reserves. 

&#160;

Rosita 

We own interests in 24 wells (13.2 net to us) in the Rosita field, located in Duval County, Texas. We operate 23 of these wells which produce from the Wilcox formation at depths from approximately 9,300 to 17,000 feet. Our proved reserves of 20.3 Bcfe in this field represent approximately 3% of our total proved reserves. 

Javelina 

We own interests in and operate 17 wells (17.0 net to us) in the Javelina field in Hidalgo County in South Texas. These wells produce primarily from the Vicksburg formation at a depth of approximately 10,900 to 12,500 feet. Proved reserves attributable to our interests in the Javelina field are 4.5 Bcfe, which represents approximately 1% of our total proved reserves. 

Las Hermanitas 

We own interests in and operate 11 natural gas wells (11.0 net to us) in the Las Hermanitas field, located in Duval County, Texas. These wells produce from the Wilcox formation at depths from approximately 11,400 to 11,800 feet. Our proved reserves of 3.2 Bcfe in this field represent approximately 1% of our total proved reserves. 

Other Regions 

Approximately 2%, or 9.6 Bcfe, of our proved reserves are in other regions, primarily in New Mexico and the Mid-Continent region. We also have a large acreage position in Mississippi and Louisiana in the emerging Tuscaloosa Marine shale play. We own interests in 332 producing wells (78.5 net to us) in 15 fields within these regions. Net daily production from our other regions during 2015 totaled 3 MMcf of natural gas and 199 barrels of oil or 5 MMcfe per day.

Major Property Acquisitions 

As a result of our acquisitions of producing oil and gas properties, we have added 1.1 Tcfe of proved oil and natural gas reserves over the past 25 years. In recent years we have focused more on acreage acquisition and drilling for reserve growth and have not completed any significant acquisitions of producing properties.

Proved reserves that are attributable to existing producing wells are primarily determined using decline curve analysis and rate transient analysis, which incorporates the principles of hydrocarbon flow. Proved reserves attributable to producing wells with limited production history and for undeveloped locations are estimated using performance from analogous wells in the surrounding area and geologic data to assess the reservoir continuity. Technologies relied on to establish reasonable certainty of economic producibility include, but are not limited to, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, geologic maps and available production data, seismic data and well test data. 

There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves. Oil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimate. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. 

The average prices that we realized from sales of oil and natural gas and lifting costs including severance and ad valorem taxes and transportation costs, for each of the last three fiscal years were as follows:

Reserves may be classified as proved undeveloped if there is a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered, and they are scheduled to be drilled within five years of their initial inclusion as proved reserves, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time. In connection with estimating proved undeveloped reserves for our December 31, 201 5 reserve report, reserves on undrilled acreage were limited to those that are reasonably certain of production when drilled where we can verify the continuity of the reservoir. At December 31, 2015 , we also limited our estimates of proved undeveloped reserves to wells that we currently plan to drill and where we have adequate capital resources to enable us to drill them. Using empirical evidence, we utilize control points and sample sizes to show continuity in the reservoir. We reflect changes to undeveloped reserves that occur in the same field as revisions to the extent that proved undeveloped location s are revised due to changes in future development plans, including changes to proposed lateral lengths, development spacing and timing of development. 

As of December 31, 2015, our proved undeveloped reserves were comprised of 258.5 Bcf of natural gas. All of our proved undeveloped reserves are associated with our Haynesville and Bossier shale properties where our drilling program in 2015 was focused. Our natural gas proved undeveloped reserves increased by 87.8 Bcf during 2015. This increase was primarily related to the reserve additions of 135.6 Bcf of natural gas related to our Haynesville and Bossier shale drilling program which were partially offset by undeveloped reserves converted to developed reserves of 55.1 Bcf. In 2015, we focused on drilling natural gas wells due to the weak oil prices. Seven of the Haynesville shale wells we drilled in 2015 resulted in conversions of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed producing reserves at December 31, 2015. Our oil proved undeveloped reserves decreased by 4.6 MMBbls during 2015. This decrease was primarily due to converting 0.1 MMBbls of our proved undeveloped oil reserves to developed in 2015, divestiture of 2.4 MMBbls and price related downward revisions of 2.1 MMBbls attributable to proved undrilled locations that are no longer economic to drill.

As of December 31, 2014, our proved undeveloped reserves included 4.6 MMBbls of oil and 170.7 Bcf of natural gas, for a total of 198.3 Bcfe of undeveloped reserves. All of our undeveloped oil reserves and 3 Bcf of natural gas of our proved undeveloped reserves were associated with our Eagle Ford shale properties in South and East Texas. The proved undeveloped reserves associated with our Haynesville and Bossier shale properties represented approximately 153 Bcf of our proved undeveloped natural gas reserves at December 31, 2014. The remaining proved undeveloped natural gas reserves are primarily associated with developing reserves in our Wilcox and Vicksburg reservoirs in South Texas. In 2014, we focused on drilling our oil properties. 51 of the Eagle Ford shale wells we drilled in 2014 resulted in conversions of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed producing reserves at December 31, 2014. Our proved undeveloped oil reserves decreased by 3.5 MMBbls during 2014. This decrease was primarily due to converting 4.7 MMBbls of our proved undeveloped oil reserves to developed in 2014, new reserves additions of 2.6 MMBbls and price and other revisions which decreased our reserves by 1.4 MMBbls. Our proved undeveloped natural gas reserves increased by 62 Bcf at December 31, 2014 as compared with December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily related to proved undeveloped reserve additions of 76 Bcf of natural gas associated with our 2015 natural gas drilling program, which were partially offset by undeveloped reserves converted to developed reserves of 2 Bcf and price and other revisions which reduced our reserves by 12 Bcfe.

Our estimated future capital costs to develop proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2015 of $270.0 million decreased by $193.0 million from our estimated future capital costs of $463.0 million as of December 31, 2014. During 2015, we incurred approximately $84.7 million to develop proved undeveloped reserves primarily in our Haynesville and Bossier shale properties. Our Haynesville and Bossier shale natural gas focused future capital expenditures increased by $76.0 million, our Eagle Ford shale oil focused future capital expenditures decreased by $235.4 million and our other properties future capital expenditures decreased by $33.6 million.

Our estimated future capital costs to develop proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2014 of $463.0 million decreased by $80.2 million from our estimated future capital costs of $543.2 million as of December 31, 2013. We incurred approximately $211.1 million during 2014 to develop proved undeveloped reserves, all of which was in our Eagle Ford shale properties. Our oil focused future capital expenditures decreased by $122.2 million and our natural gas focused capital expenditures increased by $41.9 million.

The estimates of our oil and natural gas reserves were determined by Lee Keeling and Associates, Inc. ("Lee Keeling"), an independent petroleum engineering firm. Lee Keeling has been providing consulting engineering and geological services for over fifty years. Lee Keeling's professional staff is comprised of qualified petroleum engineers who are experienced in all productive areas of the United States. The technical person responsible for review of our reserve estimates at Lee Keeling meets the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Lee Keeling does not own any interests in our properties and is not employed on a contingent fee basis. 

We have established, and maintain, internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that the estimates of proved reserves are computed and reported in accordance with rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. These internal controls include documented process workflows, employing qualified professional engineering and geological personnel, and on-going education for personnel involved in our reserves estimation process. Our internal audit function routinely tests our processes and controls. Inputs to our reserves estimation process, which we provide to Lee Keeling for use in their reserves evaluation, are based upon our historical results for production history, oil and natural gas prices, lifting and development costs, ownership interests and other required data. Our Reservoir Engineering Department, comprised of qualified petroleum engineers and technical support staff, works with our 

&#160;

operating, accounting, land and marketing departments in order to accumulate the information required for the reserves estimation process. Our Vice President of Reservoir Engineering is the primary person in charge of overseeing our reserve estimates and our Reservoir Engineering Department. He has a B . S . Degree and a Masters Degree in Petroleum Engineering, is a Registered Professional Engineer and has over thirty-five years of experience in various technical roles within the oil and gas industry. During the reserves estimation process our petroleum engineers work with Lee Keeling to ensure that all data we provid e is properly reflected in the final reserves estimates and they consult with Lee Keeling throughout the reserves estimation process on technical questions regarding the reserve estimates. We also regularly communicate with Lee Keeling throughout the year about our operations and the potential impact of operational changes and events on our reserve estimates. 

We did not provide estimates of total proved oil and natural gas reserves during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 or 2015 to any federal authority or agency, other than the SEC.

We operate 952 of the 1,575 producing wells presented in the above table. As of December 31, 201 5 , we owned interests in 14 wells containing multiple completions, which means that a well is producing from more than one completed zone. Wells with more than one completion are reflected as one well in the table above. 

Acreage 

The following table summarizes our developed and undeveloped leasehold acreage at December 31, 2015, all of which is onshore in the continental United States. We have excluded acreage in which our interest is limited to a royalty or overriding royalty interest.

Title to our oil and natural gas properties is subject to royalty, overriding royalty, carried and other similar interests and contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry, liens incident to operating agreements and for current taxes not yet due and other minor encumbrances. All of our oil and natural gas properties are pledged as collateral under our bank credit facility. As is customary in the oil and gas industry, we are generally able to retain our ownership interest in undeveloped acreage by production of existing wells, by drilling activity which establishes commercial reserves sufficient to maintain the lease, by payment of delay rentals or by the exercise of contractual extension rights. 

Markets and Customers 

The market for our production of oil and natural gas depends on factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas, the proximity and capacity of natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities, demand for oil and natural gas, the marketing of competitive fuels and the effects of state and federal regulation. The oil and gas industry also competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers. 

Our oil production is currently sold under short-term contracts with a duration of six months or less. The contracts require the purchasers to purchase the amount of oil production that is available at prices tied to the spot oil markets. Our natural gas production is primarily sold under contracts with various terms and priced on first of the month index prices or on daily spot market prices. Approximately 50% of our 2015 natural gas sales were priced utilizing first of the month index prices and approximately 50% were priced utilizing daily spot prices. BP Energy Company and its subsidiaries and Shell Oil Company and its subsidiaries accounted for 52% and 25%, respectively, of our total 2015 sales. The loss of either of these customers would not have a material adverse effect on us as there is an available market for our crude oil and natural gas production from other purchasers. 

&#160;

We have entered into longer term marketing arrangements to ensure that we have adequate transportation to get our natural gas production in North Louisiana to the markets. As an alternative to constructing our own gathering and treating facilities, we have entered into a vari ety of gathering and treating agreements with midstream companies to transport our natural gas to the long-haul natural gas pipelines. We have entered into certain agreements with a major natural gas marketing company to provide us with firm transportation for 15 ,000 MMBtu per day for our North Louisiana natural gas production on the long-haul pipelines. These agreements expire from 201 6 to 2019. To the extent we are not able to deliver the contracted natural gas volumes, we may be responsible for the trans portation costs. Our production available to deliver under these agreements in North Louisiana is expected to exceed the firm transportation arrangements we have in place. In addition, the marketing company managing the firm transportation is required to u se reasonable efforts to supplement our deliveries should we have a shortfall during the term of the agreements. 

Competition 

The oil and gas industry is highly competitive. Competitors include major oil companies, other independent energy companies and individual producers and operators, many of which have financial resources, personnel and facilities substantially greater than we do. We face intense competition for the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties and leases for oil and gas exploration. 

Regulation 

General. Various aspects of our oil and natural gas operations are subject to extensive and continually changing regulation, as legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion. Numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue, and have issued, rules and regulations binding upon the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or "FERC", regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938, or "NGA", and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, or "NGPA". In 1989, however, Congress enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, which removed all remaining price and nonprice controls affecting all "first sales" of natural gas, effective January 1, 1993, subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect. While sales by producers of natural gas and all sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices, in the future Congress could reenact price controls or enact other legislation with detrimental impact on many aspects of our business. Under the provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the "2005 Act"), the NGA has been amended to prohibit any form of market manipulation with the purchase or sale of natural gas, and the FERC has issued new regulations that are intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency. The 2005 Act has also significantly increased the penalties for violations of the NGA. The FERC has issued Order No. 704 et al. which requires a market participant to make an annual filing if it has sales or purchases equal to or greater than 2.2 million MMBtu in the reporting year to facilitate price transparency. 

Regulation and transportation of natural gas. Our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The price and terms for access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive regulation. The FERC requires interstate pipelines to provide open-access transportation on a not unduly discriminatory basis for similarly situated shippers. The FERC frequently reviews and modifies its regulations regarding the transportation of natural gas, with the stated goal of fostering competition within the natural gas industry. 

&#160;

Intrastate natural gas transportation is subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. The Texas Railroad Commission has been changing its regulations governing transportation and gathering services provided by intrastate pipelines and gatherers. Whi le the changes by these state regulators affect us only indirectly, they are intended to further enhance competition in natural gas markets. We cannot predict what further action the FERC or state regulators will take on these matters; however, we do not b elieve that we will be affected differently in any material respect than other natural gas producers with which we compete by any action taken. 

Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before Congress, the FERC, state commissions and the courts. The natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, there is no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach pursued by the FERC, Congress and state regulatory authorities will continue. 

Federal leases. Some of our operations are located on federal oil and natural gas leases that are administered by the Bureau of Land Management ("BLM") of the United States Department of the Interior. These leases are issued through competitive bidding and contain relatively standardized terms. These leases require compliance with detailed Department of Interior and BLM regulations and orders that are subject to interpretation and change. These leases are also subject to certain regulations and orders promulgated by the Department of Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation &#38; Enforcement ("BOEMRE"), through its Minerals Revenue Management Program, which is responsible for the management of revenues from both onshore and offshore leases. 

Oil and natural gas liquids transportation rates. Our sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. In a number of instances, however, the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act. In other instances, the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to regulation by state regulatory bodies under state statutes. The price received from the sale of these products may be affected by the cost of transporting the products to market. 

The FERC's regulation of pipelines that transport crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids under the Interstate Commerce Act is generally more light-handed than the FERC's regulation of natural gas pipelines under the NGA. FERC-regulated pipelines that transport crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are subject to common carrier obligations that generally ensure non-discriminatory access. With respect to interstate pipeline transportation subject to regulation of the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act, rates generally must be cost-based, although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market-based rates are permitted in certain circumstances. Effective January 1, 1995, the FERC implemented regulations establishing an indexing system (based on inflation) for transportation rates governed by the Interstate Commerce Act that allowed for an increase or decrease in the transportation rates. The FERC's regulations include a methodology for such pipelines to change their rates through the use of an index system that establishes ceiling levels for such rates. The mandatory five year review in 2005 revised the methodology for this index to be based on Producer Price Index for Finished Goods (PPI-FG) plus 1.3 percent for the period July 1, 2006 through June 30, 2011. The mandatory five year review in 2012 revised the methodology for this index to be based on PPI-FG plus 2.65 percent for the period July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2016. The regulations provide that each year the Commission will publish the oil pipeline index after the PPI-FG becomes available. 

&#160;

With respect to intrastate crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids pipelines subject to the j urisdiction of state agencies, such state regulation is generally less rigorous than the regulation of interstate pipelines. State agencies have generally not investigated or challenged existing or proposed rates in the absence of shipper complaints or pro tests. Complaints or protests have been infrequent and are usually resolved informally. 

We do not believe that the regulatory decisions or activities relating to interstate or intrastate crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids pipelines will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids producers or marketers. 

Environmental regulations. We are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws. These laws, among other things, govern the issuance of permits to conduct exploration, drilling and production operations, the amounts and types of materials that may be released into the environment, the discharge and disposition of waste materials, the remediation of contaminated sites and the reclamation and abandonment of wells, sites and facilities. Numerous governmental departments issue rules and regulations to implement and enforce such laws, which are often difficult and costly to comply with and which carry substantial civil and even criminal penalties for failure to comply. Some laws, rules and regulations relating to protection of the environment may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for environmental contamination, rendering a person liable for environmental damages and cleanup cost without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. Other laws, rules and regulations may restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise exist or even prohibit exploration and production activities in sensitive areas. In addition, state laws often require various forms of remedial action to prevent pollution, such as closure of inactive pits and plugging of abandoned wells. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability. These costs are considered a normal, recurring cost of our on-going operations. Our domestic competitors are generally subject to the same laws and regulations. 

We believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our operations. However, environmental laws and regulations have been subject to frequent changes over the years, and the imposition of more stringent requirements or new regulatory schemes such as carbon "cap and trade" programs could have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, including the suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. As such, there can be no assurance that material cost and liabilities will not be incurred in the future. 

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or "CERCLA", imposes liability, without regard to fault, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a "hazardous substance" into the environment. These persons include the current or former owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the cost of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the cost of certain health studies. In addition, companies that incur liability frequently also confront third party claims because it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment from a polluted site. 

The Federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, or "RCRA", regulates the generation, transportation, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes and can require cleanup of hazardous waste disposal sites. RCRA currently excludes drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or 

&#160;

production of oil and natural gas from regulation as "hazardous waste". Disposal of such non-hazardous oil and natural gas exploration, developm ent and production wastes usually are regulated by state law. Other wastes handled at exploration and production sites or used in the course of providing well services may not fall within this exclusion. Moreover, stricter standards for waste handling and disposal may be imposed on the oil and natural gas industry in the future. From time to time, legislation is proposed in Congress that would revoke or alter the current exclusion of exploration, development and production wastes from RCRA's definition of " hazardous wastes", thereby potentially subjecting such wastes to more stringent handling, disposal and cleanup requirements. If such legislation were enacted, it could have a significant impact on our operating costs, as well as the oil and natural gas ind ustry in general. The impact of future revisions to environmental laws and regulations cannot be predicted. 

Our operations are also subject to the Clean Air Act, or "CAA", and comparable state and local requirements. Amendments to the CAA were adopted in 1990 and contain provisions that may result in the gradual imposition of certain pollution control requirements with respect to air emissions from our operations. On April 17, 2012, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency or "EPA" promulgated new emission standards for the oil and gas industry. These rules require a nearly 95 percent reduction in volatile organic compounds ("VOCs") emitted from hydraulically fractured gas wells by January 1, 2015. This significant reduction in emissions is to be accomplished primarily through the use of "green completions" (i.e., capturing natural gas that currently escapes to the air). These rules also have notification and reporting requirements. On September 23, 2014, EPA revised the emission requirements for storage tanks emitting certain levels of VOCs requiring a 95% reduction of VOC emissions by April 15, 2014 and April 15, 2015 (depending upon the date of construction of the storage tank). On December 19, 2014, EPA finalized updates and clarifications to these emission standards for the oil and gas industry. We believe our operations comply in all material respects with these emission limitations. Recently, EPA proposed new regulations on August 18, 2015 that would require further reductions in VOC and methane emissions. In addition to reducing emissions from hydraulically fractured wells, the proposed rules would require emission reductions further downstream, including equipment in the natural gas transmission segment of the industry. Should these latest proposed rules be adopted by EPA, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions. However, we believe our operations will not be materially adversely affected by any such requirements, and the requirements are not expected to be any more burdensome to us than to other similarly situated companies involved in oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. 

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, or the "Clean Water Act", imposes restrictions and controls on the discharge of produced waters and other wastes into navigable waters. Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters and to conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands. Certain state regulations and the general permits issued under the Federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program prohibit the discharge of produced waters and sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the oil and natural gas industry into certain coastal and offshore waters, unless otherwise authorized. Further, the EPA has adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges. Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans. The Clean Water Act and comparable state statutes provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges for oil and other pollutants and impose liability on parties responsible for those discharges for the cost of cleaning up any environmental damage caused by the release and for natural resource damages resulting from the release. We believe that our operations comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Clean Water Act and state statutes enacted to control water pollution. 

The Federal Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, as amended, requires EPA to develop minimum federal requirements for Underground Injection Control ("UIC") programs and other safeguards to protect public health by preventing injection wells from contaminating underground sources of drinking water. 

&#160;

The UIC program does not regulate wells that are solely used for production. However, EPA has authority to regulate hydraulic fracturing when diesel fuels are used in fluids or propping agents. In February 2014, EPA issued new guidance on when UIC permitting requirements apply to fracking fluids containing diesel. We believe our operations will not be materially adversely affected by the new guidance, and the requirements are not expected to be any more burdensome to us than to other similarly situated companies involved in oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. 

Federal regulators require certain owners or operators of facilities that store or otherwise handle oil to prepare and implement spill prevention, control, countermeasure and response plans relating to the possible discharge of oil into surface waters. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ("OPA") contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention and response to oil spills in the waters of the United States. The OPA subjects owners of facilities to strict joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages relating to a spill. Noncompliance with OPA may result in varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities. 

Executive Order 13158, issued on May 26, 2000, directs federal agencies to safeguard existing Marine Protected Areas, or "MPAs", in the United States and establish new MPAs. The order requires federal agencies to avoid harm to MPAs to the extent permitted by law and to the maximum extent practicable. It also directs the EPA to propose new regulations under the Clean Water Act to ensure appropriate levels of protection for the marine environment. This order has the potential to adversely affect our operations by restricting areas in which we may carry out future exploration and development projects and/or causing us to incur increased operating expenses. 

Certain flora and fauna that have officially been classified as "threatened" or "endangered" are protected by the Endangered Species Act. This law prohibits any activities that could "take" a protected plant or animal or reduce or degrade its habitat area. If endangered species are located in an area we wish to develop, the work could be prohibited or delayed and/or expensive mitigation might be required. 

Other statutes that provide protection to animal and plant species and which may apply to our operations include, but are not necessarily limited to, the Oil Pollution Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the National Historic Preservation Act. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences and may limit or prohibit construction, drilling and other activities on certain lands lying within wilderness or wetlands and other protected areas and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. The permits required for our various operations are subject to revocation, modification and renewal by issuing authorities. In addition, laws such as the National Environmental Policy Act and the Coastal Zone Management Act may make the process of obtaining certain permits more difficult or time consuming, resulting in increased costs and potential delays that could affect the viability or profitability of certain activities. 

Certain statutes such as the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act require the reporting of hazardous chemicals manufactured, processed, or otherwise used, which may lead to heightened scrutiny of the company's operations by regulatory agencies or the public. In 2012, the EPA adopted a new reporting requirement, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule (40 C.F.R. Part 98, Subpart W), which requires certain onshore petroleum and natural gas facilities to begin collecting data on their emissions of greenhouse gases ("GHGs") in January 2012, with the first annual reports of those emissions due on September 28, 2012. GHGs include gases such as methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of burning natural gas. Different GHGs have different global warming potentials with CO 2 having the lowest global warming potential, so 

&#160;

emissions of GHGs are typically expressed in terms of CO 2 equivalents, or CO 2 e. The rule applies to facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons of CO 2 e or more per year, and requires onshore petroleum and natural gas op erators to group all equipment under common ownership or control within a single hydrocarbon basin together when determining if the threshold is met. These greenhouse gas reporting rules were amended on October 22, 2015 to expand the number of sources and operations that are subject to these rules. We have determined that these reporting requirements apply to us and we believe we have met all of the EPA required reporting deadlines and strive to ensure accurate and consistent emissions data reporting. Oth er EPA actions with respect to the reduction of greenhouse gases (such as EPA's Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding, and EPA's Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule) and various state actions have or could impose mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. We are unable to predict at this time how much the cost of compliance with any legislation or regulation of greenhouse gas emissions will be in future periods. 

Such changes in environmental laws and regulations which result in more stringent and costly reporting, or waste handling, storage, transportation, disposal or cleanup activities, could materially affect companies operating in the energy industry. Adoption of new regulations further regulating emissions from oil and gas production could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects, as could the adoption of new laws or regulations which levy taxes or other costs on greenhouse gas emissions from other industries, which could result in changes to the consumption and demand for natural gas. We may also be assessed administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties if we fail to comply with any such new laws and regulations applicable to oil and natural gas production. 

In June 2009, the United States House of Representatives passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009. A similar bill, the Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act, introduced in the Senate, did not pass. Both bills contained the basic feature of establishing a "cap and trade" system for restricting greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. Under such a system, certain sources of greenhouse gas emissions would be required to obtain greenhouse gas emission "allowances" corresponding to their annual emissions of greenhouse gases. The number of emission allowances issued each year would decline as necessary over time to meet overall emission reduction goals. As the number of greenhouse gas emission allowances declines each year, the cost or value of allowances is expected to escalate significantly. It appears that the prospects for a cap and trade system such as that proposed in these bills have dimmed significantly; however, the EPA has moved ahead with its efforts to regulate GHG emissions from certain sources by rule. The EPA issued Subpart W of the Final Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule, which required petroleum and natural gas systems that emit 25,000 metric tons of CO 2 e or more per year to begin collecting GHG emissions data under a new reporting system. We believe we have met all of the reporting requirements under these new regulations. Beyond measuring and reporting, the EPA issued an "Endangerment Finding" under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, concluding greenhouse gas pollution threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations. The EPA has adopted regulations that would require permits for and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities. States in which we operate may also require permits and reductions in GHG emissions. Since all of our oil and natural gas production is in the United States, these laws or regulations that have been or may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur substantial increased operating costs, and could have an adverse effect on demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. On January 14, 2015, the Obama Administration announced that, pursuant to the Administration's Climate Action Plan, the EPA will propose a rule to regulate methane and volatile organic compound emissions from new and modified oil and gas sources. The proposed rule was published in the Federal Register on August 18, 2015. A final rule is expected in 2016.

&#160;

The Administration's announc ement also stated that other federal agencies, including the Bureau of Land Management, will impose new or more stringent regulations on the oil and gas sector that will have the effect of further reducing methane emissions. In 2010 the Bureau of Land Mana gement began implementation of a proposed oil and gas leasing reform. The leasing reform requires, among other things, a more detailed environmental review prior to leasing oil and natural gas resources on federal lands, increased public engagement in the development of Master Leasing Plans prior to leasing areas where intensive new oil and gas development is anticipated, and a comprehensive parcel review process with greater public involvement in the identification of key environmental resource values befo re a parcel is leased. New leases would incorporate adaptive management stipulations, requiring lessees to monitor and respond to observed environmental impacts, possibly through the implementation of expensive new control measures or curtailment of operat ions, potentially reducing profitability. The leasing reform policy could have the effect of reducing the amount of new federal lands made available for lease, increasing the competition for and cost of available parcels. On March 26, 2015, the Bureau of Land Management adopted a new rule concerning hydraulic fracturing on federal land. The new rule requires increased well integrity testing, increased requirements for the managing of fluids, and the disclosure of chemicals used in fracturing. This rule w as challenged in federal district court in Wyoming and a preliminary injunction was issued on September 30, 2015 that stayed the effect of the new rule until the litigation was completed. Due to the ongoing litigation and the uncertainty on whether the co urts will uphold the rule in whole or in part, we cannot at this time predict what effect the new rule will have on our operations. 

On August 16, 2012, the EPA adopted final regulations under the Clean Air Act that, among other things, require additional emissions controls for natural gas and natural gas liquids production, including New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds ("VOCs") and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with such production activities. The final regulations require the reduction of VOC emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or "green completions" on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. For well completion operations occurring at such well sites before January 1, 2015, the final regulations allow operators to capture and direct flowback emissions to completion combustion devices, such as flares, in lieu of performing green completions. These regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment. On September 23, 2014, the EPA revised the emission requirements for storage tanks emitting certain levels of VOCs requiring a 95% reduction of VOC emissions by April 15, 2014 and April 15, 2015 (depending on the date of construction of the storage tank). On August 18, 2015, EPA proposed additional amendments to these rules that would require further reductions in VOC and methane emissions. In addition to reducing emissions from hydraulically fractured wells, the proposed rules would require emission reductions further downstream, including equipment in the natural gas transmission segment of the industry. Should these latest proposed rules be adopted by EPA, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions. However, we believe our operations will not be materially adversely affected by any such requirements, and the requirements are not expected to be any more burdensome to us than to other similarly situated companies involved in oil and natural gas exploration and production activities.

&#160;

Regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production. Our exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and loca l levels. Such regulations include requiring permits and drilling bonds for the drilling of wells, regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells and the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled. Man y states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells and the regul ation of spacing, plugging and abandonment of such wells. Some state statutes limit the rate at which oil and natural gas can be produced from our properties. 

State regulation. Most states regulate the production and sale of oil and natural gas, including requirements for obtaining drilling permits, the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and gas resources. The rate of production may be regulated and the maximum daily production allowable from both oil and gas wells may be established on a market demand or conservation basis or both.
