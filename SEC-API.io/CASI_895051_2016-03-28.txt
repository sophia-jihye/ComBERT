 ITEM 1. &#160; BUSINESS. &#160; 

OVERVIEW 

&#160;

CASI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#8220;CASI&#8221;, the &#8220;Company&#8221;) (Nasdaq: CASI) is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the acquisition, development and commercialization of innovative therapeutics for the treatment of cancer and other unmet medical needs. Our mission is to become a leading fully-integrated pharmaceutical company delivering new medicines to patients with unmet medical needs. We conduct clinical development activities internationally and focus our commercial and marketing strategy on the China region, and the rest of the world through partnerships for development and commercialization.

&#160;

Our pipeline features (1) our lead proprietary drug candidate, ENMD-2076, in multiple Phase 2 clinical trials, (2) MARQIBO &#174; , ZEVALIN &#174; and EVOMELA &#8482; , all U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs in-licensed from Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for China regional rights, and currently under development by CASI for market approval in China, and (3) proprietary early-stage candidates in preclinical development. We believe that our pipeline reflects a risk-balanced approach between products in various stages of development, and between products that we develop ourselves and those that we develop with our partners for the China regional market. We intend to continue building a significant product pipeline of innovative drug candidates that we will commercialize alone in China and with partners for the rest of the world. For ENMD-2076, our current development is focused on niche and orphan indications. For in-licensed products, the Company uses a market-oriented approach to identify pharmaceutical candidates that it believes have the potential for gaining widespread market acceptance, either globally or in China, and for which development can be accelerated under the Company&#8217;s drug development strategy.

&#160;

Our primary research and development focus is on oncology therapeutics. Our strategy is to develop innovative drugs that are potential first-in-class or market-leading compounds for treatment of cancer. The implementation of our plans will include leveraging our resources in both the United States and China. In order to capitalize on the drug development and capital resources available in China, the Company is doing business in China through its wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary that will execute the China portion of the Company&#8217;s drug development strategy, including conducting clinical trials in China, pursuing local funding opportunities and strategic collaborations, and implementing the Company&#8217;s plan for development and commercialization in the China market.

&#160; 

ENMD-2076 

&#160;

Our lead internal drug candidate is ENMD-2076. ENMD-2076 is an orally-active, Aurora A/angiogenic kinase inhibitor with a unique kinase selectivity profile and multiple mechanisms of action that has shown anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative properties in multiple preclinical and clinical cancer studies. ENMD-2076 has been shown to inhibit a distinct profile of angiogenic tyrosine kinase targets in addition to the Aurora A kinase. Aurora kinases are key regulators of mitosis (cell division), and are often over-expressed in human cancers. ENMD-2076 also targets the VEGFR, Flt-3 and FGFR3 kinases, which have been shown to play important roles in the pathology of several cancers. 

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

ENMD-2076 has demonstrated significant, dose-dependent preclinical activity as a single agent, including tumor regression, in multiple animal models (e.g. breast, colon, leukemia), as well as activity towards ex vivo-treated human leukemia patient cells. ENMD-2076 has shown promising activity in a completed Phase 1 clinical trial in various different solid tumor cancers including ovarian, breast, liver, renal and sarcoma, as well as in leukemia, and multiple myeloma, and has also completed a Phase 2 clinical trial in advanced ovarian cancer, as well as a healthy volunteer crossover bioavailability and food effect study.

&#160;

We are currently conducting multiple Phase 2 studies of ENMD-2076 in advanced fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), advanced ovarian clear cell carcinomas (OCCC), and advanced/metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (STS). Our development strategy for clinical-stage products includes expanding the clinical trials to China allowing for more patient recruitment and the combination of clinical data to support the registration submission in both the U.S. and China. We have submitted clinical trial applications with the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) for each of these indications, and to date, have received approvals from the CFDA to proceed with trials in China for TNBC, OCCC and STS. In March 2015, the Company expanded the Phase 2 clinical trial of ENMD-2076 in TNBC to China at the Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences in Beijing, China.

&#160; 

The status of ENMD-2076 current trials is outlined below:

&#160;

&#160;

ENMD-2076 has received orphan drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of ovarian cancer, multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In October 2015, the Company also received orphan drug designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of HCC including FLC. In the United States, the Orphan Drug Act is intended to encourage companies to develop therapies for the treatment of diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people in this country. Orphan drug designation provides us with seven years of market exclusivity that begins once ENMD-2076 receives FDA marketing approval for a specific indication. It also provides certain financial incentives that can help support the development of ENMD-2076.

&#160;

ENMD-2076 development is based on comprehensive research into the relationship between malignancy and angiogenesis (the growth of new blood vessels). ENMD-2076 acts on the cellular pathways that affect biological processes important in multiple diseases, specifically angiogenesis and cell cycle regulation through the inhibition of key kinases. ENMD-2076 has potential applications in oncology and other diseases that are dependent on the regulation of these processes. 

&#160; 

IN-LICENSED PRODUCTS FOR THE CHINA REGIONAL MARKET

&#160;

In September 2014, we acquired from Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and certain of its affiliates (together referred to as &#8220;Spectrum&#8221;) exclusive rights in greater China (including Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau) to three in-licensed oncology products, including MARQIBO &#174; (vinCRIStine sulfate LIPOSOME injection) approved in the U.S. for advanced adult Ph- acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), ZEVALIN &#174; (ibritumomab tiuxetan) approved in the U.S. for advanced non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma, as well as EVOMELA &#8482; (melphalan hydrochloride for injection) approved in the U.S. primarily for use as a high-dose conditioning treatment prior to hematopoietic progenitor (stem) cell transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma. A description of the products and its current status is described below.

&#160; 

MARQIBO &#174; 

&#160; 

MARQIBO &#174; is a novel, sphingomyelin/cholesterol liposome-encapsulated, formulation of vincristine sulfate, a microtubule inhibitor. MARQIBO &#174; is approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in second or greater relapse or whose disease has progressed following two or more anti-leukemia therapies. We have initiated the regulatory and development process towards marketing approval for MARQIBO in China. In January 2016, the CFDA accepted for review our import drug registration application for MARQIBO &#174; .

&#160;

ZEVALIN &#174; 

&#160; 

ZEVALIN &#174; injection for intravenous use is a CD20-directed radiotherapeutic antibody. It is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory, low-grade or follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma (NHL). ZEVALIN &#174; is also indicated for the treatment of patients with previously untreated follicular non-Hodgkin&#8217;s Lymphoma who achieve a partial or complete response to first-line chemotherapy. ZEVALIN &#174; therapeutic regimen consists of two components: rituximab, and Yttrium-90 (Y-90) radiolabeled ZEVALIN &#174; for therapy. ZEVALIN &#174; builds on the combined effect of a targeted biologic monoclonal antibody augmented with the therapeutic effects of a beta-emitting radioisotope. Since ZEVALIN &#174; is already approved in the U.S. and marketed by Spectrum, we expect that gaining approval from local regulatory authorities for commercialization in greater China will require a shorter timeframe compared to clinical-stage drugs. We have initiated the regulatory and development process towards marketing approval for ZEVALIN &#174; in China, and have initiated commercial activities for ZEVALIN &#174; in Hong Kong.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

EVOMELA &#8482; 

&#160;

EVOMELA &#8482; is a new intravenous formulation of melphalan being investigated by Spectrum in the multiple myeloma transplant setting. The formulation avoids the use of propylene glycol, which is used as a co-solvent in the current formulation of melphalan and has been reported to cause renal and cardiac side-effects that limit the ability to deliver higher quantities of intended therapeutic compounds. The use of Captisol technology to reformulate melphalan is anticipated to allow for longer administration durations and slower infusion rates, potentially enabling clinicians to avoid reductions and safely achieve a higher dose intensity of pre-transplant chemotherapy. On March 10, 2016, Spectrum received notification from the FDA of the grant of approval of its NDA for EVOMELA &#8482; &#160;(melphalan) for Injection primarily for use as a high-dose conditioning treatment prior to hematopoietic progenitor (stem) cell transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma. We have initiated the regulatory and development process towards marketing approval for EVOMELA &#8482; in China.

&#160; 

PRECLINICAL DEVELOPMENT 

&#160;

Our primary focus is on clinical-stage and late-stage drug candidates so that we can immediately employ our U.S. and China drug development model to accelerate clinical and regulatory progress. In addition to our clinical-and late-stage approach, we have two potential drug candidates in preclinical development that we will continue to evaluate in 2016. In addition to these early compounds, our pipeline includes 2ME2 (2-methoxyestradial), an orally active compound that has antiproliferative, antiangiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties. We maintain strong intellectual property around our 2ME2 asset and are currently seeking a partner to advance its development. 

&#160; 

MANAGEMENT 

&#160;

The current senior management team includes: Dr. Ken K. Ren, Chief Executive Officer; Cynthia W. Hu, Chief Operating Officer, General Counsel &#38; Secretary; Dr. Rong Chen, Chief Medical Officer; and Sara B. Capitelli, Vice President, Finance &#38; Principal Accounting Officer. The Company, as part of its normal operations, also has consulting relationships with a core team of experts in clinical trial design, FDA and CFDA strategy, scientific research, manufacturing and formulation, among others.

&#160;

Our management team promotes and instills a corporate culture of prudent resource management, fiscal responsibility and accountability, while maintaining an environment of innovation and entrepreneurialism in order to quickly respond to opportunities and to react to any changes in market conditions and in the regulatory landscape.

&#160;

BUsiness Development AND COMMERCIALIZATION Strategy 

&#160;

We intend to continue our path to become fully integrated with drug development and commercial operations. Our current external business development effort is concentrated on acquiring additional drug candidates through in-license and acquisitions to expand our pipeline. Our pipeline will reflect a diversified and risk-balanced set of assets that include (1) proprietary innovative drug candidates, such as our ENMD-2076, (2) late-stage clinical drug candidates in-licensed for China regional rights, such as MARQIBO &#174; , ZEVALIN &#174; , and EVOMELA &#8482; , and (3) new drug candidates under internal preclinical development. We use a market-oriented approach to identify pharmaceutical candidates that we believe have the potential for gaining widespread market acceptance, either globally or in China, and for which development can be accelerated under the Company&#8217;s drug development strategy. Although oncology is our principal clinical and commercial focus, we will be opportunistic about other pharmaceuticals that can address unmet medical needs.

&#160;

We believe that ENMD-2076 has therapeutic potential in a broad range of tumor types. We will continue to advance ENMD-2076 in our current indications. We believe that for these indications ENMD-2076 represents a potential Phase 3 partnering opportunity for large pharmaceutical companies for territory rights outside of greater China. As a result, our strategy is to pursue the development of ENMD-2076, obtain additional clinical data while being selective and opportunistic in exploring strategic alliances for territories outside of greater China. For fibrolamellar carcinoma, a much smaller indication, we intend to maintain our global rights and commercialize on our own. Similarly, we believe that 2ME2 and other new drug candidates in early development represent future partnering opportunities for large pharmaceutical companies for territory rights outside of greater China.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In 2012, we established a wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary that is executing the China portion of our drug development strategy, including conducting clinical trials in China, pursuing local funding opportunities and strategic collaborations, and implementing our plan for accelerated development and commercialization in the Chinese market.

&#160; 

RELATIONSHIPS RELATING TO CLINICAL PROGRAMS 

&#160;

Contract Manufacturing . The manufacturing efforts for the production of our clinical trial materials are performed by contract manufacturing organizations. Established relationships, coupled with supply agreements, have secured the necessary resources to supply clinical materials for our clinical development program. We believe that our current strategy of outsourcing manufacturing is cost-effective and allows for the flexibility we require.

&#160; 

Sponsored Research Agreements. To support development efforts, we may enter into sponsored research agreements with outside scientists to conduct specific projects. Under these agreements, we have secured the rights to intellectual property and to develop under exclusive license any discoveries resulting from these collaborations. The funds, if any, we provide in accordance with these agreements partially support the scientists&#8217; laboratory, research personnel and research supplies.

&#160; 

Clinical Trial Centers . As of March 18, 2016, we are conducting clinical trials for ENMD-2076 at the following institutions:

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

&#160;

We generally seek patent protection for our technology and product candidates in the United States, Canada, China and other key markets. The patent position of biopharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Our success will depend, in part, on whether we can: (i) obtain patents to protect our own products; (ii) obtain licenses to use the technologies of third parties, which may be protected by patents; (iii) protect our trade secrets and know-how; and (iv) operate without infringing the intellectual property and proprietary rights of others.

&#160;

With respect to our lead drug candidate, ENMD-2076, we directly own 22 granted patents or allowed patent applications (including 2 granted United States patents, 1 granted Chinese patent, and 18 granted patents and 1 additional pending patent applications in Brazil). The patent term for U.S. Patent No. 7,563,787 will expire March 5, 2027, assuming all maintenance fees are paid. If and when the FDA approves ENMD-2076, this patent term may be extended. The patent terms of our granted patents (including any patents issuing from our pending patent applications) in other countries will expire September 29, 2026, assuming all annuities are paid and not considering any term extensions for regulatory approval that might be available.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

With regard to our in-licensed drug candidates (MARQIBO &#174; , ZEVALIN &#174; and EVOMELA &#8482; ), we have acquired exclusive licenses to intellectual property to enable us to develop and commercialize the drug candidates in our commercial markets.

&#160;

With respect to our drug candidate, 2ME2, we directly own 4 issued US patents, 5 granted foreign patents, and 1 pending foreign application. Assuming all maintenance fees are paid not considering any term extensions for regulatory approval that might be available, the patent term of US Patent No. 7,087,592 expires March 12, 2022, the patent term of US Patent No. 7,235,540 expires August 23, 2020, the patent term of US Patent No. 8,399,440 expires September 10, 2029, and, if granted, the patent term of US Patent No. 9,132,138 expires March 8, 2033. The corresponding foreign patents will expire August 23, 2020, and March 20, 2027, assuming all annuities are paid and not considering any term extensions for regulatory approval that might be available.

&#160;

We have pending trademark applications for CASI and CASI PHARMACEUTICALS.

&#160;

We review and assess our portfolio on a regular basis to secure protection and to align our patent strategy with our overall business strategy. 

&#160; 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

&#160;

U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 

&#160;

Our development, manufacture, and potential sale of therapeutics in the United States, China and other countries are subject to extensive regulations by federal, state, local and foreign governmental authorities.

&#160;

In the United States, the FDA regulates product candidates currently being developed as drugs or biologics. New drugs are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), and biological products, in addition to being subject to certain provisions of that Act, are regulated under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). We believe that the FDA will regulate the products currently being developed by us or our collaborators as new drugs. Both the FFDCA and PHSA and corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising and other promotion of biologics or new drugs, as the case may be. FDA clearances or approvals must be obtained before clinical testing, and before manufacturing and marketing of biologics or drugs.

&#160;

Preparing drug candidates for regulatory approval has historically been a costly and time-consuming process. Generally, in order to gain FDA permission to test a new agent, a developer first must conduct preclinical studies in the laboratory and in animal model systems to gain preliminary information on an agent&#8217;s effectiveness and to identify any safety problems. The results of these studies are submitted as a part of an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for a drug or biologic, which the FDA must review before human clinical trials of an investigational drug can begin. In addition to the known safety and effectiveness data on the drug or biologic, the IND must include a detailed description of the clinical investigations proposed. Based on the current FDA organizational structure, ENMD-2076 is regulated as a new chemical entity by the FDA&#8217;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Generally, as new chemical entities like our small molecules are discovered, formal IND-directed toxicology studies are required prior to initiating human testing. Clinical testing may begin 30 days after submission of an IND to the FDA unless FDA objects to the initiation of the study or has outstanding questions to discuss with the IND sponsor.

&#160;

In order to commercialize any drug or biological products, we or our collaborators must sponsor and file an IND and conduct clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness necessary to obtain FDA approval of such products. For studies conducted under INDs sponsored by us or our collaborators, we or our collaborators will be required to select qualified investigators (usually physicians within medical institutions) to supervise the administration of the products, test or otherwise assess patient results, and collect and maintain patient data; monitor the investigations to ensure that they are conducted in accordance with applicable requirements, including the requirements set forth in the general investigational plan and protocols contained in the IND; and comply with applicable reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Clinical trials of drugs or biologics are normally done in three phases, although the phases may overlap. Phase 1 trials for drug candidates to be used to treat cancer patients are concerned primarily with the safety and preliminary effectiveness of the drug, involve a small group ranging from 15 - 40 subjects, and may take from six months to over one year to complete. Phase 2 trials normally involve 30 - 200 patients and are designed primarily to demonstrate effectiveness in treating or diagnosing the disease or condition for which the drug is intended, although short-term side effects and risks in people whose health is impaired may also be examined. Phase 3 trials are expanded clinical trials with larger numbers of patients which are intended to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to gather additional information for proper dosage and labeling of the drug. Phase 3 clinical trials generally take two to five years to complete, but may take longer. The FDA receives reports on the progress of each phase of clinical testing, as well as reports of unexpected adverse experiences occurring during the trial. The FDA may require the modification, suspension, or termination of clinical trials, if it concludes that an unwarranted risk is presented to patients, or, in Phase 2 and 3, if it concludes that the study protocols are deficient in design to meet their stated objectives.

&#160;

If clinical trials of a new drug candidate are completed successfully, the sponsor of the product may seek FDA marketing approval. If the product is classified as a new drug, an applicant must file a New Drug Application (NDA) with the FDA and receive approval before marketing the drug commercially. The NDA must include detailed information about the product and its manufacturer and the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials.

&#160;

The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort, and there can be no assurance that any approval will be obtained on a timely basis, if at all. Although it is the policy of the FDA to complete the review of the initial submission of NDAs within six to twelve months, the entire FDA review process may take several years. Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria and deny the approval. Further, the FDA may require additional clinical studies before making a decision on approval. In addition, the FDA may condition marketing approval on the conduct of specific post-marketing studies to further evaluate safety and effectiveness. Even if FDA regulatory clearances are obtained, a marketed product is subject to continuing regulatory requirements and review relating to Good Manufacturing Practices, adverse event reporting, promotion and advertising, and other matters. Discovery of previously unknown problems or failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market, as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions.

&#160;

China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) 

&#160;

We are also subject to regulation and oversight by different levels of the food and drug administration in China, in particular, the CFDA. For clinical-stage product candidates, our development activities in China can follow two purposes: (1) to obtain clinical data to support our global FDA-regulated trials as is the case for our proprietary ENMD-2076, and (2) to obtain clinical data to support local registration with the CFDA. For late-stage product candidates that we in-license for greater China rights, such as MARQIBO &#174; , ZEVALIN &#174; , and EVOMELA &#8482; , our development activities in China are to secure marketing approval from CFDA by conducting import drug registration. The &#8220;Law of the PRC on the Administration of Pharmaceuticals,&#8221; as amended on February 28, 2001, provides the basic legal framework for the administration of the production and sale of pharmaceuticals in China and covers the manufacturing, distributing, packaging, pricing and advertising of pharmaceutical products in China. Its implementation regulations set out detailed implementation rules with respect to the administration of pharmaceuticals in China. We are also subject to other PRC laws and regulations that are applicable to manufacturers and distributors in general. 

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Product Manufacturing . For local registration only, both drug substance and drug product need to be manufactured locally in China through either a self-owned facility or a contract manufacturing organization. The study drug to be used for clinical trials must be manufactured in compliance with CFDA Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines. A manufacturer of pharmaceutical products and active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) must obtain the drug manufacturing license and the GMP certification to produce pharmaceutical products and API for marketing in China. GMP certification criteria include institution and staff qualifications, production premises and facilities, equipment, raw materials, hygiene conditions, production management, quality controls, product distributions, maintenance of sales records and manner of handling customer complaints and adverse reaction reports. Both the drug manufacturing license and the GMP certificate is valid for five years, and must be renewed at least six months before its expiration date. A manufacturer is required to obtain GMP certificates to cover all of its production operations. 

&#160;

In addition, before commencing business, a pharmaceutical manufacturer must also obtain a business license from the relevant administration for industry and commerce.

&#160;

Preclinical Research and Clinical Trials . For an investigational new drug application, a clinical trial approval issued from the CFDA is required to conduct clinical trials. Chemical generics, on the other hand, only need to undergo bioequivalent studies upon a filing for record with the CFDA. In order to apply for a clinical trial application approval to support local registration in China, a pharmaceutical company is required to conduct a series of preclinical research including research on chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology and pharmacokinetics of pharmaceuticals. This preclinical research should be conducted in compliance with the relevant regulatory guidelines issued by the CFDA. In particular, safety evaluation research must be conducted in compliance with China&#8217;s Good Laboratory Practice.

&#160;

After completion of preclinical studies and obtaining the clinical trial approval from the CFDA, clinical trials are conducted in compliance with China&#8217;s Good Clinical Practice and include:

&#160;

Phase 1 &#8211; preliminary trial of clinical pharmacology and human safety evaluation studies. The primary objective is to observe the pharmacokinetics and the tolerance level of the human body to the new medicine as a basis for ascertaining the appropriate methods of dosage.

&#160;

Phase 2 &#8211; preliminary exploration on the therapeutic efficacy. The purpose is to assess preliminarily the efficacy and safety of pharmaceutical products on patients with the target indication of the pharmaceutical products and to provide the basis for the design and dosage tests for Phase 3. The dosing and methodology of research in this phase generally adopts double-blind, random methods with limited sample sizes.

&#160;

Phase 3 &#8211; confirm the therapeutic efficacy. The objective is to further verify the efficacy and safety of pharmaceutical products on patients within the target indication, to evaluate the benefits and risks and finally to provide sufficient experimentally proven evidence to support the registration application of the pharmaceutical products. In general, the trial should adopt double-blind random methods with sufficient sample sizes.

&#160; 

Import Drug Registration or Multi Regional Clinical Trials . CFDA regulations allow foreign drug developers to conduct import drug registration or multi regional clinical trials in China for a new drug as part of a global drug development program. A Multi Regional Clinical Trial Application needs to be filed with the CFDA and approval is required prior to conducting the trials. Before a Multi Regional Clinical Trial Application is filed with the CFDA, regulations require the investigational new product that is the subject of the trial to have at least completed a Phase 1 clinical trial overseas, and the new product must currently be in the process of later stages of development.

&#160;

In order to apply for a Multi Regional Clinical Trial Application in China, a biopharmaceutical company is required to submit a comprehensive investigation new drug application package filed with foreign regulatory agency, i.e. the FDA, in a format compliant with CFDA guidance.

&#160;

After obtaining the multi regional clinical trial approval from the CFDA, clinical trials are conducted in compliance with the both FDA/ICH and CFDA Good Clinical Practice guidelines.

&#160; 

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

New Drug Registration and Application . After completion of the 3 phases of clinical trials demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of a pharmaceutical in its targeted indication, a New Drug Registration Application needs to be filled with the CFDA, which includes research data of chemistry, manufacturing and controls, pre-clinical studies and clinical trial report. 

&#160;

Once new drug registration approval is received, the product can be sold nationwide in China.

&#160;

COMPETITION 

&#160;

Competition in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries is intense and based significantly on scientific and technological factors, the availability of patent and other protection for technology and products, the ability and length of time required to obtain governmental approval for testing, manufacturing and marketing and the ability to commercialize products in a timely fashion. Moreover, the biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology that could result in the technological obsolescence of any products that we develop.

&#160;

We compete with many specialized biopharmaceutical firms, as well as a growing number of large pharmaceutical companies that are applying biotechnology to their operations. It is probable that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies for the treatment of unmet needs in oncology will increase. Many biopharmaceutical companies have focused their development efforts in the human therapeutics area, including oncology and inflammation, and many major pharmaceutical companies have developed or acquired internal biotechnology capabilities or made commercial arrangements with other biopharmaceutical companies. These companies, as well as academic institutions, governmental agencies and private research organizations, also compete with us in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel and consultants.

&#160;

The biopharmaceutical industry has undergone, and is expected to continue to undergo, rapid and significant technological change. Consolidation and competition are expected to intensify as technical advances in each field are achieved and become more widely known. In order to compete effectively, we will be required to continually expand our scientific expertise and technology, identify and retain capable personnel and pursue scientifically feasible and commercially viable opportunities.

&#160;

Our competition will be determined in part by the potential indications for which our product candidates may be developed and ultimately approved by regulatory authorities. The relative speed with which we develop new products, complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals, and complete the other requirements to get a pharmaceutical product on the market are critical factors in gaining a competitive advantage. We may rely on third parties to commercialize our products, and accordingly, the success of these products will depend in significant part on these third parties&#8217; efforts and ability to compete in these markets. The success of any collaboration will depend in part upon our collaborative partners&#8217; own competitive, marketing and strategic considerations, including the relative advantages of alternative products being developed and marketed by our collaborative partners and our competitors.

&#160;

Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market products. In addition, many of these competitors have extensive experience in preclinical testing and human clinical trials and in obtaining regulatory approvals. The existence of competitive products, including products or treatments of which we are not aware, or products or treatments that may be developed in the future, may adversely affect the marketability of products that we may develop. Our competitors&#8217; drugs may be more effective than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing our product candidates.
