 Item 1. Business. 

&#160; 

GENERAL 

&#160; 

We are primarily engaged in the real estate finance business. We engage in our business through subsidiaries that invest, on a leveraged basis, in residential mortgage assets, including Agency MBS, Non-Agency MBS, residential whole loans and CRT securities. Our principal business objective is to deliver shareholder value through the generation of distributable income and through asset performance linked to residential mortgage credit fundamentals. We selectively invest in residential mortgage assets with a focus on credit analysis, projected prepayment rates, interest rate sensitivity and expected return. 

&#160; 

We were incorporated in Maryland on July 24, 1997, and began operations on April 10, 1998. We have elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust (or REIT) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must comply with a number of requirements under federal tax law, including that we must distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders. We have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as a taxable REIT subsidiary (or TRS). In general, a TRS may hold assets and engage in activities that a REIT or qualified REIT subsidiary cannot hold or engage in directly and generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business. 

We are a holding company and conduct our real estate finance businesses primarily through wholly-owned subsidiaries, so as to maintain an exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (or the Investment Company Act) by ensuring that less than 40% of the value of our total assets, exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items (which we refer to as our adjusted total assets for Investment Company Act purposes), on an unconsolidated basis consist of &#8220;investment securities&#8221; as defined by the Investment Company Act. We refer to this test as the &#8220;40% Test.&#8221; 

&#160; 

INVESTMENT STRATEGY 

&#160; 

As stated above, we primarily invest through subsidiaries in Agency MBS, Non-Agency MBS, residential whole loans and CRT securities. 

&#160; 

The mortgages collateralizing our Agency MBS portfolio are predominantly Hybrids, 15-year fixed-rate mortgages and ARMs. Our selection of Agency MBS is largely designed to generate attractive returns relative to interest rate and prepayment risks. The Hybrid loans collateralizing our MBS typically have initial fixed-rate periods at origination of three, five, seven or ten years. At the end of this fixed-rate period, these mortgages become adjustable and their interest rates adjust based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (or LIBOR) or in some cases the one-year constant maturity treasury rate (or CMT). These interest rate adjustments are typically limited by periodic caps (which limit the amount of the interest rate change from the prior rate) and lifetime caps (which are maximum interest rates permitted for the life of the mortgage). As coupons earned on Agency Hybrids and ARMs adjust over time as interest rates change, these assets are generally less sensitive to changes in interest rates than are fixed rate MBS. In general, Hybrid loans and ARMs have 30-year final maturities and they amortize over this 30-year period. While the coupons on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages do not adjust, they amortize according to a 15-year amortization schedule and have a 15-year final maturity. Due to their accelerated amortization and shorter final maturity, these assets are generally less sensitive to changes in long-term interest rates as compared to fixed-rate mortgages with a longer final maturity, such as 30-year mortgages. 

Our Non-Agency MBS portfolio primarily consists of (i) Legacy Non-Agency MBS and (ii) MBS collateralized by re-performing and non-performing loans (or RPL/NPL MBS). In addition to Non-Agency MBS investments, during 2014 we began investing in re-performing and non-performing residential whole loans through our interests in certain consolidated trusts. Our strategy of combining investments in Agency MBS, Non-Agency MBS and residential whole loans is designed to generate attractive returns with less overall sensitivity to changes in the yield curve, the general level of interest rates and prepayments. We expect to continue to seek more credit sensitive assets in 2016, such as residential whole loans, while seeking to minimize sensitivity to interest rates. 

Our Legacy Non-Agency MBS have been acquired primarily at discounts to face/par value, which we believe serves to mitigate our exposure to credit risk. A portion of the purchase discount on substantially all of our Legacy Non-Agency MBS is designated as a non-accretable discount (also referred to hereafter as Credit Reserve), which effectively mitigates our risk of loss on the mortgages collateralizing such MBS and is not expected to be accreted into interest income. The portion of the purchase discount that is designated as accretable discount is accreted into interest income over the life of the security. The mortgages collateralizing our Legacy Non-Agency MBS consist primarily of ARMs, 30-year fixed rate mortgages and Hybrids. Legacy Non-Agency ARMs and Hybrids typically exhibit reduced interest rate sensitivity (as compared to fixed-rate Legacy Non-Agency MBS) due to their interest rate adjustments (similar to Agency ARMs and Hybrids). However, yields on Legacy Non-Agency MBS, unlike Agency MBS, also exhibit sensitivity to changes in credit performance. If credit performance improves, the Credit Reserve may be decreased (and accretable discount increased), resulting in a higher yield over the remaining life of the security. Similarly, deteriorating credit performance could increase the Credit Reserve and decrease the yield over the remaining life of the security or other-than-temporary impairment could result. To the extent that higher interest rates in the future are indicative of an improving economy, better employment data and/or higher home prices, it is possible that these factors will improve the credit performance of Legacy Non-Agency MBS and therefore mitigate the interest rate sensitivity of these securities. 

Our RPL/NPL MBS were purchased primarily through new issue at prices at or around par and represent the senior tranches of the related securitizations. These RPL/NPL MBS are structured with significant credit enhancement (typically approximately 50%) and the subordinate tranches absorb all credit losses (until those tranches are extinguished) and typically receive no cash flow (interest or principal) until the senior tranche is paid off. Prior to purchase, we analyze the deal structure in order to assess the associated credit risk. Subsequent to purchase, the ongoing credit risk associated with the deal is evaluated by analyzing the extent to which actual credit losses occur that result in a reduction in the amount of subordination enjoyed by our bond. Based on the recent performance of the collateral underlying our RPL/NPL MBS and current subordination levels, we do not believe that we are currently exposed to significant risk of credit loss on these investments. In addition, these deal structures contain an interest rate step-up feature, whereby the original coupon on the senior tranche increases by 300 basis points if the security that we hold has not been redeemed by the issuer after 36 months. We expect that the combination of the priority cash flow of the senior tranche and the 36-month step-up will result in these securities &#8217; exhibiting short average lives and, accordingly, reduced interest rate sensitivity. Consequently, we believe that RPL/NPL MBS provide attractive returns given our assessment of the interest rate and credit risk associated with these securities. 

In addition, during 2015, we continued to transition to more credit sensitive, less interest sensitive residential mortgage assets by acquiring residential whole loans through certain trusts that are consolidated on our balance sheet for financial reporting purposes. To date, we have focused on purchasing packages of both re-performing and non-performing whole loans. Re-performing loans are typically characterized by borrowers who have experienced payment delinquencies in the past and the amount owed on the mortgage may exceed the value of the property pledged as collateral. These loans are purchased at purchase prices that are discounted (often substantially so) to the contractual loan balance to reflect the credit history of the borrower, the loan-to-value (or LTV) of the loan and the coupon. Non-performing loans are typically characterized by borrowers who have defaulted on their obligations and/or have payment delinquencies of 60 days or more at the time we acquire the loan. These loans are also purchased at purchase prices that are discounted (often substantially so) to the contractual loan balance that reflects primarily the non-performing nature of the loan. Typically, this purchase price is a discount to the expected value of the collateral securing the loan, such value to be realized after foreclosure and liquidation of the property. All of the residential whole loans were purchased by the consolidated trusts on a servicing-released basis, i.e ., the sellers of such loans transferred the right to service the loans as part of the sale. Because we do not directly service any loans, we have contracted with loan servicing companies with specific expertise in working with delinquent borrowers in an effort to cure delinquencies through, among other things, loan modification and third-party refinancing. To the extent these efforts are successful, we believe our investments in residential whole loans will yield attractive returns. In addition, to the extent that it is not possible to achieve a successful outcome for a particular borrower and the real property collateral must be foreclosed on and liquidated, we believe that the discounted purchase price at which the asset was acquired, provides us with a level of protection against financial loss. 

FINANCING STRATEGY 

&#160; 

Our financing strategy is designed to increase the size of our investment portfolio by borrowing against a substantial portion of the market value of the assets in our portfolio. We primarily use repurchase agreements to finance our holdings of MBS, residential whole loans and CRT securities. We enter into interest rate derivatives to hedge the interest rate risk associated with a portion of our repurchase agreement borrowings. Going forward, in connection with our current and any future investment in residential whole loans, our financing strategy may expand to the use of securitization or other forms of structured financing. 

&#160; 

Repurchase agreements, although legally structured as sale and repurchase transactions, are financing contracts (i.e., borrowings) under which we pledge our MBS, residential whole loans and CRT securities as collateral to secure loans with repurchase agreement counterparties (i.e., lenders). Repurchase agreements involve the transfer of the pledged collateral to a lender at an agreed upon price in exchange for such lender&#8217;s simultaneous agreement to return the same security back to the borrower at a future date (i.e., the maturity of the borrowing) at a higher price. The difference between the sale price that we receive and the repurchase price that we pay represents interest paid to the lender. Our cost of borrowings under repurchase agreements is generally LIBOR based. Under our repurchase agreements, we pledge our securities as collateral to secure the borrowing, which is equal in value to a specified percentage of the fair value of the pledged collateral, while we retain beneficial ownership of the pledged collateral. At the maturity of a repurchase financing, unless the repurchase financing is renewed with the same counterparty, we are required to repay the loan including any accrued interest and concurrently receive back our pledged collateral from the lender. With the consent of the lender, we may renew a repurchase financing at the then prevailing financing terms. Margin calls, whereby, a lender requires that we pledge additional securities or cash as collateral to secure borrowings under our repurchase financing with such lender, are routinely experienced by us when the value of the MBS pledged as collateral declines as a result of principal amortization and prepayments or due to changes in market interest rates, spreads or other market conditions. We also may make margin calls on counterparties when collateral values increase. 

&#160; 

In order to reduce our exposure to counterparty-related risk, we generally seek to enter into repurchase agreements and other financing arrangements, and derivatives, with a diversified group of financial institutions. At December 31, 2015 , we had outstanding balances under repurchase agreements with 27 &#32;separate lenders. 

&#160; 

In July 2015, the Company&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary, MFA Insurance, Inc. (or MFA Insurance), became a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (or FHLB) of Des Moines. At December 31, 2015 &#32;and February 16, 2016 , MFA Insurance had FHLB advances of approximately $1.500 billion &#32;and $1.200 billion , respectively. FHLB advances are secured financing transactions and are carried at their contractual amounts. The ability to borrow from the FHLB is subject to the Company&#8217;s continued creditworthiness, pledging of sufficient eligible collateral to secure advances, and compliance with certain agreements with the FHLB. 

&#32;In January, 2016, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (or FHFA) released its final rule amending its regulation on FHLB membership, which, amongst other things, provided termination rules for current captive insurance members. As a result of such regulation, MFA Insurance will not be permitted new advances or renewal of existing advances and will be required to terminate its FHLB membership and repay any outstanding advances within one year of the rule&#8217;s effective date of February 19, 2016. 

&#160; 

In addition to repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, securitized debt and 8% Senior Notes due 2042 (or Senior Notes), we may also use other sources of funding in the future to finance our MBS portfolio, including, but not limited to, other types of collateralized borrowings, loan agreements, lines of credit or the issuance of debt securities. 

COMPETITION 

We operate in the mortgage REIT industry. We believe that our principal competitors in the business of acquiring and holding residential mortgage assets of the types in which we invest are financial institutions, such as banks, savings and loan institutions, life insurance companies, institutional investors, including mutual funds and pension funds, hedge funds, other mortgage-REITs as well as the U.S. Federal Reserve as part of its monetary policy activities. Some of these entities may not be subject to the same regulatory constraints (i.e., REIT compliance or maintaining an exemption under the Investment Company Act) as us. In addition, many of these entities have greater financial resources and access to capital than us. The existence of these entities, as well as the possibility of additional entities forming in the future, may increase the competition for the acquisition of residential mortgage assets, resulting in higher prices and lower yields on such assets. 

&#160; 

EMPLOYEES 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015 , we had 50 full-time and three part-time employees. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. None of our employees are unionized or represented under a collective bargaining agreement.
