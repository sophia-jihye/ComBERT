Business 

Overview

Restoration Hardware Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;RH&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a leading luxury retailer in the home furnishings marketplace. Our curated and fully-integrated assortments are presented consistently across our sales channels in sophisticated and unique lifestyle settings that we believe are on par with world-class interior designers. We offer dominant merchandise assortments across a growing number of categories, including furniture, lighting, textiles, bathware, d&#233;cor, outdoor and garden, tableware, and child and teen furnishings. Our ability to innovate, curate and integrate products, categories, services and businesses with a completely authentic and distinctive point of view, then rapidly scale them across our fully integrated multi-channel infrastructure is a powerful platform for continued long-term growth. Our unique product development, go-to-market and supply chain capabilities, together with our significant scale, enable us to offer a compelling combination of design, quality and value that we believe is unparalleled in the marketplace. 

Restoration Hardware Holdings, Inc. was formed as a Delaware corporation on August 18, 2011. On November 7, 2012, Restoration Hardware Holdings, Inc. completed an initial public offering. Our business is fully integrated across our multiple channels of distribution, consisting of our stores, catalogs, including our Source Books, and websites. As of January 30, 2016, we operated a total of 69 retail galleries, consisting of 53 legacy Galleries, 6 larger format Design Galleries, 4 next generation Design Galleries, 1 RH Modern Gallery and 5 RH Baby &#38; Child Galleries, as well as 17 outlet stores, throughout the United States and Canada.

We have achieved strong growth in sales and profitability, as illustrated by the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Net revenues increased 13% to $2,109.0 million in fiscal 2015, on top of a 20% increase in fiscal 2014 and a 30% increase in fiscal 2013. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 marked our 24 th consecutive quarter of double-digit net revenue growth. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Our adjusted net income increased 17.6% to $114.8 million in fiscal 2015 from $97.6 million in fiscal 2014. 

Key Value Driving Strategies

Key elements of our strategy are to:

Transform Our Real Estate Platform. We believe we have an opportunity to significantly increase our sales by transforming our real estate platform from our existing legacy retail footprint to a portfolio of next generation Design Galleries that are sized to the potential of each market and the size of our assortment. On average, our legacy retail stores display less than 10% of our current product assortment. Our next generation Design Galleries allow us to optimize our selling space by displaying a greater percentage of our merchandise assortment, as well as future product expansions and new businesses, in a highly differentiated retail setting. Based on our historical performance, when a product is presented on the selling floor, we experience an increase in sales for that product across all of our channels. 

Based on recent trends and our plans for product assortment expansion and new businesses, we are generally targeting a range of approximately 25,000 to 60,000 leased selling square feet for new locations. Landlords are currently offering us leases that accommodate these space requirements and that have favorable terms, which are typically available only to anchor tenants. Based on our analysis, we believe we have the opportunity to operate next generation Design Galleries in 60 to 70 locations in the United States and Canada.

Expand Our Offering and Increase Our Market Share. We believe we have a significant opportunity to increase our market share by growing our merchandise assortment, introducing new products and categories, expanding our service offerings and exploring and testing new business opportunities complementary to our core business. We will continue to increase our brand awareness and customer loyalty through our circulation strategy, our digital marketing initiatives, and our advertising and public relations activities and events. 

Elevate the Customer Experience. We are focused on improving the end-to-end customer experience. As we have elevated our brand, especially at retail, other customer touch points also need to leapfrog forward to create a cohesive experience. This initiative will focus on everything from product quality to in-home delivery across all channels, and includes new people, processes, and systems. 

&#160;

Increase Operating Margins. We have the opportunity to continue to improve our operating margins by leveraging our fixed occupancy, advertising and corporate general and administrative costs, as well as leveraging our scalable infrastructure. Key areas in which we believe we will increase operating margins include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Occupancy Leverage &#8212;We believe that our real estate transformation will allow us to better leverage our fixed occupancy costs. Our next generation Design Galleries are expected to generate increased sales volumes in each market. We expect that these increased sales volumes, coupled with the favorable anchor tenant-type economics and lower rent per square foot, as compared to our legacy Galleries, will provide significant leverage of our retail occupancy costs. We also expect leverage in our supply chain occupancy as we optimize our inventory investments over time and further leverage our distribution center infrastructure. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Advertising Cost Leverage &#8212;We believe the physical expression and retail experience in our next generation Design Galleries serve as the best form of advertising for RH. Our next generation Design Galleries are expected to generate increased sales volumes in each market as compared to the legacy Gallery in that market. As a result, the higher sales volumes achieved will leverage our fixed advertising expenditures in each market. We also continue to explore opportunities to further optimize our Source Book strategy and enhance our on-line marketing initiatives. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Improved Product Margin &#38; Shipping Efficiencies &#8212;We believe we can obtain additional operating margin expansion from improved product margins and shipping efficiencies. We believe we have pricing power that should continue to improve as we continue to take market share in the highly-fragmented luxury home furnishings market. As our newer categories and products gain scale, we also expect improved vendor pricing. In addition, we anticipate further efficiencies of in-sourcing our home delivery locations and opportunities to optimize our shipping model over time. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Other Selling, General and Administrative Expenses &#8212;We believe we still have significant opportunity to leverage our fixed corporate and other general and administrative expenses as we increase our sales. 

Pursue International Expansion. We plan to strategically expand our business into select countries outside of the United States and Canada in the future. We believe that our luxury brand positioning and unique aesthetic will have strong international appeal. 

Products and Product Development

We have positioned RH as a lifestyle brand and design authority by offering dominant merchandise assortments. We are merchants of luxury home furnishings and our luxury products embody our design aesthetic and reflect inspiration from across the centuries and around the globe.

We have developed a proprietary product development platform that is fully integrated from ideation to presentation. Key aspects of our product development platform are: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Organization &#8212;We have established a collaborative, cross-functional organization centered on product leadership and coordinated across our product development, sourcing, merchandising, inventory and creative teams. Our product teams are focused on maximizing the sales potential of each product category across all channels, which eliminates channel conflicts and functional redundancies. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Process &#8212;For many of our products, we work closely with our network of artisan partners who possess specialized product development and manufacturing capabilities and who we consider an extension of our product development team. We collaborate with our global network of specialty vendors and manufacturers to produce artisanal pieces on a large scale with a high level of quality and value, including both distinctive original designs and reinterpretations of antiques. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Facility &#8212;We have built the RH Center of Innovation and Product Leadership , a facility which supports the entire product development process from product ideation to presentation for all channels. 

As a result of our proprietary organization, process and facility, our typical product lead times are 3 &#8211; 9 months, which enhances our ability to introduce more new products with each collection. In addition, our product development platform, sourcing capabilities and significant scale enable us to reduce our product costs.

Sales Channels 

We distribute our products through a fully integrated sales platform comprised of our stores, catalogs and websites. We believe the level of integration among all of our channels and our approach to the market distinguishes us from most other retailers. For fiscal 2015, sales of products originating in our stores represented 51% of our net revenues, while sales from our direct business represented 49% of our net revenues. We believe our channels complement each other and our customers&#8217; buying decisions are influenced by their experiences across more than one of our sales channels. We encourage our customers to shop across our channels and have aligned 

&#160;

o ur business and internal organization to be channel agnostic. Our integrated distribution and product delivery network serves all of our channels. We believe the key advantage of our multiple sales channels is our ability to leverage the unique attributes of each channel in our approach to the market. 

Stores 

Retail Galleries

Our retail galleries are located primarily in upscale malls and street locations, as well as in iconic locations. We believe situating our galleries in desirable locations with high visibility is critical to the success of our business, and we identify gallery locations based on several store specific aspects including geographic location, demographics, and proximity to other high-end specialty retail stores. We pursue a market-based sales strategy, whereby we assess each market&#8217;s overall sales potential and how best to approach the market across all of our channels. We customize square footage and catalog circulation to maximize each market&#8217;s sales potential and increase our return on invested capital. 

Our retail galleries reinforce our luxury brand aesthetic and are highly differentiated from other home furnishings retailers. We have revolutionized the customer experience by showcasing products in a sophisticated lifestyle setting that we believe is on par with world-class interior designers, consistent with the imagery and product presentation featured in our catalogs and on our websites. Products in our galleries are presented in fully appointed rooms, emphasizing collections over individual pieces. This presentation encourages a higher average order value as customers are inspired to consider purchasing a full collection of products to replicate the design aesthetic experienced in our galleries. In addition, because less than 10% of our merchandise assortment is displayed in our legacy Galleries, our store associates use iPads and other devices to allow customers to shop our entire merchandise assortment while in the gallery.

During fiscal 2015, we opened RH Chicago, The Gallery at the Three Arts Club in Chicago&#8217;s Gold Coast. This first-of-its-kind retail concept represents our initial foray into hospitality with a seamlessly integrated culinary offering, which includes the 3 Arts Club Caf&#233;, the 3 Arts Club Wine Vault &#38; Tasting Room, and the 3 Arts Club Pantry &#38; Espresso Bar. 

We define leased selling square footage as retail space at our stores used to sell our products. Leased selling square footage excludes backrooms used for storage, office space or similar purpose, as well as exterior sales space located outside a store, such as courtyards, gardens and rooftops. We currently operate five distinct store types with the following average leased selling square footage as of January 30, 2016: 

&#160;

1) 

Next generation Design Galleries; which include our Galleries in Atlanta, Chicago, Denver and Tampa, and which average approximately 43,000 leased selling square feet; 

&#160;

2) 

Initial larger format Design Galleries; which include our Galleries in Houston, Scottsdale, Boston, Indianapolis, Greenwich, and Los Angeles, and which average approximately 19,000 leased selling square feet; 

&#160;

3) 

Legacy Galleries, which average approximately 8,000 leased selling square feet;

&#160;

4) 

The RH Modern Gallery, which is located in Los Angeles and is approximately 13,000 leased selling square feet; and 

&#160;

5) 

RH Baby &#38; Child Galleries, which average approximately 4,000 leased selling square feet. 

We continue to evaluate potential opportunities for stand-alone RH Baby &#38; Child, RH Teen and RH Modern Galleries in key markets.

&#160;

As of January 30, 2016, we operated a total of 69 retail galleries throughout the United States and Canada, consisting of 53 legacy Galleries, 6 larger format Design Galleries, 4 next generation Design Galleries, 1 RH Modern Galle ry and 5 RH Baby &#38; Child Galleries. The following list shows the number of retail galleries in each U.S. state and each Canadian province where we operate as of January 30, 2016:

We continually analyze opportunities to selectively consolidate stores in connection with openings of our next generation Design Galleries or close stores that have been under-performing or are no longer consistent with our brand positioning. In many cases, we continue to operate a store until its lease has expired in order to effect the closure in a cost-efficient manner.

Outlet Stores 

As of January 30, 2016, we operated 17 outlet stores in 12 states in the United States and Canada. Our outlet stores are branded as Restoration Hardware Outlet or RH Outlet and are primarily located in large outlet malls. Our outlet stores serve as an efficient means to sell discontinued or irregular inventory outside of our core sales channels.

E-Commerce 

Our primary websites, www.restorationhardware.com , www.rh.com and www.rhbabyandchild.com , provide our customers with the ability to purchase our merchandise online. In September 2015, we launched www.rhteen.com and www.rhmodern.com , e-commerce enabled websites devoted to our teen furnishings category and to our modern product assortment.

&#160;

Our e-commerce platform allows our customers to experience the RH lifestyle reflected in our catalogs and throughout our stores, and to shop substantially all of our current product assortment. We update our websites regularly to reflect product availability and special offers.

The websites also offer room-based navigation, which allows the customer to envision and shop items by room or by product, expanding on the richness of the online experience. For example, customers can search our websites for products by size or color, browse through our extensive product categories and see detailed information about each item and collection, such as dimensions, materials and care instructions. Additionally, customers can select color swatches and view merchandise displayed with different color and fabric options. 

&#160;

Source Books 

We produce a series of catalogs, which we refer to as Source Books, to showcase our merchandise assortment. In fiscal 2015, these included our Interiors, Outdoor, RH Modern, RH Teen, RH Baby &#38; Child, Small Spaces, Bath, Linens, Rugs, Lighting and Holiday Source Books. Our Source Books, which showcase nearly our entire product assortment, are one of our primary branding and advertising vehicles. We have found that when we display a greater merchandise assortment in our Source Books, we experience increased sales across all of our channels. As in our retail stores, our Source Books present our merchandise in lifestyle settings that reflect our unique design aesthetic. Our Source Books also feature profiles of select artisan vendors and other compelling editorial content regarding home d&#233;cor. All creative work on our Source Books is coordinated in-house in our RH Center of Innovation &#38; Product Leadership , providing us greater control over the brand image presented to our customers, while also reducing our Source Book production costs. 

Our Source Book mailings serve as a key driver of sales through both our websites and retail stores. Our customers respond to the Source Books across all of our channels, with sales trends closely correlating to the assortments that we emphasize and feature prominently both in our Source Books and in our stores. We continue to evaluate and optimize our Source Book strategy based on our experience.

We maintain a database of customer information, which includes sales patterns, detailed purchasing information, certain demographic information, geographic locations and mailing and email addresses. We mail our Source Books to addresses within this database and to addresses provided to us by third parties. The database supports our ability to analyze our customers&#8217; buying behaviors across sales channels and facilitates the development of targeted marketing strategies, and is maintained in accordance with our privacy policy disclosed on our website. We segment our customer files based on multiple variables, and we tailor our Source Book mailings and emails in response to the purchasing patterns and product needs of our customers. We focus on continually improving the segmentation of customer files and the expansion of our customer database.

Our Source Books, in concert with our e-commerce channel, are a cost-effective means of testing new products, and allow us to launch categories in a disciplined, expeditious and cost-effective manner. 

Phone Orders

In addition to making purchases in our stores or online, customers, including those from our Trade and Contract businesses, can place orders over the phone by calling our customer service associates. In fiscal 2015, phone orders represented approximately 11% of net revenues.

Trade and Contract

In addition to our core channels, we continue to expand into professional services channels, including Trade and Contract. In the Trade channel, we work directly with independent interior designers purchasing for their businesses. Separately, we sell directly to customers who make purchases with the assistance of their own interior designers or decorators, which we refer to as &#8220;designer-assisted sales.&#8221; Our Contract business services hospitality, real estate development and other business clients. These channels offer additional avenues for reaching new customers, including both businesses and individuals.

Marketing and Advertising 

We employ a variety of marketing and advertising vehicles to drive customer traffic across all our channels, strengthen and reinforce our brand image and acquire new customers. These include targeted Source Book circulation, promotional mailings, email communications, online and print advertisements, and public relations activities and events. We maintain a database of customers, which includes sales patterns, detailed purchasing information, certain demographic information, geographic locations and mailing and email addresses. We use our customer database to tailor our programs and increase productivity of our marketing and promotion initiatives. We leverage our marketing and advertising expenses across all our channels as we seek to optimize the efficiency of our investment. 

Our stores and our Source Books are the primary branding and advertising vehicles for the RH brands. The highly-differentiated design aesthetic and shopping environment of our stores drive customer traffic not only to our stores but also to our direct channels. Our Source Books and targeted emails further reinforce the RH brand image and drive sales across all of our sales channels. We also engage in a wide range of other marketing, promotional and public relations activities to promote our brands. These campaigns include media coverage in design, lifestyle, culture/society and specialty publications, as well as in-store events related to new store openings and product launches. We also engage print advertising in brand-relevant publications such as Architectural Digest, DuJour, 

&#160;

Elle D&#233;cor , Town and Country, Veranda and others, and from time to time have also engage d in online advertising. We believe that these efforts will drive increased brand awareness, leading to higher sales in our stores and our direct business over time. 

Sourcing 

We primarily contract with third-party vendors for the manufacture of our merchandise. Our sourcing strategy focuses on identifying and using vendors that can provide the quality materials and fine craftsmanship that our customers expect of our brand. To ensure that our high standards of quality and timely delivery of merchandise are met, we work closely with vendors and manufacturers. Our products are generally made from readily available raw materials. We seek to ensure the consistent quality of our manufacturers&#8217; products by selectively inspecting pre-production samples, conducting periodic site visits to certain of our vendors&#8217; production facilities and selectively inspecting inbound shipments at our distribution facilities. In fiscal 2015, we sourced approximately 75% of our purchase dollar volume from approximately 30 vendors. In fiscal 2015, one vendor accounted for approximately 12% of our purchase dollar volume. Based on total dollar volume of purchases for fiscal 2015, approximately 82% of our products were sourced in Asia, the majority of which originated from China, 11% from the United States and the remainder from other regions.

RH is committed to offering safe, legal, high quality products, made consistently with our values. RH has a Compliance and Social Responsibility team dedicated to ensuring we keep these commitments through product testing, audits and other verification methods. Product testing is a core process for our organization. In fiscal 2014, RH Baby &#38; Child received GREENGUARD Gold Certification of nursery furniture, which demonstrates that these products are low-emitting, thus contributing to better indoor air quality. GREENGUARD Gold Certified products aid in the creation of healthier indoor environments, by emitting fewer airborne compounds that can contribute to health issues including asthma and other respiratory conditions. We are in the process of obtaining GREENGUARD Gold Certification for all of our furniture products.

We have a limited number of long-term merchandise supply contracts, but we believe that we generally have strong relationships with our product vendors. Although we transact business primarily on an order-by-order basis, we typically work with many of our vendors over extended periods of time, and many vendors are making long-term capacity investments to serve our increasing demands. Over the last several years, we engaged in a sourcing initiative to develop closer relationships with our vendors in order to achieve better efficiencies and further improve our product development process. Through this process, we have eliminated the use of most third party purchasing agents in favor of a model in which we directly manage our vendors. We have achieved significant cost savings and other efficiencies from this initiative. 

Distribution and Delivery

We manage the distribution and delivery of our products through our six distribution centers, which are located strategically throughout the United Stated. Each of our distribution centers serves all of our sales channels. 

We offer a white glove home delivery service for our larger merchandise and furniture categories, where delivery personnel assist our customers by delivering fully assembled items to the location of their choice. We operate portions of our home delivery services in ten key markets to leverage operating costs and improve our customers&#8217; delivery experience, while reducing returns and damage to our products. We plan to continue to in-source these services in additional markets over time. 

Through expansions and upgrades to our warehousing, distribution and delivery operations, we have improved our supply chain and fulfillment capabilities, and have built a scalable infrastructure with significant capacity to support our future growth. We believe our enhanced supply chain and fulfillment operations allow us to manage customer orders and distribute merchandise to stores and customers in an efficient and cost-effective manner. We also believe that these upgrades have improved customer satisfaction by reducing delivery times, reducing damage to merchandise, and improving our customer&#8217;s overall buying experience.

We intend to continue to strengthen our supply chain operations through a number of key initiatives in fiscal 2016 designed to improve our fulfillment and delivery logistics performance and to achieve greater efficiencies in the management of our inventories.

&#160;

Management and Information Technology 

We use industry-standard information technology systems to provide customer service, business process support, and business intelligence across our sales channels. Our technology team continues to upgrade several of our core systems, including: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Implementing enhanced in-store, web, and care center customer service and commerce technology to provide enhanced capabilities to support our luxury customer experience; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Optimizing and enhancing inventory management capabilities to improve inventory productivity and service levels across our supply chain; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Implementing enhanced special order capabilities optimizing processes to support our increasingly expanding product assortment; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Upgrading our web commerce and in-store capabilities with state-of-the art technology to optimize performance and improve the customer shopping experience; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Implementing supply chain technology and enhancements to support our expanding supply chain network improving operating efficiencies, accuracy, and service levels; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Optimizing and enhancing our enterprise data warehouse platform to expand data analysis areas to allow more timely and complete analysis of current business trends, results, and comparisons to our historical performance. 

We believe these substantial upgrades to our information technology systems provide management with the ability to drive ongoing improvement in our operating model, focus on efficiency opportunities, and increase management control. New access to results through our technology tools also equips management to more timely identify, analyze and respond to business trends. 

Over the next several years, we intend to further enhance our IT capabilities to support our growth. Key initiatives include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Further enhancing our delivery, order orchestration, inventory optimization, procurement, order management and vendor collaboration solutions to maximize operating efficiencies focused on enhancing the end-to-end customer experience; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Continuing our expansion and redefinition of business intelligence capabilities to optimize information for timely decision making in areas such as supply chain and customer experience. 

We are committed to a high level of integration in technology across our business. We believe our approach to technology demonstrates an appropriate balance of strategic planning and innovation to support both today&#8217;s business and tomorrow&#8217;s growth.

Competition 

The home furnishings industry is highly competitive. We primarily compete against a large number of independent retailers that provide unique items and custom-designed product offerings at high price points, including antique dealers and home furnishings retailers who market to the interior design community. We also compete with national and regional home furnishings retailers and department stores, as well as with mail order catalogs and online retailers focused on home furnishings. 

We believe we compete primarily on the basis of design, quality, value and customer service. We believe our distinct combination of design, quality and value allows us to compete effectively and we believe we differentiate ourselves from competitors based on the strength of our brand, products and our fully integrated multi-channel business model. We compete with the interior design trade and specialty merchants by providing a broader product assortment at an exceptional value based both upon the price and quality of our products. We compete against certain other home furnishings retailers primarily by offering what we believe are superior quality, highly distinctive design styles and a sophisticated lifestyle presentation in our product offering. 

We also believe that our success depends in substantial part on our ability to originate and define product trends, as well as to timely anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands. Certain of our competitors are larger and have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us. However, many smaller specialty retailers may lack the financial resources, infrastructure, scale and national brand identity necessary to compete effectively with us. We believe we are effectively positioned between these two market segments to gain market share and drive growth.

&#160;

Employees 

As of January 30, 2016, we had approximately 4,600 employees, of which approximately 800 were part-time employees. As of that date, approximately 2,200 of our employees were based in our stores. None of our employees are represented by a union, and we have had no labor-related work stoppages. We believe our relations with our employees are good. 

Intellectual Property 

The &#8220;RH&#8221;, &#8220;Restoration Hardware,&#8221; &#8220;RH Baby &#38; Child,&#8221; &#8220;RH Modern,&#8221; and &#8220;RH Teen&#8221; trademarks, among others, are registered or are the subject of pending trademark applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and with the trademark registries of several foreign countries. Each of our trademark registrations is perpetually renewable provided that we use or continue to use the trademarks in commerce in the particular geographic market and for the goods or services covered by the registration. In addition, we own many domain names, including &#8220;restorationhardware.com,&#8221; &#8220;rh.com,&#8221; &#8220;rhbabyandchild.com,&#8221; &#8220;rhmodern.com,&#8221; and &#8220;rhteen.com&#8221; and others that include our trademarks. These domain names are perpetually renewable. We own design patents or pending applications to protect the ornamental appearance of several of our products. These design patents are valid for 14 years from the date of issuance. We own copyrights, including copyright registrations or pending applications, for several of our Source Books. We believe that our trademarks, design patents, and copyrights have significant value and we will vigorously protect them against infringement. 

Fluctuation in Quarterly Results

Our quarterly results have historically varied depending upon a variety of factors, including our product offerings, promotional events, store openings, shifts in the timing of holidays and the timing of Source Book releases, among other things. As a result of these factors, our working capital requirements and demands on our product distribution and delivery network may fluctuate during the year. Unique factors in any given quarter may affect period-to-period comparisons between the quarters being compared, and the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that we may achieve for a full fiscal year.

Regulation and Legislation 

We are subject to numerous regulations, including labor and employment laws, customs, laws governing truth-in-advertising, consumer protection, privacy, safety, real estate, environmental and zoning and occupancy laws, and other laws and regulations that regulate retailers and govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of our galleries, outlets and warehouse facilities, both in the United States and Canada, as well as in jurisdictions from which we source our products. We believe we are in material compliance with laws applicable to our business.
