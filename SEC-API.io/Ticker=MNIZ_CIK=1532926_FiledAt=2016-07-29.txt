 ITEM 1: BUSINESS 

&#160; 

BRK Inc. (The Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 22, 2008. 

&#160;

The Company has designed a unique solution to a common household problem; broken vertical blinds. The Company has also designed and built a machine to manufacture the solution, which is our product: The Blind Repair Kit. Preliminary market testing indicates consumer acceptance although further and more extensive offerings are needed to confirm initial results. 

&#160;

The blind repair kit product consists of a specially made plastic mold that provides seamless, invisible repairs for vertical blinds that has had their "hanging hole" ripped. It allows the blind owner to extend the life of the blind vane and eliminates the need to special order or replace blinds due to damage. The Blind Repair Kit is manufactured in the US in our own facility, allowing us to monitor quality and delivery dates.
