 Item 1: Business 

Overview 

We are a global leader in digital interactive entertainment. We develop, market, publish and distribute games, content and services that can be played by consumers on a variety of platforms, which include consoles (such as the PlayStation from Sony and Xbox from Microsoft), PCs, mobile phones and tablets. 

We were incorporated originally in California in 1982. In September 1991, we were reincorporated under the laws of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 209 Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City, California 94065 and our telephone number is (650) 628-1500. 

Our Strategy 

We have three core strategies: 

&#8226; Players First 

&#8226; Commitment to Digital 

&#8226; One EA 

Players First 

Players are the foundation of our success, and we are committed to thinking about players first in everything we do. Our goal is to build deep, on-going relationships with our players. We aim to build these relationships by creating amazing games and services that deliver long-lasting fun and enduring value. 

Our games and services are based on a portfolio of intellectual property that includes established brands such as FIFA, Madden NFL, Star Wars, Battlefield, the Sims and Need for Speed. We were the number one publisher on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles and the number four publisher on mobile in the Western World for calendar year 2015 based on available sources and EA estimates. We achieved this result by delivering popular and award-winning games to our players, including FIFA 16, Madden NFL 16, Star Wars Battlefront &#32;and Battlefield: Hardline . 

Commitment to Digital 

Players increasingly are buying and playing games digitally rather than purchasing disc-based games from retailers. In addition, players are engaging with those games for longer periods of time, as they purchase additional content and services that we provide digitally. For example, features such as the Ultimate Team mode in our FIFA, Madden NFL and NHL games and digitally delivered expansion packs for our Star Wars, Battlefield and Sims franchises have extended the life of those games by engaging players over longer periods of time. This digital transformation also is creating opportunities in platforms, content models and modalities of play. For example, we have leveraged franchises historically associated with consoles and traditional 

PC gaming, such as FIFA, Madden NFL, The Sims, SimCity, and Star Wars, to create mobile and PC free-to-download games that are monetized through a business model in which we sell incremental content and/or features in discrete transactions. 

Our digital transformation also gives us the opportunity to strengthen our player network. We are investing in a technology foundation to enable us to build player relationships that can last for years instead of for days or weeks by connecting our players to us and to each other. This connection allows us to market and deliver content and services for popular franchises like FIFA, Battlefield and Star Wars to our players more efficiently. That same foundation also enables new player-centric ways to discover and try new experiences, such as our subscription-based EA Access and Origin Access services. 

We believe that our digital revenue, which generally has a higher gross margin relative to packaged goods sales revenue, will continue to increase during fiscal year 2017 relative to packaged goods revenue and in absolute terms as we continue to focus on developing and monetizing products and services that can be delivered digitally. 

One EA 

The pursuit of our goals requires that we operate as one team that is faster, more focused and constantly evolving, and we have undertaken a cultural shift across our organization in order to become more flexible. We have changed how we develop our games, engaging players through alphas, betas and other programs to seek out more feedback earlier in the game development process. We have also changed the makeup and skill set of our workforce, and combined the art of game-making with the science of managing dynamic live services and marketing those games and services. These changes have enabled us to increase our operational speed and organizational flexibility while improving our fiscal discipline. 

Our Games and Services 

We develop games and services for consoles, PCs, mobile phones and tablets, and we market and sell our games and services through retail channels and through digital distribution channels. We believe that flexibility across platforms and distribution channels is critical to maintaining and growing our overall consumer base, which continues to evolve in response to the introduction of new platforms and business models. New gaming platforms, engagement models and business models are expected to continue to emerge in the future, and we intend to evaluate these new platform, engagement and business model opportunities on a case-by-case basis. 

Digitally, our console games, additional content and online services can be purchased through Sony&#8217;s PlayStation Network and Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox Store. Our PC games and additional content can be downloaded directly through our Origin online platform, as well as through third-party online download stores. Our mobile, tablet and PC free-to-download games and additional content are available through third-party application storefronts such as the Apple App Store and Google Play. Our massively multi-player online service, Star Wars: The Old Republic , is available both as a free-to-download and as a subscription basis, and certain casual games such as card, puzzle and word games are available through our Pogo online service. 

Our packaged goods games are sold in mass market retailers (such as Walmart), electronics specialty stores (such as Best Buy) and game software specialty stores (such as GameStop). Our direct sales to GameStop Corp. represented approximately 11 percent and 13 percent of total net revenue in fiscal years 2015, and 2014, respectively. We sell our games to GameStop Corp. pursuant to numerous and frequent individual purchase orders, which contain delivery and pricing terms. There are no minimum sales or purchase commitments between us and GameStop. 

In our games, we utilize established brands that we either wholly own (such as Battlefield, Mass Effect, Need for Speed, The Sims and Plants v. Zombies) or license from others (such as FIFA, Madden NFL and Star Wars). From time to time, we contract with external game developers, such as Respawn Entertainment, to develop our games or to publish and distribute their games. We also partner with third parties to publish our mobile and PC games in certain Asian territories, such as our partnerships with Tencent Holdings Limited and Nexon Co. Ltd. for FIFA Online 3 &#32;in China and Korea, respectively. We believe that leveraging established brands across a diverse range of genres and platforms enables us to build long-term relationships with a wide variety of players. In fiscal year 2016, revenue from sales of FIFA 16 &#32;represented approximately 16 percent of our total net revenue; in fiscal year 2015, revenue from sales of FIFA 15 &#32;represented approximately 15 percent of our total net revenue; and in fiscal year 2014, revenue from sales of FIFA 14 &#32;represented approximately 15 percent of our total net revenue. 

We also are investing in a number of long-term initiatives that we believe will allow us to better serve and deepen our engagement with our players, such as our EA Competitive Gaming Division through which we will focus our efforts in competitive gaming and eSports. 

Significant Relationships 

Sony &#38; Microsoft . Under the terms of agreements we have entered into with Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. and its affiliates and with Microsoft Corporation and its affiliates, we are authorized to develop and distribute disc-based and digitally-delivered software products and services compatible with PlayStation 3 and 4 and the Xbox 360 and Xbox One, respectively. As of the date of this filing, we have not entered into a licensed publisher agreement with Sony for PlayStation 4, and the parties currently operate under the terms of existing agreements subject to a new pricing structure with respect to PlayStation 4. 

Under the agreements with Sony and Microsoft, we are provided with the non-exclusive right to use, for a fixed term and in a designated territory, technology that is owned or licensed by them to publish our games on their respective platform. Our transactions for disc-based products are made pursuant to individual purchase orders, which are accepted on a case-by case basis by Sony or Microsoft (or their designated replicators), as the case may be. For packaged goods products, we pay the console manufacturers a per-unit royalty for each unit manufactured. With respect to digitally-delivered products, other online content and services sold by the console manufacturers, the console manufacturers pay us either a wholesale price or a percentage royalty on the revenue they derive from their sales. Many key commercial terms of our relationships with Sony and Microsoft - such as manufacturing terms, delivery times, platform policies and approval conditions - are determined unilaterally, and are subject to change by the console manufacturers. Our direct sales to Sony represented approximately 16 percent of total net revenue in fiscal years 2016. Our direct sales to Microsoft represented approximately 14 percent and 10 percent of total net revenue in fiscal years 2016 and 2015 respectively. 

The platform license agreements also require us to indemnify the console manufacturers for any loss, liability and expense resulting from any claim against the console manufacturer regarding our games and services, including any claims for patent, copyright or trademark infringement brought against the console manufacturer. Each platform license may be terminated by the console manufacturer if a breach or default by us is not cured after we receive written notice from the console manufacturer, or if we become insolvent. The console manufacturers are not obligated to enter into platform license agreements with us for any future consoles, products or services. 

Apple, Google and Other App Stores . We have agreements to distribute our mobile applications and additional content through distribution partners worldwide, including Apple and Google. Consumers download our applications for their mobile devices from third party-application storefronts. The distributor charges the consumers a one-time fee if there is a cost to download the application. If the application is a &#8220;free-to-download&#8221; application, the distributor may still charge the consumer for additional content that is purchased by the consumer within the application. Our distribution agreements establish the fees to be retained by the distributor and the amounts passed through to us for distributing our applications and additional content. These arrangements are typically terminable on short notice. The agreements generally do not obligate the distributors to market or distribute any of our applications. 

Publishing Partners in Asia . We have entered into agreements whereby we partner with certain companies, including Tencent Holdings Limited and Nexon Co., Ltd. or their respective affiliates, pursuant to which these companies publish our mobile and PC free-to-download games in certain Asian territories, including China and Korea. Our players download games from the publishers&#8217; platforms, and are charged for additional content purchased within our game environment. The agreements generally establish the amounts that are retained by the publishers, and the amounts that are passed through to us. 

Competition 

The market for interactive entertainment is intensely competitive and changes rapidly as new products and platforms are introduced. We also face competition for the right to use certain intellectual property included in our products. We face significant competition, primarily from the following: 

&#8226; 

Companies that are focused on developing and publishing games that operate on consoles and on PCs, such as Activision Blizzard, Take-Two Interactive and Ubisoft, as well as diversified media companies such as Warner Bros. and Sony and Microsoft, each of which develops and publishes software for its respective console platform; 

&#8226; 

Companies that develop and publish mobile game applications; and 

&#8226; 

Companies that develop and publish PC free-to-download online gaming services. 

More broadly, we compete against providers of different sources of entertainment, such as motion pictures, television, social networking, online casual entertainment and music that our players could enjoy in their free time. Important competitive factors include game quality and ease of use, compatibility of products with certain platforms, brand recognition, price, marketing, and quality of customer service. 

Intellectual Property 

To establish and protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, patents, patent applications, trade secrets, know-how, license agreements, confidentiality provisions and procedures and other contractual provisions. We actively engage in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property. In addition, we engage in activities designed to limit the impact of abuse of our digital products and services, including monitoring our games for evidence of exploitation and re-balancing our game environments in the event that such abuse is discovered. 

Governmental Regulation 

We are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet. In addition, laws and regulations that may have an impact on our business relating to user privacy, data collection and retention, content, advertising and information security have been adopted or are being considered for adoption by many countries throughout the world. 

Seasonality 

We have historically experienced the highest percentage of our sales in our third fiscal quarter due to seasonal holiday demand; however, there can be no assurance that this will continue. In addition, we defer the recognition of a significant amount of net revenue related to our online-enabled games over an extended period of time. As a result, the quarter in which we generate the highest sales volume may be different from the quarter in which we recognize the highest amount of net revenue. 

Employees 

As of March 31, 2016, we had approximately 8,500 regular, full-time employees, over 5,200 of whom were outside the United States. We believe that our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is a critical factor in the successful development of our products and that our future success will depend, in large measure, on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees. Approximately 8 percent of our employees, all of whom work for DICE, our Swedish development studio, are represented by a union. 

Investor Information 

Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports filed pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act, as amended, are available free of charge on the Investor Relations section of our website at http://ir.ea.com as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;).
