Business

Introduction 

&#160;

Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated, a Delaware corporation (together with its majority-owned subsidiaries, the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;), produces, markets and distributes nonalcoholic beverages, primarily products of The Coca-Cola Company, which include some of the most recognized and popular beverage brands in the world. The Company was incorporated in 1980, and its predecessors have been in the nonalcoholic beverage manufacturing and distribution business since 1902. We are the largest independent Coca-Cola bottler in the United States.

&#160;

We hold various agreements under which we produce, distribute and market sparkling beverages of The Coca-Cola Company, still beverages of The Coca-Cola Company such as POWERade, vitaminwater, Minute Maid Juices To Go and Dasani water products, and various other products, including Dr Pepper, Sundrop and Monster Energy products. Historically, our operational footprint included markets located in North Carolina, South Carolina, south Alabama, south Georgia, central Tennessee, western Virginia and West Virginia (the &#8220;Legacy Territories&#8221;).

&#160;

Since April 2013, as part of The Coca-Cola Company&#8217;s plans to refranchise its North American bottling territories, we have engaged in a series of transactions with The Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola Refreshments, Inc. (&#8220;CCR&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Coca-Cola Company, to expand our distribution operations significantly through the acquisition both of rights to serve additional distribution territories previously served by CCR (the &#8220;Expansion Territories&#8221;) and of related distribution assets (the &#8220;Distribution Expansion Transactions&#8221;). The Company&#8217;s rights to distribute and market beverage products of The Coca-Cola Company in the Expansion Territories are governed by a Comprehensive Beverage Agreement entered into at each closing for Expansion Territories and are different from the rights we hold under agreements with The Coca-Cola Company to serve the markets located in the Legacy Territories. 

&#160;

The Company has acquired the following Expansion Territories as of January 3, 2016:

&#160;

In addition to expanding our distribution territory, in September 2015 and February 2016, we announced our intention to engage in a series of transactions with The Coca-Cola Company and CCR to purchase seven manufacturing facilities (the &#8220;Expansion Manufacturing Facilities&#8221;) and related assets (the &#8220;Manufacturing Facility Expansion Transactions&#8221; and, together with the Distribution Expansion Transactions, the &#8220;Expansion Transactions&#8221;).

&#160;

As of January 3, 2016, The Coca-Cola Company owned approximately 34.8% of our outstanding common stock, representing approximately 5.0% of the total voting power of our common stock and Class B common stock voting together as a single class. The Coca-Cola Company does not own any shares of our Class B common stock. J. Frank Harrison, III, the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;), currently owns or controls approximately 86% of the combined voting power of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock and Class B common stock as of January 3, 2016.

Beverage Products 

Nonalcoholic beverage products that we produce, market and distribute can be broken down into two categories:

&#160;

&#183; 

Sparkling beverages &#8211; beverages with carbonation, including energy drinks; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Still beverages &#8211; beverages without carbonation, including bottled water, tea, ready-to-drink coffee, enhanced water, juices and sports drinks. 

Sales of sparkling beverages were approximately 80%, 81% and 82% of total net sales for fiscal 2015 (&#8220;2015&#8221;), fiscal 2014 (&#8220;2014&#8221;) and fisca l 2013 (&#8220;2013&#8221;), respectively. Sales of still beverages were approximately 20%, 19%, and 18% of total net sales for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

The Company&#8217;s principal sparkling beverage is Coca-Cola. In each of the last three fiscal years, sales of products bearing the &#8220;Coca-Cola&#8221; or &#8220;Coke&#8221; trademark have accounted for more than half of our bottle/can volume to retail customers. In total, products of The Coca-Cola Company accounted for approximately 87%, 88% and 88% of our bottle/can volume to retail customers during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

&#160;

We offer a range of flavors designed to meet the demands of our consumers. The main packaging materials for our beverages are plastic bottles and aluminum cans. In addition, we provide restaurants and other immediate consumption outlets with fountain or &#8220;post-mix&#8221; products. Post-mix products are dispensed through equipment that mixes the fountain syrup with carbonated or still water, enabling fountain retailers to sell finished products to consumers in cups or glasses.

&#160;

Prior to August 2015, a subsidiary of the Company had developed certain beverage products which the Company, CCR and certain other Coca-Cola franchise bottlers marketed and distributed in the territories they served. These products included Tum-E Yummies, a vitamin-C enhanced flavored drink, and Fuel in a Bottle power shots. We sold this subsidiary to The Coca-Cola Company in August 2015, but we continue to distribute Tum-E Yummies in the territories we serve. 

&#160;

The following table sets forth some of our most important products, including products that both The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies have licensed to us.

Beverage Agreements for Legacy Territories 

&#160;

We hold a number of contracts with The Coca-Cola Company which entitle us to produce, market and distribute in the Legacy Territories The Coca-Cola Company&#8217;s nonalcoholic beverages in bottles, cans and five gallon pressurized pre-mix containers. We have similar arrangements with Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. and other beverage companies for the Legacy Territories. For the Expansion Territories, the Company holds its rights to market and distribute The Coca-Cola Company&#8217;s nonalcoholic beverages under Comprehensive Beverage Agreements that do not include the right to produce such beverages. The beverage agreements pertaining to the Expansion Territories are described below following the description of contracts for the Legacy Territories under the heading &#8220;Beverage Agreements with The Coca-Cola Company for the Expansion Territories&#8221; and &#8220;Beverage Agreements with Other Licensors for the Expansion Territories.&#8221;

&#160;

We purchase concentrates from The Coca-Cola Company and produce, market and distribute its principal sparkling beverages in the Legacy Territories under two basic forms of beverage agreements with The Coca-Cola Company: (i) beverage agreements that cover sparkling beverages bearing the trademark &#8220;Coca-Cola&#8221; or &#8220;Coke&#8221; (the &#8220;Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages&#8221; and &#8220;Cola Beverage Agreements&#8221;), and (ii) beverage agreements that cover other sparkling beverages of The Coca-Cola Company (the &#8220;Allied Beverages&#8221; and &#8220;Allied Beverage Agreements&#8221; or collectively referred to as the &#8220;Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements&#8221;). The Company is party to Cola Beverage Agreements and Allied Beverage Agreements for various specified Legacy Territories.

&#160;

We also purchase as finished goods and distribute certain still beverages, such as sports drinks and juice drinks, from The Coca-Cola Company (or its designees or joint ventures), and produce, market and distribute Dasani water products, pursuant to the terms of marketing and distribution agreements applicable to the Legacy Territories (the &#8220;Still Beverage Agreements&#8221;).

&#160;

Cola Beverage Agreements with The Coca-Cola Company

&#160;

The Cola Beverage Agreements for the Legacy Territories provide that we will purchase our entire requirements of concentrates or syrups for Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages from The Coca-Cola Company at prices, terms of payment, and other terms and conditions of supply determined from time-to-time by The Coca-Cola Company at its sole discretion and prohibit us from producing, distributing, or handling cola products other than those of The Coca-Cola Company. We have the exclusive right to manufacture and distribute Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages for sale in authorized containers in the Legacy Territories. The Coca-Cola Company may determine, at its sole discretion, what types of containers are authorized for use with its products. The Company may not sell Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages outside of the Legacy Territories except by agreement with The Coca-Cola Company.

&#160;

We are obligated, among other things, to:

&#160;

&#183; 

maintain such plant and equipment, staff and distribution and vending facilities that are capable of manufacturing, packaging, and distributing Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages in accordance with the Cola Beverage Agreements and in sufficient quantities to satisfy fully the demand for these beverages in the Legacy Territories; 

&#160;

&#183; 

undertake quality control measures and maintain sanitation standards prescribed by The Coca-Cola Company; 

&#160;

&#183; 

develop, stimulate and satisfy fully the demand for Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages in the Legacy Territories; 

&#160;

&#183; 

use all approved means and spend such funds on advertising and other forms of marketing as may be reasonably required to satisfy that objective; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

maintain such sound financial capacity as may be reasonably necessary to ensure the performance of our obligations to The Coca-Cola Company. 

&#160;

We are required to meet annually with The Coca-Cola Company to present our marketing, management, and advertising plans for the Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages for the upcoming year, including financial plans showing that we have the consolidated financial capacity to perform our duties and obligations to The Coca-Cola Company. The Coca-Cola Company may not unreasonably withhold approval of such plans. If we carry out these plans in all material respects, we will be deemed to have satisfied our obligations to develop, stimulate, and satisfy fully the demand for the Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages and to maintain the requisite financial capacity for the period of time covered by the plan. Failure to carry out such plans in all material respects would constitute an event of default that, if not cured within 120 days of written notice of the failure, would give The Coca-Cola Company the right to terminate the Cola Beverage Agreements. If at any time we fail to carry out a plan in all material respects in any geographic segment of the Legacy Territories, as defined by The Coca-Cola Company, and such failure is not cured within six months of written notice of the failure, The Coca-Cola Company may reduce the territory covered by that Cola Beverage Agreement by eliminating the portion of the territory in which such failure has occurred.

&#160;

The Coca-Cola Company has no obligation under the Cola Beverage Agreements to participate with us in expenditures for advertising and marketing. As it has in the past, The Coca-Cola Company may contribute to such expenditures and undertake independent advertising and marketing activities, as well as advertising and sales promotion programs which require mutual cooperation and financial support of the Company. The future levels of marketing funding support and promotional funds provided by The Coca-Cola Company may vary materially from the levels provided in prior years.

&#160;

If we acquire control, directly or indirectly, of any bottler of Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages, or any party controlling a bottler of Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages, we must cause the acquired bottler to amend its agreement for the Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages to conform to the terms of the Cola Beverage Agreements.

&#160;

The Cola Beverage Agreements are perpetual, subject to termination by The Coca-Cola Company upon the occurrence of an event of default by the Company. Events of default with respect to each Cola Beverage Agreement include:

&#160;

&#183; 

production, sale or ownership in any entity which produces or sells any cola product not authorized by The Coca-Cola Company or a cola product that might be confused with or is an imitation of the trade dress, trademark, tradename or authorized container of a cola product of The Coca-Cola Company; 

&#160;

&#183; 

insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, receivership, or the like; 

&#160;

&#183; 

any di sposition by the Company of any voting securities of any bottling company subsidiary without the consent of The Coca-Cola Company; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

any material breach of any of our obligations under that Cola Beverage Agreement that remains unresolved for 120 days after written notice by The Coca-Cola Company. 

&#160;

If any Cola Beverage Agreement is terminated because of an event of default, The Coca-Cola Company has the right to terminate all other Cola Beverage Agreements to which we are a party.

&#160;

We are prohibited from assigning, transferring or pledging our Cola Beverage Agreements or any interest therein, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior consent of The Coca-Cola Company. 

&#160;

&#160;

Allied Beverage Agreements with The Coca-Cola Company

&#160;

The Allied Beverage Agreements contain provisions that are similar to those of the Cola Beverage Agreements with respect to the sale of beverages outside the Legacy Territories, authorized containers, planning, quality control, transfer restrictions and related matters, but have certain significant differences from the Cola Beverage Agreements. Under the Allied Beverage Agreements, we have exclusive rights to distribute the Allied Beverages in authorized containers in specified Legacy Territories. Similar to the Cola Beverage Agreements, we have advertising, marketing, and promotional obligations, but without restriction for most brands as to the marketing of products with similar flavors, as long as there is no manufacturing or handling of other products that would imitate, infringe upon, or cause confusion with, the products of The Coca-Cola Company. The Coca-Cola Company has the right to discontinue any or all Allied Beverages, and the Company has a right, but not an obligation, under the Allied Beverage Agreements to elect to market any new beverage introduced by The Coca-Cola Company under the trademarks covered by the respective Allied Beverage Agreements.

&#160;

Allied Beverage Agreements have a term of 10 years and are renewable at our option for an additional 10 years at the end of each term. We intend to renew substantially all of the Allied Beverage Agreements as they expire. The Allied Beverage Agreements are subject to termination in the event of default by the Company. The Coca-Cola Company may terminate an Allied Beverage Agreement in the event of:

&#160;

&#183; 

insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, receivership, or the like; 

&#160;

&#183; 

termination of a Cola Beverage Agreement by either party for any reason; or 

&#160;

&#183; 

any material breach of any of our obligations under that Allied Beverage Agreement that remains unresolved for 120 days after required prior written notice by The Coca-Cola Company . 

&#160;

Supplementary Agreement Relating to Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements

&#160;

The Company and The Coca-Cola Company are parties to a Letter Agreement (the &#8220;Supplementary Agreement&#8221;) that supplements or modifies some of the provisions of the Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements. The Supplementary Agreement provides that The Coca-Cola Company will:

&#160;

&#183; 

exercise good faith and fair dealing in its relationship with us under the Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements; 

&#160;

&#183; 

offer marketing funding support and exercise its rights under the Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements in a manner consistent with its dealings with comparable bottlers; 

&#160;

&#183; 

offer to us any written amendment to the Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements (except amendments dealing with transfer of ownership) which it enters into with any other bottler in the United States which are parties to contracts substantially similar to the Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

subject to certain limited exceptions, sell syrups and concentrates to us at prices no greater than those charged to other bottlers which are parties to contracts substantially similar to the Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements. 

&#160;

The Supplementary Agreement also permits transfers of our capital stock that would otherwise be limited by the Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements.

&#160;

Impact of Territory Conversion Agreement on Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements

&#160;

Nearly all of our Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements are subject to being amended, restated and converted into a Final CBA pursuant to the Territory Conversion Agreement described below, as disclosed in the Company&#8217;s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) on September 28, 2015.

&#160;

&#160;

Pricing of Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages and Allied Beverages

&#160;

Pursuant to the Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements, except as provided in the Supplementary Agreement and in incidence-based pricing agreements, The Coca-Cola Company establishes the prices charged to the Company for concentrates of Coca-Cola Trademark Beverages and Allied Beverages. The Coca-Cola Company has no rights under the beverage agreements to establish the resale prices at which we sell its products.

&#160;

Since 2008, we have purchased concentrate from The Coca-Cola Company for all sparkling beverages for which we purchase concentrate from The Coca-Cola Company under an incidence-based pricing arrangement and have not purchased concentrates at standard concentrate prices as was our practice in prior years. During the two-year term of our incidence-based pricing agreement that ended on December 31, 2015, the pricing of such concentrate was governed by the incidence-based pricing model rather than the Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements for the Legacy Territories. Under the incidence-based pricing model, the concentrate price The Coca-Cola Company charges is impacted by a number of factors, including the incidence rate in effect, our pricing and sales of finished products, the channels in which the finished products are sold and package mix. We expect to enter into a similar incidence-based pricing agreement with The Coca-Cola Company during fiscal 2016.

&#160;

Still Beverage Agreements with The Coca-Cola Company

&#160;

The Still Beverage Agreements for the Legacy Territories contain provisions that are similar to the Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements with respect to authorized containers, planning, quality control, transfer restrictions and related matters, but have certain material differences. Unlike the Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements, which grant us exclusivity in the distribution of the covered beverages in the Legacy Territories, the Still Beverage Agreements grant exclusivity but permit The Coca-Cola Company to test-market the still beverage products in the Legacy Territories, subject to our right of first refusal, and to sell the still beverages to commissaries for delivery to retail outlets in the Legacy Territories where still beverages are consumed on-premises, such as restaurants. The Coca-Cola Company must pay us certain fees for lost volume, delivery, and taxes in the event of such commissary sales. Approved alternative route to market projects undertaken by the Company, The Coca-Cola Company, and other bottlers of Coca-Cola products would, in some instances, permit delivery of certain products of The Coca-Cola Company into the territories of almost all bottlers, in exchange for compensation in most circumstances, despite the terms of the beverage agreements making such territories exclusive. Also, under the Still Beverage Agreements for the Legacy Territories, we may not sell other beverages in the same product category.

&#160;

The Coca-Cola Company, at its sole discretion, establishes the prices we must pay for the still beverages purchased as finished goods or, in the case of Dasani, the concentrate or finished goods, but has agreed, under certain circumstances for some products, to give the benefit of more favorable pricing if such pricing is offered to other bottlers of Coca-Cola products.

&#160;

Each Still Beverage Agreement for the Legacy Territories has a term of 10 or 15 years and is renewable at our option for an additional 10 years at the end of each term. We intend to renew substantially all of the Still Beverage Agreements as they expire.

&#160;

Nearly all of our Still Beverage Agreements are subject to being amended, restated and converted into a Final CBA in the future pursuant to the Territory Conversion Agreement described below, as disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 28, 2015.

&#160;

Other Beverage Agreements with The Coca-Cola Company

&#160;

We have entered into a distribution agreement with Energy Brands, Inc. (&#8220;Energy Brands&#8221;), a wholly owned subsidiary of The Coca-Cola Company. Energy Brands, also known as glac&#233;au, is a producer and distributor of branded enhanced water products including vitaminwater and smartwater (still beverage products), and fruitwater (a sparkling water drink). The agreement has a term of 10 years and automatically renews for succeeding 10-year terms, subject to a 12-month nonrenewal notification by the Company. The agreement covers most of the Legacy Territories, requires us to distribute Energy Brands enhanced water products exclusively, and permits Energy Brands to distribute the products in some channels within the Legacy Territories.

&#160;

Nearly all of our agreements with Energy Brands are subject to being amended, restated and converted into a Final CBA in the future pursuant to the Territory Conversion Agreement described below, as disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 28, 2015.

&#160;

We also sell Coca-Cola and other post-mix products of The Coca-Cola Company on a non-exclusive basis. The Coca-Cola Company establishes the prices charged to us for its post-mix products. In addition, we produce some products for sale to other Coca-Cola bottlers and CCR. These sales have lower margins but allow us to achieve higher utilization of our production equipment and facilities.

&#160;

Beverage Agreements with Other Licensors

&#160;

We have beverage agreements for the Legacy Territories with Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. for Dr Pepper and Sundrop brands which are similar to the Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements for the Legacy Territories. These beverage agreements are perpetual in nature but may be terminated by us upon 90 days&#8217; notice. The price for syrup or concentrate is set by the beverage companies from time to time. These beverage agreements also contain similar restrictions on the use of trademarks, approved bottles, cans and labels and sale of imitations or substitutes as well as termination for cause provisions. We also sell post-mix products of Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.

&#160;

In 2015, we also signed a new distribution agreement with Monster Energy Company that substantially expanded the territory where we have rights to distribute energy drink products offered, packaged and/or marketed by Monster Energy Company under the primary brand name &#8220;Monster&#8221; so that it now includes the same geographic territory the Company services for the distribution of beverage products of The Coca-Cola Company.

&#160;

The territories covered by beverage agreements with other licensors for the Legacy Territories are not always aligned with the Legacy Territories covered by the Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements but are generally within those territory boundaries. Sales of beverages by the Company under these other agreements in the Legacy Territories represented approximately 13% of our bottle/can volume to retail customers for each of 2015, 2014 and 2013.

&#160;

The Expansion Transactions 

&#160;

Beginning in May 2014, we engaged in a series of Distribution Territory Expansion Transactions with The Coca-Cola Company and CCR. Each of the principal asset purchase agreements we entered into for Distribution Territory Expansion Transactions (the &#8220;Distribution Asset Purchase Agreements&#8221;) provided for us to (a) purchase from CCR (i) certain rights relating to the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of certain beverage brands not owned or licensed by The Coca-Cola Company (&#8220;cross-licensed brands&#8221;) but then distributed by CCR in the applicable portion of the Expansion Territories and (ii) certain assets related to the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of both The Coca-Cola Company brands and cross-licensed brands then distributed by CCR in the applicable portion of the Expansion Territories (collectively, &#8220;Transferred Assets&#8221;), and (b) assume certain liabilities and obligations of CCR relating to the business acquired. At each of the closings under the Distribution Asset Purchase Agreements, the Company, CCR and The Coca-Cola Company entered into a comprehensive beverage agreement (&#8220;Initial CBA&#8221;) pursuant to which CCR granted us certain exclusive rights (&#8220;CBA Rights&#8221;) to distribute, promote, market and sell the Covered Beverages and Related Products distinguished by the Trademarks (as those terms are defined in the Initial CBAs) in the applicable portion of the Expansion Territories in exchange for us agreeing to make a quarterly sub-bottling payment to CCR on a continuing basis.

&#160;

In April 2013, we entered into a non-binding letter of intent with The Coca-Cola Company (the &#8220;April 2013 LOI&#8221;) for the first Distribution Territory Expansion Transaction, which contemplated our acquisition of CBA Rights and Transferred Assets relating to distribution territories previously served by CCR in eastern Tennessee, central Kentucky and portions of Indiana (the &#8220;April 2013 LOI Territories&#8221;). From May 2014 to May 2015, we completed the acquisition of the April 2013 LOI Territories from CCR in a series of five asset purchase transactions and one asset exchange transaction (the &#8220;Asset Exchange Transaction&#8221;). In the Asset Exchange Transaction, we exchanged certain of our assets relating to the marketing, promotion, distribution and sale of Coca-Cola and other beverage products in the territory previously served by our facilities and equipment in Jackson, Tennessee, including the rights to produce such beverages in the Jackson, Tennessee territory, for certain assets of CCR relating to the marketing, promotion, distribution and sale of Coca-Cola and other beverage products in the portion of the April 2013 LOI Territories previously served by CCR&#8217;s facilities and equipment in Lexington, Kentucky, including the rights to produce such beverages in the Lexington, Kentucky territory. Our rights with respect to the Lexington, Kentucky territory are governed by Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements, Still Beverage Agreements and other agreements similar to those we have with respect to the Legacy Territories.

&#160;

In May 2015, we entered into a non-binding letter of intent with The Coca-Cola Company (the &#8220;May 2015 LOI&#8221;), which contemplated our acquisition from CCR, in two phases, of additional CBA Rights and Transferred Assets relating to distribution territories that include the major markets of Baltimore, Maryland; Alexandria, Norfolk and Richmond, Virginia; the District of Columbia; Cincinnati, Columbus and Dayton, Ohio; and Indianapolis, Indiana.

&#160;

In September 2015, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with CCR (the &#8220;September 2015 APA&#8221;) for the first phase of additional Distribution Territory Expansion Transactions contemplated by the May 2015 LOI for CBA Rights and Transferred Assets 

relating to distribution territories served by CCR in eastern and northern Virginia, most of Delaware, the entire State of Maryland, the District of Columbia, and parts of North Carolina, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. During 2015, we closed one Distribution Territory Expansion T ransaction under the September 2015 APA providing us with CBA Rights and Transferred Assets relating to distribution territories previously served by CCR in Norfolk, Fredericksburg and Staunton, Virginia and Elizabeth City, North Carolina. We are continui ng to work towards a definitive agreement with CCR for the remaining Distribution Territory Expansion Transactions contemplated by the May 2015 LOI for CBA Rights and Transferred Assets relating to distribution territories previously served by CCR in centr al and southern Ohio, northern Kentucky and parts of Indiana and Illinois. 

&#160;

In September 2015, we entered into a non-binding letter of intent with The Coca-Cola Company (the &#8220;September 2015 LOI&#8221;) which contemplated our acquisition of six regional manufacturing facilities and related assets from CCR in two phases.

&#160;

In October 2015, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with CCR (the &#8220;October 2015 APA&#8221;) for the first phase of Manufacturing Facility Expansion Transactions contemplated by the September 2015 LOI which provides for our acquisition of three regional manufacturing facilities located in Sandston, Virginia; Silver Springs, Maryland; and Baltimore, Maryland. We are continuing to work towards a definitive agreement with CCR for the remaining Manufacturing Facility Expansion Transactions contemplated by the September 2015 LOI, which includes three manufacturing facilities located in Indianapolis, Indiana; Portland, Indiana; and Cincinnati, Ohio.

&#160;

As part of these Expansion Transactions, we have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, to refrain until January 1, 2020 from acquiring or developing any line of business inside or outside of our territories governed by a Comprehensive Beverage Agreement or similar agreement without the consent of The Coca-Cola Company, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld.

&#160;

&#160;

Beverage Agreements with The Coca-Cola Company for the Expansion Territories

&#160;

Pursuant to the Initial CBAs entered into among the Company, CCR and The Coca-Cola Company at each of the closings under the Distribution Asset Purchase Agreements, we are obligated to make quarterly sub-bottling payments to CCR based on sales of certain beverages and beverage products that are sold under the same trademarks that identify a Covered Beverage, Related Product or certain cross-licensed brands. As of January 3, 2016, we had recorded a liability of $136.6 million to reflect the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration related to future sub-bottling payments. See Note 3 and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Other than the brands of The Coca-Cola Company and related products and expressly permitted existing cross-licensed brands sold in an Expansion Territory, each Initial CBA provides that we will not be permitted to produce, manufacture, prepare, package, distribute, sell, deal in or otherwise use or handle any beverages, beverage components or other beverage products in the Expansion Territory unless otherwise consented to by The Coca-Cola Company.

&#160;

We are obligated under the Initial CBAs to, among other things, make capital expenditures in our business in the Expansion Territories; buy exclusively from The Coca-Cola Company (directly or through CCR or another affiliate) or an authorized supplier, all beverage and related products we are authorized to distribute; expend funds for marketing and promoting the beverage and related products we are authorized to distribute; and maintain certain financial capacity in order to be financially able to perform our obligations under the Initial CBAs.

&#160;

Each Initial CBA has a term of ten years and is automatically renewed for successive additional terms of ten years each unless we give notice to terminate at least one year prior to the expiration of a ten year term. The Initial CBA is subject to customary termination provisions by The Coca-Cola Company, including the Company&#8217;s insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings and cross-default with other beverage agreements.

Pursuant to a territory conversion agreement entered into with CCR and The Coca-Cola Company in September 2015 (the &#8220;Territory Conversion Agreement&#8221;), we have agreed, subject to limited exceptions, to amend, restate and convert all of our Cola and Allied Beverage Agreements, Still Beverage Agreements, Initial CBAs and other bottling agreements with The Coca-Cola Company or CCR that authorize us to produce and/or distribute certain covered beverages defined in the Initial CBAs (excluding any bottling agreements with respect to the greater Lexington, Kentucky territory we received pursuant to the Asset Exchange Transaction) to a new and final form comprehensive beverage agreement (the &#8220;Final CBA&#8221; and, together with the Initial CBAs, referred to as the &#8220;CBAs&#8221; or the &#8220;Comprehensive Beverage Agreements&#8221;) in the future as disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 28, 2015. The Final CBA is similar to the Initial CBA in many respects, but will include certain modifications and several new business, operational, governance and sale process provisions, including the need to obtain The Coca-Cola Company&#8217;s prior approval of a potential purchaser of the Company or our aggregate businesses directly and primarily related to the marketing, promotion, distribution and sale of certain beverages of The Coca-Cola Company. The Coca-Cola Company will also have the right to terminate the Final CBA in the event of an uncured default by us.

&#160;

At the time of the conversion of the bottling agreements for the Legacy Territories to the Final CBA, CCR will pay to us a fee in an amount equivalent to 0.5 times the EBITDA we generate from sales in the Legacy Territories of Beverages (as defined in the Final CBA) either (i) owned by The Coca-Cola Company or licensed to The Coca-Cola Company and sublice nsed to us, or (ii) owned by or licensed to Monster Energy Company on which we pay, and The Coca-Cola Company receives, a facilitation fee. 

&#160;

Beverage Agreements with Other Licensors for the Expansion Territories

&#160;

We have a regional master license agreement for the Expansion Territories with Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. for Dr Pepper brands. This agreement is generally similar to our beverage agreements with Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. for the Legacy Territories, but has a term of ten years, renewable at our option for an additional ten-year term. In addition, we also have the right under our new distribution agreement with Monster Energy Company to distribute energy drink products offered, packaged and/or marketed by Monster Energy Company under the primary brand name &#8220;Monster&#8221; within the Expansion Territories.

&#160;

Product Supply Arrangements

&#160;

We have historically had a production arrangement with CCR to buy and sell finished products at cost. In the Distribution Territory Expansion Transactions, we have, with certain exceptions, agreed to continue purchasing finished beverage products from CCR&#8217;s manufacturing facilities that were then servicing customers in certain of the Expansion Territories at a cost-based price, subject to adjustment in accordance with our current incidence-based pricing agreement with The Coca-Cola Company described above, as applicable to the Expansion Territory. Under certain exceptions, we may produce finished goods for our own distribution in an Expansion Territory . 

&#160;

Regional Manufacturing Agreements with The Coca-Cola Company for the Expansion Territories

&#160;

In fiscal 2016, the Company acquired an Expansion Manufacturing Facility in Sandston, Virginia pursuant to the October 2015 APA. We are now authorized to manufacture beverages bearing trademarks of The Coca-Cola Company using cold-fill technology at the Sandston, Virginia facility pursuant to an Initial Regional Manufacturing Agreement (&#8220;Initial RMA&#8221;). The Initial RMA refers to those beverages as &#8220;Authorized Covered Beverages.&#8221; We anticipate entering into a similar Initial RMA at each subsequent closing under the October 2015 APA. Subject to the right of The Coca-Cola Company to terminate the Initial RMA in the event of an uncured default by the Company, the Initial RMA has a term that continues for the duration of the term of our CBAs with The Coca-Cola Company and CCR. Other than Authorized Covered Beverages, certain cross-licensed brands that we are permitted to distribute under our CBAs, and certain other expressly permitted existing cross-licensed brands, the Initial RMA provides that we will not manufacture at the Expansion Manufacturing Facilities any Beverages, Beverage Components (as such terms are defined in the form of the Initial RMA) or other beverage products unless otherwise consented to by The Coca-Cola Company.

&#160;

Pursuant to its terms, each Initial RMA will be amended, restated and converted into a final form of regional manufacturing agreement (&#8220;Final RMA&#8221;) concurrent with the conversion of our bottling agreements to the Final CBA under the Territory Conversion Agreement. Under the Final RMA, our aggregate business directly and primarily related to the manufacture of Authorized Covered Beverages, permitted third party beverage products and other beverages and beverage products of The Coca-Cola Company will be subject to the same agreed upon sale process provisions included in the Final CBA, including the need to obtain The Coca-Cola Company&#8217;s prior approval of a potential purchaser of such manufacturing business. The Coca-Cola Company will have the right to terminate the Final RMA in the event of an uncured default by us. The Final RMA also will be subject to termination by The Coca-Cola Company in the event of an uncured default by us under the Final CBA or under the NPSG Governance Agreement (described below).

&#160;

National Product Supply Governance Agreement

&#160;

In connection with our expanded manufacturing opera t ions and role in the national Coca-Cola product supply system, we entered into an agreement with The Coca-Cola Company and three other regional producing bottlers in October 2015 to form a national product supply group (the &#8220;NPSG Governance Agreement&#8221;). The NPSG Governance Agreement establishes the framework for Coca-Cola system strategic infrastructure investment and divestment planning, network optimization of all plant to distribution center sourcing and new product/packaging infrastructure planning. Under the NPSG Governance Agreement, each of the other regional producing bottlers and the Company have agreed to make investments in our respective manufacturing assets and implement Coca-Cola system strategic investment opportunities that are approved by the governing board of the national product supply group and consistent with the terms of the NPSG Governance Agreement.

&#160;

&#160;

In fiscal 2016, we acquired additional Expansion Territories in Easton and Salisbury, Maryland and Richmond and Yorktown, Virginia, as well as the Expansion Manufacturing Facility in Sandston, Virginia. We also entered into a non-binding letter of intent with The Coca-Cola Company in February 2016 which contemplates our acquisition of additional CBA Rights and Transferred Assets relating to distribution territories currently served by CCR in northern Ohio and northern West Virginia and an additional Expansion Manufacturing Facility located in Twinsburg, Ohio.

We are a member of South Atlantic Canners, Inc. (&#8220;SAC&#8221;), a manufacturing cooperative located in Bishopville, South Carolina. All eight members of SAC are Coca-Cola bottlers and each member has equal voting rights. We receive a fee for managing the day-to-day operations of SAC pursuant to a management agreement. Management fees earned from SAC were $1.9 million, $1.8 million and $1.6 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. SAC&#8217;s bottling lines supply a portion of our volume requirements for beverage products. We have a commitment with SAC that requires minimum annual purchases of 17.5 million cases of beverage products through June 2024. Purchases from SAC by the Company for finished products were $145 million, $132 million and $137 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, or 28.3 million cases, 25.9 million cases and 26.2 million cases of finished product, respectively.

Raw Materials 

&#160;

In addition to concentrates purchased from The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies for use in our beverage manufacturing, we also purchase sweetener, carbon dioxide, plastic bottles, cans, closures and other packaging materials, as well as equipment for the production, distribution and marketing of nonalcoholic beverages.

&#160;

We purchase substantially all of our plastic bottles (12-ounce, 16-ounce, 20-ounce, 24-ounce, half-liter, 1-liter, 1.25-liter, 2-liter, 253 ml and 300 ml sizes) from manufacturing plants owned and operated by Southeastern Container and Western Container, two entities owned by various Coca-Cola bottlers, including the Company. We currently obtain all of our aluminum cans (7.5-ounce, 12-ounce and 16-ounce sizes) from two domestic suppliers. None of the materials or supplies we use are currently in short supply.

&#160;

Along with all other Coca-Cola bottlers in the United States, we are a member in Coca-Cola Bottlers&#8217; Sales and Services Company, LLC (&#8220;CCBSS&#8221;), which was formed in 2003 to facilitate various procurement functions and the distribution of beverage products of The Coca-Cola Company with the intention of enhancing the efficiency and competitiveness of the Coca-Cola bottling system in the United States. CCBSS negotiates the procurement for the majority of our raw materials (excluding concentrate).

&#160;

We are exposed to price risk on commodities such as aluminum, corn, PET resin (a petroleum-based product), and fuel which affects the cost of raw materials used in the production of finished products. We both produce and procure these finished products. Examples of the raw materials affected are aluminum cans and plastic bottles used for packaging and high fructose corn syrup used as a product ingredient. Further, we are exposed to commodity price risk on oil, which impacts our cost of fuel used in the movement and delivery of our products. We participate in commodity hedging and risk mitigation programs administered both by CCBSS and by the Company. In addition, no limit is placed on the price The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies can charge for concentrate.

Customers and Marketing 

Our products are sold and distributed directly to retail stores and other outlets, including food markets, institutional accounts and vending machine outlets. During 2015, approximately 68% of our bottle/can volume to retail customers was sold for future consumption. The remaining bottle/can volume to retail customers of approximately 32% was sold for immediate consumption, primarily through dispensing machines owned either by the Company, retail outlets or third party vending companies. In 2015, our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for approximately 22% of our total bottle/can volume to retail customers and our second largest customer, Food Lion, LLC, accounted for approximately 7% of our total bottle/can volume to retail customers. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and Food Lion, LLC accounted for approximately 15% and 5% of the Company&#8217;s total net sales, respectively. The loss of either Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or Food Lion, LLC as customers could have a material adverse effect on the operating and financial results of the Company. All of our beverage sales are to customers in the United States.

New product introductions, packaging changes and sales promotions have been the primary sales and marketing practices in the nonalcoholic beverage industry in recent years and have required and are expected to continue to require substantial expenditures. Brand introductions from the Company and The Coca-Cola Company in recent years include Tum-E Yummies, Coca-Cola Zero, Dasani flavors, Coca-Cola Life, Full Throttle and Gold Peak tea products. New packaging introductions include the 253 ml bottle, the 1.25-liter bottle, the 7.5-ounce sleek can, the 2-liter contour bottle for Coca-Cola products, and the 16-ounce bottle/24-ounce bottle package.

We sell our products primarily in nonrefillable bottles and cans, in varying proportions from market to market. For example, there may be as many as 23 different packages for Diet Coke within a single geographic area. Bottle/can volume to retail customers during 2015 was approximately 54% bottles, 45% cans and 1% other containers. 

&#160;

Advertising in various media, primarily television and radio, is relied upon extensively in the marketing of our products. The Coca-Cola Company, Monster Energy Company and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (collectively, the &#8220;Beverage Companies&#8221;) make substantial expenditures on advertising in the Legacy Territories and Expansion Territories. We have also benefited from national advertising programs conducted by the Beverage Companies. In addition, we expend substantial funds on our own behalf for extensive local sales promotions of our products. Historically, these expenses have been partially offset by marketing funding support the Beverage Companies provide to us in support of a variety of marketing programs, such as point-of-sale displays and merchandising programs. While the Beverage Companies have provided us with marketing funding support in the past, our bottling agreements generally do not obligate the Beverages Companies to do so.

&#160;

The substantial outlays we make for marketing and merchandising programs are generally regarded as necessary to maintain or increase revenue, and any significant curtailment of marketing funding support provided by the Beverage Companies for marketing programs which benefit us could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results.

&#160;

In addition to our marketing and merchandising programs, we believe a sustained and planned charitable giving program is an essential component of our success by supporting our brand through supporting the communities we serve. Since 2009, we have given approximately $9.0 million to various donor advised charitable funds. In March 2016, the Board approved a one-time special contribution of $4 million and an annual contribution of $2 million for 2016 in light of the Company&#8217;s financial performance, expanded distribution territory footprint and future business prospects. The Company intends to continue its charitable contributions in future years subject to the Company&#8217;s financial performance and other business factors. 

Seasonality 

Sales of our products are seasonal with the highest sales volume occurring in the second and third quarters. We have, and believe CCR has, adequate production capacity to meet sales demand for sparkling and still beverages during these peak periods. See &#8220;Item 2. Properties&#8221; for information relating to utilization of our production facilities. Sales volume can also be impacted by weather conditions.

Competition 

The nonalcoholic beverage market is highly competitive. Our competitors include bottlers and distributors of nationally advertised and marketed products and regionally advertised and marketed products, as well as bottlers and distributors of private label beverages in supermarket stores. The sparkling beverage market (including energy products) comprised 79% of our bottle/can volume to retail customers in 2015. In each region in which we operate, between 90% and 95% of sparkling beverage sales in bottles, cans and other containers are accounted for by the Company and its principal competitors, which in each region includes the local bottler of Pepsi-Cola and, in some regions, the local bottler of Dr Pepper, Royal Crown and/or 7-Up products.

The principal methods of competition in the nonalcoholic beverage industry are point-of-sale merchandising, new product introductions, new vending and dispensing equipment, packaging changes, pricing, price promotions, product quality, retail space management, customer service, frequency of distribution and advertising. We believe we are competitive in our territories with respect to these methods of competition.

Government Regulation 

&#160;

The production and marketing of beverages are subject to the rules and regulations of the United States Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) and other federal, state and local health agencies. The FDA also regulates the labeling of containers under The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990. The Nutrition Facts label has not changed significantly since it was first introduced in 1994. In 2014, the FDA proposed two new rules that would result in major changes to nutrition labels on all food packages, including the packaging for our products, that would, among other things, require those labels to display caloric counts in large type, reflect larger portion sizes and display on a separate line on the label the amount of sugars that are added to the product. The comment period on the two original proposed rules closed in August 2014. In 2015, the FDA issued a supplemental proposed rule that would, among other things, require declaration of the percent daily value for added sugars and change the current footnote on the Nutrition Facts label. The comment period on the supplemental proposed rule closed in October 2015. If these proposed rules are adopted by the FDA, we expect to have up to two years to put the required labeling changes into effect on the packaging for the products we manufacture and distribute.

&#160;

As a manufacturer, distributor and seller of beverage products of The Coca-Cola Company and other soft drink manufacturers in exclusive territories, we are subject to antitrust laws of general applicability. However, pursuant to the United States Soft Drink Interbrand Competition Act, soft drink bottlers such as the Company may have an exclusive right to manufacture, distribute and sell a soft drink product in a defined geographic territory if that soft drink product is in substantial and effective competition with other products of the same general class in the market. We believe such competition exists in each of the exclusive geographic territories in the United States in which we operate.

&#160;

From time to time, legislation has been proposed in Congress and by certain state and local governments which would prohibit the sale of soft drink products in nonrefillable bottles and cans or require a mandatory deposit as a means of encouraging the return of such containers in an attempt to reduce solid waste and litter. We are currently not impacted by this type of proposed legislation.

&#160;

Soft drink and similar-type taxes have been in place in West Virginia and Tennessee for several years. Proposals have been introduced by members of Congress and certain state governments that would impose excise and other special taxes on certain beverages that we sell. We cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted.

&#160;

Most of the beverage products sold by the Company are classified as food or food products and are therefore eligible for purchase using supplemental nutrition assistance (&#8220;SNAP&#8221;) benefits by consumers purchasing them for home consumption. Some states and 

localities have proposed barring the use of SNAP benefits by recipients in their jurisdictions to purchase some of the products we manufacture. T he United States Department of Agriculture rejected such a proposal by a major American city as recently as 2011. Energy drinks that have a Nutrition Facts label are classified as food and are eligible for purchase for home consumption using SNAP benefits while energy drinks that are classified as a supplement by the FDA are not. 

&#160;

We have experienced public policy challenges regarding the sale of soft drinks in schools, particularly elementary, middle and high schools. A number of states have regulations restricting the sale of soft drinks and other foods in schools. Many of these restrictions have existed for several years in connection with subsidized meal programs in schools. The focus has more recently turned to the growing health, nutrition and obesity concerns of today&#8217;s youth. Restrictive legislation, if widely enacted, could have an adverse impact on our products, image and reputation.

Environmental Remediation 

We do not currently have any material capital expenditure commitments for environmental compliance or environmental remediation for any of our properties. We do not believe compliance with federal, state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regarding the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, will have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

Employees 

As of January 3, 2016, we had approximately 7,600 full-time employees, of whom approximately 500 were union members. The total number of employees, including part-time employees, was approximately 9,500 . Approximately 5% of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements. One collective bargaining agreement covering approximately 25 of our employees expired during 2015 and we entered into a new agreement in 2015. Three collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 65 of our employees will expire in fiscal 2016.
