 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

OVERVIEW 

Ryder System, Inc. (Ryder) is a global leader in transportation and supply chain management solutions. Our operating segments are aggregated into reportable business segments based upon similar economic characteristics, products, services, customers and delivery methods. During the first quarter of 2015 , our management structure changed within the supply chain business. We created the role of President of Dedicated Transportation Solutions (DTS) for the dedicated product offering, which was previously within Supply Chain Solutions (SCS). Beginning in 2015 , we are reporting our financial performance based on three business segments: (1) Fleet Management Solutions (FMS), which provides full service leasing, commercial rental, contract maintenance, and contract-related maintenance of trucks, tractors and trailers to customers principally in the U.S., Canada and the U.K.; (2) DTS, which provides vehicles and drivers as part of a dedicated transportation solution in the U.S.; and (3) SCS, which provides comprehensive supply chain solutions including distribution and transportation services in North America and Asia. Dedicated transportation services provided as part of an integrated, multi-service, supply chain solution to SCS customers are reported in the SCS business segment. 

For financial information and other information relating to each of our business segments and about our geographic areas, see Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; of this report and Note 29 , " Segment Reporting ," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

MISSION AND STRATEGY 

Ryder's mission is to provide innovative fleet management and supply chain solutions that are reliable, safe and efficient, enabling our customers to deliver on their promises. We seek to deliver valuable solutions that will compel customers to outsource their fleet management and supply chain needs to us. Our strategy is to grow our fleet management and supply chain outsourcing services by targeting private fleets (FMS and DTS) and key industries (SCS) with innovative solutions, operational excellence, best in class talent and information technology. This strategy is supported by: 

&#8226; offering innovative products, solutions and support services that will create and strengthen customer relationships; 

&#8226; 

delivering operational excellence through continuous productivity and process improvements; 

&#8226; 

attracting, developing and retaining the best talent, and fostering a culture where leaders engage their people to innovate, pursue Ryder&#8217;s mission and build on its values; and 

&#8226; 

deploying technology that will enable growth while improving operational efficiencies. 

INDUSTRY AND OPERATIONS &#160; &#160; 

Fleet Management Solutions 

&#32; 

Value Proposition 

Through our FMS business, we provide our customers with a variety of fleet solutions that are designed to improve their competitive position. By outsourcing these services to us, our customers can focus on their core business, improve their efficiency and productivity, and lower their costs. Our FMS product offering is comprised of longer-term full service leasing and contract maintenance services; shorter-term commercial truck rental; flexible maintenance services; and value-added fleet support services such as insurance, vehicle administration and fuel services. In addition, we provide our customers the ability to purchase a large selection of used trucks, tractors and trailers through our used vehicle sales program. 

Market Trends 

The U.S. commercial fleet market is estimated to include 7.9 million &#32;vehicles (1) of which 4.1 million &#32;vehicles are with privately held companies, 1.4 million &#32;vehicles (2) &#32;are with for-hire carriers, 0.5 million &#32;vehicles are leased from banks or other financial institutions and 0.8 million &#32;vehicles are in the lease and rental market. The 4.1 million &#32;vehicles privately owned by companies provide all or a portion of the transportation services for themselves rather than outsourcing those services to third parties such as Ryder. Several trends have been increasing the need for outsourcing: increased demand for efficiency and reliability; increased complexity and cost of buying and maintaining vehicles including technology, diagnostics, and training; labor issues including a shortage of qualified truck drivers and mechanics; as well as increased regulation and enforcement of safety requirements. Because of these trends, we believe the privately held fleets and the for-hire carriers will increasingly decide to outsource. Ryder also targets customers who are already outsourcing with other providers. 

Ryder has been operating in Canada for over 50 years. Similar trends apply to outsourcing in Canada, and the Canadian commercial fleet is estimated at 500,000 &#32;vehicles, of which approximately 27,000 &#32;are lease and rental (3) . In the U.K., the commercial rental and lease market is estimated at 200,000 &#32;units (4) . The total lease and rental market in Ryder&#8217;s major markets totals over 1 million units. However, due to general trends and the trends in market sub-segments described above, combined with our success in converting owners to outsourcing, the total market potential for Ryder is significantly higher. 

Over the last several years, many key trends have been reshaping the transportation industry. We strongly believe these trends increase the value of our product offering. Because of increased demand for efficiency and reliability, companies that own and manage their own fleet of vehicles have put greater emphasis on the quality of their preventive maintenance and safety programs. The maintenance and operation of commercial vehicles has become more complicated and expensive, requiring companies to spend a significant amount of time and money to keep up with new technology, diagnostics, retooling and training. Increased regulation and active enforcement efforts by federal and state governments require more stringent and costly operational processes and oversight. Fluctuating energy prices and alternative fuel technologies make it difficult for businesses to predict and manage fleet costs. Finally, the tightened credit market has limited some businesses&#8217; access to capital at a time when commercial vehicle costs have increased as a result of the more expensive, EPA-compliant engines. 

Operations 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , our global FMS business accounted for 63% &#32;of our consolidated revenue. 

U.S. Our FMS customers in the U.S. range from small businesses to large national enterprises operating in a wide variety of industries, the most significant of which are food and beverage, transportation and warehousing, housing, business and personal services, and industrial. At December 31, 2015 , we had 529 &#32;operating locations, excluding ancillary storage locations, in 50 &#32;states and Puerto Rico. A location typically consists of a maintenance facility or &#8220;shop&#8221;, offices for sales and other personnel, and in many cases, a commercial rental vehicle counter. Our maintenance facilities typically include a service island for fueling, safety inspections and preliminary maintenance checks as well as a shop for preventive maintenance and repairs. We also operate on-site at 151 &#32;customer locations, which primarily provide vehicle maintenance. 

Canada . We have been operating in Canada for over 50 years. At December 31, 2015 , we had 36 &#32;operating locations throughout 9 Canadian provinces. We also operated 14 &#32;maintenance facilities on-site at customer properties in Canada. 

Europe. We began operating in the U.K. in 1971. At December 31, 2015 , we had 52 &#32;operating locations primarily throughout the U.K. We also managed a network of 477 &#32;independent maintenance facilities in the U.K. to serve our customers when it is more effective than providing the service in a Ryder location. In addition to our typical FMS operations, we supply and manage vehicles, equipment and personnel for military organizations in the U.K. and Germany.

FMS Product Offerings 

Full Service Leasing . Through our full service lease product line, we provide customers with vehicles, maintenance services, supplies, and related equipment necessary for operation of the vehicles while our customers furnish and supervise their own drivers and dispatch and exercise control over the vehicles. Our full service lease customers receive the following benefits: 

&#8226; 

We are able to leverage our vehicle buying power for the benefit of our customers because we purchase a large number of vehicles from a limited number of manufacturers. Once we have signed an agreement with the customer, we acquire vehicles and components that are custom engineered to the customer&#8217;s requirements and lease the vehicles to the customer for periods generally ranging from three to seven years for trucks and tractors and typically ten years for trailers. 

&#8226; 

We provide a complete maintenance program designed to reduce vehicle downtime through a preventive maintenance plan that is based on vehicle type and time or mileage intervals. Given our continued focus on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our maintenance services, particularly in light of changing technology and increased regulation, we provide our full service lease customers with a cost effective alternative to maintaining their own fleet of vehicles. 

&#8226; 

Our customers have access to our extensive network of maintenance facilities and trained technicians for maintenance, vehicle repairs, 24-hour emergency roadside service, and replacement vehicles for vehicles that are temporarily out of service. 

&#8226; 

We typically retain vehicle residual risk exposure. 

&#8226; 

Customers have an opportunity to enhance their standard full service lease with additional fleet support services including our fuel and related services as described below; liability insurance coverage under our existing insurance policies and related insurance services; safety services including safety training, driver certification, and loss prevention consulting; vehicle use and other tax reporting, permitting and licensing, and regulatory compliance (including hours of service administration); environmental services; and access to RydeSmart &#174; , a full-featured GPS fleet location, tracking, and vehicle performance management system and to Ryder &#32; FleetCARE SM , &#32;our web-based tool that provides customers with 24/7 access to key operational and maintenance management information about their fleets. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , full service lease revenue accounted for 53% &#32;of our FMS total revenue. 

Commercial Rental . We target rental customers that have a need to supplement their private fleet of vehicles on a short-term basis (one day up to one year in length), either because of seasonal increases in their business or discrete projects that require additional transportation resources. Full service lease customers utilize our commercial rental fleet to handle their peak or seasonal business needs. Although a portion of our commercial rental business is purely occasional in nature, we focus on building long-term relationships with customers so that we become their preferred source for commercial vehicle rentals. Our rental representatives assist in selecting a vehicle that satisfies a customer&#8217;s needs and supervise the rental process, which includes execution of a rental agreement and a vehicle inspection. In addition to vehicle rental, we may extend liability insurance coverage under our existing policies to our rental customers as well as the benefits of our comprehensive fuel services program. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , commercial rental revenue accounted for 21% &#32;of our FMS total revenue. 

Contract Maintenance . Through our contract maintenance product line, we provide customers with all or certain of the maintenance services provided under a full service lease. Our contract maintenance customers commit to utilizing our extensive network of maintenance facilities and trained technicians to maintain the vehicles they own or lease from third parties. We can also customize the services to include ancillary maintenance and/or fleet support services. Vehicles covered under this offering are typically serviced at our own facilities. However, based on the size and complexity of a customer&#8217;s fleet, we may operate an on-site maintenance facility at the customer&#8217;s location. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , contract maintenance revenue accounted for 4% &#32;of our FMS total revenue.

______________ 

(1) 

Commercial rental customers include customers who rented a vehicle for more than 3 days during the year and includes approximately 8,600 &#32;full service lease customers 

(2) 

Contract maintenance customers include approximately 947 &#32;full service lease customers 

Contract-Related Maintenance . Our full service lease and contract maintenance customers periodically require additional maintenance and repair services that are not included in their full service lease or contract maintenance contracts. For example, additional maintenance and repair services may arise when a customer damages a leased vehicle. In addition, because of our existing relationships with the customer, we may provide service on their owned vehicles and charge the customer on an hourly basis for work performed. By servicing all of our customers&#8217; maintenance needs, we create stronger, long-term relationships and have greater opportunity to provide customers with a wide range of outsourcing solutions. 

More recently, we have contracted with large private fleet operators and for-hire carriers to provide maintenance on demand, particularly in geographic areas where these customers do not have their own maintenance operations. Although the contract for on-demand maintenance services is based on a maintenance program that is designed to meet the customers' specific needs, all maintenance is performed only when and as requested by the customer. This product allows us to expand our customer base to include customers that have traditionally chosen to own and maintain their fleet of vehicles. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , contract-related maintenance revenue accounted for 5% &#32;of our FMS total revenue. 

Fuel Services. We provide our FMS customers with access to diesel fuel at competitive prices at over 450 &#32;of our maintenance facilities across the United States and Canada. We also provide fuel services such as fuel planning, fuel tax reporting, centralized billing, fuel cards and fuel monitoring. Although fuel sales do not have a significant impact on our FMS earnings as it is largely a pass-through cost to customers, we believe allowing customers to leverage our fuel buying power is a significant and valuable benefit to our customers. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , fuel services revenue accounted for 15% &#32;of our FMS total revenue. 

Used Vehicles. We primarily sell our used vehicles at one of our 59 &#32;retail sales centers throughout North America ( 18 &#32;of which are co-located at an FMS shop), at our branch locations or through our website at www.Usedtrucks.Ryder.com . Typically, before we offer used vehicles for sale, our technicians assure that the vehicles are Road Ready &#174; , which means that they have passed a comprehensive, multi-point performance inspection based on specifications formulated through our maintenance program. Our retail sales centers throughout North America allow us to leverage our maintenance expertise and strong brand reputation to realize higher sales proceeds than in the wholesale market. Given our focus on maximizing sales proceeds, we generally sell our used vehicles through retail centers for prices in excess of book value. However, the extent to which we are able to realize a gain on the sale of used vehicles is dependent upon various other factors, including the general state of the used vehicle market including the supply and demand for used commercial vehicles in retail and wholesale markets, the age and condition of the vehicle at the time of its disposal and vehicle depreciation rates. 

FMS Business Strategy 

Our FMS business strategy is to be the leading provider of fleet management outsourcing services for light, medium and heavy duty vehicles. Our strategy will be achieved if we focus on the following goals and priorities: 

&#8226; 

Drive fleet growth by (1) successfully implementing sales and marketing initiatives designed to compel private fleet operators and for-hire carriers to outsource all or some portion of their fleet management needs to us; (2) offering innovative products, solutions and support services that will create and strengthen new and existing customer relationships; and (3) completing targeted acquisitions; 

&#8226; 

Deliver a consistent, industry-leading and cost-effective maintenance program to our customers through continued process improvement and re-design, productivity initiatives, and technology improvements; and 

&#8226; 

Optimize asset utilization and management, particularly with respect to our rental fleet, used vehicle operations and maintenance facility infrastructure. 

Successfully driving our fleet growth strategy will require significant capital investments in full service lease and commercial rental vehicles. As a result, during periods of significant growth, our free cash flow may be negative. 

Competition 

As an alternative to using our fleet management services, most companies choose to provide these services for themselves, although some may choose to obtain similar or alternative services from other third-party vendors. 

Our FMS business segment competes with companies providing similar services on a national, regional and local level. Many regional and local competitors provide services on a national level through their participation in various cooperative programs. Competitive factors include price, equipment, maintenance, service and geographic coverage. We compete with finance lessors and also with truck and trailer manufacturers and independent dealers who provide full service lease products, finance leases, extended warranty maintenance, rental and other transportation services. With the growth of our on-demand maintenance product, we will also face competition from managed maintenance providers who are hired to coordinate and manage the maintenance of large fleets of vehicles through a network of third-party maintenance providers. Value-added differentiation of the full service leasing, maintenance and commercial rental service, as well as continued commitment to offer innovative products and solutions, such as natural gas vehicles, has been and will continue to be our emphasis. 

Dedicated Transportation Solutions 

Value Proposition 

Through our DTS business segment, we combine the equipment, maintenance and administrative services of a full service lease with drivers and additional services to provide a customer with a dedicated transportation solution that is designed to increase their competitive position, improve risk management and integrate their transportation needs with their overall supply chain. Such additional services include routing and scheduling, fleet sizing, safety, regulatory compliance, risk management, technology and communication systems support including on-board computers, and other technical support. These additional services allow us to address, on behalf of our customers, labor challenges associated with maintaining a private fleet of vehicles, such as driver recruitment and retention, government regulation, including hours of service regulations, DOT audits and workers&#8217; compensation. Our DTS solution offers a high degree of specialization to meet the needs of customers with sophisticated service requirements such as tight delivery windows, high-value or time-sensitive freight, closed-loop distribution, multi-stop shipments, specialized equipment or integrated transportation needs. 

Market Trends 

The U.S. dedicated contract carriage market is estimated to be $13 billion (1) . This market is affected by many of the trends that impact our FMS business, including the tightening of capacity in the current U.S. trucking market. The administrative requirements relating to regulations issued by the Department of Transportation (DOT) regarding driver screening, training and testing, as well as record keeping and other costs associated with the hours of service requirements, make our DTS product an attractive alternative to private fleet and driver management. This has become even more significant in light of Compliance, Safety, Accountability (CSA) 2010 regulatory changes. The CSA 2010 regulatory changes have also put pressure on the availability of qualified truck drivers, which continues to lag market requirements. In addition, market demand for just-in-time delivery creates a need for well-defined routing and scheduling plans that are based on comprehensive asset utilization analysis and fleet rationalization studies that are offered as part of our DTS service offering. 

Operations/Product Offerings 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , our global DTS business accounted for 14% &#32;of our consolidated revenue. At December 31, 2015 , we had 194 &#32;DTS customer accounts in the U.S. Because it is highly customized, our DTS product is particularly attractive to companies that operate in industries that have time-sensitive deliveries or special handling requirements, as well as to companies who require specialized equipment. Because DTS accounts typically operate in a limited geographic area, most of the drivers assigned to these accounts are short haul drivers, meaning they return home at the end of each work day. Although a significant portion of our DTS operations are located at customer facilities, our DTS business utilizes and benefits from our extensive network of FMS facilities. 

In order to customize an appropriate DTS transportation solution for our customers, our DTS logistics specialists perform a transportation analysis using advanced logistics planning and operating tools. Based on this analysis, they formulate a logistics design that includes the routing and scheduling of vehicles, the efficient use of vehicle capacity and overall asset utilization. The goal of the plan is to create a distribution system that optimizes freight flow while meeting a customer&#8217;s service goals. A team of DTS transportation specialists can then implement the plan by leveraging the resources, expertise and technological capabilities of both our FMS and SCS businesses. 

To the extent a distribution plan includes multiple modes of transportation (air, rail, sea and highway), our DTS team, in conjunction with our SCS transportation specialists, selects appropriate transportation modes and carriers, places the freight, monitors carrier performance and audits billing. In addition, through our SCS business, we can reduce costs and add value to a customer&#8217;s distribution system by aggregating orders into loads, looking for shipment consolidation opportunities and organizing loads for vehicles that are returning from their destination point back to their point of origin (backhaul). 

DTS Business Strategy 

Our DTS business strategy is to focus on customers who need specialized equipment, specialized handling or integrated services. This strategy revolves around the following interrelated goals and priorities: 

&#8226; Increase market share with customers in the energy and utility, metals and mining, retail, construction, healthcare, and food and beverage industries; 

&#8226; Leverage the support and talent of the FMS sales team in a joint sales program; 

&#8226; Align the DTS business with other SCS product lines to create revenue opportunities and improve operating efficiencies in both segments; and 

&#8226; Improve competitiveness in the non-specialized and non-integrated customer segments.

Competition 

Our DTS business segment competes with truckload carriers and other dedicated providers servicing on a national, regional and local level. Competitive factors include price, equipment, maintenance, service and geographic coverage and driver and operations expertise. We are able to differentiate the DTS product offering by leveraging FMS and integrating the DTS services with those of SCS to create a more comprehensive transportation solution for our customers. Our strong safety record and focus on customer service enable us to uniquely meet the needs of customers with high-value products that require specialized handling in a manner that differentiates us from truckload carriers. 

Supply Chain Solutions 

Value Proposition 

Through our SCS business, we offer a broad range of innovative logistics management services that are designed to optimize a customer&#8217;s supply chain and address customer's key business requirements. The organization is aligned by industry verticals (Automotive, Technology and Healthcare, Consumer Packaged Goods and Retail, and Industrial) to enable the teams to focus on the specific needs of their customers. Our SCS product offerings are organized into four categories: dedicated services, distribution management, transportation management and professional services. These offerings are supported by a variety of information technology and engineering solutions that are an integral part of our SCS services. These product offerings can be offered independently or as an integrated solution to optimize supply chain effectiveness. A key aspect of our value proposition is our operational execution, which is an important differentiator in the marketplace. 

Market Trends 

Global logistics is approximately a $9.2 trillion (1) &#32;market, of which approximately $750 billion (1) &#32;is outsourced. Logistics spending in the markets we are targeting in North America and Asia equates to approximately $3.6 trillion , of which $340 billion &#32;is outsourced. Outsourced logistics is a market with significant growth opportunity. More sophisticated supply chain practices are required as supply chains expand and become more complex, product needs continue to proliferate and companies look for lower cost supply chain alternatives. In addition, disruptions from unexpected events such as natural disasters have caused companies to focus on risk management of their supply chains. The more complicated the supply chain or the product requirements, the greater the need for companies to utilize the expertise of supply chain solution providers. 

Operations 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , our global SCS business accounted for 23% &#32;of our consolidated revenue. 

&#160; U.S. At December 31, 2015 , we had 326 &#32;SCS customer accounts in the U.S., most of which are large enterprises that maintain large, complex supply chains. Most of our core SCS business operations are geographically located to maximize efficiencies and reduce costs. At December 31, 2015 , managed warehouse space totaled approximately 35 &#32;million square feet for the U.S. and Puerto Rico. We also concentrate certain logistics expertise in locations not associated with specific customer sites. For example, our carrier procurement, contract management, freight bill audit and payment services, and transportation optimization and execution groups operate out of our logistics centers in Novi, Michigan and Fort Worth, Texas. 

Mexico . At December 31, 2015 , we had 111 &#32;SCS customer accounts and managed warehouse space totaling approximately 3.6 million square feet. Our Mexico operations offer a full range of SCS services and manage approximately 11,800 &#32;border crossings each month between Mexico and the U.S. and Canada, often highly integrated with our distribution and transportation operations. 

Canada. At December 31, 2015 , we had 65 &#32;SCS customer accounts and managed warehouse space totaling approximately 930,000 &#32;square feet. Given the proximity of this market to our U.S. and Mexico operations, the Canadian operations are highly coordinated with their U.S. and Mexico counterparts, managing cross-border transportation and freight movements. 

Asia. At December 31, 2015 , we had 94 &#32;SCS customer accounts and managed warehouse space totaling approximately 412,000 &#32;square feet, primarily in Singapore.

SCS Product Offerings 

Distribution Management . Our SCS business offers a wide range of services relating to a customer&#8217;s distribution operations, from designing a customer&#8217;s distribution network to managing distribution facilities. Services within the facilities generally include managing the flow of goods from the receiving function to the shipping function, coordinating warehousing and transportation for inbound and outbound material flows, handling import and export for international shipments, coordinating just-in-time replenishment of component parts to manufacturing and final assembly, and providing shipments to customer distribution centers or end customer delivery points. Additional value-added services such as light assembly of components into defined units (kitting), packaging and refurbishment are also provided. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , distribution management solutions accounted for 45% &#32;of our SCS revenue. 

Dedicated Services. Dedicated services are offered as part of an integrated supply chain solution to our customers. We fulfill transportation needs for our customers with a combination of outside carriers and dedicated services. The dedicated services offering combines the equipment, maintenance, drivers and additional services to provide a customer with a dedicated transportation solution, which combined with outside transportation is designed to increase their competitive position, improve risk management and integrate their transportation needs with their overall supply chain. Such additional services include routing and scheduling, fleet sizing, safety, regulatory compliance, risk management, technology and communication systems support including on-board computer, and other technical support. These additional services allow us to address, on behalf of our customers, labor challenges associated with maintaining a private fleet of vehicles, such as driver recruitment and turnover, government regulation (including hours of service regulations), DOT audits and workers' compensation. Our dedicated services solution offers a high degree of specialization to meet the needs of customers with sophisticated service requirements such as tight delivery windows, high value or time sensitive freight, closed-loop distribution, multi-stop shipments, specialized equipment and integrated transportation needs. Dedicated services operations are located at our customer facilities, and our dedicated offering utilizes and benefits from our extensive network of FMS facilities. For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 38% of our SCS revenue was related to dedicated services. 

Transportation Management . Our SCS business offers services relating to all aspects of a customer&#8217;s transportation network. Our team of transportation specialists provides shipment planning and execution, which includes shipment optimization, load scheduling and delivery confirmation through a series of technological and web-based solutions. Our transportation consultants, including our freight brokerage department, focus on carrier procurement of all modes of transportation with an emphasis on truck-based transportation, rate negotiation, and freight bill audit and payment services. In addition, our SCS business as well as our FMS business provide customers with capacity management services that are designed to meet backhaul opportunities and minimize excess miles. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , we purchased and/or executed over $4.3 billion &#32;in freight moves on our customers' behalf. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , transportation management solutions accounted for 10% &#32;of our SCS revenue. 

Professional Services . In conjunction with providing the SCS core services described previously, our SCS business offers a variety of knowledge-based services that support every aspect of a customer&#8217;s supply chain. Our SCS professionals are available to evaluate a customer&#8217;s existing supply chain to identify inefficiencies as well as opportunities for integration and improvement. Once the assessment is complete, we work with the customer to develop a supply chain strategy that will create the most value for the customer and their target clients. Once a customer has adopted a supply chain strategy, our SCS logistics team, supported by functional experts and representatives from our information technology, real estate and finance groups, work together to design a strategically focused supply chain solution. The solution may include both a network design that sets forth the number, location and function of key components of the network and a transportation solution that optimizes the mode or modes of transportation and route selection. In addition to providing the distribution and transportation expertise necessary to implement the supply chain solution, our SCS representatives can coordinate and manage all aspects of the customer&#8217;s supply chain provider network to assure consistency, efficiency and flexibility. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , knowledge-based professional services accounted for 7% &#32;of our SCS revenue. 

SCS Business Strategy 

Our SCS business strategy is to offer our customers differentiated functional execution and proactive solutions from deep expertise in key industry verticals. The strategy revolves around the following interrelated goals and priorities: 

&#8226; 

Providing customers with a differentiated quality of service and best execution through reliable and flexible supply chain solutions; 

&#8226; 

Developing capabilities that can be applied and utilized in our targeted industry verticals; 

&#8226; 

Creating a culture of innovation that fosters new and high value solutions for our customers&#8217; supply chain needs; 

&#8226; 

Focusing on continuous improvement and standardization; and 

&#8226; 

Successfully implementing targeted sales and marketing strategies. 

Competition 

As an alternative to using our services, most companies choose to internally manage their own supply chains and logistics operations, although some may choose to obtain similar or alternative services from other third-party vendors. 

In the SCS business segment, we compete with a large number of companies providing similar services, each of which has a different set of core competencies. We compete with a handful of large, multi-service companies across all of our service offerings and industries. We also compete against other companies on specific service offerings (for example, in transportation management, distribution management or dedicated services) or in a specific industry. We face different competitors in each country or region where they may have a greater operational presence. Competitive factors include price, service, market knowledge, expertise in logistics-related technology and overall performance (e.g. timeliness, accuracy, and flexibility). 

ACQUISITIONS 

In addition to our continued focus on organic growth, acquisitions play an important role in enhancing our growth strategy. In assessing potential acquisition targets in our FMS business segment, we look for companies that would create value through operating synergies, leveraging our existing facility infrastructure, improving our geographic coverage and diversifying our customer base. In our SCS business segment, we focus on adding capabilities and product offerings, potentially expanding into new industries, diversifying our customer base within our current industries, and improving our competitive position. 

CYCLICALITY &#32; 

Ryder's business is impacted by economic and market conditions. In a strong economic cycle, there is generally more demand for our fleet management, dedicated and supply chain services. In a weak or volatile economy, demand for our services decreases and is inconsistent and considerably more unpredictable. Because of these factors, we have continued to focus on increasing the diversity of our customer base and strengthening our long-term business partnerships with our customers. Although we believe these efforts help mitigate the immediate impact of an economic downturn, during a protracted or severe economic downturn, customers are often unwilling to commit to a full-service lease or long-term supply chain contract. Because commercial rental and used vehicle sales are transactional, they are more cyclical in nature, and results can vary significantly in both the short- and long-term. We mitigate some of the potential impact of an economic downturn through a disciplined and centralized approach to asset management. This approach allows us to manage the size, mix and location of our operating fleet and used vehicle inventories to try and maximize asset utilization and used vehicle proceeds in both strong and weak market conditions. 

ADMINISTRATION 

Our financial administrative functions for the U.S. and Canada, including credit, billing and collections are consolidated into our Shared Services Center operations, a centralized processing center located in Alpharetta, Georgia. Our Shared Services Center also manages contracted third parties providing administrative finance and support services outside of the U.S. in order to reduce ongoing operating expenses and maximize our technology resources. This centralization results in more efficient and consistent centralized processing of selected administrative operations. Certain administrative functions are also performed at the Shared Services Center for our customers. The Shared Services Center&#8217;s main objectives are to enhance customer service through process standardization, create an organizational structure that will improve market flexibility and allow future reengineering efforts to be attained more easily at lower implementation costs. 

REGULATION 

Our business is subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign governmental entities. The DOT and various federal and state agencies exercise broad powers over certain aspects of our business, generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety and financial reporting. In 2010, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) began implementation of the CSA, a compliance and enforcement initiative partnering with State agencies designed to monitor and improve commercial vehicle motor safety. The CSA program includes a Safety Measurement System (SMS) that uses roadside inspections and violations to measure motor carriers and drivers and determines the scores related to these inspections and violations that compare the motor carriers and drivers against peers. The FMCSA established thresholds for each of seven different measurement areas that identify potential safety risks and result in direct intervention or enforcement action. 

We are also subject to a variety of requirements of national, state, provincial and local governments, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, that regulate safety, the management of hazardous materials, water discharges and air emissions, solid waste disposal and the release and cleanup of regulated substances. We must comply with licensing and other requirements imposed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs Service as a result of increased focus on homeland security and our Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism certification. We may also become subject to new or more restrictive regulations imposed by these agencies or other authorities relating to carbon controls and reporting, engine exhaust emissions, drivers&#8217; hours of service, wage and hour requirements, security including data privacy and cyber security and ergonomics. 

ENVIRONMENTAL 

We have a long, standing commitment to sound environmental practices that reduce risk and build value for us and our customers. We have a history of adopting &#8220;green&#8221; designs and processes because they are efficient, cost-effective transportation solutions that improve our bottom line and bring value to our customers. We have maintained an environmental mission since 1991 and have updated it periodically as regulatory and customer needs have changed. Our environmental policy reflects our commitment to supporting the goals of sustainable development, environmental protection and pollution prevention in our business. We have adopted proactive environmental strategies that have advanced business growth and continued to improve our performance in ways that reduce emission outputs and environmental impact. Our environmental team works with operating employees to develop and administer programs in support of our environmental policy and to help ensure that environmental considerations are integrated into all business processes and decisions. 

&#32;In establishing appropriate environmental objectives and targets for our wide range of business activities around the world, we focus on (1) the needs of our customers; (2) the communities in which we provide services; and (3) relevant laws and regulations. We regularly review and update our environmental management procedures, and information regarding our environmental activities is routinely disseminated throughout Ryder. In 2015 , we substantially expanded our sustainability reporting with the publication of our 2013 / 2014 &#32;Corporate Sustainability Report that includes expanded and enhanced disclosures, as well as new metrics related to our environmental and safety performance for the years 2013 and 2014 . In addition, we have voluntarily responded to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) since 2008, disclosing direct and indirect emissions resulting from our operations. These reports are publicly available on the company website at www.ryder.com by clicking on About Us and then selecting Sustainability. 

SAFETY 

Our safety culture is founded upon a core commitment to the safety, health and well-being of our employees, customers and the community, a commitment that has made us a long-standing industry leader in safety. 

Safety is an integral part of our business strategy because preventing injuries and collisions improves employee quality of life, eliminates service disruptions to our customers, increases efficiency and improves customer satisfaction. As a core value, our focus on safety is embedded in our day-to-day operations, reinforced by many safety programs and continuous operational improvement and supported by a talented and dedicated safety organization. 

Training is a critical component of our safety program. Monthly safety training delivered by location safety committees cover specific and relevant safety topics and managers receive annual safety leadership training. Quarterly and remedial training is also delivered online to each driver through our highly interactive Ryder Pro-TREAD comprehensive lesson platform. Regular safety behavioral observations are conducted by managers throughout the organization everyday and remedial training and coaching takes place on-the-spot. We also deploy state-of-the-art safety technologies in Ryder vehicles and our safety policies require that all managers, supervisors and employees incorporate safe processes in all aspects of our business. Monthly safety scorecards are tracked and reviewed by management for progress toward key safety objectives. Our proprietary web-based safety tracking system, RyderStar SM , delivers proactive safety programs tailored to every location and helps measure safety activity effectiveness across the organization. 

EMPLOYEES 

At December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 33,100 &#32;full-time employees worldwide, of which 31,300 &#32;were employed in North America, 1,400 &#32;in Europe and 400 &#32;in Asia. Currently we employ approximately 7,400 &#32;drivers and 5,700 &#32;technicians. We have approximately 20,500 &#32;hourly employees in the U.S., approximately 3,700 &#32;of which are organized by labor unions. Those employees organized by labor unions are principally represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers and the United Auto Workers, and their wages and benefits are governed by 102 &#32;labor agreements that are renegotiated periodically. Although we have not experienced a material work stoppage or strike, these events can potentially occur given the types of businesses in which we currently engage. We consider that our relationship with our employees is good.
