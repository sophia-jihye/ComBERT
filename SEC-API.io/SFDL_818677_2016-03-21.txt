Security Federal Corporation 

Security Federal Corporation (the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in July 1987 for the purpose of becoming the savings and loan holding company for Security Federal Bank ("Security Federal" or the "Bank") upon the Bank's conversion from mutual to the stock form (the "Conversion"). Effective August 17, 1998, the Company changed its state of incorporation from Delaware to South Carolina. On December 28, 2011, the Company reorganized into a bank holding company in connection with the Bank's conversion from a federally chartered stock savings bank to a South Carolina chartered commercial bank. As a result of the reorganization, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("Federal Reserve") became the Company's primary federal regulator. On January 17, 2013, the Board of Directors of the Company determined to change the Company's fiscal year end from March 31 to December 31. As a result of this change, the Company filed a Transition Report on Form 10-K for the nine-month transition period from April 1, 2012 to December 31, 2012. 

As a South Carolina corporation, the Company is authorized to engage in any activity permitted by South Carolina General Corporation Law. The Company is a one bank holding company. Through the bank holding company structure, it is possible to expand the size and scope of the financial services offered beyond those currently offered by the Bank. The holding company structure also provides the Company with greater flexibility than the Bank would have to diversify its business activities, through existing or newly formed subsidiaries, or through acquisitions or mergers of financial institutions as well as other companies. There are no current arrangements, understandings or agreements regarding any such acquisition. Future activities of the Company, other than the continuing operations of Security Federal, will be funded through dividends from Security Federal and through borrowings from third parties. See "Regulation - Regulation of the Company - Dividends" and "Taxation." Activities of the Company may also be funded through sales of additional securities or income generated by other activities of the Company. At this time, there are no plans regarding sales of additional securities or other activities. 

At December 31, 2015, the Company had assets of $799.7 million , deposits of $652.1 million &#32;and shareholders' equity of $91.0 million . 

The executive office of the Company is located at 238 Richland Avenue Northwest, Aiken, South Carolina 29801, and its telephone number is (803) 641-3000. 

Security Federal Bank 

General . Security Federal is a South Carolina chartered commercial bank headquartered in Aiken, South Carolina. Security Federal, with 14 branch offices in Aiken, Richland and Lexington counties, South Carolina and Columbia County, Georgia, was originally chartered under the name Aiken Building and Loan Association on March 27, 1922. It received its federal charter and changed its name to Security Federal Savings and Loan Association of Aiken on March 7, 1962, and later changed its name to Security Federal Savings Bank of South Carolina, on November 11, 1986. Effective April 8, 1996, the Bank changed its name to Security Federal Bank. The Bank converted from the mutual to the stock form of organization on October 30, 1987. As mentioned above, effective December 28, 2011, Security Federal converted from a federally chartered stock savings bank to a South Carolina chartered commercial bank. As a result of the conversion to a South Carolina commercial bank, the Bank is regulated by the South Carolina State Board of Financial Institutions ("State Board") and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). 

The principal business of Security Federal is accepting deposits from the general public and originating commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, consumer loans, as well as mortgage loans to buy or refinance one-to-four family residential real estate. The Bank also originates construction loans on single-family residences, multi-family dwellings and projects, and commercial real estate, as well as loans for the acquisition, development and construction of residential subdivisions and commercial projects. In addition, the Bank operates Security Federal Trust and Investments, as a division of the Bank that offers trust, financial planning and financial management services. 

Security Federal Bank has a wholly owned subsidiary, Security Federal Insurance, which is an insurance agency subsidiary that offers auto, business, and home insurance. Security Federal Insurance also has a wholly owned subsidiary, Collier Jennings Financial Corporation, which has three wholly owned subsidiaries: Security Federal Auto Insurance, The Auto Insurance Store Inc., and Security Federal Premium Pay Plans Inc. Security Federal Premium Pay Plans Inc. has one wholly owned insurance premium finance subsidiary and also has an ownership interest in four other insurance premium finance subsidiaries. 

Security Federal's income is derived primarily from interest and fees earned in connection with its lending activities, and its principal expenses are interest paid on savings deposits and borrowings and operating expenses. 

Corporate Overview 

Community Development Capital Initiative ("CDCI" ). On September 29, 2010, the Company entered into a Letter Agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury ("Treasury") in connection with its participation in the CDCI which was established by the Treasury pursuant to the Troubled Asset Relief Program ("TARP"). The CDCI was established by the Treasury to invest lower cost capital in Community Development Financial Institutions ("CDFI"), supporting their efforts to provide credit to small businesses and other qualified customers. 

Pursuant to the CDCI, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement with the Treasury and exchanged the 18,000 shares of its Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A ("Series A Preferred Stock"), previously sold to the Treasury on December 19, 2008 pursuant to the TARP Capital Purchase Program ("CPP"), for 18,000 shares of newly designated Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B ("Series B Preferred Stock"). 

In addition to, and in connection with the Company's participation in the CDCI, on September 29, 2010, the Company entered into a Letter Agreement with the Treasury (including the Securities Purchase Agreement - Standard Terms, the "Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company sold an additional 4,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to the Treasury at a price of $4.0 million. As a result of its participation in the CDCI and the transactions under the Exchange Agreement and the Purchase Agreement, the Treasury now holds 22,000 shares of the Company's Series B Preferred Stock, with an aggregate liquidation preference amount of $22.0 million. 

The additional capital received by the Company from Treasury pursuant to the Purchase Agreement was contingent upon the Company's completion of a separate stock offering of the same amount, as required by the Company's prior federal regulator, the Office of Thrift Supervision ("OTS"). In satisfaction of this requirement, on September 29, 2010, the Company sold 400,000 shares of its common stock to certain accredited investors in a private placement at a price of $10.00 per share, for gross proceeds of $4.0 million. 

On July 31, 2013, the Company repurchased its outstanding warrant at a fair market value of $50,000 from the Treasury. As a result of the transaction, the warrant was canceled which reduced the warrants outstanding by $400,000 and increased additional paid in capital by $350,000. For additional information regarding the CDCI transaction and the TARP CPP transaction, see Notes 16 &#32;and 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the 2015 Annual Report to Stockholders ("Annual Report").

Lending Activities 

General . Security Federal's principal lending activities are making loans on commercial real estate and one-to-four family residential real estate. The Bank originates fixed rate residential real estate loans for sale in the secondary market and adjustable rate mortgage loans ("ARMS") to be held in its portfolio. The Bank also originates construction loans on single family residences, multi-family dwellings and commercial real estate, and loans for the acquisition, development and construction of residential subdivisions and commercial projects. To a lesser extent, the Bank originates consumer loans and commercial business loans. 

The loan-to-value ratio, maturity and other provisions of loans made by the Bank reflect its policy of making the maximum loan permissible consistent with applicable regulations, established lending policies and market conditions. The Bank requires title insurance (or acceptable legal opinions on smaller loans secured by real estate) and fire insurance, and flood insurance where applicable, on loans secured by improved real estate. 

Loan Portfolio Composition. The following table sets forth information concerning the composition of the Bank's loan portfolio, including loans held for sale, in dollar amounts and in percentages by type of loan, and presents a reconciliation of total loans receivable before net items.

In addition to interest earned on loans, the Bank receives loan origination fees or "points" for originating loans. Loan points are a percentage of the principal amount of the mortgage loan which are charged to the borrower for the creation of the loan. The Bank's loan origination fees are generally 1% on conventional residential mortgages, and 0.25% to 1% on commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans. The total fee income (including amounts amortized to income as yield adjustments) for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $645,000. 

Loan origination and commitment fees are volatile sources of income. These fees vary with the volume and type of loans and commitments made and purchased and with competitive conditions in mortgage markets, which in turn are governed by the demand for and availability of money. 

The following table shows deferred mortgage loan origination fees recognized as income by the Bank expressed as a percentage of the dollar amount of total mortgage loans originated (and retained in the Bank's portfolio) and purchased during the periods indicated and the dollar amount of deferred loan origination fees at the end of each respective period.

Includes amounts amortized to interest income as yield adjustments; does not include fees earned on loans sold. 

The Bank also receives other fees and charges related to existing loans, conversion fees, assumption fees, late charges and other fees collected in connection with a change in borrower or other loan modifications. 

Security Federal currently sells substantially all conforming fixed rate loans with terms of 15 years or greater in the secondary mortgage market. These loans are sold in order to provide a source of funds and as one of the strategies available to close the gap between the maturities of the Bank's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Currently, most fixed rate, long-term mortgage loans are being originated based on Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae") and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac") underwriting standards. 

Secondary market sales are made to other banks or institutional investors. Generally all loans sold to investors are without recourse. For the past several years, substantially all loans have been sold on a servicing released basis. During the year ended December 31, 2015, Security Federal sold $24.2 million in fixed rate residential loans on a servicing released basis in the secondary market. Loans closed but not yet settled with banks or other investors, are carried in the Bank's "loans held for sale" portfolio. At December 31, 2015, the Bank had $2.5 million &#32;of loans held for sale. These loans are fixed rate residential loans that have been originated in the Bank's name and have closed. Virtually all of these loans have commitments to be purchased by investors and the majority of these loans were locked in by price with the investors on the same day or shortly thereafter that the loan was locked in with the Bank's customers. Therefore, these loans present very little market risk for the Bank. The Bank usually delivers loans to, and receives funding from, the investor within 30 days. Security Federal originates all of its loans held for sale on a "best efforts" basis which means that the Bank suffers no penalty if it is unable to deliver a loan to a potential investor. 

Loan Solicitation and Processing . The Bank actively solicits mortgage loan applications from existing customers, real estate agents, builders, real estate developers and others. The Bank also receives mortgage loan applications as a result of customer referrals and from walk-in customers. 

Detailed loan applications are obtained to determine the borrower's creditworthiness and ability to repay. The more significant items on loan applications are verified through the use of credit reports, financial statements and confirmations. After analysis of the loan application and property or collateral involved, including an appraisal of the property (residential appraisals 

are obtained through independent fee appraisers), a lending decision is made in accordance with the underwriting guidelines of the Bank. These guidelines are generally consistent with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae guidelines for residential real estate loans. With respect to commercial real estate loans, the Bank also reviews the capital adequacy of the business, the income potential of the property, the ability of the borrower to repay the loan and honor its other obligations, and general economic and industry conditions. 

Upon receipt of a loan application and all required related information from a prospective borrower, the loan application is submitted for approval or rejection. The residential mortgage loan underwriters approve loans which meet Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae underwriting requirements. The Chairman of the Company, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Bank, the President of the Bank, the Executive Vice President/Business Development, the Senior Vice President/Chief Lending Officer and Senior Vice President/Mortgage Lending individually have the authority to approve loans of $500,000 or less, except as set forth above for conforming conventionally underwritten, single family mortgage loans, which are approved by the underwriters. Loans in excess of $500,000 and up to $1.0 million require the approval of any three of the following: Chairman of the Company, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Bank, the President of the Bank, the President of the Company, the Executive Vice President/Business Development, the Senior Vice President/Chief Lending Officer, the Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee or the Secretary of the Executive Committee. Any loan in excess of $1.0 million must be approved by the Bank's Executive Committee, which operates as the Bank's Loan Committee. The loan approval limits discussed above are the aggregate of all loans to any one borrower or entity, not including loans that are secured by the borrower's primary residence, and are conventionally underwritten. 

The general policy of Security Federal is to issue loan commitments to qualified borrowers for a specified term. These commitments are generally for a period of 45 days or less. With management approval, commitments may be extended for up to an additional 45 days. As of December 31, 2015 , the Bank had no outstanding commitments on mortgage loans not yet closed compared to $571,000 at December 31, 2014. Security Federal had outstanding commitments available on all lines of credit (including letters of credit, commercial, undisbursed loans in process, home equity, VISA, and other consumer loans) totaling $51.2 million &#32;as of December 31, 2015 . See Note 18 &#32;of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Annual Report. 

Permanent Residential Mortgage Lending . Permanent residential real estate mortgage loans constituted 20.7% of the Bank's total outstanding loan portfolio at December 31, 2015 . 

Security Federal offers a variety of ARMs which offer adjustable rates of interest, payments, loan balances or terms to maturity which vary according to specified indices. The Bank's ARMs generally have a loan term of 15 to 30 years with initial rate adjustments every one, three, five or seven years during the term of the loan. After the initial rate adjustment, the loan rate then adjusts annually. Most of the Bank's ARMs contain a 200 basis point limit as to the maximum amount of change in the interest rate at any adjustment period and a 500 or 600 basis point limit over the life of the loan. The Bank generally originates ARMs to retain in its portfolio. These loans are generally made consistent with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae guidelines. At &#32; December 31, 2015 , residential ARMs totaled $64.7 million , or 18.9% of the Bank's loan portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , the Bank originated $38.5 million in residential real estate loans, 37.2% of which had adjustable rates of interest. At December 31, 2015 , the Bank also held approximately $14.2 million &#32;in longer term fixed rate residential mortgage loans. These loans were 4.1% of the entire loan portfolio at December 31, 2015 . Currently, the Bank sells the majority of its longer term fixed rate mortgage loans at origination with a few exceptions. 

There are unquantifiable risks resulting from possible increased costs to the borrower as a result of periodic repricing. Despite the benefits of ARMs to the Bank's asset/liability management program, these loans also pose potential additional risks, primarily because as interest rates rise, the underlying payment by the borrower rises, increasing the potential for default. At the same time, marketability of the underlying property may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. 

When making a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan, the Bank evaluates both the borrower's creditworthiness and his or her general ability to make principal and interest payments, and the value of the property that will secure the loan. The Bank generally makes loans on one- to four-family residential properties in amounts of 95% or less of the appraised value of the collateral. Where loans are made in amounts which exceed 80% of the appraised value of the underlying real estate, the Bank's general policy is to require private mortgage insurance on the portion of the loan in excess of 80% of the appraised value. In general, the Bank restricts its residential lending to South Carolina and the nearby Augusta, Georgia market. 

The Bank also provides construction financing for single family dwellings to owner-occupants. Construction loans are generally made for periods of six months to one year with either adjustable or fixed rates. At December 31, 2015 , residential construction loans on one- to four-family dwellings to owner-occupants totaled $8.1 million , or 2.4%, of the Bank's loan portfolio. On loans of this type, the Bank seeks to evaluate the financial condition and prior performance of the builder, as well as the 

borrower's creditworthiness and his or her general ability to make principal and interest payments, and the value of the property that will secure the loan. On construction loans offered to individuals (non-builders), the Bank offers a construction/permanent loan. The one year construction portion of the loan has a fixed rate ranging currently from 2.75% to 6.25% depending on which ARM program the borrower has chosen for the permanent portion of the loan after the construction period. The borrower pays interest on the loan during the construction phase. After construction, the loan then automatically converts, depending on the borrower's upfront selection, to a one year ARM, a three year/one year ARM, or a five year/one year ARM loan in which the borrower will pay principal and interest. The borrower also has the option, after the construction period only, to convert the loan to a fixed rate residential mortgage loan which the Bank then sells on the secondary market immediately on a servicing released basis. 

Commercial Real Estate, Commercial Business and Multi-Family Loans . The commercial business loans originated by the Bank are primarily secured by business equipment, furniture and fixtures, inventory and receivables, or are unsecured. At December 31, 2015 , the Bank had $12.5 million , or 3.7 %, of the Bank's total loan portfolio, in commercial business loans. A total of $2.1 million, or 16.4% of these loans were unsecured at December 31, 2015 . 

The commercial real estate loans originated by the Bank are primarily secured by non-residential commercial properties, churches, hotels, residential developments, single family construction loans to builders for speculative or pre-sold homes, lot loans to builders, income property developments, and undeveloped land. At December 31, 2015 , the Bank had $200.1 million , or 58.5%, &#32; of the Bank's total loan portfolio, in commercial real estate loans and multi-family loans. Included in these loans at December 31, 2015 &#32;was $8.6 million in A&#38;D loans with terms of typically two to three years. Also included in commercial real estate loans was $17.3 million in loans for the construction of single family dwellings to builders with a term of typically one year. 

The multi-family loans originated by the Bank are primarily secured by commercial residential properties including apartment complexes, condominiums or townhouses, and loans for acquisition and development of, or improvements to multi-family residential properties. At December 31, 2015 , the Bank had $12.1 million , or 3.6%, of the Bank's total loan portfolio, in multi-family loans.

Loans secured by commercial real estate are typically written for amortization terms of 10 to 20 years. Commercial loans not secured by real estate are typically based on terms of three to 60 months. Both commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans not secured by real estate can be originated on adjustable or fixed rate terms. Adjustable rates are tied to the prime rate as quoted in The Wall Street Journal &#32;and typically adjust on a daily basis. Since 2009, the Bank has instituted floors of typically 4% to 6% (currently 4%) on newly originated adjustable rate commercial business and commercial real estate loans. If ceilings are used, the loan will typically require a balloon payment in 60 months or less. Fixed rate loans on commercial real estate usually require a balloon payment in 36 to 60 months. Fixed rate loans on non-real estate collateral are generally amortizing in five years or less. 

Commercial real estate lending entails significant additional credit risk when compared to residential lending. Commercial real estate loans typically involve large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Because payments on loans secured by commercial properties often depend upon the successful operation and management of the properties, repayment of these loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. In order to minimize the risks associated with this type of loan, the Bank generally limits the maximum loan-to-value ratio for commercial real estate to 65% to 80%, based on appraisals of the property at the time of the loan by appraisers designated by the Bank, and strictly scrutinizes the credit history, financial condition and cash flow of the borrower, the quality of the collateral and the expertise of management of the property securing the loan. Although the creditworthiness of the business and its principals is of primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security, if any, in relation to the proposed loan amount. A&#38;D loans secured by improved lots generally involve greater risks than residential mortgage lending because these loans are more 

difficult to evaluate. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, in the event of default and foreclosure, we may be confronted with a property, the value of which is insufficient to assure full payment. 

Commercial business lending generally involves greater risk than residential mortgage lending and involves risks that are different from those associated with lending that is secured by real estate. Real estate lending is generally considered to be collateral based lending with loan amounts based on predetermined loan-to-collateral values, and liquidation of the underlying real estate collateral is viewed as the primary source of repayment in the event of borrower default. Although commercial business loans often have equipment, inventory, accounts receivable or other business assets as collateral, the liquidation of collateral in the event of a borrower default is often not a sufficient source of repayment because accounts receivable may be uncollectible and inventories and equipment may be obsolete or of limited use, among other conditions. Accordingly, the repayment of a commercial business loan depends primarily on the creditworthiness of the borrower (and any guarantors), while liquidation of collateral is a secondary and often insufficient source of repayment. The Bank seeks to minimize these risks by strictly scrutinizing the borrower's current financial condition, ability to pay, past earnings and payment history. In addition, the current financial condition and payment history of all principals are reviewed. Typically, the Bank requires the principal or owners of a business to guarantee all loans made to their business by the Bank. Although the creditworthiness of the business and its principals is of primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security, if any, in relation to the proposed loan amount. 

Federal law restricts the Bank's permissible lending limits to one borrower to the greater of $500,000 or 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. At December 31, 2015, the Bank's legal lending limit under this restriction was $14.4 million. At that date, the Bank's largest loan relationship to a single borrower was $6.5 million. South Carolina law restricts the Bank's permissible lending limits to one borrower to 10% of unimpaired capital unless prior approval is granted by a two-thirds vote of the Board of Directors, in which case the limit is increased to 15% of unimpaired capital. The Bank's lending limit at 10% of unimpaired capital &#32; was $9.6 million at December 31, 2015. 

Consumer Loans . The Bank originates consumer loans for any personal, family or household purpose, including the financing of home improvements, loans to individuals for residential lots for a future home, automobiles, boats, mobile homes, recreational vehicles and education. The Bank also makes consumer first and second mortgage loans secured by residences. These loans typically do not qualify for sale in the secondary market, but are generally not considered sub-prime lending. In addition, the Bank offers home equity lines of credit. Home equity loans are secured by mortgage liens on the borrower's principal or second residence. Home equity lines are open end lines of credit where the borrowers pay a minimum of interest only monthly on drawn lines. The terms are for a maximum period of 20 years and the rate is a variable rate tied to prime and floats monthly. Margins range from zero to one percent. In 2012, the Bank instituted floors, which currently range from 3.25% to 4.25%, on new originations and a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80% for first mortgages originated by Security Federal and 60% for first mortgages originated by other lenders. Previously, the maximum loan-to-value ratio was 90%, but was decreased because of the current economic environment. At December 31, 2015 , the Bank had $24.2 million of home equity lines of credit outstanding and $20.7 million of additional commitments of home equity lines of credit. The Bank also makes secured and unsecured lines of credit available. Although consumer loans involve a higher level of risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, they generally provide higher yields and have shorter terms to maturity than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2015 , the Bank had total consumer loans of $50.4 million, or 14.7% of the Bank's loan portfolio. 

&#160; 

The Bank's underwriting standards for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant's payment history on other debts and an assessment of ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. The stability of the applicant's monthly income is determined by verification of gross monthly income from primary employment, and from any verifiable secondary income. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security, if any, in relation to the proposed loan amount. 

The Bank also has a credit card program. As of December 31, 2015 , the Bank had issued 3,522 Visa credit cards with &#32; total approved credit lines of $7.0 million, of which $2.3 million was outstanding on that date. 

Loan Delinquencies and Defaults 

General . The Bank's collection procedures provide that when a real estate loan is approximately 20 days past due, the borrower is contacted by mail and payment is requested. If the delinquency continues for another 10 days, subsequent efforts are made to contact the delinquent borrower and establish a program to bring the loan current. In certain instances, the Bank may modify the loan or grant a limited moratorium on loan payments to enable the borrower to reorganize his financial affairs. If the loan continues in a delinquent status for 60 days or more, the Bank generally initiates foreclosure proceedings after the customer has been notified by certified mail. The Bank institutes the same collection procedure for its commercial real estate loans. 

Delinquent Loans . The following table sets forth information concerning delinquent loans at December 31, 2015 . The amounts presented represent the total remaining principal balances of the delinquent loans (before specific reserves for losses), rather than the actual payment amounts which are overdue.

Classified Assets . Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets such as debt and equity securities considered to be of lesser quality as "substandard," "doubtful" or "loss" assets. The regulations require commercial banks to classify their own assets and to establish prudent general allowances for loan losses for assets classified "substandard" or "doubtful." For the portion of assets classified as "loss," an institution is required to either establish specific allowances of 100% of the amount classified or charge off such amount. In addition, the State Board and/or FDIC may require the establishment of a general allowance for losses based on assets classified as "substandard" and "doubtful" or based on the general quality of the asset portfolio of a Bank. See "Regulation - Regulation of the Bank." 

The Company uses a risk based approach based on the following credit quality measures consistent with regulatory guidelines when analyzing the loan portfolio: pass, caution, special mention, and substandard. These indicators are used to rate the credit quality of loans for the purposes of determining the Company&#8217;s allowance for loan losses. Pass loans are loans that are performing and are deemed adequately protected by the net worth of the borrower or the underlying collateral value. These loans are considered to have the least amount of risk in terms of determining the allowance for loan losses. Loans that are graded as substandard are considered to have the most risk. These loans typically have an identified weakness or weaknesses and are inadequately protected by the net worth of the borrower or collateral value. All loans 60 days or more past due are automatically classified in this category. The caution and special mention categories fall in between the pass and substandard grades and consist of loans that do not currently expose the Company to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification but possess weaknesses. 

At December 31, 2015 , $18.4 million &#32;of the Bank's total loan balance were classified "substandard" compared to $24.3 million &#32;at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015 , $18.1 million &#32;were designated as "special mention" compared to $36.1 million &#32;at December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2015 , $49.1 million &#32;were designated as &#8220;caution&#8221; compared to $34.9 million &#32;at December 31, 2014. The Bank had no loans classified as "doubtful" or "loss" at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014. According to generally accepted accounting principles, the Bank is required to account for certain loan modifications or restructuring as a &#8220;troubled debt restructuring&#8221; ("TDRs"). In general, the modification or restructuring of a debt is considered a TDR if the Bank, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that would not otherwise be considered. As of December 31, 2015 , there were $6.7 million &#32;of TDRs compared to $9.6 million at December 31, 2014. The Bank's classification of assets is consistent with FDIC regulatory classifications. 

Non-performing Assets . Loans are placed on non-accrual status when the collection of principal and/or interest becomes doubtful. In addition, all loans are placed on non-accrual status when the loan becomes 90 days or more contractually delinquent. All consumer loans more than 90 days delinquent are charged against the consumer loan allowance for loan losses unless there is adequate collateral which is in the process of being repossessed or foreclosed on. At December 31, 2015 , the Bank &#32; had $6.7 million &#32;in TDRs which involved the Bank restructuring the borrower's interest rate or principal on a loan or making other concessions on loans at a rate materially less than the market rate. Other loans of concern are those loans (not delinquent more than 60 days) that management has determined need to be closely monitored as the potential exists for increased risk on these loans in the future. Non-performing loans are reviewed monthly on a loan by loan basis. Charge-offs, whether partial or in full, associated with these loans will vary based on estimates of recovery for each loan. 

The following table sets forth the amounts and categories of risk elements in the Bank's loan portfolio.

(1) Includes six loans with a balance of $877,000 at December 31, 2015 that are also included in the Non-Accruing Loans section of this table. 

Non-performing loans decreased $6.7 million &#32;to $7.0 million at December 31, 2015 from $13.7 million at December 31, 2014 primarily due to a decrease in non-performing commercial real estate loans, which decreased $6.9 million &#32;to $3.0 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;from $9.9 million &#32;at December 31, 2014. The balance in non-performing commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2015 &#32;consisted of 17 loans to 14 borrowers with an average loan balance of $175,000 compared to 46 loans to 28 borrowers with an average loan balance of $214,000 at December 31, 2014. 

Of the non-performing commercial real estate category, $1.6 million consisted of 11 loans secured by commercial buildings or first mortgages on principal residences throughout the Bank's market area to nine different borrowers; $314,000 consisted of one loan related to the acquisition and development of a subdivision; $219,000 consisted of one loan secured by builder lots; $160,000 consisted of two loans secured by raw land to two separate borrowers; and $642,000 consisted of two loans secured by a church building to one borrower. At December 31, 2015 , our largest non-performing commercial real estate loan was $530,000 and was secured by a church building. 

Non-performing residential real estate loans increased $245,000 to $3.3 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;from $3.1 million at December 31, 2014. The balance in non-performing residential real estate loans at December 31, 2015 &#32;consisted of 24 loans to 24 different borrowers with an average loan balance of $138,000, the largest of which was $386,000. The balance in non-performing residential real estate loans at December 31, 2014 consisted of 27 loans to 27 different borrowers with an average loan balance of $113,000, the largest of which was $415,000. 

&#160; 

Also included in non-accruing loans at December 31, 2015 &#32;were 13 consumer loans totaling $576,000 and two commercial business loans totaling $178,000. Of the 13 consumer loans on non-accrual status at December 31, 2015 , the largest had a balance of $188,000. 

At December 31, 2015 , there were no accruing loans equal to or more than 90 days delinquent. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , the interest income not recognized and would have been recognized with respect to non-accruing loans, had such loans been current in accordance with their original terms and with respect to TDRs, had such loans been current in accordance with their original terms, totaled $679,000 compared to $920,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015 actual interest recorded on these loans amounted to $296,000 compared to $327,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. 

&#160; 

Troubled Debt Restructurings . The Bank identifies and reviews all loans to be restructured based on an assessment of the borrower's credit status. This assessment is a continuous process that involves a review of the financial statements and prospects for repayment, payment delinquency, non-accrual status, and risk rating. 

Not all loan modifications are TDRs. The Bank designates a loan modification as a TDR when the following two conditions are present: the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, and because of this difficulty, the Bank grants a concession it would not otherwise consider. Typically these concessions involve a change in the interest rate, maturity date or payment amount or some combination of each. These concessions rarely result in the forgiveness of principal or interest. TDRs are considered impaired and initially reported as non-performing loans on non-accrual status. Non-performing TDRs may be returned to accrual status when payment in full of all amounts due under the restructured terms is anticipated and the borrower has demonstrated a sustained payment history which is typically six months. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015 , the Bank modified seven loans that were considered to be TDRs. The Bank had 16 &#32;loans totaling $6.7 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;which were TDRs compared to 18 &#32;loans totaling $9.6 million &#32;at December 31, 2014. The 16 TDRs included one consumer loan secured by a first mortgage on a residential dwelling and two automobiles totaling $63,000, and one unsecured consumer loan totaling $26,000. All of the remaining 14 TDRs consisted of commercial real estate loans to 10 separate borrowers. 

&#32;Six of the TDRs to four borrowers totaling $1.2 million were in default at December 31, 2015 . All of the remaining TDRs were current at December 31, 2015 . The Bank considers any loan 30 days or more past due to be in default. 

Potential Problem Loans. &#32;Potential problem loans include substandard loans that are not already included as non-accrual loans or TDRs and special mention loans where management has become aware of information regarding possible credit issues for borrowers that could potentially cause doubt about their ability to comply with current repayment terms. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Bank had identified $29.5 million and $46.7 million, respectively, of potential problem loans through its internal loan review procedures. 

Repossessed Assets . OREO had a balance of $4.4 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 and consisted of the following real estate properties: &#32; &#32;seven single-family residences and 29 lots within residential subdivisions located throughout our market area in South Carolina and Georgia; eight lots within a subdivision and THE adjacent 22.96 acres of land in Aiken, South Carolina; nine parcels of commercial land; two commercial buildings in Aiken, South Carolina; and 34.8 acres of land in Bluffton, South Carolina. &#32;&#32; 

Provision for Losses on Loans . Security Federal recognizes that it will experience credit losses during the course of making loans and that the risk of loss will vary with, among other things, the type of loan being made, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and, in the case of a secured loan, the quality of the underlying security for the loan. The Bank seeks to establish and maintain sufficient reserves for estimated losses on specifically identified loans and real estate where such losses can be estimated. Additionally, general reserves for estimated possible losses are established on specified portions of the Bank's portfolio such as consumer loans and higher risk residential construction mortgage loans based on management's estimate of the potential loss for loans which normally can be classified as higher risk. Specific and general reserves are based on, among other criteria: (1) the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, (2) current economic conditions on a local as well as a statewide basis, (3) actual losses experienced historically and (4) the level of reserves for possible losses in the future. 

At December 31, 2015 , the allowance for loan losses or reserve was $8.3 million . In determining the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses, management reviews past experience of loan charge-offs, the level of past due and non-accrual loans, the size and mix of the portfolio, general economic conditions in the market area, and individual loans to identify potential credit problems. Commercial business, commercial real estate and consumer loans were $263.0 million, or 76.9% of the Bank's total loan portfolio at December 31, 2015 . Although these types of loans carry a higher level of credit risk than conventional residential mortgage loans, the level of reserves reflects management's continuing evaluation of this risk based on the Bank's past loss experience. At December 31, 2015 , the Bank's ratio of loans delinquent more than 60 days to total assets was 1.17%. The reserve is management's best estimate for offsetting risk for our estimated possible losses. There can be no guarantee that the estimate is adequate or accurate. 

Management believes that reserves for loan losses are at a level adequate to provide for inherent loan losses. Although management believes that it has considered all relevant factors in its estimation of future losses, future adjustments to reserves may be necessary if conditions change substantially from the assumptions used in making the original estimations. Regulators will from time to time evaluate the allowance for loan losses which is subject to adjustment based upon the information available to the regulators at the time of their examinations. 

The following table sets forth an analysis of the Bank's allowance for loan losses during the dates indicated.

Subsidiaries 

At December 31, 2015, Security Federal's net investment in its subsidiaries (including loans to subsidiaries) totaled $5.0 million. In addition to investments in subsidiaries, federal institutions are permitted to invest an unlimited amount in operating subsidiaries engaged solely in activities which a commercial bank may engage in directly. 

Security Federal Insurance, Inc. ("SFINS") . SFINS, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank, was formed during the year ended March 31, 2002 and began operating during the December 2001 quarter. SFINS is an insurance agency offering auto, business, and home insurance, and premium finance. The operations of SFINS are included in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Collier Jennings Financial Corporation . Collier Jennings Financial Corporation is a subsidiary of SFINS, a subsidiary of the Bank, which is described above. The Company acquired the insurance and insurance premium finance businesses of Collier Jennings Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries, Security Federal Auto Insurance, Inc., The Auto Insurance Store, Inc., and Security Federal Premium Pay Plans, Inc. (the "Collier-Jennings Companies"), effective June 30, 2006. 

Investment Activities 

Investment securities . The Bank has authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations and securities of various federal agencies, certificates of deposit at insured institutions, mutual funds, bankers' acceptances and federal funds. The Bank may also invest a portion of its assets in certain commercial paper and corporate debt securities. See "Regulation - Regulation of the Bank." 

As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") System, Security Federal must maintain minimum levels of investments that are liquid assets as defined in Federal regulations. See "Regulation - Regulation of the Bank - Federal Home Loan Bank System." Liquidity may increase or decrease depending upon the availability of funds and comparative yields on investments in relation to the return on loans. 

Historically, the Bank has maintained its liquid assets at a level believed adequate to meet requirements of normal daily activities, repayment of maturing debt and potential deposit outflows. Management regularly reviews and updates cash flow projections to assure that adequate liquidity is provided. 

The following table sets forth the composition of the Company's portfolio of securities and other investments, excluding mortgage-backed securities.

(1) Does not include mortgage-backed securities. 

At December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any investment securities (exclusive of obligations of the U.S. Government and federal agencies) issued by any one entity with a total book value in excess of 10% of its shareholders' equity. &#32; SBA bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government and carry a zero percent risk base when calculating risk based assets for regulatory capital purposes. 

FHLB securities, Federal Farm Credit Bank securities, Fannie Mae bonds and Freddie Mac bonds are all securities that are issued by government sponsored enterprises ("GSEs"). GSE securities are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. 

The following table sets forth the maturities or repricing of investment securities, not including mortgage-backed securities, and FHLB stock at December 31, 2015, and the weighted average yields of such securities and FHLB stock (calculated on the basis of the cost and effective yields weighted for the scheduled maturity of each security). Tax equivalent yields on tax &#32; exempt municipal bonds are calculated using a 34% tax rate. Callable securities are shown at their likely call dates based on &#32; current interest rates. The table was prepared using amortized cost. Small Business Administration securities are based on maturity dates without the effect of scheduled payments or anticipated prepayments.

(1) FHLB stock has no stated maturity date. 

(2) Excludes mortgage-backed securities with a total amortized cost of $210.1 million and a yield of 2.35%. 

For information regarding the market value of the Bank's securities portfolios, see Notes 2 &#32;and 3 &#32;of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Annual Report. 

Mortgage-backed Securities . Security Federal has a portfolio of mortgage-backed securities in its portfolio. Mortgage-backed securities can serve as collateral for borrowings and, through repayments, as a source of liquidity. Under the Bank's risk-based capital requirement, mortgage-backed securities have a risk weight of 20% (or 0% in the case of Government National Mortgage Association ("Ginnie Mae") securities) compared to the 50% risk weight carried by residential loans. 

The following table sets forth the composition of the mortgage-backed securities available for sale portfolio at fair value and the held to maturity portfolio at amortized cost at the dates indicated.

Sources of Funds 

Deposit accounts have traditionally been a principal source of the Bank's funds for use in lending and for other general business purposes. In addition to deposits, the Bank derives funds from loan repayments, cash flows generated from operations (including interest credited to deposit accounts), FHLB of Atlanta advances, borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta ("Federal Reserve"), the sale of securities under agreements to repurchase, and loan sales. See "- Borrowings" below and Note &#32; 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Annual Report. Scheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds while deposit inflows and outflows and the related cost of such funds have varied widely. FHLB of Atlanta advances, borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank and the sale of securities under agreements to repurchase may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for seasonal reductions in deposits or deposit inflows at less than projected levels and may be used on a longer term basis in support of expanded lending activities. The availability of funds from loan sales is influenced by general interest rates. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained in the Annual Report. 

&#160; 

Deposits . The Bank attracts both short-term and long-term deposits from the general public by offering a wide assortment of account types and rates. The Bank offers regular savings accounts, checking accounts, various money market accounts, fixed interest rate certificates with varying maturities, negotiated rate $100,000 or above jumbo certificates of deposit ("Jumbo CDs") and individual retirement accounts. 

At December 31, 2015, the Bank had $42.5 million &#32;in brokered deposits. The Bank believes that, based on its experience over the past several years, its savings and transaction accounts are stable sources of deposits. 

The following table sets forth the dollar amount of savings deposits in the various types of deposit programs at the dates indicated.

Borrowings 

As a member of the FHLB of Atlanta, the Bank is required to own capital stock in the FHLB of Atlanta and is authorized to apply for advances from the FHLB of Atlanta. Each FHLB credit program has its own interest rate, which may be fixed or variable, and range of maturities. The FHLB of Atlanta may prescribe the acceptable uses to which these advances may be put, &#32; as well as limitations on the size of the advances and repayment provisions. At December 31, 2015, the Bank had $34.6 million &#32; in outstanding advances from the FHLB of Atlanta. See Note 10 &#32;of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Annual Report for information regarding the maturities and rate structure of the Bank's FHLB advances. Federal law contains certain collateral requirements for FHLB advances. See "Regulation - Regulation of the Bank - Federal Home Loan Bank System." 

At December 31, 2015, the Company had $5.2 million &#32;in junior subordinated debentures. The debentures accrue and pay distributions quarterly at a floating rate of three-month LIBOR plus 170 points which was equal to 2.21% at December 31, 2015. The debentures were callable by the Company in September 2011, and quarterly thereafter, with a final maturity date of December 15, 2036. See Note 11 &#32;of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Annual Report for more information. 

On December 1, 2009, the Company issued $6.1 million in convertible senior debentures. The debentures will mature on December 1, 2029 and accrue interest at the rate of 8.0% per annum until maturity or earlier redemption or repayment. Interest on the debentures is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing June 1, 2010. The debentures are convertible into the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $20 per share at the option of the holder at any time prior to maturity. The convertible senior debentures are redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company at any time on or after December 1, 2019, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the debentures to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. See Note 12 &#32;of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Annual Report for more information. 

The following table sets forth the maximum month-end balance and average balance of FHLB advances, other borrowings and junior subordinated debentures for the periods indicated.

Competition 

The Bank serves the counties of Aiken, Richland, and Lexington, South Carolina, and Columbia County, Georgia through its 14 full service branch offices located in Aiken, Ballentine, Clearwater, Columbia, Graniteville, Langley, Lexington, North Augusta, Wagener, and West Columbia, South Carolina, and a branch office in Columbia County, Evans, Georgia. The newest branch in Ballentine, South Carolina opened in December 2015. 

Security Federal faces strong competition both in originating loans and in attracting deposits. Competition in originating loans comes primarily from other commercial banks, federal savings institutions, mortgage bankers and credit unions who also make loans in the Bank's market area. The Bank competes for loans principally on the basis of the interest rates and loan fees it charges, the types of loans it makes and the quality of services it provides to borrowers. 

The Bank faces substantial competition in attracting deposits from federal savings institutions, commercial banks, money market and mutual funds, credit unions and other investment vehicles. The ability of the Bank to attract and retain deposits depends on its ability to provide an investment opportunity that satisfies the requirements of investors as to rate of return, liquidity, risk and other factors. The Bank attracts a significant amount of deposits through its branch offices primarily from the communities in which those branch offices are located. Therefore, competition for those deposits is principally from federal savings institutions and commercial banks located in the same communities. The Bank competes for these deposits by offering a variety of deposit accounts at competitive rates, convenient business hours, and convenient branch locations with interbranch deposit and withdrawal privileges at each. 

The authority to offer money market deposits, and expanded lending and other powers authorized for savings and loan associations by federal law, have resulted in increased competition for both deposits and loans between banks and other financial institutions such as savings and loans and credit unions. 

Personnel 

At December 31, 2015, the Company employed 190 full-time and 24 part-time employees. The Bank employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement. Management of the Bank considers its relations with its employees to be good.

REGULATION 

The following is a brief description of certain laws and regulations which are applicable to the Company and the Bank. Descriptions of laws and regulations here and elsewhere in this Form 10-K do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations. Legislation is introduced from time to time in the United States Congress or in the South Carolina State Legislature that may affect the operations of the Company and the Bank. In addition, the regulations governing the Company and the Bank may be amended from time to time by the State Board, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve or the SEC, as appropriate. Any such legislation or regulatory changes in the future could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. We cannot predict whether any such changes may occur. 

As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to examination and supervision by, and is required to file certain reports with, the Federal Reserve. The Company also is subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC under the federal securities laws. The Bank, as a state-chartered savings bank, is subject to regulation and oversight by the State Board, the applicable provisions of South Carolina law and by the regulations of the State Board adopted thereunder. The Bank also is subject to regulation and examination by the FDIC, which insures its deposits to the maximum extent permitted by law. 

The laws and regulations affecting depository institutions and their holding companies have changed significantly particularly in connection with the enactment of The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (&#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;). Among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve. The CFPB assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations and has authority to impose new requirements. The Bank is subject to consumer protection regulations issued by the CFPB, but as a smaller financial institution, we are generally subject to supervision and enforcement by the FDIC and the State Board with respect to our compliance with consumer financial protection laws and CFPB regulations 

Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking by the federal banking agencies, which has not been completed and in some instances will not take effect for some time, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the Bank, the Company and the financial services industry more generally. 

Regulation of the Bank 

The Bank is an FDIC-insured, state-chartered commercial bank and is subject to various statutory requirements and rules and regulations promulgated and enforced primarily by the FDIC and the State Board. These statutes, rules, and regulations relate to insurance of deposits, required reserves, allowable investments, loans, mergers, consolidations, issuance of securities, payment of dividends, establishment of branches and other aspects of the business of the Bank. The FDIC has broad authority to prohibit the Bank from engaging in what it determines to be unsafe or unsound banking practices. In addition, federal law imposes a number of restrictions on state-chartered, FDIC-insured banks, and their subsidiaries. These restrictions range from prohibitions against engaging as a principal in certain activities to the requirement of prior notification of branch closings. The Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System. 

The Bank is required to file periodic reports with the FDIC and the State Board and is subject to periodic examinations and evaluations by those regulatory authorities. Based on these evaluations, the regulators may revalue the assets of an institution and require that it establish specific reserves to compensate for the differences between the determined value and the book value of these assets. The FDIC and the State Board may each accept the results of an examination by the other in lieu of conducting an independent examination. 

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation . The Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF") of the FDIC insures deposit accounts in the Bank up to $250,000 per separately insured depositor and such insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government. As insurer, the FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions. It also may prohibit any FDIC-insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the insurance fund. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against savings institutions and may terminate the deposit insurance if it determines that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition. Our deposit insurance premiums for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $611,000. 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC's deposit insurance assessments to be based on assets instead of deposits. The FDIC issued rules which specify that the assessment base for a bank is equal to its total average consolidated assets less average tangible capital. The FDIC revised assessment schedule established assessment rates that range from approximately 2.5 basis points to 45 basis points, depending on applicable adjustments for unsecured debt issued by an institution and brokered deposits 

(and a further adjustment for institutions that hold unsecured debt of other FDIC-insured institutions), until such time as the FDIC's reserve ratio equals 1.15%. Once the FDIC's reserve ratio reaches 1.15% and the reserve ratio for the immediately prior assessment period is less than 2.0%, the applicable assessment rates may range from three basis points to 30 basis points (subject to adjustments as described above). If the reserve ratio for the prior assessment period is equal to, or greater than 2.0% and less than 2.5%, the assessment rates may range from two basis points to 28 basis points and if the reserve ratio for the prior assessment period is greater than 2.5%, the assessment rates may range from one basis point to 25 basis points (in each case subject to adjustments as described above). No institution may pay a dividend if it is in default on its federal deposit insurance assessment. 

The FDIC conducts examinations of and requires reporting by state non-member banks, such as the Bank. The FDIC also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the DIF. 

In addition to the assessment for deposit insurance, institutions are required to make payments on bonds issued in the late 1980s by the Financing Corporation to recapitalize a predecessor deposit insurance fund. These assessments, which may be revised based upon the level of DIF deposits, will continue until the bonds mature in the years 2017 through 2019. This payment is established quarterly and is an annual rate of 0.58 basis points of assessable assets for December 31, 2015. The Financing Corporation was chartered in 1987 solely for the purpose of functioning as a vehicle for the recapitalization of the deposit insurance system. For 2015, the Bank incurred approximately $43,000 in assessments. 

The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible capital. If insurance of accounts is terminated, the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC. Management is not aware of any existing circumstances which would result in termination of the Bank's deposit insurance. 

A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. There can be no prediction as to what changes in insurance assessment rates may be made in the future. 

&#160; 

Prompt Corrective Action . Federal statutes establish a supervisory framework based on five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. An institution's category depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to relevant capital measures, which include a risk-based capital measure, a leverage ratio capital measure and certain other factors. The well-capitalized category is described below in "Capital Requirements". 

&#32; An institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits, including restrictions on the rates it can offer on its deposits, generally. Any institution which is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized is considered undercapitalized. 

Undercapitalized institutions are also subject to certain prompt corrective action requirements, regulatory controls and restrictions that become more extensive as an institution becomes more severely undercapitalized. Failure by institutions to comply with applicable capital requirements would, if unremedied, result in progressively more severe restrictions on their activities and lead to enforcement actions, including, but not limited to, the issuance of a capital directive to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels and, ultimately, the appointment of the FDIC as receiver or conservator. Banking regulators will take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. Additionally, approval of any regulatory application filed for review by the banking agencies may be dependent on compliance with capital requirements. 

At December 31, 2015, the Bank was categorized as "well capitalized" under the prompt corrective action regulations of the FDIC. For additional information, see "Capital Requirements" below and Note 14 &#32;of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. 

Capital Requirements . Federally insured financial institutions, such as the Bank, are required to maintain a minimum level of regulatory capital. 

Effective January 1, 2015 (with some changes transitioned into full effectiveness over two to four years), the Bank became subject to new capital adequacy requirements adopted by the FDIC, which create a new required ratio for common equity Tier 1 ("CET1") capital, increases the leverage and Tier 1 capital ratios, changes the risk-weightings of certain assets for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios, creates an additional capital conservation buffer over the required capital ratios and changes what qualifies 

as capital for purpose of meeting these various capital requirements. These regulations implement the regulatory capital reforms required by the Dodd Frank Act and the &#8220;Basel III&#8221; requirements. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by bank regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Bank is required to maintain additional levels of Tier 1 common equity over the minimum risk-based capital levels before it may pay dividends, repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses. 

Under the new capital regulations, the minimum requirements are a ratio of CET1 capital to total risk-weighted assets (the "CET1 risk-based ratio") of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, a total capital ratio of 8.0%, and a leverage ratio of 4.0%. In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and total capital ratios, the Bank will have to maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. This new capital conservation buffer requirement is to be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented in January 2019. 

In addition to the capital requirements, there are a number of changes in what constitutes regulatory capital, subject to transition periods. These changes include the phasing-out of certain instruments as qualifying capital. Mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets over designated percentages of CET1 will be deducted from capital, subject to a four-year transition period. CET1 will consist of Tier 1 capital less all capital components that are not considered common equity. In addition, Tier 1 capital will include accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities, subject to a four-year transition period. Because of the Bank's asset size, it was not considered an advanced approaches banking organization and elected in the first quarter of calendar year 2015 to take the one-time option of deciding to permanently opt-out of the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities in its capital calculations. The new requirements also include changes in the risk-weighting of assets to better reflect credit risk and other risk exposure. These include a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and for non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days or more past due or otherwise on non-accrual status; a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable; and a 250% risk weight (up from 100%) for mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital. 

&#160; 

Under the new standards, in order to be considered well-capitalized, the Bank must have a CET1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% (new), a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% (increased from 6.0%), a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% (unchanged) and a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 5.0% (unchanged). 

At December 31, 2015, the Bank met the requirements to be "well capitalized" and met the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer requirement. Management monitors the capital levels of the Bank to provide for current and future business opportunities and to meet regulatory guidelines for &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; institutions. 

The FDIC also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon a determination that an institution's capital level is or may become inadequate in light of particular risks or circumstances. Management of the Bank believes that, under the current regulations, the Bank will continue to meet its minimum capital requirements in the foreseeable future. 

For a complete description of the Bank's required and actual capital levels on December 31, 2015, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. 

&#160; 

Federal Home Loan Bank System . The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Atlanta, which is one of 11 regional FHLBs that administer the home financing credit function of financial institutions. The FHLBs are subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. The FHLBs are funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System and makes loans or advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB, which are subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Board. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB. In addition, all long-term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing. At December 31, 2015 , the Bank had $34.6 million &#32;of outstanding advances from the FHLB of Atlanta under an available credit facility of $240.2 million, which is limited to available collateral. See "Business - Sources of Funds - Borrowings." 

As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of Atlanta. At December 31, 2015, the Bank had $2.2 million &#32;in FHLB stock, which was in compliance with this requirement. In past years, the Bank has received 

substantial dividends on its FHLB stock. These dividend yields have averaged 4.91% for the year ended December 31, 2015; 4.16% for the year ended December 31, 2014; and 2.61% for the year ended December 31, 2013. 

The FHLBs continue to contribute to low- and moderately-priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income housing projects. These contributions have in the past affected adversely the level of FHLB dividends paid and could continue to do so in the future. These contributions could also have an adverse effect on the value of FHLB stock in the future. A reduction in value of the Bank's FHLB stock may result in a corresponding reduction in the Bank's capital. 

Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 ("EESA") . &#32;&#32; ESA was enacted in October 2008 and authorizes the Treasury Department to purchase from financial institutions and their holding companies up to $700 billion in mortgage loans, mortgage-related securities and certain other financial instruments, including debt and equity securities issued by financial institutions and their holding companies in a troubled asset relief program ("TARP"). The purpose of TARP is to restore confidence and stability to the U.S. banking system and to encourage financial institutions to increase their lending to customers and to each other. Under the TARP CPP, the Treasury purchased debt or equity securities from participating institutions. The TARP also included direct purchases or guarantees of troubled assets of financial institutions. Participants in the CPP are subject to executive compensation limits and are encouraged to expand their lending and mortgage loan modifications. The Company completed its TARP CPP transaction on December 19, 2008, receiving $18.0 million in funding for the issuance of its Series A Preferred Stock to Treasury. 

Under TARP, the Company also is a participant in the U.S. Treasury's CDCI. The Company completed its CDCI transaction on September 29, 2010. In connection with its participation in the CDCI, the Company exchanged $18.0 million of its Series A Preferred Stock for $18.0 million of Series B Preferred Stock and simultaneously sold an additional $4.0 million of its Series B Preferred Stock to the U.S. Treasury. For additional information regarding the Company's participation in the CDCI, see " - Corporate Overview - Community Development Capital Initiative ("CDCI"). 

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 . On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ("ARRA") into law. The ARRA is intended to revive the U.S. economy by creating millions of new jobs and stemming home foreclosures. For financial institutions that received financial assistance under TARP or related programs, the ARRA significantly rewrote the original executive compensation and corporate governance provisions of Section 111 of the EESA. Among the most important changes instituted by the ARRA were new limits on the ability of TARP recipients to pay incentive compensation to up to 20 of the next most highly-compensated employees in addition to the "senior executive officers," a restriction on termination of employment payments to senior executive officers and the five next most highly-compensated employees and a requirement that TARP recipients implement "say on pay" shareholder votes. 

Affiliate Transactions . The Company and the Bank are separate and distinct legal entities. Federal laws strictly limit the ability of banks to engage in certain transactions with their affiliates, including their bank holding companies. Transactions deemed to be a "covered transaction" under Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and between a subsidiary bank and its parent company or the nonbank subsidiaries of the bank holding company are limited to 10% of the bank subsidiary's capital and surplus and, with respect to the parent company and all such nonbank subsidiaries, to an aggregate of 20% of the bank subsidiary's capital and surplus. Further, covered transactions that are loans and extensions of credit generally are required to be secured by eligible collateral in specified amounts. Federal law also requires that covered transactions and certain other transactions listed in Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act between a bank and its affiliates be on terms as favorable to the bank as transactions with non-affiliates. 

Community Reinvestment Act . The Bank is also subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which requires the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency to assess a bank's record in meeting the credit needs of the community serviced by the bank, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The regulatory agency's assessment of the bank's record is made available to the public. Further, an assessment is required of any bank which has applied to establish a new branch office that will accept deposits, relocate an existing office or merge or consolidate with, or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of, a federally regulated financial institution. The Bank received an "outstanding" rating during its most recent examination. 

Dividends . Dividends from the Bank constitute the major source of funds for dividends which may be paid by the Company to shareholders. The amount of dividends payable by the Bank to the Company depends upon the Bank's earnings and capital position, and is limited by federal and state laws, regulations and policies. South Carolina banking regulations restrict the amount of dividends that the Bank can pay to the Company, and may require prior approval before declaration and payment of any excess dividend. 

The amount of dividends actually paid during any one period will be strongly affected by the Bank's management policy of maintaining a strong capital position. Federal law further provides that no insured depository institution may pay a cash dividend if it would cause the institution to be "undercapitalized," as defined in the prompt corrective action regulations. Moreover, the federal bank regulatory agencies also have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks if such payments should be deemed to constitute an unsafe and unsound practice. 

Activities of Insured State-Chartered Financial Institutions . Federal law generally limits the activities and equity investments of FDIC-insured, state-chartered banks to those that are permissible for national banks. An insured state bank is not prohibited from, among other things, (i) acquiring or retaining a majority interest in a subsidiary, (ii) investing as a limited partner in a partnership the sole purpose of which is direct or indirect investment in the acquisition, rehabilitation or new construction of a qualified housing project, provided that such limited partnership investments may not exceed 2% of the bank's total assets, (iii) acquiring up to 10% of the voting stock of a company that solely provides or reinsures directors', trustees' and officers' liability insurance coverage or bankers' blanket bond group insurance coverage for insured depository institutions, (iv) acting as agent for a customer in many capacities, and (v) acquiring or retaining the voting shares of a depository institution if certain requirements are met. 

Federal Reserve System . The Federal Reserve Board requires that all depository institutions maintain reserves on transaction accounts or non-personal time deposits. These reserves may be in the form of cash or non-interest-bearing deposits with the regional Federal Reserve Bank. Negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts and other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties fall within the definition of transaction accounts and are subject to the reserve requirements, as are any non-personal time deposits at a savings bank. As of December 31, 2015 , the Bank's deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and vault cash exceeded its reserve requirements. 

Standards for Safety and Soundness . The federal banking regulatory agencies have prescribed, by regulation, guidelines for all insured depository institutions relating to internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; loan documentation; credit underwriting; interest rate risk exposure; asset growth; asset quality; earnings; and compensation, fees and benefits. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. Each insured depository institution must implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the institution&#8217;s size and complexity and the nature and scope of its activities. The information security program must be designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information, protect against any unanticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information, protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer, and ensure the proper disposal of customer and consumer information. Each insured depository institution must also develop and implement a risk-based response program to address incidents of unauthorized access to customer information in customer information systems. If the FDIC determines that an institution fails to meet any of these guidelines, it may require an institution to submit to the FDIC an acceptable plan to achieve compliance. 

Environmental Issues Associated with Real Estate Lending . The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), a federal statute, generally imposes strict liability on all prior and present "owners and operators" of sites containing hazardous waste. However, Congress acted to protect secured creditors by providing that the term "owner and operator" excludes a person whose ownership is limited to protecting its security interest in the site. Since the enactment of the CERCLA, this "secured creditor exemption" has been the subject of judicial interpretations which have left open the possibility that lenders could be liable for cleanup costs on contaminated property that they hold as collateral for a loan. 

To the extent that legal uncertainty exists in this area, all creditors, including the Bank, that have made loans secured by properties with potential hazardous waste contamination (such as petroleum contamination) could be subject to liability for cleanup costs, which costs often substantially exceed the value of the collateral property. 

Privacy Standards . The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 (&#8220;GLBA&#8221;) modernized the financial services industry by establishing a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks, insurance companies, securities firms and other financial service providers. The Bank is subject to FDIC regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of the GLBA. These regulations require the Bank to disclose its privacy policy, including informing consumers of its information sharing practices and informing consumers of their rights to opt out of certain practices. 

Other Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations . The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB and empowered it to exercise broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority with respect to both new and existing consumer financial protection laws. The Bank is subject to consumer protection regulations issued by the CFPB, but as a financial institution with assets of less than $10 billion, the Bank is generally subject to supervision and enforcement by the FDIC and the State Board with respect to our compliance with consumer financial protection laws and CFPB regulations. 

The Bank is subject to a broad array of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern almost every aspect of its business relationships with consumers. While the list set forth below is not exhaustive, these include the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, the Consumer Leasing Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, laws governing flood insurance, laws governing consumer protections in connection with the sale of insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices, and various regulations that implement some or all of the foregoing. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans, and providing other services. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the Bank to various penalties, including but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines, civil liability, criminal penalties, punitive damages, and the loss of certain contractual rights. 

Regulation of the Company 

General . The Company, as the sole shareholder of the Bank, is a registered bank holding company with the Federal Reserve. Bank holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended ("BHCA"), and the regulations promulgated thereunder. As a bank holding company, the Company is required to file with the Federal Reserve quarterly and periodic reports and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require and is subject to regular examinations by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve may examine the Company, and any of its subsidiaries, and charge the Company for the cost of the examination. The Federal Reserve also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to require that a holding company divest subsidiaries (including its bank subsidiaries). In general, enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of law and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. 

The Bank Holding Company Act . Under the BHCA, the Company is supervised by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has a policy that a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act and earlier Federal Reserve policy provide that a bank holding company should serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary bank by having the ability to provide financial assistance to its subsidiary bank during periods of financial distress to the bank, and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary bank. A bank holding company's failure to meet its obligation to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve's regulations or both. No regulations have yet been proposed by the Federal Reserve to implement the source of strength doctrine required by the Dodd-Frank Act. 

The Company and any subsidiaries that it may control are considered "affiliates" within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act, and transactions between the Bank and affiliates are subject to numerous restrictions. With some exceptions, the Company and its subsidiaries, are prohibited from tying the provision of various services, such as extensions of credit, to other services offered by the Company, or by its affiliates. 

Acquisitions . The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. Under the BHCA, the Federal Reserve is authorized to approve the ownership of shares by a bank holding company in any company, the activities of which the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. The list of activities determined by regulation to be closely related to banking within the meaning of the BHCA includes, among other things: operating a savings institution, mortgage company, finance company, credit card company or factoring company; performing certain data processing operations; providing certain investment and financial advice; underwriting and acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit-related insurance; leasing property on a full-payout, non-operating basis; selling money orders, travelers' checks and U.S. Savings Bonds; real estate and personal property appraising; providing tax planning and preparation services; and, subject to certain limitations, providing securities brokerage services for customers. 

Capital Requirements . Bank holding companies are subject to capital adequacy requirements of the Federal Reserve under the BHCA and the regulations of the Federal Reserve. For a bank holding company with less than $1.0 billion in assets, the capital guidelines apply on a bank only basis and the Federal Reserve expects the holding company's subsidiary banks to be well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company&#8217;s total risk-based capital 

was 24.4% &#32;of risk-weighted assets and its Tier 1 (core) capital was 21.7% &#32;of risk-weighted assets. If Security Federal Corporation was subject to regulatory guidelines for bank holding companies with $1.0 billion or more in assets, at December 31, 2015, it would have exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. Effective January 1, 2015, the amended regulatory risk-based capital rules to implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act were implemented. For a discussion of the new capital rules, see the section above entitled &#8220;- Regulation of the Bank - Capital Requirements&#8221; and Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. 

&#32; Interstate Banking . The Federal Reserve may approve an application of a bank holding company to acquire control of, or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, a bank located in a state other than such holding company's home state, without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state except with respect to the acquisition of a bank that has not been in existence for the minimum time period, not exceeding five years, specified by the law of the host state. The Federal Reserve may not approve an application if the applicant controls or would control more than 10% of the insured deposits in the United States or 30% or more of the deposits in the target bank's home state or in any state in which the target bank maintains a branch. Federal law does not affect the authority of states to limit the percentage of total insured deposits in the state that may be held or controlled by a bank holding company to the extent such limitation does not discriminate against out-of-state banks or bank holding companies. Individual states may also waive the 30% state-wide concentration limit contained in the federal law. 

The federal banking agencies are authorized to approve interstate merger transactions without regard to whether such transaction is prohibited by the law of any state, unless the home state of one of the banks adopted a law prior to June 1, 1997 which applies equally to all out-of-state banks and expressly prohibits merger transactions involving out-of-state banks. Interstate acquisitions of branches will be permitted only if the law of the state in which the branch is located permits such acquisitions. Interstate mergers and branch acquisitions will also be subject to the nationwide and statewide insured deposit concentration amounts described above. 

Dividends . As a South Carolina corporation, the Company is subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends under South Carolina law. In addition, the Company is an entity separate and distinct from its principal subsidiary, Security Federal Bank, and derives substantially all of its revenue in the form of dividends from this subsidiary. Accordingly, the Company is, and will be, dependent upon dividends from the Bank to pay the principal of and interest on its indebtedness, to satisfy its other cash needs and to pay dividends on its common stock. The Company is also subject to certain federal regulatory considerations. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve's view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company's net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earning retention that is consistent with the company's capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition, and that it is inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. 

As a result of the Company's participation in the TARP CDCI, it is subject to certain limitations regarding the payment of dividends on and the repurchase of its common stock. Without the consent of the U.S. Treasury, the Company may not increase the cash dividend on its common stock or, pay any dividends on its common stock unless it is current in its dividend payments to the U.S. Treasury on the Series B Preferred Stock. In addition and subject to limited exceptions, with the consent of the U.S. Treasury, the Company also may not redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire shares of its common stock or preferred stock other than the Series B Preferred Stock or trust preferred securities. 

Stock Repurchases . Bank holding companies, except for certain "well-capitalized" and highly rated bank holding companies, are required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of their consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve. 

Federal Securities Laws . &#32;&#32;The Company&#8217;s common stock is registered with the SEC under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). We are subject to information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Exchange Act. 

The Dodd-Frank Act . &#32;&#32;On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank-Act imposes new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions and implements new capital regulations that the Company and the Bank will become subject to and that are discussed above under the section entitled &#8220;- Regulation of the Bank - Capital Requirements.&#8221; 

In addition, among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies, like the Company, to (i) provide their shareholders with a non-binding vote (a) at least once every three years on the compensation paid to executive officers and (b) at least once every six years on whether they should have a &#8220;say on pay&#8221; vote every one, two or three years; (ii) have a separate, non-binding shareholder vote regarding golden parachutes for named executive officers when a shareholder vote takes place on mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or other transactions that would trigger the parachute payments; (iii) provide disclosure in annual proxy materials concerning the relationship between the executive compensation paid and the financial performance of the issuer; and (iv) amend Item 402 of Regulation S-K to require companies to disclose the ratio of the Chief Executive Officer's annual total compensation to the median annual total compensation of all other employees. For certain of these changes, the implementing regulations have not been promulgated, so the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on public companies cannot be determined at this time. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 . As a public company that files periodic reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act, the Company is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (&#8220;Sarbanes-Oxley Act&#8221;), which addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems, such as the regulation of the accounting profession, and to state corporate law, such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees. Our policies and procedures have been updated to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 

&#160; 

Jumpstart Our Business Startups ("JOBS") Act . The JOBS Act was signed into law on April 5, 2012 and allows banks and bank holding companies to terminate the registration of a class of securities under Section 12(g) and Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act if such class is held of record by less than 1,200 persons, an increase from the prior 300 person threshold. The SEC issued proposed rules on August 29, 2012 and on December 18, 2014 and has also mandated rules under Title III of the JOBS Act. The Company's Board continues to evaluate the costs and advantages and disadvantages of being an SEC registered company and the affects of deregistering its shares of common stock, including among other things, the resulting decrease in the liquidity of its shares. 

TAXATION 

Federal Taxation 

General . The Company and the Bank report their income on a calendar year basis using the accrual method of accounting and are subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions, including particularly the Bank's reserve for bad debts discussed below. The following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Bank or the Company. 

Distributions . To the extent that the Bank makes "nondividend distributions" to the Company, these distributions will be considered to result in distributions from the balance of its bad debt reserve as of December 31, 1987 (or a lesser amount if the Bank's loan portfolio decreased since December 31, 1987) and then from the supplemental reserve for losses on loans ("Excess Distributions"), and an amount based on the Excess Distributions will be included in the Bank's taxable income. Nondividend distributions include distributions in excess of the Bank's current and accumulated earnings and profits, distributions in redemption of stock and distributions in partial or complete liquidation. However, dividends paid out of the Bank's current or accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes, will not be considered to result in a distribution from the Bank's bad debt reserve. The amount of additional taxable income created from an Excess Distribution is an amount that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount of the distribution. Thus, if, after the Conversion, the Bank makes a "nondividend distribution," then approximately one and one-half times the Excess Distribution would be includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes, assuming a 34% corporate income tax rate (exclusive of state and local taxes). See "Regulation - Regulation of the Bank - Dividends&#8221; for limits on the payment of dividends by the Bank. The Bank does not intend to pay dividends that would result in a recapture of any portion of its tax bad debt reserve. 

Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax . The Code imposes a tax on alternative minimum taxable income ("AMTI") at a rate of 20%. The excess of the tax bad debt reserve deduction using the percentage of taxable income method over the deduction that would have been allowable under the experience method is treated as a preference item for purposes of computing the AMTI. In addition, only 90% of AMTI can be offset by net operating loss carryovers. AMTI is increased by an amount equal to 75% of the amount by which the Bank's adjusted current earnings exceeds its AMTI (determined without regard to this preference and prior to reduction for net operating losses). For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, and before January 1, 1996, an environmental tax of 0.12% of the excess of AMTI (with certain modification) over $2.0 million is imposed on corporations, including the Bank, whether or not an Alternative Minimum Tax is paid. 

Dividends-Received Deduction . The Company may exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. The corporate dividends-received deduction is generally 70% in the case of dividends received from unaffiliated corporations with which the Company and the Bank will not file a consolidated tax return, except that if the Company or the Bank owns more than 20% of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend, then 80% of any dividends received may be deducted. 

Audits . The Company, the Bank and its consolidated subsidiaries have been audited or their books closed without audit by the IRS with respect to consolidated federal income tax returns through March 31, 2011. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Annual Report for additional information regarding income taxes. 

State Taxation 

South Carolina has adopted the Internal Revenue Code as it relates to commercial banks, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986. The Bank is subject to South Carolina income tax at the rate of 4.5%. The Bank has not been audited by the State of South Carolina during the past five years. 

The Company's income tax returns have not been audited by federal or state authorities within the last five years. For additional information regarding income taxes, see Note 13 &#32;of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Annual Report.
