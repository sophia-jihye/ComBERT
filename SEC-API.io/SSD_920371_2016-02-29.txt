The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Simpson Strong-Tie Company Inc., designs, engineers and is a leading manufacturer of wood construction products, including connectors, truss plates, fastening systems, fasteners and pre-fabricated lateral systems used in light-frame construction, and concrete construction products used for concrete, masonry, steel construction and for concrete repair, protection and strengthening, including adhesives, chemicals, mechanical anchors, carbide drill bits, powder actuated tools and fiber reinforced materials. The Company markets its products to the residential construction, light industrial and commercial construction, remodeling and do-it-yourself (&#8220;DIY&#8221;) markets. The Company also provides engineering services in support of some of its products and increasingly offers design and other software that facilitates the specification, selection and use of its products. The Company believes that the Simpson Strong-Tie brand benefits from strong brand name recognition among architects and engineers who frequently specify in building plans the use of the Company&#8217;s products. The Company has continuously manufactured structural connectors since 1956. 

Business Strategy 

The Company attracts and retains customers by designing, manufacturing and selling products that are of high quality and performance, easy to use and cost-effective for customers. The Company aims to manufacture and warehouse its products in geographic proximity to its markets to provide availability and rapid delivery of products to customers and prompt response to customer requests for specially designed products and services. The Company maintains high levels of inventory to operate with little backlog and fill most customer orders within a few days. High levels of manufacturing automation and flexibility allow the Company to maintain its quality standards while continuing to provide prompt delivery. 

The Company intends to continue efforts to increase market share in both the wood construction and concrete construction product groups by: 

&#8226; 

maintaining frequent contact with customers and private organizations that provide information to building code officials; 

&#8226; 

continuing to sponsor seminars to inform architects, engineers, contractors and building officials on appropriate use, proper installation and identification of the Company&#8217;s products; 

&#8226; 

continuing to invest in mobile and web applications for customers, utilizing social media, blog posts and videos to connect and engage with customers and to help them do their jobs more efficiently; and 

&#8226; 

continuing to diversify product offerings to be less dependent on residential housing. 

The Company&#8217;s long-term strategy is to develop, acquire or invest in product lines or businesses that have the potential to increase the Company&#8217;s earnings per share over time and that: 

&#8226; 

complement the Company&#8217;s existing product lines; 

&#8226; 

can be marketed through the Company&#8217;s existing distribution channels; 

&#8226; 

might benefit from use of the Company&#8217;s brand names and expertise; 

&#8226; 

are responsive to needs of the Company&#8217;s customers; 

&#8226; 

expand the Company&#8217;s markets geographically; and 

&#8226; 

reduce the Company&#8217;s dependence on the United States residential construction market. 

New Products. The Company commits substantial resources to new product development. The majority of SST&#8217;s products have been developed through its internal research and development program. SST&#8217;s research and development expense for the three years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , was $10.3 million , $11.2 million , and $10.7 million , respectively. The Company believes it is the only United States manufacturer with the capability to test multi-story wall systems, thus enabling full scale testing rather than analysis alone to prove system performance. The Company&#8217;s engineering, sales, product management, and marketing teams work together with architects, engineers, building inspectors, code officials and customers in the new product development process. 

The Company&#8217;s product research and development is based largely on products or solutions that are identified within the Company or as customers communicate to the Company as well as the Company&#8217;s strategic initiatives to develop new markets or product lines. The Company&#8217;s strategy is to develop new products on a proprietary basis, to seek patents when appropriate and to rely on trade secret protection for others. The Company typically develops 15 to 25 new products each year. 

The Company expanded its product offering for 2015 by adding: 

&#8226; 

new connectors for wood framing applications; 

&#8226; 

new wood shrinkage compensating devices; 

&#8226; 

new cold formed steel bridging and kneewall connections; 

&#8226; 

new structural screws for wood, metal and composite decking applications; 

&#8226; 

new mechanical anchors were introduced for use in hollow wall conditions and for overhead applications; and 

&#8226; 

the repair, protection and strengthening line of products received code approvals for their carbon fiber fabric and laminate systems. 

The Company intends to continue to expand its product offering in all its products. 

Distribution channels. &#32;&#32;The Company seeks to expand its product and distribution coverage through several channels: 

&#8226;

Engineering and Design Services. The Company&#8217;s engineers not only design and test products, but also provide engineering support for customers in connection with a number of products that the Company manufactures and sells. This support might range from the discussion of a load value in a catalog to testing the suitability of an existing product in a unique application. For certain product lines, industry norms require that the Company&#8217;s engineers are more involved in the sales process. For example, in connection with the sale of our truss plates, the Company&#8217;s engineers review the output of the Company&#8217;s software to assist customers in ensuring that trusses are properly designed and specified, and in some instances stamp design diagrams. Generally, in connection with any engineering services the Company provides, the Company&#8217;s engineers serve as a point of reference and support for the customer&#8217;s engineers and other service professionals, who ultimately determine and are responsible for the engineering approach to any project. 

Sales and Marketing 

The Company&#8217;s sales and marketing programs are implemented through its branch system. The Company currently maintains branches in California, Texas, Ohio, Canada, England, France, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, Poland, Czech Republic, Portugal, Austria, The Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Chile. Each branch is served by its own sales force, warehouse and office facilities, while some branches have their own manufacturing facilities. Each branch is responsible for setting and executing sales and marketing strategies that are consistent both with the markets in the geographic area that the branch serves and with the goals of the Company. Branch sales forces in North America are supported by marketing managers in the home office in Pleasanton, California. The home office also coordinates issues affecting customers that operate in multiple regions. The sales 

force maintains close working relationships with customers, develops new business, calls on architects, engineers and building officials and participates in a range of educational seminars. 

The Company dedicates substantial resources to customer service. The Company produces numerous publications and point-of-sale marketing aids to serve specifiers, distributors, retailers and users for the various markets that it serves.

The catalogs and publications describe the products and provide load and installation information. The Company also maintains several linked websites centered on www.strongtie.com, which include catalogs, product and technical information, code reports and other general information related to the Company, its product lines and promotional programs. The contents of these websites are not incorporated into this filing. Further, the Company&#8217;s references to the URLs for these websites is intended to be inactive textual references only. 

Manufacturing Process 

The Company designs and manufactures most of its products. The Company has developed and uses automated manufacturing processes for many of its products. The Company&#8217;s innovative manufacturing systems and techniques have allowed it to control manufacturing costs, even while developing both new products and products that meet customized requirements and specifications. The Company&#8217;s development of specialized manufacturing processes has also permitted increased operating flexibility and enhanced product design innovation. As part of ongoing continuous improvement processes in its factories, the Company&#8217;s major North American and European manufacturing facilities initiated lean manufacturing practices to improve efficiency and customer service. The Company sources some products from third-party vendors, both domestically and internationally. The Company has 22 manufacturing locations in the United States, Canada, France, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, Poland, Portugal, China and England. 

Quality Control. &#32;The Company has developed a quality system that manages defined procedures to ensure consistent product quality and also meets the requirements of product evaluation reports of the International Code Council (ICC) and the International Association of Plumbers and Mechanical Officials Uniform Evaluation Services (IAPMO-UES). Since 1996, the Company&#8217;s quality system has been registered under ISO 9001, an internationally recognized set of quality-assurance standards. The Company believes that ISO registration is a valuable tool for maintaining and promoting its high quality standards. As the Company establishes new business locations through expansion or acquisitions, projects are established to integrate the Company&#8217;s quality systems and achieve ISO 9001 registration. In addition, the Company has six testing laboratories accredited to ISO standard 17025, an internationally accepted standard that provides requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories. The Company implements testing requirements through systematic control of its processes, enhancing the Company&#8217;s standard for quality products, whether produced by the Company or purchased from others. 

Wood Construction Products Manufacturing. Most of the Company&#8217;s wood construction products are produced with a high level of automation. The Company has significant press capacity and has multiple dies for some of its high volume products to enable production of these products close to the customer and to provide back-up capacity. The balance of production is accomplished through a combination of manual, blanking and numerically controlled (NC) processes that include robotic welders, lasers and turret punches. This capability allows the Company to produce products with little redesign or set-up time, facilitating rapid turnaround for customers. The Company also has smaller specialty production facilities, which primarily use batch production with some automated lines. 

Concrete Construction Products Manufacturing. &#32;&#32;The Company manufactures its concrete construction products at its facilities in Zhangjiagang, China, Addison, Illinois, Baltimore, Maryland, Cardet, France, Seewen, Switzerland, Malbork, Poland, and Elvas, Portugal. The mechanical anchor products are produced with a high level of automation. Some products, such as epoxy and adhesive anchors, are mixed in batches and are then loaded into one-part or two-part dispensers, which mix the product on the job site because set-up times are usually very short. In addition, the Company purchases a number of products, powder actuated pins, tools and accessories and certain of its mechanical anchoring products, from various sources around the world. These purchased products undergo inspections on a sample basis for conformance with ordered specifications and tolerances before being distributed. 

Regulation 

Environmental Regulation. The Company itself is subject to environmental laws and regulations governing emissions into the air, discharges into water, and generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. The Company is also subject to other federal and state laws and regulations regarding health and safety matters. The Company believes that it has obtained all material licenses and permits required by environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in connection with the Company&#8217;s operations and that its policies and procedures comply in all material respects with existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. See &#8220;Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Other. The Company&#8217;s product lines are subject to federal, state, county, municipal and other governmental and quasi-governmental regulations that affect product development, design, testing, analysis, load rating, application, marketing, sales, exportation, installation and use. 

The Company considers product evaluation, recognition and listing to the building code as a significant tool that facilitates and expedites the use of the Company&#8217;s products by design professionals, building officials, inspectors, builders, home centers and contractors. Industry members are more likely to use building products that have the appropriate recognition and listing than products that lack this acceptance. The Company devotes considerable time and testing resources to obtaining and maintaining appropriate listings for its products. The Company actively participates in industry related professional associations and building code committees both to keep abreast of regulatory changes and to provide comments and expertise to these regulatory agencies. 

A substantial portion of the Company&#8217;s products have been evaluated and are recognized by governmental and product evaluation agencies. Some of the entities that recognize the Company&#8217;s products include the International Code Council Uniform Evaluation Service (ICC-ES), IAPMO-UES, the City of Los Angeles (LARR&#8217;s), California Division of the State Architect, the State of Florida, Underwriters Laboratory (UL), Factory Mutual (FM) and state departments of transportation. In Europe, the Company&#8217;s structural products meet European Technical Agreement (ETA) regulations. 

Competition 

The Company faces a variety of competition in all of the markets in which it participates. This competition ranges from subsidiaries of large national or international corporations to small regional manufacturers. While price is an important factor, the Company also competes on the basis of quality, breadth of product line, proprietary technology, technical support, availability of inventory, service (including custom design and manufacturing), field support and product innovation. As a result of differences in structural design and building practices and codes, the Company&#8217;s markets tend to differ by region. Within these regions, the Company competes with companies of varying size, several of which also distribute their products nationally or internationally. See &#8220;Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Raw Materials 

The principal raw material used by the Company is steel, including stainless steel. The Company also uses materials such as carbon fiber, epoxies and acrylics in the manufacture of its chemical anchoring and reinforcing products. The Company purchases raw materials from a variety of commercial sources. The Company&#8217;s practice is to seek cost savings and enhanced quality by purchasing from a limited number of suppliers. 

The steel industry is highly cyclical and prices for the Company&#8217;s raw materials are influenced by numerous factors beyond the Company&#8217;s control. The steel market continues to be dynamic, with a high degree of uncertainty about future pricing trends. Given current conditions, including low demand, labor union contract negotiations, anti-dumping and countervailing duty trade cases filed by United States steel producers in 2015, the Company currently expect that the high degree of uncertainty regarding steel prices will continue. Numerous factors may cause steel prices to increase in the future. In addition to increases in steel prices, mills may add surcharges for zinc, energy and freight in response to increases in their costs. See &#8220;Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Item 7 &#8212; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; The Company historically has not attempted to hedge against changes in prices of steel or other raw materials. 

Patents and Proprietary Rights 

The Company has United States and foreign patents, the majority of which cover products that the Company currently manufactures and markets. These patents, and applications for new patents, cover various design aspects of the Company&#8217;s products, as well as processes used in their manufacture. The Company continues to develop new potentially patentable products, product enhancements and product designs. Although the Company does not intend to apply for additional foreign patents covering existing products, the Company has developed an international patent program to protect new products that it may develop. In addition to seeking patent protection, the Company relies on unpatented proprietary technology to maintain its competitive position. See &#8220;Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Acquisitions and Expansion into New Markets 

The Company&#8217;s growth potential depends, to some extent, on its ability to penetrate new markets, both domestically and internationally. See &#8220;Industry and Market Trends&#8221; and &#8220;Business Strategy.&#8221; 

In December 2015, the Company purchased all of the business assets, including intellectual property, from Blue Heron Enterprises, and Fox Chase Enterprises, LLC (collectively, "EBTY"), both New Jersey limited liability companies, for $3.4 million in cash. EBTY manufactured and sold hidden deck clips and associated products and systems. The Company's provisional measurement of assets acquired included goodwill of $2.0 million, which was assigned to the North American segment, and intangible assets of $1.1 million, both of which are subject to tax-deductible amortization. Net assets consisting of inventory and equipment accounted for the balance of the purchase price. 

The Company currently intends as part of its expansion strategy to continue to pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses. See &#8220;Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Item 7 &#8212; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; 

Seasonality and Cyclicality 

The Company&#8217;s sales are seasonal and cyclical. Operating results vary from quarter to quarter and with economic cycles. The Company&#8217;s sales are also dependent, to a large degree, on the North American residential home construction industry. See &#8220;Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Item 7 &#8212; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; 

Employees and Labor Relations 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had 2,498 full-time employees, of whom 1,029 were hourly employees and 1,469 were salaried employees. The Company believes that its overall compensation and benefits for the most part meet industry averages and that its relations with its employees are good. 

A significant number of the employees at two of the Company&#8217;s facilities are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Company&#8217;s facility in San Bernardino County, California, has two of the Company&#8217;s collective bargaining agreements, one with tool and die craftsmen and maintenance workers, and the other with sheetmetal workers. These two contracts expire February 2017 and June 2018, respectively. The Company&#8217;s facility in Stockton, California, is also a union facility with two collective bargaining agreements, which also cover tool and die craftsmen and maintenance workers and sheetmetal workers. These two contracts will expire July and September 2019, respectively. See &#8220;Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors.&#8221;
