 Item 1. Business 

General 

Owens &#38; Minor, Inc. and subsidiaries (we, us or our), a Fortune 500 company headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, is a leading global healthcare services company that connects the world of medical products to the point of care. We provide vital supply chain assistance to the providers of healthcare services and the manufacturers of healthcare products, supplies and devices. With fully developed networks in the United States and Europe, we are equipped to serve a customer base ranging from hospitals, integrated healthcare systems, group purchasing organizations, and the U.S. federal government, to manufacturers of life-science and medical devices and supplies, including pharmaceuticals in Europe. The description of our business should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and supplementary data included in this Form 10-K. 

&#32;Founded in 1882, Owens &#38; Minor was incorporated in 1926 in Richmond, Virginia. We focus our operations on healthcare logistics services and provide our customers with a service portfolio that covers procurement, inventory management, delivery and sourcing of products for the healthcare market. Through organic growth and acquisitions over many years, we significantly expanded and strengthened our company, achieving national scale in the United States healthcare market. In 2012, through the acquisition of the Movianto Group (Movianto), we entered into third-party logistics services for the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries in the European market, leveraging an existing platform that also expands our ability to serve our United States-based manufacturer customers on an international level. 

On October 1, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Medical Action Industries Inc. (Medical Action), a leading producer of surgical kits and procedure trays for the healthcare market. On November 1, 2014, we acquired ArcRoyal, a privately held surgical kitting company based in Ireland (ArcRoyal). These acquisitions further expanded our capabilities to provide our provider and manufacturer customers a range of kitting services, including the ability to combine instruments and supplies into sterilized custom procedure trays used in a variety of clinical procedures, such as cardiac and orthopedic procedures, and sterilized minor procedure kits and trays which are used in a wide variety of minor surgical and medical procedures, such as I.V. start kits and suture removal. This approach enables healthcare providers to track and manage the supply chain for products, supplies and instruments used in clinical settings. The combined consideration for these two acquisitions was $261.6 million, net of cash acquired, and including debt assumed of $13.4 million (capitalized lease obligations). 

We report our business under two segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment includes all functions relating to our role as a medical supply logistics company providing distribution, kitting (including Medical Action) and logistics services to healthcare providers and manufacturers in the United States. The International segment consists of Movianto and ArcRoyal. Financial information by segment and geographic area appears in Note 20, &#8220;Segment Information,&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report. 

The Domestic Segment 

Healthcare product volumes in the United States are dependent on the rates of utilization of medical/surgical procedures by consumers, which are subject to fluctuation according to the condition of the domestic economy and other factors, such as changes in regulation affecting reimbursement. Aside from consumer-driven activity, the healthcare industry is also experiencing growing demand for advanced logistics and inventory management services from healthcare providers and manufacturers that are focused on achieving more efficient and cost-effective supply-chain operations. 

In the United States, healthcare supply distributors contract with group purchasing organizations (GPOs) that negotiate distribution contracts on behalf of their healthcare provider members and also contract directly with healthcare providers and manufacturers for their services. Healthcare providers are increasingly consolidating into larger, more sophisticated networks that are actively seeking reductions in the total cost of delivering healthcare products. These healthcare providers face complex financial challenges, including managing the cost of purchasing, receiving, storing and tracking supplies. 

Economic trends have also driven significant consolidation within the healthcare products distribution and logistics industry due to the competitive advantages enjoyed by larger organizations. Among these advantages are the ability to serve customers in widespread geographic locations, purchase inventory in large volume, develop more sophisticated technology platforms and decision-support systems and provide expertise to healthcare providers and manufacturers to help reduce supply chain costs. 

We offer a comprehensive portfolio of products and services to healthcare providers and manufacturers in the United States. Our portfolio of medical and surgical supplies includes branded products purchased in large volume from manufacturers and our own proprietary private-label products, which are internally sourced through our sourcing capabilities abroad or through a select group of manufacturers. We store our products at our distribution centers and provide delivery of these products, along with related services, to healthcare providers around the nation. Our kitting capabilities offer the combining of instruments and supplies into custom and minor procedure kits and trays which are assembled and delivered based on the specifications provided by the healthcare provider customer. For sterilized kits and trays, we utilize one or more third-party sterilization contractors. 

Most supplies are delivered using a leased fleet and almost all of our delivery personnel are our teammates, ensuring a consistent level of performance and customer service. In situations where they are more cost-effective and timely, we use contract carriers and parcel delivery services. We customize product deliveries, whether the orders are &#8220;just-in-time,&#8221; &#8220;low-unit-of-measure,&#8221; pallets, or truckloads. We also customize delivery schedules according to customers&#8217; needs to increase their efficiency in receiving and storing products. &#32; We have deployed low-unit-of-measure automated picking modules in our larger distribution centers to maximize efficiency, and our distribution center teammates use voice-pick technology to enhance speed and accuracy in performing certain warehousing processes. 

We also offer additional services to healthcare providers including supplier management, analytics, inventory management, outsourced resource management, clinical supply management and business process consulting. These value-add services help providers improve their process for contracting with vendors, purchasing supplies and streamlining inventory. These services include our operating room-focused inventory management program that helps healthcare providers manage suture and endo-mechanical inventory, as well as our customizable surgical supply service that includes the kitting and delivery of surgical supplies in procedure-based totes to coincide with the healthcare providers' surgical schedule. 

&#32;The majority of our distribution arrangements compensate us on a cost-plus percentage basis, under which a negotiated percentage mark-up is added to the contract cost of the product agreed to by the customer and the supplier. We price our services for certain other arrangements under activity-based pricing models. In these cases, pricing depends upon the type, level and/or complexity of services that we provide to customers, and in some cases we do not take title to the product (although we maintain certain custodial risks). As a result, this fee-for-service pricing model aligns the fees we charge with the cost of the services provided, which is a component of selling, general and administrative expenses, rather than with the cost of the product, which is a component of cost of goods sold. 

We offer a variety of programs and services dedicated to providing logistics and marketing solutions to our manufacturer customers as well. These programs and services are designed to help manufacturers increase market share, drive sales growth, and achieve operational efficiencies. Manufacturer programs are generally negotiated on an annual basis and provide for enhanced levels of support that are aligned with the manufacturer&#8217;s annual objectives and growth goals. We have contractual arrangements with manufacturers participating in these programs that provide performance-based incentives to us, as well as cash discounts for prompt payment. Program incentives can be earned on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. 

All of our distribution and logistics services utilize a common infrastructure of distribution centers, equipment, technology, and delivery methods (internal fleet, common carrier or parcel services). We operate a network of 42 distribution centers located throughout the continental United States, which are strategically located to efficiently serve our provider and manufacturer customers, and two kitting facilities for the production of custom and minor procedure kits and trays. A significant investment in information technology supports our business including warehouse management systems, customer service and ordering functions, demand forecasting programs, electronic commerce, data warehousing, decision support and supply-chain management. During 2014, we completed a three-year, $54 million investment in our information technology infrastructure in the United States designed to achieve operational and data-management efficiencies and improve customer service. 

The International Segment 

Our International segment includes Movianto and ArcRoyal. Through Movianto, we provide contract logistics services to the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries, offering a broad range of supply chain logistics services to manufacturers. Our warehousing and transportation offerings include storage, controlled-substance handling, cold-chain, emergency and export delivery, inventory management and pick &#38; pack services. Our other services include order-to-cash, re-labeling, customer service and returns management. Through our kitting operations in ArcRoyal, we offer custom procedure trays to manufacturers and healthcare provider customers throughout Europe. 

Our International segment has a network of 22 logistics centers and one kitting facility in 11 European countries, including Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. To serve our clients, we use a fleet of leased and owned trucks, including cold-chain delivery trucks. The majority of our drivers are our International teammates, although contract carriers and parcel services are used in situations where they are more cost-effective and timely. 

Client logistics contracts in our International segment are generally for three-year terms with rolling automatic one- year extension periods. The tendering or competitive bidding process typically takes 12 to 18 months from the initial client request for proposal until becoming operational. We offer significant flexibility to tailor contracts to specific client requirements, and benefit from the expansion of clients into additional European countries. Pricing may be activity-based, with fees determined by clients&#8217; particular requirements for warehousing, handling and delivery services, or it may be based on buy-sell wholesaler arrangements for product distribution. 

Our Customers 

We currently provide distribution, kitting, outsourced resource management and/or consulting services to thousands of healthcare provider customers. These customers include multi-facility networks of healthcare providers offering a broad spectrum of healthcare services to a particular market or markets (IHNs) as well as smaller, independent hospitals in the United States. In addition to contracting with healthcare providers at the IHN level and through Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs), we also contract with other types of healthcare providers including surgery centers, physicians&#8217; practices and smaller networks of hospitals that have joined together to negotiate terms. We have contracts to provide distribution services to the members of a number of national GPOs, including Novation, LLC (Novation), MedAssets Inc. (MedAssets), Premier, Inc. (Premier) and HealthTrust Purchasing Group (HPG). In 2012 and 2013, we renewed the distribution agreements with all four GPOs to continue our status as an authorized distributor for their member healthcare providers and allow us to compete with other authorized distributors for the business of individual members. Below is a summary of these agreements:

&#160; 

We have our own independent relationships with most of our hospital customers through separate contractual commitments that may or may not be based upon the terms of our agreement with the GPO. As a result, the termination or expiration of an agreement with a particular GPO would not necessarily mean that we would lose the members of such GPO as our customers. In 2015, Novation became part of Vizient which is expected to acquire MedAssets in early 2016. We do not expect this transaction to have a significant impact on our operations in 2016. 

Our supplier and manufacturer customers represent the largest and most influential healthcare manufacturers in the industry. We have long-term relationships with these important companies in the healthcare supply chain and have long provided traditional distribution services to them. We currently have relationships with approximately 1,300 supplier and manufacturer customers. In the Domestic segment, sales of products supplied by subsidiaries of Covidien Ltd. accounted for approximately 14% of our consolidated net revenue for 2015. Sales of products supplied by Johnson &#38; Johnson Health Care Systems, Inc. were approximately 10% of our consolidated net revenue for 2015. 

In Europe, we serve a diverse customer base of approximately 600 manufacturer clients, including pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device manufacturers. 

&#32;&#32; Asset Management &#32; &#32; 

In the healthcare supply distribution industry, a significant investment in inventory and accounts receivable is required to meet the rapid delivery requirements of customers and provide high-quality service. As a result, efficient asset management is essential to our profitability. We continually work to refine our processes to optimize inventory and collect accounts receivable. 

Inventory 

We are focused in our efforts to optimize inventory and continually consolidate products and collaborate with supply-chain partners on inventory productivity initiatives. When we convert large-scale, multi-state IHN customers to our distribution network, an additional investment in inventory in advance of expected sales is generally required. We actively monitor inventory for obsolescence and use inventory turnover and other operational metrics to measure our performance in managing inventory. 

Accounts Receivable 

In the normal course of business, we provide credit to our domestic and European customers and use credit management techniques to evaluate customers&#8217; creditworthiness and facilitate collection. These techniques may include performing initial and ongoing credit evaluations of customers based primarily on financial information provided by them and from sources available to the general public. We also use third-party information from sources such as credit reporting agencies, banks and other credit references. We actively manage our accounts receivable to minimize credit risk, days sales outstanding (DSO) and accounts receivable carrying costs. Our ability to accurately invoice and ship product to customers enhances our collection results and drives our positive DSO performance. We also have arrangements with certain customers under which they make deposits on account, either because they do not meet our standards for creditworthiness or in order to obtain more favorable pricing. 

Competition &#32;&#32; 

The medical/surgical supply distribution and healthcare logistics industries are highly competitive in the United States and Europe. The U.S. sector includes Owens &#38; Minor, Inc., as well as two major nationwide manufacturers who also provide distribution services, Cardinal Health, Inc. and privately-held Medline, Inc. In addition, we compete with a number of regional and local distributors and customer self-distribution models. Major logistics competitors serving healthcare manufacturers in the United States and in Europe include United Parcel Service, FedEx Corporation, Deutsche Post DHL and Alloga, as well as local competitors in specific countries. 

Regulation &#32; 

The medical/surgical supply distribution and healthcare logistics industries in the United States are subject to regulation by federal, state and local government agencies. Each of our distribution centers is licensed to distribute medical and surgical supplies, as well as certain pharmaceutical and related products, and each of our kitting facilities is licensed to perform kit assembly operations. We must comply with laws and regulations, including those governing operations, storage, transportation, safety and security standards for each of our distribution centers and kitting facilities, of the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Department of Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Homeland Security, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and state boards of pharmacy, or similar state licensing boards and regulatory agencies. We are also subject to various federal and state laws intended to protect the privacy of health or other personal information and to prevent healthcare fraud and abuse. We believe we are in material compliance with all statutes and regulations applicable to our operations, including the Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), Medicare and Medicaid, as well as applicable general employment and employee health and safety laws and regulations. 

Our International business is subject to local, country and European-wide regulations, including those promulgated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Medical Devices Directive. In addition, quality requirements are imposed by healthcare industry manufacturers which audit our operations on a regular basis. Each of our logistics centers in Europe is licensed to distribute medicinal, medical and surgical supplies, as well as certain pharmaceutical and related products, according to the country-specific requirements. Our logistics centers in Europe are able to store ambient, cold-chain or deep frozen products, are licensed to distribute narcotic products and pharmaceutical products included in clinical trials and are licensed for secondary packaging activities for medicinal products. Movianto is also ISO 9001:2008 certified across the entire enterprise. Our Ireland-based kitting facility is licensed to assemble kits and sell them in the markets we serve and operates in compliance with the requirements of ISO 9001:2008 and ISO/EU 13485:2012 standards. We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable statutes and regulations, as well as prevailing industry best practices, in the conduct of our European business operations. 

&#32; Employees &#32; 

At the end of 2015, we employed approximately 5,800 full- and part-time teammates in the Domestic segment and 2,300 in the International segment. Most of our International teammates are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Ongoing teammate training is critical to performance and we use Owens &#38; Minor University &#174; , an in-house training facility, to offer classes in leadership, management development, finance, operations, safety and sales. We continue to have positive relationships with teammates and European works councils.
