We undertake no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by law. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Unless the context suggests otherwise, references in this report to &#8220;Carlyle,&#8221; the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to The Carlyle Group L.P. and its consolidated subsidiaries. When we refer to the &#8220;partners of The Carlyle Group L.P.,&#8221; we are referring specifically to the common unitholders and our general partner and any others who may from time to time be partners of that specific Delaware limited partnership. When we refer to our &#8220;senior Carlyle professionals,&#8221; we are referring to the partner-level personnel of our firm. References in this report to the ownership of the senior Carlyle professionals and other employees include the ownership of personal planning vehicles of these individuals. 

&#8220;Carlyle funds,&#8221; &#8220;our funds&#8221; and &#8220;our investment funds&#8221; refer to the investment funds and vehicles advised by Carlyle. Our &#8220;carry funds&#8221; refer to (i) those investment funds that we advise, including the buyout funds, growth capital funds, real estate funds, infrastructure funds, certain energy funds and opportunistic credit, distressed debt and mezzanine funds (but excluding our structured credit funds, hedge funds, business development companies, mutual fund, and fund of funds vehicles), where we receive a special residual allocation of income, which we refer to as a carried interest, in the event that specified investment returns are achieved by the fund and (ii) those investment funds advised by NGP Energy Capital Management (together with its affiliates and subsidiaries, &#8220;NGP&#8221;) from which we are entitled to receive a carried interest. The &#8220;NGP management fee funds&#8221; refer to those funds advised by NGP from which we only receive an allocation of income based on the funds' management fees. Our &#8220;fund of funds vehicles&#8221; refers to those funds, accounts and vehicles advised by AlpInvest Partners B.V. (&#8220;AlpInvest&#8221;), Metropolitan Real Estate Equity Management, LLC (&#8220;Metropolitan&#8221;), and Diversified Global Asset Management (&#8220;DGAM&#8221;). For an explanation of the fund acronyms used throughout this Annual Report, refer to &#8220;Business&#8212;Our Family of Funds.&#8221; 

&#8220;Fee-earning assets under management&#8221; or &#8220;Fee-earning AUM&#8221; refer to the assets we manage or advise from which we derive recurring fund management fees. Our Fee-earning AUM generally equals the sum of: 

&#160; 

(a) 

for substantially all carry funds and certain co-investment vehicles where the original investment period has not expired, and for Metropolitan fund of funds vehicles during the weighted-average investment period of the underlying funds, the amount of limited partner capital commitments, and for AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles, the amount of external investor capital commitments during the commitment fee period, and for the NGP management fee funds and certain carry funds advised by NGP, the amount of investor capital commitments before the first investment realization; 

(b) 

for substantially all carry funds and certain co-investment vehicles where the original investment period has expired and for Metropolitan fund of funds vehicles after the expiration of the weighted-average investment period of the underlying funds, the remaining amount of limited partner invested capital at cost, and for the NGP management fee funds and certain carry funds advised by NGP where the first investment has been realized, the amount of partner commitments less realized and written-off investments; 

(c) 

the amount of aggregate fee-earning collateral balance at par of our collateralized loan obligations (&#8220;CLOs&#8221;), as defined in the fund indentures (typically exclusive of equities and defaulted positions) as of the quarterly cut-off date for each CLO, and the aggregate principal amount of the notes of our other structured products; 

(d) 

the net asset value of our mutual fund and the external investor portion of the net asset value (pre-redemptions and subscriptions) of our long/short credit funds, emerging markets, multi-product macroeconomic, fund of hedge funds vehicles and other hedge funds; 

(e) 

the gross assets (including assets acquired with leverage), excluding cash and cash equivalents of our business development companies and certain carry funds; and 

(f) 

for AlpInvest fund of funds vehicles where the commitment fee period has expired, and certain carry funds where the investment period has expired, the lower of cost or fair value of invested capital. 

&#8220;Assets under management&#8221; or &#8220;AUM&#8221; refers to the assets we manage or advise. Our AUM equals the sum of the following: 

(a) the fair value of the capital invested in Carlyle carry funds, co-investment vehicles, NGP management fee funds and fund of funds vehicles plus the capital that Carlyle is entitled to call from investors in those funds and vehicles (including Carlyle commitments to those funds and vehicles and those of senior Carlyle professionals and employees) pursuant to the terms of their capital commitments to those funds and vehicles; 

(b) 

the amount of aggregate collateral balance and principal cash at par or aggregate principal amount of the notes of our CLOs and other structured products (inclusive of all positions); 

(c) 

the net asset value (pre-redemptions and subscriptions) of our long/short credit, emerging markets, multi-product macroeconomic, fund of hedge funds vehicles, mutual fund and other hedge funds; and 

(d) 

the gross assets (including assets acquired with leverage) of our business development companies. 

We include in our calculation of AUM and Fee-earning AUM certain energy and renewable resources funds that we jointly advise with Riverstone Holdings L.L.C. (&#8220;Riverstone&#8221;) and certain NGP management fee funds and carry funds that are advised by NGP. 

For our carry funds, co-investment vehicles, fund of funds vehicles, and NGP management fee funds, total AUM includes the fair value of the capital invested, whereas Fee-earning AUM includes the amount of capital commitments or the remaining amount of invested capital, depending on whether the original investment period for the fund has expired. As such, Fee-earning AUM may be greater than total AUM when the aggregate fair value of the remaining investments is less than the cost of those investments. 

Our calculations of AUM and Fee-earning AUM may differ from the calculations of other alternative asset managers. As a result, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other alternative asset managers. In addition, our calculation of AUM (but not Fee-earning AUM) includes uncalled commitments to, and the fair value of invested capital in, our investment funds from Carlyle and our personnel, regardless of whether such commitments or invested capital are subject to management or performance fees. Our calculations of AUM or Fee-earning AUM are not based on any definition of AUM or Fee-earning AUM that is set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds that we manage or advise. 

With respect to certain of the hedge funds and vehicles that we advise, we are entitled to incentive fees that are paid annually, semi-annually or quarterly, as the case may be, if the net asset value of an investor&#8217;s account has increased above the high-water mark. A hedge fund's or vehicle's &#8220;high-water mark&#8221; refers to the highest period end net asset value of an investor&#8217;s account on which incentive fees were previously paid. 

PART I. 

&#160; 

&#32;ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

We are one of the world&#8217;s largest and most diversified multi-product global alternative asset management firms. We advise an array of specialized investment funds and other investment vehicles that invest across a range of industries, geographies, asset classes and investment strategies and seek to deliver attractive returns for our fund investors. Since our firm was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1987, we have grown to become a leading global alternative asset manager with more than $183 billion &#32;in AUM across 126 &#32;funds and 160 &#32;fund of funds vehicles as of December 31, 2015 . We have more than 1,700 &#32;employees, including more than 700 &#32;investment professionals in 36 &#32;offices across six continents, and we serve more than 1,700 &#32;active carry fund investors from 78 &#32;countries. Across our Corporate Private Equity (&#8220;CPE&#8221;) and Real Assets segments, we have investments in more than 250 active portfolio companies that employ more than 675,000 people. In general, we have more investment professionals, offices, investment funds, and investments across our platform than many of our peers. We have structured our firm in this manner to provide our fund investors with a more diverse product set tailored to individual investing decisions, and a broader global reach, but such structure increases our costs of doing business. 

The growth and development of our firm has been guided by several fundamental tenets: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Excellence in Investing. &#32;Our primary goal is to invest wisely and create value for our fund investors. We strive to generate superior investment returns by combining deep industry expertise, a global network of local investment teams who can leverage extensive firm-wide resources and a consistent and disciplined investment process. 

&#8226; 

Commitment to our Fund Investors. &#32;Our fund investors come first. This commitment is a core component of our firm culture and informs every aspect of our business. We believe this philosophy is in the long-term best interests of Carlyle and its owners, including our common unitholders. 

&#8226; 

Investment in the Firm. &#32;We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in hiring and retaining a deep talent pool of investment professionals and in building the infrastructure of the firm, including our expansive local office network and our comprehensive investor services team, which provides finance, legal and compliance and tax services in addition to other services. 

&#8226; 

Expansion of our Platform. &#32;We innovate continuously to expand our investment capabilities through the creation or acquisition of new asset-, sector- and regional-focused strategies in order to provide our fund investors a variety of investment options. 

&#8226; 

Unified Culture. &#32;We seek to leverage the local market insights and operational capabilities that we have developed across our global platform through a unified culture we call &#8220;One Carlyle.&#8221; Our culture emphasizes collaboration and sharing of knowledge and expertise across the firm to create value. We believe our collaborative approach enhances our ability to analyze investments, deploy capital and improve the performance of our portfolio companies. 

There are four primary drivers of our business &#8212; fundraising or attracting new capital commitments to our funds; investing; working to create value for our investors or to achieve appreciation of our various investments; and harvesting, selling or otherwise disposing of our carry fund investments. Operational and strategic highlights for 2015 include the following: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

During 2015, we raised approximately $23 billion in gross new commitments, or $16 billion &#32;net of redemptions, across our platform; made equity investments through our carry funds of approximately $9 billion &#32;in 279 &#32;new and follow-on investments; realized proceeds of more than $18 billion &#32;through 51 &#32;funds; and increased the value of our carry fund portfolio by approximately 7% . 

&#8226; 

We continued to bolster our senior management team by hiring a new Chief Information Officer and promoting the co-head of our U.S. buyout group to Co-Deputy Chief Investment Officer of CPE. 

&#8226; 

We further aligned our interests with those of our fund investors with Carlyle, our senior Carlyle professionals, advisors, other professionals and advisors increasing their commitments to our investment funds by over $0.7 billion to a total cumulative commitment of $8.9 billion. 

&#8226; 

Each of our segments continued to leverage the One Carlyle platform to take advantage of economies of scale and offer our fund investors differentiated products. Specifically: 

&#9702; 

In our CPE segment: 

&#9642; 

We closed our fourth Europe buyout fund, our third Japan buyout fund and our third European technology fund. We launched fundraising for our fifth Asia growth fund and continued to see investor demand for our second U.S. mid-market fund and our first longer duration global buyout fund. In total, we closed on $8.0 billion &#32;in commitments in our CPE segment. 

&#8226; 

We invested in, among others, Asia Satellite Telecom Holdings (through CAP IV), The Innovation Group (through CEP IV), JIC Leasing Co., Ltd. (through CAGP IV), Novetta Solutions, LLC (through CP VI), PA Consulting (through CEP IV), PNB Housing Finance Limited (through CAP IV), PrimeSport (through CEOF I), Rede D&#8217;or S&#227;o Luiz S.A. (through CSABF and related coinvestments, and CP VI) and SEACOR Marine Holdings Inc. (through CEOF II). 

&#8226; 

We sold our stake in, among others, Altice S.A., a CEP II and CEP III portfolio company, kbro Limited, a CAP II portfolio company, Metrologic Group SA, a CETP II portfolio company, The Nielsen Company, a CP IV and CEP II portfolio company, Veyance Technologies, Inc., a CP IV portfolio company, Telecable de Asturias, S.A., a CEP III portfolio company, and a portion of our stake in both Axalta Coating Systems and CommScope, Inc., both CP V and CEP III portfolio companies. We also undertook several successful initial public offerings including Tsubaki Nakashima Co., Ltd., a CJP II portfolio company, Guangxi Nanning Waterworks Co., Ltd., a CAGP IV portfolio company and Focus Media, a CAP III portfolio company. In total, we realized proceeds of $12.8 billion &#32;for our CPE carry fund investors. 

&#9702; 

In our Global Market Strategies (&#8220;GMS&#8221;) segment: 

&#9642; 

We raised $2.4 billion for our second generation energy mezzanine fund, continued fundraising for our first Asian structured credit fund and launched fundraising for our fourth generation distressed fund. We closed five new collateralized loan obligations (&#8220;CLOs&#8221;) in the U.S. and closed three new CLOs in Europe in 2015 with $4.3 billion of AUM at December 31, 2015 . In total, we raised more than $2.9 billion &#32;for our GMS funds. 

&#9642; 

CSP III and CEMOF I were particularly active this year, investing in Nationwide Accident Repair Services (CSP III), Trey Resources (CEMOF I), and Clearly Petroleum Holdings (CEMOF I), among others. 

&#9642; 

We established a partnership with Hilcorp Energy Company that will seek to acquire, operate, and develop onshore oil and natural gas properties and related assets in North America. CEMOF I and CEMOF II have entered into an agreement to invest more than $1 billion in the newly formed partnership. 

&#9702; 

In our Real Assets segment: 

&#9642; 

We closed our seventh U.S. real estate fund and our first international energy fund, both reaching their caps; NGP XI also had a final close at its cap. Demand for our second power fund remained strong, and we launched fundraising for a new core-plus real estate fund. Building on our existing expertise in real estate and infrastructure, we intend to launch a global infrastructure fund later this year. In total, we closed on approximately $3.9 billion &#32;in commitments to our Real Assets segment. 

&#8226; 

We invested nearly $1.4 billion to acquire or develop real estate properties, primarily in the U.S. across multiple sectors including multi-family and for-sale residential properties in the U.S. We invested in power generating facilities in the United States, an office property in China and a Romanian oil and gas development platform. 

&#8226; 

We exited a number of investments, including a student housing portfolio in the United Kingdom, a Florida based 250 MW coal-fired power facility, a southern California apartment complex and a Northern Virginia mid-rise apartment complex. In total, we realized proceeds of approximately $4.8 billion &#32;for our Real Assets carry fund investors. 

&#9702; 

In our Investment Solutions segment: 

&#9642; 

We launched fundraising for our sixth AlpInvest secondaries fund and closed on more than $400 million for funds that are focused on a real estate secondaries and coinvestments for Metropolitan real Estate, our real estate fund of funds business. In total, we closed on approximately $1.6 billion &#32;in commitments to our Investment Solutions segment. 

&#9642; 

We named a new Head of Investment Solutions, promoting the segment's Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer to the position. 

Business Segments 

We operate our business across four segments: (1) Corporate Private Equity, (2) Global Market Strategies, (3) Real Assets and (4) Investment Solutions. Information about our segments should be read together with &#8220;Part II. Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; 

Although we primarily transact business in the United States and a significant amount of our revenues are generated domestically, we have established investment vehicles whose primary focus is making investments in specified geographical locations. Refer to &#8220;Information by Geographic Location&#8221; in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on consolidated revenues and assets based on the geographical focus of the associated investment vehicle. 

Corporate Private Equity 

Our Corporate Private Equity segment, established in 1990 with our first U.S. buyout fund, advises our buyout and growth capital funds, which pursue a wide variety of corporate investments of different sizes and growth potentials. Our 32 &#32;active CPE funds are each carry funds. They are organized and operated by geography or industry and are advised by separate teams of local professionals who live and work in the markets where they invest. In our CPE segment we also have 56 active external co-investment entities. We believe this diversity of funds and entities allows us to deploy more targeted and specialized investment expertise and strategies and offers our fund investors the ability to tailor their investment choices. 

Our CPE teams have two primary areas of focus: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Buyout Funds. &#32;Our buyout teams advise a diverse group of 22 &#32;active funds that invest in transactions that focus either on a particular geography (e.g., United States, Europe, Asia, Japan, MENA, Sub-Saharan Africa or South America) or a particular industry. We continually seek to expand and diversify our buyout portfolio into new areas where we see opportunity for future growth. In 2015, we had final closings on our fourth European buyout fund and third Japan buyout fund and continued fundraising for our first longer duration global buyout fund. We invested $4.1 billion in new and follow-on investments through our buyout funds. As of December 31, 2015 , our buyout funds had, in the aggregate, approximately $56.2 billion &#32;in AUM. 

&#8226; 

Growth Capital Funds. &#32;Our 10 &#32;active growth capital funds are advised by four regionally focused teams in the United States, Europe and Asia, with each team generally focused on middle-market and growth companies consistent with specific regional investment considerations. The investment mandate for our growth capital funds is to seek out companies with the potential for growth, strategic redirection and operational improvements. These funds typically do not invest in early stage or venture-type investments. In 2015, launched our fifth Asia growth fund, held a final closing for our third Europe technology fund at its cap and continued fundraising for our second U.S. equity opportunities fund. As of December 31, 2015 , our growth capital funds had, in the aggregate, approximately $7.0 billion &#32;in AUM. 

From inception through December 31, 2015 , our CPE segment has invested approximately $67 billion &#32;in 535 &#32;investments. Of that total, we have invested 60% &#32;in 262 &#32;investments in North and South America, 20% &#32;in 121 &#32;investments in 

Europe, the Middle East and Africa and 20% &#32;in 152 &#32;investments in the Asia-Pacific region. We have fully realized 353 &#32;of these investments, meaning that our funds have completely exited, and no longer own an interest in, those investments. 

The following table presents certain data about our CPE segment as of December 31, 2015 &#32;(dollar amounts in billions; amounts invested include co-investments).

Global Market Strategies 

Our Global Market Strategies segment, established in 1999 with our first high yield fund, advises a group of 68 &#32;active funds that pursue investment strategies including leveraged loans and structured credit, energy mezzanine opportunities, middle market lending, distressed debt, long/short credit, long/short emerging markets equities, macroeconomic strategies, commodities trading and commodity structured transactions. In 2015, the GMS segment ended the year at $35.3 billion &#32;of AUM, down from $36.7 billion &#32;at December 31, 2014 . This decrease was primarily due to redemptions in our hedge funds, offset by eight new issue CLOs, fundraising for our second generation energy mezzanine fund, our second securitized commodity structured transactions vehicle and fundraising for our first carry fund dedicated to Asian structured credit. 

Primary areas of focus for our GMS teams include: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Structured Credit Funds. &#32;Our structured credit funds invest primarily in performing senior secured bank loans through structured vehicles and other investment vehicles. In 2015, we closed five new U.S. CLOs and three CLOs in Europe with a total of $2.8 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, of AUM at December 31, 2015 . As of December 31, 2015 , our structured credit team advised 43 &#32;structured credit funds and one &#32;carry fund in the United States, Europe, and Asia totaling, in the aggregate, approximately $18.4 billion &#32;in AUM. 

&#8226; 

Distressed and Corporate Opportunities. &#32;Our distressed and corporate opportunities funds generally invest in liquid and illiquid securities and obligations, including secured debt, senior and subordinated unsecured debt, convertible debt obligations, preferred stock and public and private equity of financially distressed companies in defensive and asset-rich industries. In certain investments, our funds may seek to restructure pre-reorganization debt claims into controlling positions in the equity of reorganized companies. As of December 31, 2015 , our distressed and corporate opportunities team advised two &#32;funds totaling, in the aggregate, approximately $1.4 billion &#32;in AUM. 

&#8226; 

Middle Market Finance. &#32;Our middle market finance business comprises our business development companies (&#8220;BDCs&#8221;), which invest primarily in first lien loans (which include unitranche, "first out" and "last out" loans) and second lien loans, a CLO consisting of middle market senior, first lien loans, and our corporate mezzanine funds, which invest in the first-lien, second-lien and mezzanine loans of middle-market companies, typically defined as companies with annual EBITDA ranging from $10 million to $100 million that lack access to the broadly syndicated loan and bond markets. As of December 31, 2015 , our middle market investment team advised five &#32;funds totaling, in the aggregate, approximately $2.2 billion &#32;in AUM. 

&#8226; 

Energy Mezzanine Opportunities. &#32;Our energy mezzanine opportunities team invests primarily in privately negotiated mezzanine debt investments in North American energy and power projects and companies. As of December 31, 2015 , our energy mezzanine opportunities team advised two &#32;funds with approximately $4.3 billion &#32;in AUM. 

&#8226; 

Long/Short Credit. &#32;Claren Road Asset Management LLC (&#8220;Claren Road&#8221;) advises two long/short credit hedge funds focusing on the global high grade and high yield markets totaling, in the aggregate, $3.4 billion &#32;in AUM as of December 31, 2015, which includes $2.3 billion of AUM that is subject to outstanding redemption requests as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2016. Claren Road seeks to profit from market mispricing of long and/or short positions in corporate and municipal bonds and loans, and their derivatives, across investment grade, below investment grade (high yield) or distressed companies. 

&#8226; 

Emerging Market Equity and Macroeconomic Strategies. &#32;Emerging Sovereign Group LLC (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) advises six emerging markets equities and macroeconomic hedge funds with $4.3 billion &#32;in the aggregate of AUM as of December 31, 2015, which includes $0.7 billion of AUM that is subject to outstanding redemption requests as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2016. ESG&#8217;s emerging markets equities funds invest in publicly traded equities across a range of developing countries. ESG&#8217;s macroeconomic funds pursue investment strategies in developed and developing countries, and opportunities resulting from changes in the global economic environment. 

&#8226;

Real Assets 

Our Real Assets segment, established in 1997 with our first U.S. real estate fund, advises our 26 &#32;active carry funds focused on real estate, infrastructure and energy and natural resources (including power) and also includes the six &#32;NGP management fee funds and three &#32;carry funds that are advised by NGP. This segment pursues investment opportunities across a diverse array of tangible assets, such as office buildings, hotels, retail and residential properties, industrial properties and senior-living facilities, as well as oil and gas exploration and production, midstream, refining and marketing, power generation, pipelines, wind farms, refineries, airports, toll roads, transportation, water utility and agriculture, as well as the companies providing services or otherwise related to them. 

Our Real Assets teams have two primary areas of focus: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Real Estate. &#32;Our eight &#32;active real estate funds pursue real estate investment opportunities in Asia, Europe and the United States and generally focus on acquiring single-property assets rather than large-cap companies with real estate portfolios. Our team of 108 real estate investment professionals has made more than 675 investments in 327 cities/metropolitan statistical areas around the world as of December 31, 2015 , including office buildings, hotels, retail and residential properties, industrial properties and senior living facilities. As of December 31, 2015 , our real estate funds had, in the aggregate, approximately $13.8 billion &#32;in AUM. 

&#8226; 

Energy and Natural Resources. &#32;Our energy and natural resources activities focus on buyouts, growth capital investments and strategic joint ventures in the midstream, upstream, power and oilfield services sectors, the renewable and alternative sectors and the energy and power industries around the world. Historically, we conducted our energy activities jointly with Riverstone, advising five &#32;funds with approximately $6.3 billion &#32;in AUM as of December 31, 2015 &#32;(we refer to these energy funds as our &#8220;Legacy Energy funds&#8221;). Currently, we conduct our North American energy investing through our partnership with NGP Energy Capital Management, an Irving, Texas-based energy investor. NGP advises nine &#32;funds with approximately $12.4 billion &#32;in AUM as of December 31, 2015 . Our power team focuses on investment opportunities in the North American power generation sector. As of December 31, 2015 , the power team managed approximately $1.8 billion &#32;in AUM through two &#32;funds. Our international energy investment team focuses on investments in a full range of energy assets outside of North America. As of December 31, 2015 , the international energy team 

managed approximately $2.7 billion &#32;in AUM through one &#32;fund. We also have an infrastructure team that focuses on investments in infrastructure companies and assets. As of December 31, 2015 , we advised one &#32;infrastructure fund with over $1.0 billion &#32;in AUM. 

Our Real Assets carry funds, including Carlyle-advised co-investment vehicles, have, from inception through December 31, 2015 , invested on a global basis approximately $39 billion &#32;in 858 &#32;investments (including more than 150 portfolio companies). Of that total, we have invested 77% &#32;in 682 &#32;investments in North and South America, 17% &#32;in 114 &#32;investments in Europe, the Middle East and Africa and 6% &#32;in 62 &#32;investments in the Asia-Pacific region. We have fully realized 510 &#32;of these investments, meaning that our funds have completely exited, and no longer own an interest in, those investments.

Investment Solutions 

Our Investment Solutions segment provides comprehensive investment opportunities and resources for our investors and clients to build private equity and real estate portfolios through fund of funds, secondary purchases of existing portfolios and managed coinvestment programs. Investment Solutions executes these activities through AlpInvest, one of the world&#8217;s largest investors in private equity and, Metropolitan, one of the largest managers of indirect investment in global real estate. In February 2016, we decided to restructure our Investment Solutions segment to focus on private market secondaries, co-investment and managed account activities and, given the challenging market environment, discontinue our fund of hedge funds and liquid alternative initiatives. In connection with the restructuring, we commenced a wind down of the operations of DGAM, a global manager of hedge funds based in Toronto, Canada that we acquired in February 2014. We expect that this action will improve our Investment Solutions results in the future, exclusive of costs incurred in connection with the wind down. 

The primary areas of focus for our Investment Solutions teams include: 

&#8226; 

Private Equity Fund Investments. &#32;Our fund of funds vehicles advised by AlpInvest make investment commitments directly to buyout, growth capital, venture and other alternative asset funds advised by other general partners (&#8220;portfolio funds&#8221;). As of December 31, 2015 , AlpInvest advised 48 &#32;fund of funds vehicles totaling, in the aggregate, approximately $28.2 billion &#32;in AUM. 

&#8226; 

Private Equity Co-investments. &#32;AlpInvest invests alongside other private equity and mezzanine funds in which it typically has a fund investment throughout Europe, North America and Asia (for example, when an investment opportunity is too large for a particular fund, the sponsor of the fund may seek to raise additional &#8220;co-investment&#8221; capital from sources such as AlpInvest). As of December 31, 2015 , our co-investment programs were conducted through 35 &#32;vehicles totaling, in the aggregate, over $6.4 billion &#32;in AUM. 

&#8226; 

Private Equity Secondary Investments. &#32;We manage through AlpInvest funds that acquire limited partnership interests in secondary market transactions. Private equity investors who desire to sell or restructure their pre-existing investment commitments to a fund may negotiate to sell the fund interests to AlpInvest. In this manner, AlpInvest&#8217;s secondary investments team provides liquidity and restructuring alternatives for third-party private equity investors. In 2015, we established a secondary team dedicated to finding opportunities in the energy and infrastructure space. As of December 31, 2015 , our secondary investments program was conducted through 35 &#32;fund of funds vehicles totaling, in the aggregate, more than $7.7 billion &#32;in AUM. 

&#8226; 

Real Estate, Funds of Funds and Co-Secondary Investments. &#32;The principal strategic focus in our real estate fund of funds vehicles is on value add/opportunistic real estate investments through direct commitments with 90 highly focused, specialist real estate managers across the globe. As of December 31, 2015 , we advised 26 

real estate fund of funds vehicles with approximately $1.9 billion in AUM. We also focus on real estate secondaries and coinvestments. 

The following table presents certain data about our Investment Solutions segment as of December 31, 2015 &#32;(dollar amounts in billions). See &#8220;&#8212; Structure and Operation of Our Investment Funds &#8212; Incentive Arrangements/Fee Structure&#8221; in this Item 1 for a discussion of the arrangements with the historical owners and management of AlpInvest regarding the allocation of carried interest in respect of the historical investments of and the historical and certain future commitments to our fund of funds vehicles.

Under our arrangements with the historical owners and management team of AlpInvest, we generally do not retain any carried interest in respect of the historical investments and commitments to our fund of funds vehicles that existed as of July 1, 2011 (including any options to increase any such commitments exercised after such date). We are entitled to 15% of the carried interest in respect of commitments from the historical owners of AlpInvest for the period between 2011 and 2020 and 40% of the carried interest in respect of all other commitments (including all future commitments from third parties).

Investment Approach 

Corporate Private Equity 

The investment approach of our Corporate Private Equity teams is generally characterized as follows: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Consistent and Disciplined Investment Process. &#32;We believe our successful investment track record is the result in part of a consistent and disciplined application of our investment process. Investment opportunities for our CPE funds are initially sourced and evaluated by one or more of our deal teams. The due diligence and transaction review process places a special emphasis on, among other considerations, the reputation of a target company&#8217;s shareholders and management, the company&#8217;s size and sensitivity of cash flow generation, the business sector and competitive risks, the portfolio fit, exit risks and other key factors highlighted by the deal team. In evaluating each deal, we consider what expertise or experience (i.e., the &#8220;Carlyle Edge&#8221;) we can bring to the transaction. An investment opportunity must secure final approval from the investment committee of the applicable investment fund. The investment committee approval process involves a detailed overview of the transaction and investment thesis, business, risk factors and diligence issues, as well as financial models. 

&#8226; 

Geographic- and Industry-Focused. &#32;We have developed a global network of local investment teams with deep local insight into the areas in which they invest and have adopted an industry-focused approach to investing. Our extensive network of global investment professionals has the knowledge, experience and relationships on a local level that allow them to identify and take advantage of opportunities which may be unavailable to firms who do not have our global reach and resources. We also have particular industry expertise in aerospace, defense and government services, consumer and retail, financial services, healthcare, industrial, telecom, media and technology and transportation. As a result, we believe that our in-depth knowledge of specific industries improves our ability to source and create transactions, conduct effective and more informed due diligence, develop strong relationships with management teams and use contacts and relationships within such industries to identify potential buyers as part of a coherent exit strategy. 

&#8226; 

Variable Deal Sizes and Creative Structures. &#32;Our teams are staffed not only to effectively pursue large transactions, but also other transactions of varying sizes. We often invest in smaller companies and this has allowed us to obtain greater diversity across our entire portfolio. Additionally, we may undertake large, strategic minority investments with certain control elements or private investment in public equity (PIPE) transactions in large companies with a clear exit strategy. In certain jurisdictions around the world, we may make investments with little or no debt financing and seek alternative structures to opportunistically pursue transactions. We generally seek to obtain board representation and typically appoint our investment professionals and advisors to represent us on the boards of the companies in which we invest. Where our 

funds, either alone or as part of a consortium, are not the controlling investor, we typically, subject to applicable regulatory requirements, acquire significant voting and other control rights with a view to securing influence over the conduct of the business. 

&#8226; 

Driving Value Creation. &#32;Our CPE teams seek to make investments in portfolio companies in which our particular strengths and resources may be employed to their best advantage. Typically, as part of a CPE investment, our investment teams will prepare and execute a value creation plan that is developed during a thorough due diligence effort and draws on the deep resources available across our global platform, specifically relying on: 

&#8226; 

Reach: &#32;Our global team and global presence that enables us to support international expansion efforts and global supply chain initiatives. 

&#8226; 

Expertise: &#32;Our investment professionals and our industry specialists, who provide extensive sector-specific knowledge and local market expertise. 

&#8226; 

Insight: &#32;We engage 26 operating executives and advisors as independent consultants to work with our investment teams during due diligence, provide board-level governance and support and advise our portfolio company CEOs. These advisors are former CEOs or other high level executives of some of the world&#8217;s most successful corporations and currently sit on the board of directors of a diverse mix of companies. We use this collective group of advisors to provide special expertise to support specific value creation initiatives. 

&#8226; 

Data: &#32;The goal of our research function is to extract as much information from the portfolio as possible about the current state of the economy and its likely evolution over the near-to-medium term. Our CPE investment portfolio includes over 175 active portfolio companies as of December 31, 2015 , across a diverse range of industries and geographies that each generate multiple data points (e.g., orders, shipments, production volumes, occupancy rates, bookings). By evaluating these data on a systematic basis, we work to identify the data with the highest correlation with macroeconomic data and map observed movements in the portfolio to anticipated variation in the economy, including changes in growth rates across industries and geographies. 

&#8226; 

Pursuing Best Exit Alternatives. &#32;In determining when to exit an investment, our private equity teams consider whether a portfolio company has achieved its objectives, the financial returns and the appropriate timing in industry cycles and company development to strive for the optimal value. The fund&#8217;s investment committee approves all exit decisions. 

Global Market Strategies 

The investment approach of our Global Market Strategies credit-focused funds is generally characterized as follows: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Source Investment Opportunities. &#32;Our GMS teams source investment opportunities from both the primary and secondary markets through our global network and strong relationships with the financial community. We typically target portfolio companies that have a demonstrated track record of profitability, market leadership in their respective niche, predictable cash flow, a definable competitive advantage and products or services that are value added to its customer base. 

&#8226; 

Conduct Fundamental Due Diligence and Perform Capital Structure Analyses . After an opportunity is identified, our GMS teams conduct fundamental due diligence to determine the relative value of the potential investment and capital structure analyses to determine the credit worthiness. Our due diligence approach typically incorporates meetings with management, company facility visits, discussions with industry analysts and consultants and an in-depth examination of financial results and projections. 

&#8226; 

Evaluation of Macroeconomic Factors. &#32;Our GMS teams evaluate technical factors such as supply and demand, the market&#8217;s expectations surrounding a company and the existence of short- and long-term value creation or destruction catalysts. Inherent in all stages of credit evaluation is a determination of the likelihood of potential catalysts emerging, such as corporate reorganizations, recapitalizations, asset sales, changes in a company&#8217;s liquidity and mergers and acquisitions. 

&#8226; 

Risk Minimization. &#32;Our GMS teams seek to make investments in capital structures to enable companies to both expand and weather downturns and/or below-plan performance. They work to structure investments with strong financial covenants, frequent reporting requirements and board representation, if possible. Through board representation or observation rights, our GMS teams work to provide a consultative, interactive approach to equity sponsors and management partners as part of the overall portfolio management process. 

Real Assets 

Our Real Assets business includes investments in real estate assets, infrastructure and energy and natural resources (including power) companies and projects. The investment approach of the teams advising the international energy, power and infrastructure funds is similar to that of our CPE funds. 

Generally, the investment approach of our real estate teams is characterized as follows: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Pursue Single Asset Transactions. &#32;In general, our U.S. real estate funds have focused on single asset transactions. We follow this approach in the U.S. because we believe that pursuing single assets enables us to better understand the factors that contribute to the fundamental value of each property, mitigate concentration risk, establish appropriate asset-by-asset capital structures and maintain governance over major property-level decisions. In addition, direct ownership of assets typically enables us to effectively employ an active asset management approach and reduce financing and operating risk, while increasing the visibility of factors that affect the overall returns of the investment. Historically, we have used an opportunistic real estate investment strategy; however, we have recently expanded our platform to include a core-plus investment strategy. In the U.S., we will continue to focus on single asset transactions in both our opportunistic and core plus investment strategies. Outside the U.S., we continue to opportunistically invest in the Asia and European markets. Currently, we are pursuing a value add strategy in China and focusing on opportunities such as logistics and data center platforms. In Europe, we pursue investment opportunities across asset classes and geographies both for single assets and portfolios, with a focus on opportunistic or value-add strategies. 

&#8226; 

Seek out Strong Joint Venture Partners or Managers. &#32;Where appropriate, we seek out joint venture partners or managers with significant operational expertise. For each joint venture, we design structures and terms that provide situationally appropriate incentives, often including, for example, the subordination of the joint venture partner&#8217;s equity and profits interest to that of a fund, clawback provisions and/or profits escrow accounts in favor of a fund and exclusivity. We also typically structure positions with control or veto rights over major decisions. 

&#8226; 

Source Deals Directly. &#32;Our teams endeavor to establish &#8220;market presence&#8221; in our target geographies where we have a history of operating in local markets and benefit from extensive long-term relationships with developers, corporate real estate owners, institutional investors and private owners. Such relationships have resulted in our ability to source a large number of investments on a direct negotiated basis. 

&#8226; 

Focus on Sector-Specific Strategies. &#32;Our real estate funds focus on specific sectors and markets in areas where we believe the fundamentals are sound and dynamic capital markets allow for identification of assets whose value is not fully recognized. The real estate funds we advise have invested according to strategies established in several main sectors: office, hotel, retail, residential, industrial and senior living. 

&#8226; 

Actively Manage our Real Estate Investments. &#32;Our real estate investments often require active management to uncover and create value. Accordingly, we have put in place experienced local asset management teams. These teams add value through analysis and execution of capital expenditure programs, development projects, lease negotiations, operating cost reduction programs and asset dispositions. The asset management teams work closely with the other real estate professionals to effectively formulate and implement strategic management plans. 

&#8226; 

Manage the Exit of Investments. &#32;We believe that &#8220;exit management&#8221; is as important as traditional asset management in order to take full advantage of the typically short windows of opportunity created by temporary imbalances in capital market forces that affect real estate. In determining when to exit an investment, our real estate teams consider whether an investment has fulfilled its strategic plan, the depth of the market and generally prevailing industry conditions. 

Our energy and natural resources activities primarily focus on three areas: international energy, North American energy and power. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

International Energy Investing. &#32;Our international energy team pursues investment opportunities in oil and gas exploration and production, midstream, oilfield services and refining and marketing in Europe, Africa, Latin America and Asia. Seeking to take advantage of the lack of capital in the international energy market, we pursue transactions where we have a distinctive competitive advantage and can create tangible value for companies in which we invest, through industry specialization, deployment of human capital and access to our global network. In seeking to build a geographically diverse international energy portfolio, we focus on cash generating opportunities, with a particular focus on proven reserves and production, and strategically seek to enhance the efficiency of the portfolio through exploration or infrastructure improvements. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

North American Energy Investing. &#32;We conduct our current North American energy investing through our partnership with NGP Energy Capital Management, an Irving, Texas-based energy investment firm that focuses on investments across a range of energy and natural resource assets, including oil and gas resources, oilfield services, pipelines and processing, as well as agricultural investments and properties. NGP seeks to align itself with &#8220;owner-managers&#8221; who are invested in the enterprise, have a top-tier technical team and who have a proprietary edge that differentiates their business plan. NGP strives to establish a portfolio of platform companies to grow through acquisitions and development and provides financial and strategic support and access to additional capital at the lowest cost. We do not control or manage the NGP management fee funds or the existing carry funds that are advised by NGP. NGP is managed by its founders and other senior members of NGP. 

&#8226; 

Power Investing. &#32;Our power team focuses on investment opportunities in the North American power generation sector. Leveraging the expertise of the investment professionals at Cogentrix Energy L.L.C., one of our portfolio companies, the team seeks investments where it can obtain direct or indirect operational control to facilitate the implementation of technical enhancements. We seek to capitalize on secular trends and to identify assets where engineering and technical expertise, in addition to a strong management team, can facilitate performance. 

Investment Solutions 

Our Investment Solutions team aims to apply a wide array of capabilities to help clients meet their investment objectives. The investment approach of our Investment Solutions platform is generally characterized as follows: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Depth of Investment Expertise. &#32;Investment Solutions has dedicated teams for each area of focus, and seeks to attract and retain talent with the required skill-set for each strategy. Investment Solutions professionals have trading, operational, portfolio and risk management expertise. From a top-down perspective, investment professionals seek to position the Investment Solutions business to capitalize on market opportunities through focused research and allocation of resources. From a bottom-up perspective, they seek to build deep relationships with underlying fund managers that are strengthened by the investment professionals&#8217; relevant experience in the broader financial markets. 

&#8226; 

Discipline. &#32;Investment Solutions professionals focus on diversification, risk management and downside protection. Its processes include the analysis and interpretation of macrodevelopments in the global economy and the assessment of a wide variety of issues that can influence the emphasis placed on sectors, geographies, asset classes and strategies when constructing investment portfolios. After making an investment commitment, the investment portfolios are subject to at least semi-annual reviews conducted by the respective investment team responsible for each investment. 

&#8226; 

Innovation. &#32;Investment Solutions professionals seek to leverage the intellectual capital throughout the firm to identify emerging trends, market anomalies and new investment technologies to facilitate the formation of new strategies, as well as to set the direction for exiting strategies. This market intelligence provides them with an additional feedback channel for the development of new investment products. 

Our Family of Funds 

The following chart presents the name (acronym), total capital commitments (in the case of our carry funds, structured credit funds, certain fund of funds vehicles, and the NGP management fee funds), assets under management (in the case of our hedge funds, fund of hedge funds vehicles, and other structured products), gross assets (in the case of our business development companies), and vintage year of the active funds in each of our segments, as of December 31, 2015 . We present total capital commitments (as opposed to assets under management) for our closed-end investment funds because we believe this metric provides the most useful information regarding the relative size and scale of such funds. In the case of our hedge funds, fund of hedge funds vehicles, and other structured products which are open-ended and accordingly do not have permanent committed capital, we believe the most useful metric regarding relative size and scale is assets under management.

Organizational Structure 

The simplified diagram below depicts our organizational structure. Ownership information in the diagram below is presented as of December 31, 2015. The diagram does not depict all of our subsidiaries, including intermediate holding companies through which certain of the subsidiaries depicted are held. As discussed in greater detail below, The Carlyle Group L.P. holds, through wholly owned subsidiaries, a number of Carlyle Holdings partnership units that is equal to the number of common units that The Carlyle Group L.P. has issued and benefits from the income of Carlyle Holdings to the extent of its equity interests in the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. While the holders of common units of The Carlyle Group L.P. are entitled to all of the economic rights in The Carlyle Group L.P., the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships, like the wholly owned subsidiaries of The Carlyle Group L.P., hold Carlyle Holdings partnership units that entitle them to economic rights in Carlyle Holdings to the extent of their equity interests in the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. Public investors do not directly hold equity interests in the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. 

(1) 

The Carlyle Group L.P. common unitholders have only limited voting rights and have no right to remove our general partner or, except in limited circumstances, elect the directors of our general partner. TCG Carlyle Global Partners L.L.C., an entity wholly owned by our senior Carlyle professionals, holds a special voting unit in The Carlyle Group L.P. that entitles it, on those few matters that may be submitted for a vote of The Carlyle Group L.P. common unitholders, to participate in the vote on the same basis as the common unitholders and provides it with a number of votes that is equal to the aggregate number of vested and unvested partnership units in Carlyle Holdings held by the limited partners of Carlyle Holdings on the relevant record date. 

(2) 

Certain individuals engaged in our business own interests directly in selected subsidiaries, including, in certain instances, entities that receive management fees from funds that we advise. See &#8220;&#8212; Structure and Operation of Our Investment Funds &#8212; Incentive Arrangements/Fee Structure&#8221; in this Item 1 for additional information. 

The Carlyle Group L.P. conducts all of its material business activities through Carlyle Holdings. Each of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships was formed to hold our interests in different businesses. Carlyle Holdings I L.P. owns all of our U.S. fee-generating businesses and many of our non-U.S. fee-generating businesses, as well as our carried interests (and other investment interests) that derive income that we believe is not qualifying income for purposes of the U.S. federal income tax publicly-traded partnership rules and certain of our carried interests (and other investment interests) that do not relate to investments in stock of corporations or in debt, such as equity investments in entities that are pass-through for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Carlyle Holdings II L.P. holds a variety of assets, including our carried interests in many of the investments by our carry funds in entities that are treated as domestic corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes and in certain non-U.S. entities. Certain of our non-U.S. fee-generating businesses, as well as our non-U.S. carried interests (and other investment interests) that derive income that we believe is not qualifying income for purposes of the U.S. federal income tax publicly-traded partnership rules and certain of our non-U.S. carried interests (and other investment interests) that do not relate to investments in stock of corporations or in debt, such as equity investments in entities that are pass-through for U.S. federal income tax purposes are held by Carlyle Holdings III L.P. 

The Carlyle Group L.P. has wholly owned subsidiaries that serve as the general partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships: Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. (a Delaware corporation that is a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes), Carlyle Holdings II GP L.L.C. (a Delaware limited liability company that is a disregarded entity and not an association taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and Carlyle Holdings III GP L.P. (a Qu&#233;bec soci&#233;t&#233; en commandite &#32;that is a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) serve as the general partners of Carlyle Holdings I L.P., Carlyle Holdings II L.P. and Carlyle Holdings III L.P., respectively. Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc. and Carlyle Holdings III GP L.P. serve as the general partners of Carlyle Holdings I L.P. and Carlyle Holdings III L.P., respectively, through wholly owned subsidiaries that are disregarded for federal income tax purposes. We refer to Carlyle Holdings I GP Inc., Carlyle Holdings II GP L.L.C. and Carlyle Holdings III GP L.P. collectively as the &#8220;Carlyle Holdings General Partners.&#8221; 

Holding Partnership Structure 

The Carlyle Group L.P. is treated as a partnership and not as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, although our partnership agreement does not restrict our ability to take actions that may result in our being treated as an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal (and applicable state) income tax purposes. An entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes is not a taxable entity and incurs no U.S. federal income tax liability. Instead, each partner is required to take into account its allocable share of items of income, gain, loss and deduction of the partnership in computing its U.S. federal income tax liability, whether or not cash distributions are made. Each holder of our common units is a limited partner of The Carlyle Group L.P., and accordingly, is generally required to pay U.S. federal income taxes with respect to the income and gain of The Carlyle Group L.P. that is allocated to such holder, even if The Carlyle Group L.P. does not make cash distributions. We believe that the Carlyle Holdings partnerships should also be treated as partnerships and not as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the holders of partnership units in Carlyle Holdings, including The Carlyle Group L.P.&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiaries, incur U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on their proportionate share of any net taxable income of Carlyle Holdings. 

Each of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships has an identical number of partnership units outstanding, and we use the terms &#8220;Carlyle Holdings partnership unit&#8221; or &#8220;partnership unit in/of Carlyle Holdings&#8221; to refer collectively to a partnership unit in each of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. The Carlyle Group L.P. holds, through wholly owned subsidiaries, a number of Carlyle Holdings partnership units equal to the number of common units that The Carlyle Group L.P. has issued. The Carlyle Holdings partnership units that are held by The Carlyle Group L.P.&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiaries are economically identical to the Carlyle Holdings partnership units that are held by the limited partners of the Carlyle Holdings partnerships. Accordingly, the income of Carlyle Holdings benefits The Carlyle Group L.P. to the extent of its equity interest in Carlyle Holdings. 

The Carlyle Group L.P. is managed and operated by our general partner, Carlyle Group Management L.L.C., to whom we refer as &#8220;our general partner,&#8221; which is in turn wholly owned by our senior Carlyle professionals. Our general partner does not have any business activities other than managing and operating us. We reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for all costs incurred in managing and operating us, and our partnership agreement provides that our general partner determines the expenses that are allocable to us. Although there are no ceilings on the expenses for which we will reimburse our general partner and its affiliates, the expenses to which they may be entitled to reimbursement from us, such as director fees, historically have not been, and are not expected to be, material. 

LP Relations 

Our diverse and sophisticated investor base includes more than 1,700 active carry fund investors located in 78 &#32;countries. Included among our many longstanding fund investors are pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies and high net worth individuals in the United States, Asia, Europe, the Middle East and South America. 

We strive to maintain a systematic fundraising approach to support growth and serve our investor needs. This approach to fundraising has been critical in raising over $16 billion , net of redemptions, in 2015. We work for our fund investors and continuously seek to strengthen and expand our relationships with them through frequent investor engagement and by cross-selling products across our diverse platform. We have a dedicated in-house LP relations group, which includes 27 geographically focused professionals with extensive investor relations and fundraising experience. In addition, we have 18 product specialists with a focus on specific business segments and 10 professionals focused on high net worth distribution. Our LP relations group is supported by 66 support staff responsible for project management and fulfillment. Our LP relations professionals are in constant dialogue with our fund investors, which enables us to monitor client preferences and tailor future fund offerings to meet investor demand. We strive to secure a first-mover advantage with key investors, often by establishing a local presence and providing a broad and diverse range of investment opportunities. 

As of December 31, 2015, approximately 92% of commitments to our active carry funds (by dollar amount) were from investors who are committed to more than one active carry fund, and approximately 62% of commitments to our active carry funds (by dollar amount) were from investors who are committed to more than five active carry funds. We believe the loyalty of our fund investor base, as evidenced by our substantial number of multi-fund relationships, enhances our ability to raise new funds and successor funds in existing strategies. 

Investor Services 

We have a team of over 700 investor services professionals worldwide. The investor services group performs a range of functions to support our investment teams, LP relations group, and the corporate infrastructure of Carlyle. Our investor services professionals provide an important control function, ensuring that transactions are structured pursuant to the partnership agreements, assisting in global regulatory compliance requirements and investor reporting to enable investors to easily monitor the performance of their investments. We have devoted substantial resources to creating comprehensive and timely investor reports, which are increasingly important to our investor base. The investor services group also works closely with each fund&#8217;s lifecycle, from fund formation and investments to portfolio monitoring and fund liquidation. We maintain an internal global legal and compliance team, which includes 22 professionals and a government relations group with a presence around the globe, which includes 15 professionals as of December 31, 2015. We intend to continue to build and invest in our legal, regulatory and compliance functions to enable our investment teams to better serve our investors. 

Structure and Operation of Our Investment Funds 

We conduct the sponsorship and management of our carry funds and other investment vehicles primarily through limited partnerships, which are organized by us, to accept commitments and/or funds for investment from institutional investors and high net worth individuals. Each investment fund that is a limited partnership, or &#8220;partnership&#8221; fund, has a general partner that is responsible for the management and operation of the fund&#8217;s affairs and makes all policy and investment decisions relating to the conduct of the investment fund&#8217;s business. The limited partners of such funds take no part in the conduct or control of the business of such funds, have no right or authority to act for or bind such funds and have no influence over the voting or disposition of the securities or other assets held by such funds, although such limited partners may vote on certain partnership matters including the removal of the general partner or early liquidation of the partnership by simple majority vote, as discussed below. In the case of certain separately managed accounts advised by us, the investor, rather than us, may control the asset or the investment decisions related thereto or certain investment vehicles or entities that hold or have custody of such assets. 

Each investment fund and in the case of our separately managed accounts, the client, engages an investment adviser. Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C. (&#8220;CIM&#8221;) or one of its subsidiaries or affiliates serves as an investment adviser for most of our carry funds and is registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the &#8220;Advisers Act&#8221;). Our investment advisers are generally entitled to a management fee from each investment fund for which they serve as investment advisers. For a discussion of the management fees to which our investment advisers are entitled across our various types of investment funds, see &#8220;&#8212; Incentive Arrangements / Fee Structure&#8221; below. 

Our carry funds and hedge funds themselves typically do not register as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#8220;1940 Act&#8221; or the &#8220;Investment Company Act&#8221;), in reliance on Section 3(c)(7) or Section 7(d) thereof or, typically in the case of funds formed prior to 1997, Section 3(c)(1) thereof. Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act exempts from the 1940 Act&#8217;s registration requirements investment funds privately placed in the United States whose 

securities are owned exclusively by persons who, at the time of acquisition of such securities, are &#8220;qualified purchasers&#8221; as defined under the 1940 Act and purchase their interests in a private placement. Section 3(c)(1) of the 1940 Act exempts from the 1940 Act&#8217;s registration requirements privately placed investment funds whose securities are beneficially owned by not more than 100 persons and purchase their interests in a private placement. In addition, under certain current interpretations of the SEC, Section 7(d) of the 1940 Act exempts from registration any non-U.S. investment fund all of whose outstanding securities are beneficially owned either by non-U.S. residents or by U.S. residents that are qualified purchasers and purchase their interests in a private placement. 

The governing agreements of the vast majority of our investment funds provide that, subject to certain conditions, a majority in interest (based on capital commitments) of third-party investors in those funds have the right to remove the general partner of the fund for cause and/or to accelerate the liquidation date of the investment fund without cause. In addition, the governing agreements of many of our investment funds generally require investors in those funds to vote to continue the investment period in the event that certain &#8220;key persons&#8221; in our investment funds do not provide the specified time commitment to the fund or our firm, cease to control the general partner (or similar managing entity) or the investment adviser or cease to hold a specified percentage of the economic interests in the general partner. 

Our carry funds, fund of funds vehicles, business development companies, and NGP management fee funds are closed-ended funds. In a closed-ended fund structure, once an investor makes an investment, the investor is generally not able to withdraw or redeem its interest, except in very limited circumstances. Furthermore, each limited partnership contains restrictions on an investor&#8217;s ability to transfer its interest in the fund. In the open-ended funds we advise, investors are usually locked-up for a period of time after which they may generally redeem their interests on a quarterly basis. 

With respect to our carry funds, investors generally agree to fund their commitment over a period of time. For our private equity funds, the commitment period generally runs until the earlier of (i) the sixth anniversary of the initial closing date or the fifth anniversary of the final closing date of the fund; (ii) the date the general partner cancels such obligation due to changes in applicable laws or when at least a significant portion (which may range between 85% and 90%) of the capital commitments to the fund have been invested, committed or reserved for investments; (iii) the date a supermajority in interest (based on capital commitments) of investors vote to terminate the commitment period; or (iv) the failure of certain key persons to devote a specified amount of time to such fund or Carlyle, to control the general partner or the investment adviser or to hold a specified percentage of the economic interests in the general partner, unless upon any of these events the investors vote to continue the investment period. Following the termination of the commitment period, an investor generally will be released from any further obligation with respect to its undrawn capital commitment except to the extent necessary to pay partnership expenses and management fees, fund outstanding borrowings and guarantees, complete investments with respect to transactions committed to prior to the end of the commitment period and make follow-on investments in existing companies. Generally, an investor&#8217;s obligation to fund follow-on investments extends for a period of three years following the end of the commitment period, provided that there may be limitations on how much such investor is required to fund for such follow-on investments. In those funds where such limitations exist, they generally range from 15-20% of an investor's capital commitment. 

Investors in the latest generation of our real estate funds generally commit to fund their investment for a period of four (Asia and Europe) or five (United States) years from the final closing date, provided that the general partner may unilaterally extend such expiration date for one year and may extend it for another year with the consent of a majority of the limited partners or the investment advisory committee for that fund. Investors in the latest generation of our real estate funds are also obligated to continue to make capital contributions with respect to follow-on investments and to repay indebtedness for a period of time after the original expiration date of the commitment period, as well as to fund partnership expenses and management fees during the life of the fund. 

The term of each of the CPE, Real Assets and GMS carry funds generally will end 10 years from the initial closing date, or in some cases, from the final closing date, but such termination date may be earlier in certain limited circumstances or later if extended by the general partner (in many instances with the consent of a majority in interest (based on capital commitments) of the investors or the investment advisory committee) for successive one-year periods, typically up to a maximum of two years. 

With respect to our fund of funds vehicles, the commitment period generally runs for a period of three years after the initial closing date of the vehicle. Following the termination of the commitment period, an investor in one of our fund of funds vehicles generally will only be required to fund additional amounts for partnership expenses, fund outstanding borrowings and guarantees, transactions in process or committed to during the investment period and make follow-on investments in existing companies. The term of each of the fund of funds vehicles generally will end 8 to 12 years from the initial closing date. In some cases, the termination date may be later if extended by the general partner (in many instances with the consent of a majority in interest (based on capital commitments) of the investors or the investment advisory committee) for successive up to 

two-year periods, potentially up to a maximum of four years or until such time as is reasonably necessary for the general partner to be able to liquidate the fund's assets. 

Incentive Arrangements / Fee Structure 

Fund Management Fees. &#32;The investment adviser of each of our carry funds generally receives an annual management fee that ranges from 1% to 2% of the investment fund or vehicle&#8217;s capital commitments during the investment period. Following the expiration or termination of the investment period of such carry funds, the management fees generally step-down to between 0.6% and 2.0% generally on the lower of cost or fair value of capital invested; however, certain of our managed accounts base management fees on contributions for unrealized investments or the current value of the investment at all times. The management fees that we receive from our carry funds typically are payable semi-annually in advance. The investment adviser of our private equity and real estate fund of funds vehicles generally receives an annual management fee that ranges from 0.3% to 1.0% of the vehicle&#8217;s capital commitments during the commitment fee period of the relevant fund or the weighted-average investment period of the underlying funds. Following the expiration of the commitment fee period or weighted-average investment period of such fund of funds vehicles, the management fees generally range from 0.3% to 1.0% on the lower of cost or fair value of the capital invested, the net asset value for unrealized investments, or the contributions for unrealized investments. The management fees for our fund of hedge funds vehicles generally range from 0.2 % to 1.5% of net asset value. The management fees we receive from our fund of funds vehicles typically are payable quarterly in advance. The investment adviser of our hedge funds generally receives management fees that range from 1.5% to 2.0% of net asset value per year. The investment adviser of our business development companies generally receives management fees quarterly in arrears at annual rates that range from 0.25% to 1.00% of gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents. The investment adviser of each of our CLOs and other structured products generally receives an annual management fee of 0.15% to 1.00% on the total par amount of assets or the aggregate principal amount of the notes in the CLO. Such management fees are due quarterly or semi-annually based on the terms of the applicable fund documentation and recognized over the respective period. The investment adviser will receive management fees for the CLOs until redemption of the securities issued by the CLOs, which is generally five to ten years after issuance. Open-ended funds typically do not have stated termination dates. 

With respect to Claren Road, ESG and, for periods prior to July 1, 2015, Carlyle Commodity Management (&#8220;CCM&#8221;), we retain a specified percentage of the earnings of those businesses based on our 55% ownership in the management companies of those entities. Effective July 1, 2015, our specified percentage of earnings for CCM are based on our approximate 83% economic interest in that entity. The management fees received by our Claren Road, ESG and CCM hedge funds have similar characteristics. Certain of such funds often afford investors increased liquidity through annual, semi-annual, quarterly, or monthly withdrawal or redemption rights in certain cases following the expiration of a specified period of time when capital may not be withdrawn and the amount of management fees to which the investment adviser is entitled with respect thereto will proportionately increase as the net asset value of each investor&#8217;s capital account grows and will proportionately decrease as the net asset value of each investor&#8217;s capital account decreases. Our equity interest in NGP previously entitled us to an allocation of income equal to 47.5%, which increased to 55% in January 2015, of the management fee-related revenues of the NGP entities that serve as advisors to the NGP management fee funds. 

The general partners or investment advisers to our carry funds from time to time receive customary transaction fees upon consummation of many of our funds&#8217; acquisition transactions, receive monitoring fees from many of their portfolio companies following acquisition and may from time to time receive other fees in connection with their activities. The ongoing monitoring fees that they receive are generally calculated as a percentage of a specified financial metric of a particular portfolio company. The transaction fees which they receive are generally calculated either as a fixed amount or as a percentage (that generally ranges up to 1%, but may exceed 1% in certain circumstances) of the total enterprise value or capitalization of the investment. The management fees charged to limited partner investors are generally reduced by 80% to 100% of such transaction fees and certain other fees that are received by the general partners and their affiliates. 

Performance Fees. &#32;The general partner of each of our carry funds and fund of funds vehicles also receives carried interest from the carry fund or fund of funds vehicle. Carried interest entitles the general partner to a special residual allocation of profit on third-party capital. In the case of our carry funds, carried interest is generally calculated on a &#8220;realized gain&#8221; basis, and each general partner is generally entitled to a carried interest equal to 20% (or 10% to 20% on external coinvestment vehicles, with most earning no carried interest, or approximately 2% to 10% in the case of most of our fund of funds vehicles) of the net realized profit (generally taking into account unrealized losses) generated by third-party capital invested in such fund. Net realized profit or loss is not netted between or among funds. Our senior Carlyle professionals and other personnel who work in these operations also own interests in the general partners of our carry funds and we generally allocate 45% of any carried interest that we earn to these individuals in order to better align their interests with our own and with those of the investors in the funds. For most carry funds, the carried interest is subject to an annual preferred return of 8% to 9%, subject to a catch-up allocation to the general partner. If, as a result of diminished performance of later investments in the life of a carry fund or fund of funds vehicle, the carry fund or fund of funds vehicle does not achieve investment returns that (in most cases) 

exceed the preferred return threshold or (in almost all cases) the general partner receives in excess of 20% (or 10% to 20% on external coinvestment vehicles, with most earning no carried interest, or approximately 2% to 10% in the case of most of our fund of funds vehicles) of the net profits on third-party capital over the life of the fund, we will be obligated to repay the amount by which the carried interest that was previously distributed to us exceeds amounts to which we are ultimately entitled. This obligation, which is known as a &#8220;giveback&#8221; obligation, operates with respect to a given carry fund&#8217;s own net investment performance only and is typically capped at the after tax amount of carried interest received by the general partner. Each recipient of carried interest distributions is individually responsible for his or her proportionate share of any "giveback" obligation; however, we may guarantee the full amount of such &#8220;giveback&#8221; obligation in respect of amounts received by Carlyle and certain other amounts. Our ability to generate carried interest is an important element of our business and carried interest has historically accounted for a significant portion of our income. 

The receipt of carried interest in respect of investments of our carry funds is dictated by the terms of the partnership agreements that govern such funds, which generally allow for carried interest distributions in respect of an investment upon a realization event after satisfaction of obligations relating to the return of capital from all realized investments, any realized losses, allocable fees and expenses and the applicable annual preferred return. Carried interest is ultimately realized and distributed when: (i) an underlying investment is profitably disposed of, (ii) certain costs borne by the limited partner investors have been reimbursed, (iii) the investment fund&#8217;s cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return and (iv) we have decided to collect carry rather than return additional capital to limited partner investors. Distributions to eligible senior Carlyle professionals in respect of such carried interest are generally made shortly thereafter. Our decision to realize carry considers such factors as the level of embedded valuation gains, the portion of the fund invested, the portion of the fund returned to limited partner investors, and the length of time the fund has been in carry, as well as other qualitative measures. Although Carlyle has seldom been obligated to pay a giveback obligation, such obligation, if any, in respect of previously realized carried interest, is generally determined and due upon the winding up or liquidation of a carry fund pursuant to the terms of the fund&#8217;s partnership agreement although in certain cases the giveback is calculated at prior intervals. 

In addition to the carried interest from our carry funds, we are also entitled to receive incentive fees or allocations from certain of our GMS funds. Our hedge funds generally pay annual incentive fees or allocations equal to 20% of the fund&#8217;s profits for the year, subject to a high-water mark. The high-water mark is the highest historical NAV attributable to a fund investor&#8217;s account on which incentive fees were paid and means that we will not earn incentive fees with respect to such fund investor for a year if the NAV of such investor&#8217;s account at the end of the year is lower that year than any prior year-end NAV or the NAV at the date of such fund investor&#8217;s investment, generally excluding any contributions and redemptions for purposes of calculating NAV. Certain of our business development companies also earn incentive fees (i) quarterly based on net investment income for the prior quarter and (ii) 20% annually based on the business development company's profits for the year, subject to a high water mark. In these arrangements, incentive fees are recognized when the performance benchmark has been achieved based on the hedge funds&#8217; then-current fair value and are included in performance fees in our consolidated statements of operations. These incentive fees are a component of performance fees in our consolidated financial statements and are treated as accrued until paid to us. 

With respect to our arrangements with NGP, we have acquired future interests in the general partners of certain future funds advised by NGP that will entitle us to an allocation of income equal to 47.5% of the carried interest received by such fund general partners. In addition, we also exercised our option to purchase interests in the general partner of the NGP X fund, which entitles us to an allocation of income equal to 40% of the carried interest received by NGP X's general partner. 

Under our arrangements with the historical owners and management team of AlpInvest, we generally do not retain any carried interest in respect of the historical investments and commitments to our fund of funds vehicles that existed as of July 1, 2011 (including any options to increase any such commitments exercised after such date). We are entitled to 15% of the carried interest in respect of commitments from the historical owners of AlpInvest for the period between 2011 and 2020 and 40% of the carried interest in respect of all other commitments (including all future commitments from third parties). 

Under our arrangements with the historical owners and management team of Metropolitan, the management team and employees are allocated all carried interest in respect of the historical investments and commitments to the fund of funds vehicles that have had a final closing on or prior to July 31, 2013, and 45% of the carried interest in respect of all other commitments. 

Under our arrangements with the historical owners and management team of DGAM, through the year ended December 31, 2015, the management team and employees are entitled to receive 30% of certain revenues received by DGAM&#8217;s management company (including revenues from management fees and incentive fees). DGAM investment funds generally pay annual incentive fees equal to 7.5% to 10% of the fund&#8217;s profits for the year, subject to a high water mark. In February 2016, we decided to restructure our Investment Solutions segment to focus on private market secondaries, co-investment and managed 

account activities and, given the challenging market environment, discontinue our fund of hedge funds and liquid alternative initiatives. In connection with the restructuring, we commenced a wind down of the operations of DGAM. 

As noted above, in connection with raising new funds or securing additional investments in existing funds, we negotiate terms for such funds and investments with existing and potential investors. The outcome of such negotiations could result in our agreement to terms that are materially less favorable to us than for prior funds we have advised or funds advised by our competitors. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Our Business Operations &#8212; Our investors in future funds may negotiate to pay us lower management fees and the economic terms of our future funds may be less favorable to us than those of our existing funds, which could adversely affect our revenues.&#8221; 

Capital Invested in and Alongside Our Investment Funds 

To further align our interests with those of investors in our investment funds, we have invested our own capital and that of our senior Carlyle professionals in and alongside the investment funds we sponsor and advise. We intend to have Carlyle commit to fund approximately 1% of the capital commitments to our future carry funds. We also intend to make investments in our open-end funds and our CLO vehicles. In addition, certain qualified Carlyle professionals and other qualified individuals (including certain individuals who may not be employees of the firm but who have pre-existing business relationships with Carlyle or industry expertise in the sector in which a particular investment fund may be investing) are permitted, subject to certain restrictions, to invest alongside the investment funds we sponsor and advise. Fees assessed or profit allocations on such investments by such persons may be eliminated or substantially reduced. 

Minimum general partner capital commitments to our investment funds are determined separately with respect to each investment fund. We may, from time to time, exercise our right to purchase additional interests in our investment funds that become available in the ordinary course of their operations. See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212; Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; for more information regarding our minimum general partner capital commitments to our funds. Our general partner capital commitments are funded with cash and not with carried interest or through a management fee waiver program. 

Carlyle and its eligible employees and officers have the right to co-invest with each of the investment funds on a deal-by-deal basis, typically in an amount up to 5% of the investment opportunity (on top of our base commitment). 

Corporate Citizenship 

We are committed to the principle that building a better business means investing responsibly. In September 2008, Carlyle developed a set of responsible investment guidelines that consider the environmental, social and governance implications of certain investments we make. These guidelines were integral to shaping the corporate social responsibility guidelines later adopted by the members of the Private Equity Growth Capital Council. We have worked to integrate these guidelines into our investment decision-making process for controlling, corporate investments. We also have worked to develop internal expertise in our sustainability work. We are a member of Business for Social Responsibility, a global nonprofit business network dedicated to sustainability. We also educate portfolio companies in which we have a controlling interest on the guidelines and encourage them to review the guidelines at the board level on an annual basis. 

We are a member of the British Venture Capital Association and seek to ensure that our U.K.-based portfolio companies are compliant, on a voluntary basis, with the Walker Guidelines for Disclosure and Transparency when such companies become subject to these guidelines. Further, we are also a member of the Bundesverband Deutscher Kapitalbeteiligungsgesellschaften (the &#8220;BVK&#8221;), the German private equity and venture capital trade association. We believe that we are compliant with the BVK Guidelines for Disclosure and Transparency and seek to ensure that our German portfolio companies comply with these guidelines when they are required to do so. 

AlpInvest is a signatory of the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment and has adopted the UN Global Compact as a corporate social responsibility (CSR) framework to evaluate fund managers and portfolio companies. AlpInvest has fully integrated CSR into its investment process and actively engages with fund managers and other stakeholders in the private equity markets to promote sustainability and improved corporate governance as an investment consideration. In addition, AlpInvest seeks opportunities to invest in sustainability solutions. 

Global Information Technology and Solutions 

Global Information Technology and Solutions, which we refer to as GTS, is essential for Carlyle to conduct investment activities, manage internal administration activities and connect a global enterprise. As part of our GTS strategy and governance processes, we develop and routinely refine our technology architecture to leverage solutions that will best serve the needs of our investors. Our systems, data, network and infrastructure are continuously monitored and administered by formal 

controls and risk management processes that also help protect the data and privacy of our employees and investors. Our business continuity plan is designed to allow all critical business functions to continue in an orderly manner in the event of an emergency. 

Competition 

As a global alternative asset manager, we compete with a broad array of regional and global organizations for both investors and investment opportunities. Generally, our competition varies across business lines, geographies, distribution channels and financial markets. We believe that our competition for investors is based primarily on investment performance, business relationships, the quality of services provided to investors, reputation and brand recognition, pricing and the relative attractiveness of the particular opportunity in which a particular fund intends to invest. To stay competitive, we believe it is also important to be able to offer fund investors a customized suite of investment products which enable them to tailor their investments across alternatives in hedge funds, private equity and real estate. We believe that competition for investment opportunities varies across business lines, but is generally based on industry expertise and potential for value-add, pricing, terms and the structure of a proposed investment and certainty of execution. 

We generally compete with sponsors of public and private investment funds across all of our segments. Within our CPE segment, we also compete with business development companies and operating companies acting as strategic acquirers. In our GMS segment, we compete with private credit strategies, hedge funds, business development companies, distressed debt funds, mezzanine funds and other CLO issuers. In our Real Assets segment, we also compete with real estate development companies. In our Investment Solutions segment, we generally compete with other fund of funds managers and/or with advisers that are turning their business models towards discretionary investment advisory services. 

In addition to these traditional competitors within the global alternative asset management industry, we have increasingly faced competition from local and regional firms, financial institutions, sovereign wealth funds, family offices and agencies and instrumentalities of governments in the various countries in which we invest. This trend has been especially apparent in emerging markets, where local firms tend to have more established relationships with the companies in which we are attempting to invest. In addition, large institutional investors and sovereign wealth funds have begun to develop their own in-house investment capabilities and may compete against us for investment opportunities. Furthermore, in some cases, large institutional investors have reduced allocations to &#8220;fund of funds&#8221; vehicles and turned instead to private equity and hedge fund advisory firms that assist with direct investments. Greater reliance on advisory firms or in-house investment management may reduce fund of funds&#8217; appeal to large institutional investors. As we continue to target high net worth investors, we also face competition from mutual funds and alternative asset management firms that have launched liquid alternative products. 

Some of the entities that we compete with as an alternative asset manager are substantially larger and have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and more personnel than we do. Several of our competitors also have recently raised or are expected to raise, significant amounts of capital and many of them have investment objectives similar to ours, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities and investor capital. Some of these competitors may also have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us, which may create competitive disadvantages for us when sourcing investment opportunities. In addition, some of these competitors may have higher risk tolerances, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds, which could allow them to consider a wider range of investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments. Strategic buyers may also be able to achieve synergistic cost savings or revenue enhancements with respect to a targeted portfolio company, which we may not be able to achieve through our own portfolio, and this may provide them with a competitive advantage in bidding for such investments. 

Employees 

We believe that one of the strengths and principal reasons for our success is the quality and dedication of our people. As of December 31, 2015, we employed more than 1,700 &#32;individuals, including more than 700 &#32;investment professionals, located in 36 &#32;offices across six continents. 

Regulatory and Compliance Matters 

United States 

Our businesses, as well as the financial services industry generally, are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and elsewhere. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the &#8220;CFTC&#8221;) and other regulators around the globe have in recent years significantly increased their regulatory activities with respect to alternative asset management firms. 

Certain of our subsidiaries are registered as investment advisers with the SEC. Registered investment advisers are subject to the requirements and regulations of the Investment Advisers Act. Such requirements relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to advisory clients, maintaining an effective compliance program, solicitation agreements, conflicts of interest, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements, limitations on agency cross and principal transactions between an adviser and advisory clients and general anti-fraud prohibitions. In addition, our registered investment advisers are subject to routine periodic and other examinations by the staff of the SEC. In accordance with our efforts to enhance our compliance program and in response to recommendations received from the SEC in the course of routine examinations, certain additional policies and procedures have been put into place, but no material changes to our registered investment advisers&#8217; operations have been made as a result of such examinations. Our registered investment advisers also have not been subject to any regulatory or disciplinary actions by the SEC. Finally, certain of our investment advisers are subject to limited SEC disclosure requirements as &#8220;exempt reporting advisers.&#8221; 

TCG Securities, L.L.C. (&#8220;TCG Securities&#8221;), the affiliate entity through which we conduct U.S.-based marketing and fundraising activities, is registered as a limited purpose broker/dealer with the SEC, is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;), and is also registered as a broker/dealer in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Additionally, TCG Securities operates under the international broker/dealer exemption in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec. TCG Securities acts as a placement agent, on a best efforts basis, for interests in private funds, as well as interests in special purpose vehicles, specifically debt and equity tranches of collateralized commodities obligations and collateralized loan obligations for which TCG Securities&#8217; affiliates serve as collateral manager. In the first half of 2016, TCG Securities intends to submit an application to FINRA to expand its scope of associated persons. Additionally, FINRA, a self-regulatory organization that is subject to SEC oversight, maintains regulatory authority over all securities firms doing business with the public in the United States (including our broker/dealer), adopts and enforces rules governing the activities of its member firms and conducts cycle examinations and targeted sweep inquiries on issues of immediate concern, among other roles and responsibilities. Our broker dealer is subject to routine periodic and other examinations by the staff of FINRA. No material changes to our broker dealer's operations have been made as a result of such examinations. 

Broker/dealers are subject to rules relating to transactions on a particular exchange and/or market, and rules relating to the internal operations of the firms and their dealings with customers including, but not limited to the form or organization of the firm, qualifications of associated persons, officers and directors, net capital and customer protection rules, books and records and financial statements and reporting. In particular, as a result of its registered status, TCG Securities is subject to the SEC&#8217;s uniform net capital rule, Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), which specifies both the minimum level of net capital a broker/dealer must maintain relative to the scope of its business activities and net capital liquidity parameters. The SEC and FINRA require compliance with key financial responsibility rules, including maintenance of adequate funds to meet expenses and contractual obligations, as well as early warning rules that compel notice to the regulators via accelerated financial reporting anytime a firm&#8217;s capital falls below the minimum required level. The uniform net capital rule limits the amount of qualifying subordinated debt that is treated as equity to a specific percentage under the debt-to-equity ratio test, and further limits the withdrawal of equity capital, which is subject to specific notice provisions. Finally, compliance with net capital rules may also limit a firm&#8217;s ability to expand its operations, particularly to those activities that require the use of capital. To date, TCG Securities has not had any capital adequacy issues and is currently capitalized in excess of the minimum maintenance amount required by regulators. 

In 2013, we launched two business development companies which entities are subject to all relevant provisions under the 1940 Act as registered investment companies. In 2015, we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary of one of the business development companies, which operates as a collateralized loan obligation issuer. 

In 2011, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act amended the Commodity Exchange Act to expand the CFTC&#8217;s regulatory jurisdiction with respect to certain derivative instruments, including swaps. In 2012, the CFTC rescinded an exemption from CFTC registration traditionally relied upon by private fund managers, narrowed an exception related to registered investment companies and amended related rules and guidance. As a result of these changes, managers of certain pooled investment vehicles with exposure in commodity interests now may be required to register with the CFTC as commodity pool operators (&#8220;CPOs&#8221;) and/or commodity trading advisors (&#8220;CTAs&#8221;) and become members of the National 

Futures Association (the &#8220;NFA&#8221;). As such, certain of our or our subsidiaries&#8217; risk management or other commodities interest-related activities may be subject to CFTC oversight. Consequently, certain CFTC rules expose alternative asset managers, such as us, to increased registration and reporting requirements in connection with transactions in futures, swaps and other derivatives regulated by the CFTC. Consequently, each of CGMSIM, DGAM, ESG, Emerging Sovereign Partners LLC (&#8220;ESP&#8221;) and Carlyle Commodity Management, L.L.C. ("CCM") is a NFA member and is registered with the CFTC as a CPO and/or CTA. In addition, certain Carlyle personnel are registered with the CFTC as Principals of certain of these entities. These regulations have required us to reassess certain business practices related to our pooled vehicles, consider registration of additional entities with the CFTC or file for additional exemptions from such registration requirements. In addition, as a result of their commodities interest-related activities, certain of our entities also may be subject to a wide range of other regulatory requirements, such as: 

&#8226; 

potential compliance with certain commodities interest position limits or position accountability rules; 

&#8226; 

administrative requirements, including recordkeeping, confirmation of transactions and reconciliation of trade data; and 

&#8226; 

mandatory central clearing and collateral requirements. 

In addition, many Carlyle vehicles are subject to the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;) Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (&#8220;FATCA&#8221;) tax regulations intended to address tax compliance issues associated with U.S. taxpayers with foreign accounts. FATCA requires &#8220;foreign financial institutions&#8221; to report to the IRS information about financial accounts held by U.S. taxpayers and imposes due diligence, withholding, documentation and reporting requirements on such entities. In many instances, however, the precise nature of the FATCA-related requirements to which Carlyle is subject is governed by bilateral Intergovernmental Agreements (&#8220;IGAs&#8221;) between the United States and the countries in which Carlyle does business. Among other things, FATCA could subject investors within certain Carlyle funds to additional tax withholding. 

United Kingdom and the European Union 

CECP Advisors LLP (&#8220;CECP&#8221;), one of our subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (the &#8220;FCA&#8221;). CECP operates in accordance with the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the &#8220;FSMA&#8221;), which is the United Kingdom&#8217;s implementing legislation for the European Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (&#8220;MiFID&#8221;). CECP has permission to engage in a number of corporate finance activities regulated under the FSMA, including advising on, and arranging deals in relation to certain types of, investments. CECP is only permitted to carry out these activities in relation to eligible counterparties and professional clients. CECP has registered a branch office in Ireland in connection with Carlyle&#8217;s investment activities in that country. CELF Advisors LLP (&#8220;CELF&#8221;), another one of our subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, is also authorized and regulated by the FCA under the FSMA and has permission to engage in a number of activities regulated under the FSMA, including making arrangements with a view to transactions in investments, advising on, managing and arranging deals in relation to certain types of investments, dealing in investments as agent and arranging safeguarding and administration of assets. CELF is only permitted to carry out these activities in relation to eligible counterparties and professional clients. The FSMA and related rules govern most aspects of investment businesses, including sales, research and trading practices, provision of investment advice, corporate finance, use and safekeeping of client funds and securities, record keeping, margin practices and procedures, approval standards for individuals, anti-money laundering, periodic reporting and settlement procedures. 

The FSMA says that any firm or individual which carries out a regulated activity in the United Kingdom must be authorized or regulated by the FCA, unless they are exempt. The FCA is responsible monitoring regulated entities&#8217; compliance with the FSMA. Violations of these requirements may result in censures, fines, imposition of additional requirements, injunctions, restitution orders, revocation or modification of permissions or registrations, the suspension or expulsion from certain &#8220;controlled functions&#8221; within the financial services industry of officers or employees performing such functions or other similar consequences. 

Similar to the United States, jurisdictions outside the United States in which we operate, in particular Europe, have become subject to extensive further regulation. Governmental regulators and other authorities in Europe have proposed or implemented a number of initiatives and additional rules and regulations that could adversely affect our business. Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to compliance requirements in connection with the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (the &#8220;AIFMD&#8221;), which generally became effective in countries across the European Economic Area (the &#8220;EEA&#8221;) in 2014. The AIFMD imposes significant regulatory requirements on alternative investment fund managers operating or marketing funds to investors within the EEA, as well as prescribing certain conditions with regard to regulatory standards, cooperation and transparency that must be satisfied for non-EEA fund managers to market or manage alternative investment funds into EEA jurisdictions. Authorization under the AIFMD is currently available only to EEA fund managers. One of Carlyle&#8217;s subsidiaries, AlpInvest, obtained such authorization in 2015. As such, AlpInvest is now a licensed as an alternative investment fund manager under the AIFMD by the Authority for Financial Markets in the Netherlands (the &#8220;AFM&#8221;). AlpInvest is also 

licensed by the AFM to provide investment management services under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. Carlyle&#8217;s other subsidiaries that manage or market alternative investment funds in the EEA do so in accordance with the national private placement regimes of the various EEA jurisdictions. Compliance with the AIFMD&#8217;s requirements may restrict Carlyle&#8217;s fund marketing strategy and will place additional compliance obligations in the form of remuneration policies, capital requirements, reporting requirements, leverage oversight and liquidity management. 

Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various aspects of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (&#8220;EMIR&#8221;). Among other things, EMIR imposes a set of requirements on European Union derivatives activities, including risk mitigation, risk management, regulatory reporting and margin and clearing requirements. Given the global scale of the derivatives activity of various Carlyle entities, the various regulatory regimes to which Carlyle is subject could result in duplication of administration and increased transaction costs related to such derivatives activities. 

As outlined above, certain of our European subsidiaries must comply with the pan-European regime established by MiFID, which regulates the provision of investment services and conduct of investment activities throughout the EEA. MiFID sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. It also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements. A review of MiFID by the European regulators has led to the creation of a replacement directive and a new draft regulation (together &#8220;MiFID II&#8221;) which is currently scheduled to become effective in 2017, although a delay to this implementation date is currently being discussed. When effective, MiFID II will enhance numerous aspects of MiFID and will impose many new compliance requirements on CECP and CELF. 

Other Jurisdictions 

Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to registration and compliance with laws and regulations of non-U.S. governments, their respective agencies and/or various self-regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to, among other things, investment advisory services and the marketing of investment products, and any failure to comply with these regulations could expose us to liability and/or damage our reputation. Certain of our private funds are also required to comply with the trading and disclosure rules and regulations of non-U.S. securities regulators. 

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (the &#8220;OECD&#8221;) has developed Common Reporting Standard (&#8220;CRS&#8221;) rules for the automatic exchange of FATCA-like financial account information amongst OECD member states. Like FATCA, CRS will impose certain due diligence, documentation and reporting requirements on various Carlyle entities. While CRS does not contain a potential withholding requirement, non-compliance could subject Carlyle to certain reputational harm.

In addition, we and/or our affiliates and subsidiaries may become subject to additional regulatory demands in the future to the extent we expand our investment advisory business in existing and new jurisdictions. There are also a number of pending or recently enacted legislative and regulatory initiatives in the United States and around the world that could significantly impact our business. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Company- Extensive regulation in the United States and abroad affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties,&#8221; &#8220;-Regulatory changes in the United States could adversely affect our business and the possibility of increased regulatory focus could result in additional burdens and expenses on our business&#8221; and &#8220;-Recent regulatory changes in jurisdictions outside the United States could adversely affect our business.&#8221; 

Our businesses have operated for many years within a framework that requires our being able to monitor and comply with a broad range of legal and regulatory developments that affect our activities and we take our obligation to comply with all such laws, regulations and internal policies seriously. Our reputation depends on the integrity and business judgment of our employees and we strive to maintain a culture of compliance throughout the firm. We have developed, and adhere to, compliance policies and procedures such as codes of conduct, compliance systems, education and communication of compliance matters. These policies focus on matters such as insider trading, anti-corruption, document retention, conflicts of interest and other matters. Our legal and compliance team monitors our compliance with all of the legal and regulatory requirements to which we are subject and manages our compliance policies and procedures. Our legal and compliance team also monitors the information barriers that we maintain to restrict the flow of confidential information, including material, nonpublic information, across our business. Our enterprise risk management function analyzes our operations and investment strategies to identify key risks facing the firm and works closely with the legal and compliance team to address them. The firm also has an independent and objective internal audit department that employs a risk-based audit approach that focuses on Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, enterprise risk management functions and other areas of perceived risk and aims to give management and the board of directors of our general partner reasonable assurance that our risks are well managed and controls are appropriate and effective.
