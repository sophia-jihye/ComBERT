 Item 1. Business 

Our customers have bold aspirations&#8212;the drive to be their own boss, write their own story and take a leap of faith to pursue their dreams. Launching that brewery, running that wedding planning service, organizing that fundraiser, expanding that web-design business or whatever sparks their passion. We are inspired by our customers, and are dedicated to helping them turn their powerful ideas into meaningful action. Our vision is to radically shift the global economy toward small business by empowering passionate individuals to easily start, confidently grow and successfully run their own ventures. 

Overview 

Our 13.8 million &#32;customers are people and organizations with vibrant ideas&#8212;businesses, both large and small, entrepreneurs, universities, charities and hobbyists. They are defined by their guts, grit and determination to transform their ideas into something meaningful. They wear many hats and juggle many responsibilities, and they need to make the most of their time. Our customers need help navigating today&#8217;s dynamic Internet environment and want the benefits of the latest technology to help them succeed. Since our founding in 1997, we have been a trusted partner and champion for organizations of all sizes in their quest to build successful online ventures. 

We are a leading technology provider to small businesses, web design professionals and individuals, delivering simple, easy to use cloud-based products and outcome-driven, personalized Customer Care. We operate the world&#8217;s largest domain marketplace, where our customers can find that unique piece of digital real estate perfectly matching their idea. We provide website building, hosting and security tools to help customers easily construct and protect their online presence. As our customers grow, we provide applications and access to relevant third party products helping them connect to their customers, manage and grow their businesses and get found online. 

Our customers need help navigating today&#8217;s dynamic Internet environment and want the benefits of the latest technology to help them succeed. The increase in broadband penetration, mobile device usage and the need for presence across search engines, content destinations, listings and e-commerce sites, and social media channels create both opportunities and challenges for them. We offer products and solutions to help our customers tackle this rapidly changing technology landscape. We develop the majority of our products internally and believe our solutions are among the best in the industry in terms of comprehensiveness, performance, functionality and ease of use. 

Often technology companies force their customers to choose between technology and support, delivering one but not the other. At GoDaddy, we don't believe our customers should have to choose and strive to deliver both great technology and great support to our customers. We believe engaging with our customers in a proactive, consultative way helps them knock down the technology hurdles they face. And, through the thousands of conversations we have with our customers every day, we receive valuable feedback enabling us to continually evolve our products and solutions. 

Our people and unique culture have been integral to our success. We live by the same principles that enable new ventures to survive and thrive: hard work, perseverance, conviction, an obsession with customer satisfaction and a belief that no one can do it better. We take responsibility for driving successful outcomes and are accountable to our customers, which we believe has been a key factor in enabling our rapid customer and revenue growth. We believe we have one of the most recognized brands in technology. 

Our Size and Scale 

Our combination of easy to use, cloud-based products, personalized Customer Care, a powerful brand and a unique culture have helped us build an attractive business with strong financial performance. 

&#8226; 

We are the global market leader in domain name registration&#8212;a key on-ramp to establishing a business online in our connected economy&#8212;with approximately 62 million &#32;domains under management as of December 31, 2015 . According to VeriSign&#8217;s Domain Name Industry Brief, we had 20% &#32;of the world&#8217;s domains registered as of September 30, 2015 . 

&#8226; 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 13.8 million &#32;customers and added 1.1 million &#32;customers in 2015 . 

&#8226; 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had more than 700,000 &#32;customers who each spent more than $500 &#32;a year. 

&#8226; 

In each of the five years ended December 31, 2015 , our customer retention rate exceeded 85% &#32;and our retention rate for customers who had been with us for over three years was approximately 90% . 

&#8226; 

In 2015 , we generated $1.9 billion &#32;in total bookings, up 14.3% &#32;(or approximately 17.5% &#32;on a constant currency basis) from $1.7 billion &#32;in 2014 . In 2015 , we had $1.6 billion &#32;of revenue, up 15.9% &#32;(or approximately 17.3% &#32;on a constant currency basis) from $1.4 billion &#32;in 2014 . 

&#8226; 

As of December 31, 2015 , we provided localized solutions in 37 &#32;countries, 44 &#32;currencies and 17 languages. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , 26% &#32;of our total bookings were attributable to customers outside of the United States. 

&#8226; 

Our highly-rated Customer Care team of more than 3,800 &#32;specialists is focused on providing high-quality, personalized care. As a result of their ongoing dialogue with customers, our Customer Care team also drives bookings and in 2015 &#32;generated approximately 24% &#32;of our total bookings. 

&#8226; 

Our net loss was $120.4 million &#32;and $146.1 million &#32;in 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. We generated $337.4 million &#32;of adjusted EBITDA in 2015 , up from $271.5 million &#32;in 2014 . 

Our Market 

Our customers represent a large and diverse market which we believe is largely underserved. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, there were approximately 28 million &#32;small businesses in 2012 . Based on data from the 2012 U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Small Business Administration, over 85% &#32;of small businesses have fewer than five &#32;employees and approximately 23 million , or over 75% &#32;of, small businesses were non-employer firms. Furthermore, according to the International Labor Organization Statistics Database there were more than 200 million people outside the United States identified as self-employed in 2012 . Moreover, the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity report estimates that in 2015 there were approximately 530,000 &#32;new business owners created each month in the United States. We believe our addressable market extends beyond small businesses and includes individuals and organizations, such as universities, charities and hobbyists. 

Despite the ubiquity and importance of the Internet to individual consumers, many small businesses and organizations have remained offline given their limited resources and inadequate tools. We believe approximately 60% &#32;of small businesses do not have a website. However, as proliferation of mobile devices blurs the online/offline distinction into an "always online" world, having an impactful online presence is becoming a "must have" for small businesses worldwide. 

What it means for small businesses and ventures to be online continues to evolve. Only a few years ago, an online presence typically consisted of a simple and static website with basic information, perhaps supported by limited search engine marketing. Today, having an effective online presence requires much more, including a content rich website viewable from any device; presence on social media sites and an increasing number of horizontal and vertical marketplaces (e.g. Yelp and OpenTable); branded email communication; online marketing; and Internet-enabled reservation and scheduling capabilities. In addition, back-end activities such as invoicing, payment processing, accounting and tax preparation, which are typically separate point solutions, can now increasingly be linked to the front-end. 

The shift toward dynamic online presence for small business has been fueled by the emergence of simple&#8212;yet powerful&#8212;cloud-based technologies that can easily be utilized by individuals with limited technical skills. Cloud technologies have helped enable the integration of front and back-end activities. Cloud-based products, which can be "rented" on a monthly or yearly basis, allow a business to more easily scale from a nascent idea to a thriving venture. The Parallels SMB Cloud Insights for Global 2014 report estimates the cloud market for small business was $62 billion &#32;in 2013 , and will double by 2016 , growing to $125 billion . 

Our Customers 

Our customers share common traits, such as tenacity and determination, yet their specific needs vary depending on the type and stage of their ventures. They range from individuals who are thinking about starting a business to established ventures that are up and running but need help attracting customers, growing their sales, managing their business or expanding their operations. While our customers have differing degrees of resources and technical capabilities, they all share a desire to bring their ideas to life. We call them GoGetters and they are united by a number of common characteristics: entrepreneurial spirit, strong work ethic and, above all, passion for their ventures. 

Our target customers are primarily local service-based businesses. Most of our customers have fewer than five &#32;employees and most identify themselves as having little to no technology skills. They need our help to give their businesses a unique and secure digital identity and tools to help them stay connected with their customers. 

To serve our customers well at every phase of their business, we group them into multiple stages of growth, starting with "nascent" and evolving to "established and content." We have also identified special groups like the "digital commerce" group which is made up of web-savvy individuals who utilize digital commerce platforms as their primary business vehicles. We also serve a group of customers consisting of web-designers and web-developers&#8212;who we call "Web Pros"&#8212;who are in the business of building, designing and managing the online presence of others. Each of these groups is unique in their needs, and we personalize our solutions to meet them at each stage in their lifecycle. 

Our Opportunity&#8212;What the GoGetter Needs 

Our customers are consumers themselves and use the Internet to get informed, research and shop for solutions, which makes them keenly aware of the need to have an impactful online presence. While our customers&#8217; needs change depending on where they are in their lifecycle, the most common customer needs we serve include: 

&#8226; 

Getting online and looking great . Our customers want to find a name perfectly identifying their business, hobby or passion. Once they have a name, they want to create a digital identity so their customers can find, engage and transact with them online. We believe a complete digital identity includes an elegant, mobile-enabled website and the ability to get found across various search engines, social media platforms and vertical marketplaces. 

&#8226; 

Growing their business and running their operations . Our customers need to communicate with their existing customers and find new customers. They also need tools to help them run their businesses, from productivity and marketing tools to getting paid and balancing their books. In today&#8217;s online world, these activities are increasingly linked to a customer&#8217;s online presence. 

&#8226; 

Easy to use products with help from a real person when needed . Our customers want easy-to-use products and sometimes they need help from real people to set up their website, launch a new feature or try something new. We build products that are intuitive for beginners to use, yet robust and feature-rich to address the needs of expert designers and power-users. We also provide high quality, consultative Customer Care and advise our customers as needed. 

&#8226; 

Technology that grows with them . Our customers need a simple platform and set of tools enabling their domain, website and other solutions to easily work together as their business grows and becomes more complex, and they need that platform to be simple to manage. The right platform can meet the needs of both an entrepreneur who is not technologically savvy and a Web Pro with a more complex set of requirements. 

&#8226; 

Reliability, security and performance . Our customers expect reliable products and want to be confident their digital presence is secure. Our customers work on their businesses whenever and however they can and need solutions fitting their lifestyle and schedule. 

&#8226; 

Affordable solutions . Our customers often have limited financial resources and are unable to make large, upfront investments in the latest technology. Our customers need affordable solutions leveling the playing field and giving them the tools to look and act like bigger businesses. 

Our Solution&#8212;What We Do and How We Do It 

We built GoDaddy to serve the GoGetter by providing elegant, easy to use, cloud-based products wrapped with personalized Customer Care. Our customers turn to us in order to: 

&#8226; 

Get a great domain name . Every great idea needs a great name. Staking a claim with a domain name has become the de facto first step in establishing an idea and presence online. When inspiration strikes, we are there to provide our customers with high-quality search, discovery and recommendation tools as well as the broadest selection of domains to help them find the right name for their venture. 

&#8226; 

Turn their domain into a dynamic online presence . Our products enable anyone to build an elegant website or online store, for both desktop and mobile, regardless of technical skill. Our products, powered by a unified cloud 

platform, enable our customers to get found online by extending their website and its content to where they need to be, from search engine results (e.g. Google) to social media (e.g. Facebook) to vertical marketplaces (e.g. Yelp and FourSquare), all from one location. For more technically-sophisticated web designers, developers and customers, we provide high-performance, flexible hosting and security products that can be used with a variety of open source design tools. We design these solutions to be easy to use, effective, reliable, flexible and a great value. 

&#8226; 

Add back-office and marketing products . Our customers want to spend their time on what matters most to them, selling their products or services or helping their customers do the same. We provide them with productivity tools such as domain-specific email, online storage, invoicing and payment solutions to help run their ventures as well as robust marketing products, such as email marketing, to attract and retain customers. 

&#8226; 

Use our products together in a solution that grows with our customers over time . Our API-driven technology platform is built on state-of-the-art, open source technologies like Hadoop, OpenStack and other large-scale, distributed systems. Simply put, we believe our products work well together and are more valuable and easier to use together than if our customers purchased these products individually from other companies and tried to integrate them. Additionally, our platform allows our developers to innovate new and enhanced products or product features assembled from common building blocks leading to faster deployment cycles. 

&#8226; 

Receive assistance from our highly-rated Customer Care team . Our Customer Care team consists of more than 3,800 &#32;specialists who are available 24/7/365 and are capable of providing care to customers with different levels of technical sophistication. Our specialists are evaluated on customer outcomes and the quality of the experience they provide, not other common measures like handle time and cost per call. We strive to provide high-quality, personalized care and deliver a distinctive experience helping us create loyal customers who renew their subscriptions, purchase additional products and refer their family and friends to us. 

&#8226; 

Utilize a reliable, secure, global technology platform and infrastructure . In 2015 , we handled on average more than 15.2 billion &#32;DNS queries per day and hosted approximately 10 million &#32;websites on servers located throughout our worldwide data centers. We focus on online security, customer privacy and reliable infrastructure to address the evolving needs of our customers. 

&#8226; 

Receive high value . We price most of our products at a few dollars per month while providing our customers with robust features and functionality. We believe our high-quality products and personalized Customer Care provide our customers with an affordable bridge between their available resources and their aspirations.

According to VeriSign&#8217;s Domain Name Industry Brief, we held over 20% &#32;of the more than 299 million &#32;worldwide domain names under management as of September 30, 2015.

Our investment in technology and development and our data science capabilities enable us to innovate and deliver a personalized experience to our customers. 

&#8226; 

We operate an industry-leading Customer Care team that also drives bookings . We give our customers much more than typical customer support. Our team is unique, blending personalized Customer Care with the ability to evaluate our customers&#8217; needs, which allows us to help and advise them as well as drive incremental bookings for our business. Our Customer Care team contributed approximately 24% &#32;of our total bookings in 2015 . Our customers respond to our personalized approach with high marks for customer satisfaction. Our proactive Customer Care model is a key component helping create a long-term customer relationship, which is reflected in our high retention rates. 

&#8226; 

Our brand and marketing efficiency . We believe GoDaddy is one of the most recognized technology brands in the United States. Through a combination of cost-effective direct-marketing, brand advertising and customer referrals, 

we have increased our total customers from 9.4 million &#32;as of December 31, 2011 &#32;to 13.8 million &#32;as of December 31, 2015 . 

&#8226; 

Our financial model . Our stable and predictable business model is driven by efficient customer acquisition, high customer retention rates and increasing lifetime spend. In each of the five &#32;years ended December 31, 2015 , our customer retention rate exceeded 85% &#32;and our retention rate for customers who had been with us for over three &#32;years was approximately 90% . We believe the breadth and depth of our product offerings and the high quality and responsiveness of our Customer Care team builds strong relationships with our customers and are keys to our high level of customer retention. 

&#8226; 

Our people and our culture . We are a company whose people embody the grit and determination of our customers. Our world-class engineers, scientists, designers, marketers and Customer Care specialists share a passion for technology and its ability to change our customers&#8217; lives. We value hard work, extraordinary effort, living passionately, taking intelligent risks and working together toward successful customer outcomes. Our relentless pursuit of doing right for our customers has been a crucial ingredient to our growth. 

&#8226;

&#8226; 

In 2015 , we generated $1.9 billion &#32;in total bookings up from $1.1 billion &#32;in 2011 , representing a CAGR, of 15% . 

&#8226; 

In 2015 , we had $1.6 billion &#32;of revenue up from $862.9 million &#32;in 2011 , representing a CAGR of 17% . 

&#8226; 

In the five years ended December 31, 2015 , we invested to support our growth with $1.1 billion &#32;and $ 764.1 million &#32;in technology and development expenses and marketing and advertising expenses, respectively. 

Our Strategy&#8212;How We Grow 

We are pursuing the following principal strategies to drive our business: 

&#8226; 

Expand and innovate our product offerings . Our product innovation priorities include: 

&#8226; 

Delivering the next generation of naming . The first generation of naming included a limited set of gTLDs, such as .com and .net, and country code top-level domains (ccTLDs), such as .uk and .in. With over 299 million &#32;existing domains registered, it may be increasingly difficult for customers to find the name best suiting their needs. As a result, ICANN has authorized the introduction of more than 1,300 &#32;new gTLDs, which began in late 2013 and will continue over the next several years. These newly introduced gTLDs include names geared toward professions (e.g. .photography), personal interests (e.g. .guru), and geographies (e.g. .london, .nyc and .vegas) and are just plain fun (e.g. .ninja). Additionally, we believe there is great potential in the emerging secondary market to match buyers to sellers who already own domains. In January 2016, we launched the GoDaddy Investor mobile application to help investors watch and bid on domains at auction and stay on top of their current bids, all from their mobile device. We continue to invest in search, discovery and recommendation tools and transfer protocols for the combined markets of primary and secondary domains. 

&#8226; 

Powering elegant and effortless presence . We continue to invest in tools, templates and technology to make the process of building a professional looking mobile or desktop website simple and easy. Additionally, we are investing in products helping our customers drive their customer acquisition efforts by managing their presence across search engines, social networks and vertical marketplaces. 

&#8226; 

Making the business of business easy . Our business applications range from domain-specific email and email marketing to payment tools and help our customers grow their ventures. We intend to continue investing in the breadth of our product offerings helping our customers connect with their customers and run their businesses. 

&#8226; 

Win the Web Pros . We are investing in our end-to-end Web Pro offerings ranging from open APIs to our platform, delegation products and administrative tools as well as dedicated Customer Care resources. Our acquisition of Media Temple and launch of GoDaddy Pro further expanded our Web Pro offerings, bolstered our Web Pro-focused Customer Care team and extended our reach into the Web Pro community. 

&#8226; 

Go global . As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 31% &#32;of our customers were located in international markets, notably Canada, India and the United Kingdom. We began investing in the localization of our service offerings in 

markets outside of the United States in 2012 &#32;and, as of December 31, 2015 , we offered localized products and Customer Care in 37 &#32;countries, 44 &#32;currencies and 17 &#32;languages. To support our international growth, we will continue investing to develop our local capabilities across products, marketing programs, data centers and Customer Care. 

&#8226; 

Partner up . Our flexible platform also enables us to acquire companies and quickly launch new products for our customers, including the launch of a series of partnerships ranging from Microsoft Office 365 for email to PayPal for payments. We have also acquired companies and technologies to complement our product offerings. We intend to continue identifying technology acquisition targets and partnership opportunities that add value for our customers. 

&#8226; 

Make it personal . We seek to leverage data and insights to personalize the product and Customer Care experiences of our customers as well as tailor our solutions and marketing efforts to each of our customer groups. We are constantly seeking to improve our website, marketing programs and Customer Care to intelligently reflect where customers are in their lifecycle and identify their specific product needs. We intend to continue investing in our technology and data platforms to further enable our personalization efforts. 

&#8226; 

Wrap it with Care . We believe our highly-rated Customer Care team is distinctive and essential to the lifetime value proposition we offer our customers. We continue to invest in our Customer Care team, including investing to improve the quality of our Customer Care resources as well as to introduce improved tools and processes across our expanding global footprint. 

Products 

We have designed and developed an extensive set of easy to use, cloud-based technology products enabling our customers to establish a digital presence, connect with their customers and manage their business operations. We understand our customers&#8217; needs vary depending on the type and stage of their venture, which is why we offer our products both independently and bundled as suites of integrated products designed for specific activities. 

Our domain name registration product enables us to engage customers at the initial stage of establishing a digital identity and acts as an on-ramp for our hosting, presence and business application products. We believe our hosting, presence and business application products increase our revenue and margin growth opportunities, frequently serve as starting points for our customer relationships, improve customer retention and significantly improve our value proposition to customers. 

Domains 

We are the global market leader in domain name registration. Securing a domain is a necessary first step to creating a digital identity and our domain products often serve as the starting point in our customer relationships. As of December 31, 2015 , more than 93% &#32;of our customers had purchased a domain from us, and as of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 62 million domains under management. In 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we generated approximately 52% , 55% &#32;and 59% &#32;of our total revenue, respectively, from sales of our domain products. 

Our primary domains product offerings are: 

Primary Registrations . Using our website or mobile application, we offer customers the ability to search for and register available domain names, or primary registrations, with the relevant registry. Our inventory for primary registrations is defined by the number of TLDs we offer. As of December 31, 2015 , 367 &#32;different gTLDs, such as .com, .net and .org, and 50 &#32;different ccTLDs, such as .de, .ca, .in and .jp. were available for purchase through our primary registration product. New gTLDs launched in 2013 include names geared toward professions (e.g. .photography), personal interests (e.g. .guru), and geographies (e.g. .london, .nyc and .vegas) and are just plain fun (e.g. .ninja). As of December 31, 2015 , 357 &#32;new gTLD offerings were available for purchase through our primary registration product. These new gTLDs make it easier for companies and individuals to find and register new, easy-to-remember domain names tailored to their business, industry or interests that may not have been available in the relatively crowded, traditional gTLDs such as .com. ccTLDs are important to our international expansion efforts as we have found international customers often prefer the ccTLD for the country or geographic market in which they operate. Our primary registration offering relies heavily on our search, discovery and recommendation tools which enable our customers to find a name matching their needs. 

Domain Name Add-Ons . Domain name add-ons are features a customer can add to a domain name registration. Our domain name privacy product allows our customers to register a domain name on an "unlisted" basis. This product helps prevent privacy intrusions, helps deter domain related spam and allows our customers to confidentially secure a domain for an unannounced product, service or idea. Domain name add-ons are typically purchased concurrently with domain name registrations and have minimal costs associated with their delivery. 

A ftermarket . We operate the world&#8217;s largest domain aftermarket which processes aftermarket, or secondary, domain name sales. Our aftermarket platform, which we substantially supplemented through our acquisition of Afternic in 2013, is designed to enable the seamless purchase and sale of an already registered domain name through an online auction, an offer and counter-offer transaction or a "buy now" transaction. In 2015 , we acquired approximately 278,000 &#32;premium domain names to increase the inventory available to our customers. In January 2016, we launched the GoDaddy Investor mobile application to help investors watch and bid on domains at auction and stay on top of their current bids, all from their mobile device. We operate a cross-registrar network that automates transaction execution across registrars thereby reducing the time required to complete a transaction. We receive a percentage of the sales price for each domain sold. 

Hosting and Presence 

We offer a variety of hosting and presence products enabling our customers to create and manage their digital identity, or in the case of Web Pros, the digital identities of their end-customers. As of December 31, 2015 , we hosted approximately 10 million &#32;websites. In 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we derived approximately 37% , 37% &#32;and 34% &#32;of our total revenue, respectively, from sales of our hosting and presence products. 

Our primary hosting products are: 

Shared Website Hosting . The term "shared hosting" refers to the housing of multiple websites on the same server and is our most popular hosting product. We operate, maintain and support shared website hosting in our owned and operated data center and our leased co-located data center facilities using either Linux or Windows operating systems. We currently offer three tiers of shared website hosting plans to suit the needs and resources of our customers, all of which use industry standard cPanel or Parallels Plesk control panels. We also bundle our hosting plans with a variety of applications and products such as web analytics and SSL certificates. 

Website Hosting on Virtual Dedicated Servers and Dedicated Servers . Our virtual dedicated and dedicated servers provide customers with greater control and higher performance than our shared hosting plans. Our virtual dedicated hosting offering utilizes software to partition a single physical server allowing it to function as multiple servers. Our dedicated server offering provides customers with a server reserved exclusively for their use. Both of these products are designed to meet the requirements of customers with more advanced technical capabilities and needs by providing the customer with full control of and electronic access to their server. We offer customers the ability to tailor their plan based on a range of hardware, performance, storage, bandwidth, operating system and control features. 

Managed Hosting . With our managed hosting product, we set up, monitor, maintain, secure and patch the dedicated server for the customer so our managed hosting customers get the benefits of a dedicated server without the responsibility of actually running the server. We can also install and maintain a variety of web applications such as WordPress, Joomla, Magento and Gallery on behalf of our customers upon request. We offer a variety of managed hosting plans tailored to our customers&#8217; needs as well as our Expert Hands offering, which provides additional custom support services at an hourly rate. 

Security . Our security products include SSL certificates and malware scanners. According to Netcraft, we are the world&#8217;s third largest provider of SSL certificates. An SSL certificate validates a customer&#8217;s website identity and encrypts online transactional information, such as credit card information, and communications sent to or by the website. We offer a variety of SSL certificates all of which provide high-grade, 256-bit encryption. Our SSL certificate offerings include multiple domain SSLs and "wildcard" SSL certificates, which secure a singular website URL as well as subdomains on that URL (e.g. protectmyvisitors.com and cart.protectmyvisitors.com). We also offer "code signing certificates" designed to prove the identity of software authors and validate that the software has not been tampered with since its original distribution. 

Cloud Services and Cloud Applications . Our cloud servers are a non-managed cloud product built on our OpenStack platform. Cloud servers allow our customers to easily create and manage servers on their own and pay for only the resources they 

actually use. Our cloud applications product is designed to be a flexible solution, supporting over 100 popular open source applications and technology stacks that can be "right sized" in order to meet our customers' needs. 

Our primary presence products are: 

Website Builder . Our Website Builder is an easy to use, do it yourself online tool enabling customers, irrespective of their technical skills, to build elegant websites. We offer a variety of plans, with pricing dependent on the number of available design styles and desired business and marketing features. With each of these plans, customers have access to hundreds of professional designs which can be further customized using our drag-and-drop editor by adding photos, graphics or text. Our designs cover a wide range of categories with professionally written content for small businesses, organizations, families, athletic teams, weddings, reunions and other interest groups. Once built, websites can be easily connected to social profiles, such as Facebook and Twitter, and optimized for search engines using Website Builder. Our customers are also able to receive a mobile-optimized version of their website through Website Builder.

Technology and Infrastructure 

Our technology platform forms the core of many of our solutions, and we have invested significantly to develop a platform designed to be intelligent, fast, secure and scalable. Our technology and development expenses, including those expenses related to our technology platform, were $270 million , $251 million &#32;and $206 million &#32;in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. We have built a scalable platform allowing us to provide faster business insights at lower costs, develop and introduce new products quickly and leverage economies of scale to reduce costs and enable next-generation hosting architecture. Our technology stack, which includes physical infrastructure, Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service, applications and data science, allows our customers to build and manage their digital identities and enable access across multiple devices. We seek to continuously enhance the performance and reliability of our technology infrastructure by investing in faster data centers, peering sites and local points of presence, both domestically and internationally. 

Physical infrastructure 

Our physical technology infrastructure includes servers located throughout nine data centers around the world. We have also invested significantly in our peering architecture and utilize multiple peering sites allowing us to handle high IP transit traffic at low bandwidth costs. Our large technology infrastructure footprint allows us to leverage economies of scale through low server, network, storage and processing costs by commoditizing hardware across various systems and leveraging virtualization where possible. 

Infrastructure-as-a-Service 

We leverage an Infrastructure-as-a-Service model geared toward the virtualization and automation of common physical data center components like servers, load balancers, switches and storage. We use open source solutions when possible to eliminate manual processes and thereby reduce the risk of human error as well as to lower costs. Additionally, we are beginning to use a single automated infrastructure based on OpenStack to enable next-generation hosting architecture. 

Platform-as-a-Service 

Our cloud platform offers our customers an integrated and comprehensive set of services saving them time. Our platform is designed to help us reduce costs, increase personalization and more easily and quickly build and deploy new products. We continuously invest to develop our platform capabilities and have recently deployed a new authentication platform allowing us to onboard new products more quickly and securely. We have also deployed Cassandra, an open source distributed database management system, across our datacenters for improved customer data replication enabling personalization. 

Applications 

Our platform is highly flexible which allows us to easily integrate third-party offerings and enhance our value proposition to our customers by offering comprehensive and integrated solutions that can be rapidly scaled up or down and used across multiple platforms, including mobile. Our platform also allows resellers to easily sell our products, thereby broadening our distribution. We seek to continuously launch new and relevant applications and streamline our existing offerings in order to provide the best user experience to our customers. 

Data science 

Our data collection technology enables us to collect customer, product and business data from various sources, including web crawling, local listings providers (e.g. Yelp and state business registrations), social platforms (e.g. Facebook and Twitter) and mobile platforms (e.g. geolocation and e-commerce). We use Hadoop, an open source software framework for storage and large-scale processing of data sets, to develop an integrated customer insights data platform. By integrating this data, we are able to offer personalized and intelligent insights and business intelligence to our customers that they can access via dashboards. These dashboards also enhance our ability to develop and deploy differentiated products and more intelligent Customer Care. We believe our ability to offer this insight helps us deliver the right solutions targeted to the needs of our customers and attract more businesses to our platform. 

Customer Care 

We have more than 3,800 &#32;Customer Care specialists who provide technical assistance on a 24/7/365 basis to new and existing customers located around the world. Operating as "business consultants," our specialists advise customers of products best suiting their individual needs. This ability to provide real-time product suggestions to customers after providing a world-class support experience allows our Customer Care team to provide an impactful contribution to bookings through the sale of product subscriptions, including domain products, hosting and presence offerings and business applications. Our Customer Care specialists take great pride in owning outcomes and being accountable to our customers, both of which are essential to enhancing customer experience. In each of the years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , at least 23% &#32;of our total bookings were generated from the sale of product subscriptions by our Customer Care team. The majority of our Customer Care specialists are located in our Arizona and Iowa facilities in the United States. We have additional specialists in Europe and India to provide in-region support in languages native to many of the regions we serve. In addition, our easy to use website contains extensive educational content designed to demystify the process of establishing an online presence and to assist customers in choosing the products best meeting their needs. 

Our Customer Care team has handled over 12 million &#32;contacts per year in each of the last three years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and spans a variety of channels to provide tailored and timely support to our customers. Our customers can choose their preferred Customer Care channel, including proactive and reactive chat and phone support. We take a consultative approach to our customers, acting as a trusted partner to guide them through the process with technical solutions supporting them at each phase of their lifecycle and offer real-time product suggestions best suited to the customers&#8217; needs. The effectiveness of our model is reflected in the high ratings we receive from our customers, the bookings generated by our Customer Care team and strong customer referrals. 

The strength of our Customer Care team is our people. Our hiring process is extensive and highly selective, designed to yield individuals who will thrive in our team based on core values, character, work ethic and ability. Our new Customer Care hires spend over a month moving from classroom to a live "nesting" environment where they refine their customer and technology skills. With a commitment to life-long learning, we offer over 400 classes to our employees spanning leadership, sales, service and technology. We have an incentive program that rewards outcomes, across both customer satisfaction and bookings goals. For that and many other reasons, as of December 31, 2015 , approximately 33% &#32;of our Customer Care specialists had been with us for at least three &#32;years. 

Marketing 

We believe GoDaddy is one of the most recognized technology brands in the United States. We have established this high level of brand awareness primarily through our advertising campaigns across various platforms including television commercials, print, online and billboards. We have supplemented these advertising campaigns with athlete and celebrity sponsorships. Our strong brand has helped us attract and retain 13.8 million customers as of December 31, 2015 . We intend to continue investing in our brand as we seek to further grow our total customers, particularly internationally. Customer referrals are another highly efficient and cost-effective channel for acquiring customers. 

We complement our brand marketing efforts with highly focused and metric-driven direct response marketing to acquire new customers. We use a variety of targeted online marketing programs for lead generation, including search engine marketing, search engine optimization and targeted email and social media marketing campaigns, as well as more traditional direct marketing and indirect channel partner marketing programs, to drive interest in our products and traffic to our websites. As part of this effort, we regularly run numerous campaigns simultaneously and constantly refine our media mix across our channels. 

International 

We have more than 4 million &#32;customers outside of the United States in approximately 250 &#32;countries. In 2015 , we derived 26% &#32;of our total bookings from international sales compared to 25% &#32;in 2014 &#32;and 24% &#32;in 2013 . Historically, we were primarily focused on the U.S. market and only offered international customers our U.S.-centric product offerings, without any localization or meaningful international marketing efforts. We believe our international scale and growth to date are indicative of the international growth opportunities available to us and position us to continue to grow our business internationally. 

We recently began devoting substantial, dedicated resources to growing our international presence. This led to the establishment of our Customer Care center in India in 2012 , the initial introduction of localized websites and products in 2013 &#32;and the expansion of these localized products and Customer Care to 37 &#32;countries, 44 &#32;currencies and 17 &#32;languages as of December 31, 2015 . Central to our international strategy is a philosophy of localizing our product offerings and deploying them through our global infrastructure. 

We built a team of more than 35 &#32;people to date who are responsible for the internationalization and localization of our core product offerings as well as our Customer Care and marketing efforts. In conjunction with our localization efforts, we have added on-the-ground regional teams and increased our country and regional specific marketing spend. These investments have enabled us to successfully launch our business in select international markets. Our success in these markets has furthered our belief that our international model can work in both established and emerging markets. We have taken a rigorous approach to managing the level of investment we expect to make in each geographic market we enter based on a market tier approach. We expect to continue to expand internationally, targeting additional markets in Europe, Asia and the Middle East over the next several years. 

Competition 

We provide cloud-based solutions enabling individuals, businesses and organizations to establish an online presence, connect with customers and manage their ventures. The market for providing these solutions is highly fragmented with some vendors providing part of the solution, and highly competitive with many existing competitors. These solutions are also rapidly evolving, creating opportunity for new competitors to enter the market with point product solutions or addressing specific segments of the market. In some instances, we have commercial partnerships with companies with which we also compete. Given our broad product portfolio, we compete with niche point-solution products and broader solution providers. Our competitors include providers of: 

&#8226; 

traditional domain registration services and web-hosting solutions such as Endurance, Rightside, United Internet and Web.com; 

&#8226; 

website creation and management solutions and e-commerce enablement providers such as Shopify, Squarespace, Wix and WordPress; 

&#8226; 

cloud-infrastructure services and online security providers such as Rackspace and Symantec; 

&#8226; 

alternative web presence and marketing solutions providers such as Constant Contact, OpenTable, Yelp and Zillow; and 

&#8226; 

productivity tools including business-class email, calendaring, file-sharing and payments such as Dropbox, Intuit, Square and Xero. 

We expect continued competition from competitors in the domain, hosting and presence markets such as Endurance, Rightside, United Internet and Web.com, as well as potential increased competition from companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft, all of which are providers of web-hosting and other cloud-based services and have recently entered the domain name registration business as upstream registries, and eBay and Facebook, both of which offer robust Internet marketing platforms. 

We believe the principal competitive factors include: product capabilities meeting customer requirements, a secure, reliable and integrated technology platform, cost-effective customer acquisition, brand awareness and reputation, customer service and support and overall customer satisfaction. We believe we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors. For additional information, see "Risk Factors." 

Regulation 

Our business is subject to regulation by ICANN, federal and state laws in the United States and the laws of other jurisdictions in which we do business. 

ICANN . The registration of domain names is governed by ICANN. ICANN is a multi-stakeholder private sector, not-for-profit corporation formed in 1998 operating pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with the U.S. Department of Commerce for the express purposes of overseeing a number of Internet related tasks, including managing the DNS, allocation of IP addresses, accreditation of domain name registrars and registries and the definition and coordination of policy development for all of these 

functions. We are accredited by ICANN as a domain name registrar and thus our ability to offer domain name registration products is subject to our ongoing relationship with and accreditation by ICANN. The regulation of Internet domain names in the United States and in foreign countries is subject to change. In particular, on March 14, 2014 , the NTIA announced its intention to transition key Internet domain name functions to the global multi-stakeholder community. At this time there is uncertainty concerning the timing, nature and significance of any transition from U.S. oversight of ICANN to oversight of ICANN by another body or bodies. 

ccTLD Authorities . The regulation of ccTLDs is governed by national regulatory agencies of the country underlying the specific ccTLDs, such as China (.cn), Canada (.ca) and the United Kingdom (.uk). Our ability to sell ccTLDs is dependent on our and our partners&#8217; ability to maintain accreditation in good standing with these various international authorities. 

Advertising and promotional information presented on our websites and in our products, and our other marketing and promotional activities, are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws regulating unfair and deceptive practices. U.S. federal, state, and foreign legislatures have also adopted laws and regulations regulating numerous other aspects of our business. Regulations relating to the Internet, including laws governing online content, user privacy, taxation, liability for third-party activities and jurisdiction, are particularly relevant to our business. Such laws and regulations are discussed below. 

Communications Decency Act . The CDA regulates content of material on the Internet, and provides immunity to Internet service providers and providers of interactive computer services for certain claims based on content posted by third parties. The CDA and the case law interpreting it generally provide that domain name registrars and website hosting providers cannot be liable for defamatory or obscene content posted by customers on their servers unless they participate in creating or developing the content. 

Digital Millennium Copyright Act . The DMCA provides domain name registrars and website hosting providers a safe harbor from liability for third-party copyright infringement. To qualify for the safe harbor, however, registrars and website hosting providers must satisfy numerous requirements, including adoption of a user policy providing for termination of service access of users who are repeat infringers, informing users of this policy, and implementing the policy in a reasonable manner. In addition, registrars and website hosting providers must expeditiously remove or disable access to content upon receiving a proper notice from a copyright owner alleging infringement of its protected works. A registrar or website hosting provider failing to comply with these safe harbor requirements may be found liable for copyright infringement. 

Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act . The ACPA was enacted to address piracy on the Internet by curtailing a practice known as "cybersquatting," or the bad-faith registration of a domain name identical or similar to another party&#8217;s trademark, or to the name of another living person, in order to profit from that name or mark. The ACPA provides that registrars may not be held liable for damages for registration or maintenance of a domain name for another person absent a showing of the registrar&#8217;s bad faith intent to profit. Registrars may, however, be held liable if their activities are deemed outside the scope of basic registrar functions. 

Lanham Act . The Lanham Act governs trademarks and false advertising. Case law interpreting the Lanham Act has limited liability for many online service providers such as search engines and domain name registrars. Nevertheless, there is no statutory safe harbor for trademark violations comparable to the provisions of the DMCA and we may be subject to a variety of trademark claims in the future. 

Privacy and Data Protection . In the areas of personal privacy and data protection, the U.S. federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on, and requirements associated with, the collection, distribution, use, storage, and security of personal information of individuals. If our practices with respect to the collection, distribution, storage, or security of personal information are challenged, we may not be able to demonstrate adequate compliance with existing or future laws or regulations. In addition, in the European Union member states and certain other countries outside the U.S., data protection is more highly regulated and rigidly enforced. As we conduct and expand our business within these countries, we expect compliance with these regulatory schemes to be more burdensome and costly for us. 

Laws and regulations relating to our activities are unsettled in many jurisdictions, or may prove difficult or impossible to comply with in some jurisdictions. Additionally, federal, state, local and foreign governments are also considering legislative and regulatory proposals that would regulate the Internet and our activities in more and different ways than exist today. It also is impossible to predict whether new taxes will be imposed on our services, and depending upon the type of such taxes, whether and 

how we would be affected. Laws and regulations in the United States or in foreign jurisdictions may be applied in new or different manners in pending or future litigation. Further, other existing bodies of law, including the criminal laws of various jurisdictions, may be deemed to apply to our activities, or new statutes or regulations may be adopted in the future. 

Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights 

Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our business. We rely on a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality and access-related procedures and safeguards and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technologies, confidential information, brands and other intellectual property. 

We have also developed, acquired or licensed proprietary technologies for use in our business. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;we had 164 &#32;issued patents in the United States covering various aspects of our product offerings. Additionally, as of December 31, 2015 , we had 211 &#32;pending U.S. patent applications and intend to file additional patent applications in the future. 

We have non-disclosure, confidentiality and license agreements with employees, contractors, customers and other third parties, which limit access to and use of our proprietary information. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, as well as various procedural safeguards, we believe the skill and ingenuity of our employees, the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions and our ability to introduce new products and features meeting the needs of our customers are more important to maintaining our competitive position in the marketplace. 

We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names and product names, taglines and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. We also have common law rights in some unregistered trademarks that were established over years of use. In addition, we have a trademark and service mark enforcement program pursuant to which we monitor applications filed by third parties to register trademarks and service marks that may be confusingly similar to ours, as well as the use of our major brand names in social media, domain names and other Internet sites. 

Despite our efforts to preserve and protect our intellectual property, unauthorized third parties may attempt to copy, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain access to our proprietary rights, and competitors may attempt to develop solutions that could compete with us in the markets we serve. Unauthorized disclosure of our confidential information or proprietary technologies by our employees or third parties could also occur. The risk of unauthorized use of our proprietary and intellectual property rights may increase as we continue to expand outside of the United States. 

Third-party infringement claims are also possible in our industry, especially as functionality and features expand, evolve and overlap across industries. Third parties, including non-practicing patent holders, have from time to time claimed, and could claim in the future, that our processes, technologies or websites infringe patents they now hold or might obtain or be issued in the future. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 4,761 &#32;employees worldwide, including 3,243 &#32;in our Customer Care team, 811 &#32;in technology and development, 132 &#32;in marketing and advertising and 575 &#32;in general and administrative. Excluded from our employee figures are more than 600 &#32;Customer Care specialists located in India and Belfast, Ireland who are directly employed by third-party partners, but who are devoted to GoDaddy on a full time basis. Substantially all of our employees are based in the United States. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or is party to any collective bargaining agreement in connection with his or her employment with us.
