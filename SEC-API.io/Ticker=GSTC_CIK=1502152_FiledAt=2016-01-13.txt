 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160;

First Titan Corp., a Nevada corporation, was incorporated on September 16, 2010. Our year-end is September 30. We were formed to design and manufacture both panel and engineered/tooled custom vacuum formed instrument panels and wiring harnesses, required for the monitoring of any final product that utilizes a gas or diesel engine source. The Company is currently primarily an oil and gas exploration company.

&#160;

On September 16, 2011, we created First Titan Energy, LLC to invest in oil and gas properties, greenfield projects and in the development of innovative exploration and production technologies.

&#160;

On September 16, 2011, we formed a new subsidiary company, First Titan Technical, LLC, to commence business operations designing and marketing automotive electronics custom-designed for heavy-duty vehicles.

&#160;

On May 15, 2015, we reincorporated from Florida to Nevada. As a result of the reincorporation, we effected a reverse split on June 30, 2015. Each shareholder in the Florida corporation received one share in the Nevada corporation for each 100 shares they held in the Florida corporation; fractional shares were rounded up to the nearest whole share and each shareholder received at least five shares.

&#160;

First Titan Energy&#8217;s oil and gas development activities include the following:

&#160;

Alabama &#8211; On May 2, 2012, we acquired a one percent working interest in one well in Little Cedar Creek Field in Alabama. This well was drilled during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 and we began receiving revenue during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2013. This well is located in the Little Cedar Field, Alabama&#8217;s largest producing oil field. This well is currently producing oil and natural gas from one well. 

&#160;

Louisiana &#8211; On January 3, 2012, we entered into a participation agreement in an oil and gas drilling project in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana (the &#8220;Participation Agreement&#8221;). The South Lake Charles Prospect is located seven miles south of the city of Lake Charles, Louisiana. It is a middle Oligocene age geo-pressured prospect located in the middle and lower hackberry sands. Under the terms of the Participation Agreement, we will participate in the drilling of one well and may participate in the drilling of future wells if it chooses. We will pay 25% of the drilling cost of the first well and will receive 13.59% of the net revenue from the well. We anticipate that our share of the total drilling and completion cost of the initial well, projected to be drilled to approximately 15,500 feet, will be $3.4 million. On August 12, 2013, the Participation Agreement was amended to reduce our working interest to 1.8%. As a result, our share of the drilling cost is expected to be approximately $181,000. The Company has paid $143,264 of its share of the costs of the well to date. We will receive 1.4% of the revenue from this well. The well began being drilled during the year ended September 30, 2014. During the year ended September 30, 2015, before the completion of the well, the well was damaged by a subcontractor working on the well. The operator of the well is in arbitration with the relevant subcontractors for compensation on the damage to the well. 

&#160;

Texas &#8211; On July 7, 2013, the Company acquired a 30% working interest in the Minns Project located in Waller County, Texas. The project included three producing wells and a salt water disposal well within the Brookshire Field. This well was reworked and deepened during the year ended September 30, 2014. It is currently producing oil from one well. 

In November 2015, the Company signed a letter of intent with a third-party that is in the business of acquiring midstream oil field equipment. The agreement provides a 90-day option period for the parties to conduct due diligence and determine the prospects of entering into a partnership, joint venture and/or investigating other strategic opportunities. 

In December 2015, the Company signed an oil, gas and minerals option for a property on the westernmost edge of the Barnett Shale in Texas. The Company will have 90 days to investigate the property before deciding whether or not to move forward with leasing and/or developing the property. 

&#160;

We have incurred losses since inception, have been issued a going concern opinion from our auditors, and rely upon the sale of our securities and debt financing to fund operations. We will need additional financing in order to continue operations.
