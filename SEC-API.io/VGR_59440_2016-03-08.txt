Tobacco Operations 

General. Liggett is the operating successor to Liggett &#38; Myers Tobacco Company, which was founded in 1873. Vector Tobacco is a discount cigarette manufacturer selling product in the deep discount category. In this report, certain references to &#8220;Liggett&#8221; refer to our tobacco operations, including the business of Liggett and Vector Tobacco, unless otherwise specified. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , Liggett was the fourth -largest manufacturer of cigarettes in the United States in terms of unit sales. Liggett&#8217;s manufacturing facilities are located in Mebane, North Carolina where it manufactures most of Vector 

Tobacco&#8217;s cigarettes pursuant to a contract manufacturing agreement. At the present time, Liggett and Vector Tobacco have no foreign operations. 

According to data from Management Science Associates, Inc., Liggett&#8217;s domestic shipments of approximately 8.7 billion &#32;cigarettes during 2015 &#32;accounted for 3.3% &#32;of the total cigarettes shipped in the United States during such year. Liggett&#8217;s market share decreased &#32; 0.1% &#32;in 2015 &#32;from 3.4% &#32;in 2014 . Market share in 2013 &#32;was 3.3% . Historically, Liggett produced premium cigarettes as well as discount cigarettes (which include among others, control label, private label, branded discount and generic cigarettes). Premium cigarettes are generally marketed under well-recognized brand names at higher retail prices to adult smokers with a strong preference for branded products, whereas discount cigarettes are marketed at lower retail prices to adult smokers who are more cost conscious. In recent years, the discounting of premium cigarettes has become far more significant in the marketplace. This has led to some brands that were traditionally considered premium brands becoming more appropriately categorized as branded discount, following list price reductions. Liggett&#8217;s EVE brand falls into that category. All of Liggett&#8217;s unit sales volume in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;was in the discount segment, which Liggett&#8217;s management believes has been the primary growth segment in the industry for more than a decade. 

Liggett produces cigarettes in 117 &#32;combinations of length, style and packaging. Liggett&#8217;s current brand portfolio includes: 

&#8226; 

EAGLE 20&#8217;s &#8212; a brand positioned in the deep discount segment for long-term growth re-launched as a national brand in 2013, 

&#8226; 

PYRAMID &#8212; the industry&#8217;s first deep discount product with a brand identity relaunched in the second quarter of 2009, 

&#8226; 

GRAND PRIX &#8212; re-launched as a national brand in 2005, 

&#8226; 

LIGGETT SELECT &#8212; a discount category brand originally launched in 1999, 

&#8226; 

EVE &#8212; a 120 millimeter cigarette in the branded discount category, and 

&#8226; 

USA and various Partner Brands and private label brands. 

In April 2009, Liggett repositioned PYRAMID as a box-only brand with a low price to specifically compete with brands which are priced at the lowest level of the deep discount segment. PYRAMID is now the largest seller in Liggett&#8217;s family of brands with 54.4% &#32;of Liggett&#8217;s unit volume in 2015 , 61.1% &#32;in 2014 &#32;and 65.5% &#32;in 2013 . In January 2013, Liggett repackaged and relaunched EAGLE 20&#8217;s to distributors and retailers on a national basis. EAGLE 20&#8217;s is marketed to compete with brands positioned in the deep discount segment. EAGLE 20&#8217;s represented 23.4% &#32;in 2015 &#32;and 13.4% &#32;in 2014 &#32;of Liggett&#8217;s unit volume. According to Management Science Associates, Liggett held a share of approximately 11.8% &#32;of the overall discount market segment for 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;and 11.6% &#32;for 2013 . 

Under the MSA reached in November 1998 with 46 states and various territories, the three largest cigarette manufacturers must make settlement payments to the states and territories based on how many cigarettes they sell annually. Liggett, however, is not required to make any payments unless its market share exceeds approximately 1.65% &#32;of the U.S. cigarette market. Additionally, Vector Tobacco has no payment obligation unless its market share exceeds approximately 0.28% &#32;of the U.S. cigarette market. We believe our tobacco subsidiaries have a sustainable cost advantage over their competitors as a result of the settlement. 

Liggett&#8217;s and Vector Tobacco&#8217;s payments under the MSA are based on each respective company&#8217;s incremental market share above the minimum threshold applicable to each respective company. Thus, if Liggett&#8217;s total market share is 3%, its MSA payment is based on 1.35%, which is the difference between Liggett&#8217;s total market share of 3% and its approximate applicable grandfathered share of 1.65% . We anticipate that both Liggett&#8217;s and Vector Tobacco&#8217;s payment exemptions will be fully utilized in the foreseeable future. 

The source of industry data in this report is Management Science Associates, Inc., an independent third-party database management organization that collects wholesale and retail shipment data from various cigarette manufacturers and distributors and provides analysis of market share, unit sales volume and premium versus discount mix for individual companies and the industry as a whole. Management Science Associates&#8217; information relating to unit sales volume and market share of certain of the smaller, primarily deep discount, cigarette manufacturers is based on estimates developed by Management Science Associates. 

Business Strategy. Liggett&#8217;s business strategy is to capitalize upon its cost advantage in the United States cigarette market resulting from the favorable treatment our tobacco subsidiaries receive under settlement agreements with the states and the MSA. Liggett&#8217;s long-term business strategy is to continue to focus its marketing and selling efforts on the discount segment of the market, to continue to build volume and margin in its core discount brands (EAGLE 20&#8217;s, PYRAMID, GRAND PRIX, LIGGETT SELECT and EVE) and to utilize its core brand equity to selectively build distribution. Liggett intends to continue its product development to provide the best quality products relative to other discount products in the market place. Liggett will continue to seek increases in efficiency by developing and adapting its organizational structure to maximize profit potential. 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution. Liggett&#8217;s products are distributed from a central distribution center in Mebane, North Carolina to 17 &#32;public warehouses located throughout the United States. These warehouses serve as local distribution centers for 

Liggett&#8217;s customers. Liggett&#8217;s products are transported from the central distribution center to the public warehouses by third-party trucking companies to meet pre-existing contractual obligations to its customers. 

Liggett&#8217;s customers are primarily candy and tobacco distributors and large grocery, drug and convenience store chains. Two &#32;customers, accounted for 19% &#32;and 10% &#32;of Liggett's revenues in 2015 &#32;and 18% &#32;and 10% &#32;in 2013. One &#32;customer accounted for 19% &#32;of Liggett's revenues in 2014 . Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are generally limited due to the large number of customers, located primarily throughout the United States, comprising Liggett&#8217;s customer base. Liggett&#8217;s two &#32;largest customers, represented approximately 4% &#32;and 1% , respectively, of net accounts receivable at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 5% &#32;and 1% , respectively, at December 31, 2013 . Liggett&#8217;s largest customer represented approximately 11% &#32;of net accounts receivable at December 31, 2014 . Ongoing credit evaluations of customers&#8217; financial condition are performed and, generally, no security is required. Liggett maintains reserves for potential credit losses and such losses, in the aggregate, have not exceeded management&#8217;s expectations. 

Trademarks. All of the major trademarks used by Liggett are federally registered or are in the process of being registered in the United States and other markets. Trademark registrations typically have a duration of ten years and can be renewed at Liggett&#8217;s option prior to their expiration date. 

In view of the significance of cigarette brand awareness among consumers, management believes that the protection afforded by these trademarks is material to the conduct of its business. These trademarks are pledged as collateral for certain of our senior secured debt. 

Manufacturing. Liggett purchases and maintains leaf tobacco inventory to support its cigarette manufacturing requirements. Liggett believes that there is a sufficient supply of tobacco within the worldwide tobacco market to satisfy its current production requirements. Liggett stores its leaf tobacco inventory in warehouses in North Carolina and Virginia. There are several different types of tobacco, including flue-cured leaf, burley leaf, Maryland leaf, oriental leaf, cut stems and reconstituted sheet. Leaf components of American-style cigarettes are generally the flue-cured and burley tobaccos. While premium and discount brands use many of the same tobacco products, input ratios of tobacco products may vary between premium and discount products. Liggett purchases its tobacco requirements from both domestic and foreign leaf tobacco dealers, much of it under long-term purchase commitments. As of December 31, 2015 , the majority of Liggett&#8217;s commitments were for the purchase of foreign tobacco. 

Liggett&#8217;s cigarette manufacturing facility was designed for the execution of short production runs in a cost-effective manner, which enables Liggett to manufacture and market 117 &#32;different cigarette brand styles including private labels for other companies. Liggett&#8217;s facility produced approximately 8.4 billion &#32;cigarettes in 2015 , but maintains the capacity to produce approximately 16.4 billion &#32;cigarettes per year. Vector Tobacco has contracted with Liggett to produce most of its cigarettes at Liggett&#8217;s manufacturing facility in Mebane. 

Competition. Liggett&#8217;s competition is divided into two segments. The first segment consists of the three largest manufacturers of cigarettes in the United States: Philip Morris USA Inc., RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company (which is now part of Reynolds American) (&#8220;RJ Reynolds&#8221;) and ITG Brands LLC, which is owned by Imperial Brands Plc. These three manufacturers, while primarily premium cigarette-based companies, also produce and sell discount cigarettes. The second segment of competition is comprised of a group of smaller manufacturers and importers, most of which sell deep discount cigarettes. 

The merger between RJ Reynolds and Lorillard in June 2015 consolidated more than 80% of the U.S. cigarette market within the control of two manufacturers, Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds. Consolidation in the industry could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the U.S. cigarette market. 

Historically, there have been substantial barriers to entry into the cigarette business, including extensive distribution organizations, large capital outlays for sophisticated production equipment, substantial inventory investment, costly promotional spending, regulated advertising and, for premium brands, strong brand loyalty. However, after the MSA was signed, some smaller manufacturers and importers that are not parties to the MSA were able to overcome these competitive barriers due to their cost advantage resulting from the MSA. These smaller manufacturers and importers that are not parties to the MSA have been impacted in recent years by the state statutes enacted pursuant to the MSA and have seen a decline in volume after years of growth. However, these companies still have significant market share through competitive discounting in this segment. 

In the cigarette business, Liggett competes on a dual front. The two &#32;major manufacturers compete among themselves for premium brand market share based on advertising and promotional activities and trade rebates and incentives and compete with Liggett and others for discount market share, on the basis of cost and brand loyalty. These two &#32;competitors have substantially greater financial resources than Liggett, and most of their brands have greater sales and consumer recognition than Liggett&#8217;s products. Liggett&#8217;s discount brands must also compete in the marketplace with the smaller manufacturers&#8217; and importers&#8217; deep discount brands. 

According to Management Science Associates&#8217; data, the unit sales of Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds accounted in the aggregate for approximately 78.5% &#32;of the domestic cigarette market in 2015 . Liggett&#8217;s domestic shipments of approximately 8.7 

billion &#32;cigarettes during 2015 &#32;accounted for 3.3% &#32;of the approximately 264 billion &#32;cigarettes shipped in the United States, compared to 8.9 billion &#32;cigarettes in 2014 &#32;( 3.4% ) and 9.1 billion &#32;cigarettes in 2013 &#32;( 3.3% ). 

Industry-wide shipments of cigarettes in the United States have been declining for a number of years, with Management Science Associates&#8217; data indicating that domestic industry-wide shipments declined by approximately 0.1% &#32;(approximately 0.3 billion &#32;units) and 3.0% &#32;(approximately 8.0 billion &#32;units) in 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. Liggett&#8217;s management believes that industry-wide shipments of cigarettes in the United States will continue to decline as a result of numerous factors. These factors include health considerations, diminishing social acceptance of smoking, and a wide variety of federal, state and local laws limiting smoking in restaurants, bars and other public places, as well as increases in federal and state excise taxes and settlement-related expenses which have contributed to higher cigarette prices in recent years. 

Historically, because of their dominant market share, Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds, the two largest cigarette manufacturers, have been able to determine cigarette prices for the various pricing tiers within the industry. Market pressures have historically caused the other cigarette manufacturers to bring their prices in line with the levels established by these two major manufacturers. Off-list price discounting and similar promotional activity by manufacturers, however, has substantially affected the average price differential at retail, which can be significantly less than the manufacturers&#8217; list price gap. Recent discounting by manufacturers has been far greater than historical levels, and the actual price gap between premium and deep-discount cigarettes has changed accordingly. This has led to shifts in price segment performance depending upon the actual price gaps of products at retail. 

Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds dominate the domestic cigarette market with a combined market share of approximately 78.5% &#32;at December 31, 2015 . This concentration of United States market share makes it more difficult for Liggett to compete for shelf space in retail outlets and could impact price competition in the market, either of which could have a material adverse effect on its sales volume, operating income and cash flows. 

E-Cigarettes 

Our subsidiary, Zoom, entered the emerging United States e-cigarette market in limited retail distribution outlets in January 2014 with a cautious plan to minimize expense. In January of 2014, we announced the national rollout of our Zoom e-cigarette brand. Uncertainties regarding e-cigarettes are significantly greater today than they were a year ago and, at this point, the trend lines do not predict a bright future. In fact, we have seen significant changes in the e-cigarette market over the past year with disposable e-cigarettes in rapid decline, rechargeable e-cigarettes appearing to be in decline and open system vapor products, that feature refillable tanks and use low-cost flavored liquids, demonstrating mixed results with limited category volume growth but rapidly declining prices. Additionally, we believe uncertainties related to the regulation of e-cigarettes, including open system vapor products, exist. Given this backdrop, our primary focus on the e-cigarette product is to limit risk while staying prepared to pursue opportunities if they occur. Zoom incurred operating losses of $13.0 million &#32;and $13.1 million &#32;in 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively, and approximately $1.0 million in operating losses during 2013 relating to startup costs. 

Legislation, Regulation and Litigation 

In the United States, tobacco products are subject to substantial and increasing legislation, regulation and taxation, which have a negative effect on revenue and profitability. In June 2009, legislation was passed providing for regulation of the tobacco industry by the United States Food and Drug Administration. See Item 7. &#8220;Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Legislation and Regulation.&#8221; 

The cigarette industry continues to be challenged on numerous fronts. The industry is facing increased pressure from anti-smoking groups and continued smoking and health litigation, the effects of which, at this time, we are unable to quantify. Product liability litigation, particularly in Florida in the Engle &#32;progeny cases, continues to adversely affect the cigarette industry. See Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors,&#8221; Item 3. &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221; and Note 15 &#32;to our consolidated financial statements, which contain a description of litigation. 

It is possible that our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome in any tobacco-related litigation or as a result of additional federal or state regulation relating to the manufacture, sale, distribution, advertising or labeling of tobacco products. 

Liggett&#8217;s management believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with the laws regulating cigarette manufacturers. 

The MSA and Other State Settlement Agreements 

In March 1996, March 1997, and March 1998, Liggett entered into settlements of tobacco-related litigation with 45 states and territories. The settlements released Liggett from all tobacco-related claims within those states and territories, including claims for health care cost reimbursement and claims concerning sales of cigarettes to minors. 

In November 1998, Philip Morris, Brown &#38; Williamson, R.J. Reynolds and Lorillard (the &#8220;Original Participating Manufacturers&#8221; or &#8220;OPMs&#8221;) and Liggett (together with any other tobacco product manufacturer that becomes a signatory, the &#8220;Subsequent Participating Manufacturers&#8221; or &#8220;SPMs&#8221;), (the OPMs and SPMs are hereinafter referred to jointly as the &#8220;Participating Manufacturers&#8221;) entered into the MSA with 46 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands (collectively, the &#8220;Settling States&#8221;) to settle the asserted and unasserted healthcare cost recovery and certain other claims of those Settling States. The MSA received final judicial approval in each Settling State. 

In the Settling States, the MSA released Liggett and other participating tobacco product manufacturers from: 

&#8226; 

all claims of the Settling States and their respective political subdivisions and other recipients of state health care funds, relating to: (i) past conduct arising out of the use, sale, distribution, manufacture, development, advertising and marketing of tobacco products; (ii) the health effects of, the exposure to, or research, statements or warnings about, tobacco products; and 

&#8226; 

all monetary claims of the Settling States and their respective subdivisions and other recipients of state health care funds, relating to future conduct arising out of the use of or exposure to, tobacco products that have been manufactured in the ordinary course of business. 

The MSA restricts tobacco product advertising and marketing within the Settling States and otherwise restricts the activities of Participating Manufacturers. Among other things, the MSA prohibits the targeting of youth in the advertising, promotion or marketing of tobacco products; bans the use of cartoon characters in all tobacco advertising and promotion; limits each Participating Manufacturer to one tobacco brand name sponsorship during any 12-month period; bans all outdoor advertising, with certain limited exceptions; prohibits payments for tobacco product placement in various media; bans gift offers based on the purchase of tobacco products without sufficient proof that the intended recipient is an adult; prohibits Participating Manufacturers from licensing third parties to advertise tobacco brand names in any manner prohibited under the MSA; and prohibits Participating Manufacturers from using as a tobacco product brand name any nationally recognized non-tobacco brand or trade name or the names of sports teams, entertainment groups or individual celebrities. 

The MSA also requires Participating Manufacturers to affirm corporate principles to comply with the MSA and to reduce underage usage of tobacco products and imposes restrictions on lobbying activities conducted on behalf of Participating Manufacturers. In addition, the MSA provides for the appointment of an independent auditor to calculate and determine the amounts of payments owed pursuant to the MSA. 

Under the payment provisions of the MSA, the Participating Manufacturers are required to make annual payments of $9.0 billion &#32;(subject to applicable adjustments, offsets and reductions). These annual payments are allocated based on unit volume of domestic cigarette shipments. The payment obligations under the MSA are the several, and not joint, obligations of each Participating Manufacturer and are not the responsibility of any parent or affiliate of a Participating Manufacturer. 

Liggett has no &#32;payment obligations under the MSA except to the extent its market share exceeds a market share exemption of approximately 1.65% &#32;of total cigarettes sold in the United States. Vector Tobacco has no &#32;payment obligations under the MSA except to the extent its market share exceeds a market share exemption of approximately 0.28% &#32;of total cigarettes sold in the United States. Liggett and Vector Tobacco&#8217;s domestic shipments accounted for 3.3% &#32;of the total cigarettes sold in the United States in 2015 . If Liggett&#8217;s or Vector Tobacco&#8217;s market share exceeds their respective market share exemption in a given year, then on April 15 of the following year, Liggett and/or Vector Tobacco, as the case may be, must pay on each excess unit an amount equal (on a per-unit basis) to that due from the OPMs for that year. 

Liggett may have additional payment obligations under the MSA and its other settlement agreements with the states. See Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and Note 15 &#32;to our consolidated financial statements.

Douglas Elliman Real Estate operates as a broker in residential real estate transactions. In performing these services, the company has historically represented the seller, either as the listing broker, or as a co-broker in the sale. In acting as a broker for the seller, their services include assisting the seller in pricing the property and preparing it for sale, advertising the property, 

showing the property to prospective buyers, and assisting the seller in negotiating the terms of the sale and in closing the transaction. In exchange for these services, the seller pays to the company a commission, which is generally a fixed percentage of the sales price. In a co-brokered arrangement, the listing broker typically splits its commission with the other co-broker involved in the transaction. The company also offers buyer brokerage services. When acting as a broker for the buyer, its services include assisting the buyer in locating properties that meet the buyer&#8217;s personal and financial specifications, showing the buyer properties, and assisting the buyer in negotiating the terms of the purchase and closing the transaction. In exchange for these services, a commission is paid to the company which also is generally a fixed percentage of the purchase price and is usually, based upon a co-brokerage agreement with the listing broker, deducted from, and payable out of, the commission payable to the listing broker. With the consent of a buyer and seller, subject to certain conditions, the company may, in certain circumstances, act as a selling broker and as a buying broker in the same transaction. The company&#8217;s sales and marketing services are provided by licensed real estate sales persons or associate brokers who have entered into independent contractor agreements with the company. The company recognizes revenue and commission expenses upon the consummation of the real estate sale. 

Douglas Elliman Real Estate also offers relocation services to employers, which provide a variety of specialized services primarily concerned with facilitating the resettlement of transferred employees. These services include sales and marketing of transferees&#8217; existing homes for their corporate employer, assistance in finding new homes, moving services, educational and school placement counseling, customized videos, property marketing assistance, rental assistance, area tours, international relocation, group move services, marketing and management of foreclosed properties, career counseling, spouse/partner employment assistance, and financial services.

elliman.com &#32;and AskElliman.com. &#32;&#32;Douglas Elliman Real Estate&#8217;s website, elliman.com, serves as a destination where consumers can search properties throughout the entire New York and South Florida markets and access current market information as well as comprehensive building and neighborhood guides and other interactive content. We have also recently launched AskElliman.com, our new web site that facilitates communication with consumers, providing them with access to information from real estate to mortgage financing, to specific neighborhoods. 

Marketing. Douglas Elliman Real Estate offers real estate sales and marketing and relocation services, which are marketed by a multimedia program. This program includes direct mail, newspaper, internet, catalog, radio and television advertising and is conducted throughout Manhattan and Long Island. In addition, the integrated nature of the real estate brokerage companies services is designed to produce a flow of customers between their real estate sales and marketing business and their mortgage business. 

Competition. The real estate brokerage business is highly competitive. However, Douglas Elliman Real Estate believes that its ability to offer their customers a range of inter-related services and its level of residential real estate sales and marketing help position them to meet the competition and improve their market share. 

In the brokerage company&#8217;s traditional business of residential real estate sales and marketing, it competes with multi-office independent real estate organizations and, to some extent, with franchise real estate organizations, such as Century-21, ERA, RE/MAX International, Sotheby&#8217;s International Realty, Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate, Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices, and Coldwell Banker. Douglas Elliman believes that its major competitors in 2016 &#32;will also increasingly include multi-office real estate organizations, such as GMAC Home Services, NRT LLC (whose affiliates include the New York City-based Corcoran Group) and other privately-owned companies. Residential brokerage firms compete for sales and marketing business primarily on the basis of services offered, reputation, personal contacts, and, recently to a greater degree, price. 

Government Regulation. Several facets of real estate brokerage businesses are subject to government regulation. For example, their real estate sales and marketing divisions are licensed as real estate brokers in the states in which they conduct their real estate brokerage businesses. In addition, their real estate sales associates must be licensed as real estate brokers or salespersons in the states in which they do business. Future expansion of the real estate brokerage operations of Douglas Elliman Real Estate into new geographic markets may subject it to similar licensing requirements in other states. 

A number of states and localities have adopted laws and regulations imposing environmental controls, disclosure rules, zoning and other land use restrictions, which can materially impact the marketability of certain real estate. However, Douglas Elliman Real Estate does not believe that compliance with environmental, zoning and land use laws and regulations has had, or will have, a materially adverse effect on its financial condition or operations. 

RESPA and state real estate brokerage laws restrict payments that real estate brokers, title agencies, mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers and other settlement service providers may receive or pay in connection with the sales of residences and referral of settlement services (e.g., mortgages, homeowners insurance and title insurance). Such laws may, to some extent, restrict preferred alliance and other arrangements involving our real estate franchise, real estate brokerage, settlement services and relocation 

businesses. In addition, our relocation and title and settlement services businesses, RESPA and similar state laws require timely disclosure of certain relationships or financial interests with providers of real estate settlement services. 

On November 17, 2008, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (&#8220;HUD&#8221;) published a rule that seeks to simplify and improve disclosures regarding mortgage settlement services and encourage consumers to compare prices for such services by consumers. The material provisions of the rule include: new Good Faith Estimate (&#8220;GFE&#8221;) and HUD-1 forms, permissibility of average cost pricing by settlement service providers, implementation of tolerance limits on various fees from the issuance of the GFE and the HUD-1 provided at closing, and disclosure of the title agent and title underwriter premium splits. To date, there has not been any material impact (financial or otherwise) to us arising out of compliance with these new rules. 

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, administration of RESPA has been moved from HUD to the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) and it is possible that the practices of HUD, taking very expansive broad readings of RESPA, will continue or accelerate at the CFPB creating increased regulatory risk. RESPA also has been invoked by plaintiffs in private litigation for various purposes. 

Title Services Regulation . Many states license and regulate title agencies/settlement service providers or certain employees and underwriters through their Departments of Insurance or other regulatory body. In many states, title insurance rates are either promulgated by the state or are required to be filed with each state by the agent or underwriter, and some states promulgate the split of title insurance premiums between the agent and underwriter. States sometimes unilaterally lower the insurance rates relative to loss experience and other relevant factors. States also require title agencies and title underwriters to meet certain minimum financial requirements for net worth and working capital. 

Franchises and Trade Names. The &#8220;Douglas Elliman&#8221; trade name is a registered trademark in the United States. The name has been synonymous with the most exacting standards of excellence in the real estate industry since Douglas Elliman&#8217;s formation in 1911. Other trademarks used extensively in Douglas Elliman&#8217;s business, which are owned by Douglas Elliman and registered in the United States, include &#8220;We are New York,&#8221; &#8220;Bringing People and Places Together,&#8221; &#8220;If You Clicked Here You&#8217;d Be Home Now&#8221; and &#8220;Picture Yourself in the Perfect Home.&#8221; 

The taglines &#8220;From Manhattan to Montauk&#8221; and &#8220;askelliman.com&#8221; are used extensively in the Douglas Elliman&#8217;s brokerage operations. In addition, Douglas Elliman&#8217;s brokerage operation continues to use the trade names of certain companies that it has acquired. 

Residential Property Management Business. Douglas Elliman Realty is also engaged in the management of cooperatives, condominiums and apartments though its subsidiary, Residential Management Group, LLC, which conducts business as Douglas Elliman Property Management and is the leading New York City based manager of apartments, cooperatives and condominiums in the New York metropolitan area according to a survey in the September 2013 issue of The Real Deal .

We and our partners seek to enhance the cash flows and returns from our investments by using varying levels of leverage. In addition, we and our partners may earn incentives on certain investments if the investments achieve rates of return that exceed targeted thresholds. Our real estate investments are located in the United States, Bermuda and the French West Indies and we may pursue growth in other markets where we identify attractive opportunities to invest in or acquire assets and to achieve strong risk-adjusted returns. We strive to invest at attractive valuations, capitalize on distressed situations where possible, create opportunities for superior valuation gains and cash flow returns and monetize assets at appropriate times to realize value. Our portfolio as of December 31, 2015 &#32;included interests in the 23 properties discussed above.
