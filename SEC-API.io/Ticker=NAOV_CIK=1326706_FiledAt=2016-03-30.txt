Overview 

&#160;

We were organized as a Delaware corporation in October 2003. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NanoVibronix Ltd., a private company incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel, we focus on noninvasive biological response-activating devices that target wound healing and pain therapy and can be administered at home, without the assistance of medical professionals. Our primary products currently consist of:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; WoundShield, a patch-based therapeutic ultrasound device that facilitates tissue regeneration and wound healing by using ultrasound to increase local capillary perfusion and tissue oxygenation; &#160;

&#160; &#183; PainShield&#8482;, a disposable patch-based therapeutic ultrasound technology to treat pain, muscle spasm and joint contractures by delivering a localized ultrasound effect to treat pain and induce soft tissue healing in a targeted area; and &#160;

&#160; &#183; UroShield&#8482;, an ultrasound-based product that is designed to prevent biofilm in urinary catheters, increase antibiotic efficacy and decrease pain and discomfort associated with urinary catheter use. &#160;

Each of our WoundShield, PainShield and UroShield products employs a small, disposable transducer that transmits low frequency, low intensity ultrasound acoustic waves that seek to repair and regenerate tissue, musculoskeletal and vascular structures and increase antibiotic efficacy. Through their size, effectiveness and ease of use, these products are intended to eliminate the need for technicians and medical personnel to manually administer ultrasound treatment through large transducers, thereby promoting patient independence and enabling more cost-effective home-based care.

&#160;

PainShield is currently cleared for marketing in the U.S. by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and all of our products have CE Mark approval in the European Union. We have a Canadian medical device license for PainShield, a certificate allowing us to sell PainShield, WoundShield and UroShield in Israel and we are able to sell PainShield, WoundShield and UroShield in India and Ecuador based on our CE Mark. We generally apply, through our distributor, for approval in a particular country for a particular product only when we have a distributor in place with respect to such product. 

&#160;

In the United States, PainShield requires a prescription from a licensed physician or a physical therapist. If U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance is obtained, the Company anticipates that WoundShield will require a prescription from a licensed physician in the United States. UroShield will also need a prescription. We anticipate it being sold directly to health care facilities and therefore will not require a prescription for these venues. However in other countries in which we sell them, PainShield, WoundShield and UroShield are eligible for sale without a prescription.

&#160;

In addition to the need to obtain regulatory approvals, as described above, we anticipate that sales volumes and prices of our WoundShield and PainShield products will depend in large part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement for self-administered use from third party payers. Third party payers include governmental programs such as Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S., private insurance plans and workers&#8217; compensation plans. We do not currently have reimbursement codes for self-administered use or clinical use of WoundShield in any of the markets in which we have regulatory authority to sell WoundShield. Of the markets in which we have regulatory authority to sell PainShield, we have reimbursement codes in the United States (i.e., Current Procedural Terminology codes or &#8220;CPT codes&#8221;) for clinical use only, but do not have such reimbursement codes for self-administered use of the product, although the product is marketed and sold for such use. With respect to UroShield, which will be used primarily in a clinical setting, we do not currently have reimbursement codes in any of the markets in which we have regulatory authority to sell UroShield. We anticipate that we will begin to seek reimbursement codes for self-administered and clinical use of our products in the markets in which we have regulatory authority to sell such products, however, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining such codes quickly, or at all.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We are currently conducting a double blinded clinical trial for UroShield in the U.S. in order to obtain 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In addition, we are currently ramping up our marketing efforts in North America with respect to PainShield. We anticipate that these efforts will include recruiting direct sales personnel and representatives, making in-office calls to physicians and attending trade shows and conferences. We have also identified a market for PainShield in the sports arena where in many cases reimbursement is either available from sports organizations or by self pay from wealthy sports figures. In order to pursue this market the Company is exhibiting at sports trainers meetings and advertising in their media.

&#160; 

Ultrasound Technology and Our Products 

&#160;

As noted above, our primary products are based on the use of low frequency ultrasound, which delivers energy through mechanical vibrations in the form of sound waves. Ultrasound has long been used in physical therapy, physical medicine, rehabilitation and sports medicine. Moreover, there is a growing body of research that supports the positive biological effects of ultrasound. A recent study indicates that low frequency ultrasound increases nerve regeneration (Crisci AR, Ferreira AL, &#8220;Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound accelerates the regeneration of the sciatic nerve after neurotomy in rats&#8221;, Ultrasound Med. Biol. 2002 October; 28(10):1335-41). According to Atland, et. al., low frequency ultrasound also has important therapeutic metabolic effects (Altland OD, Dalecki D, Suchkova VN, Francis CW, &#8220;Low-intensity ultrasound increases endothelial cell nitric oxide synthase activity and nitric oxide synthesis&#8221;, J. Thromb. Haemost. 2004 April; 2(4):637-43). In addition, there is evidence that ultrasound increases the healing of fractures (Warden SJ, Favaloro JM, Bennell KL, McMeeken JM, Ng KW, Zajac JD, Wark JD, &#8220;Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound stimulates the bone-forming response in UMR-106 cells&#8221;, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001 August 24; 286(3):443-50 and Warden SJ, Bennell KL, McMeeken JM, Wark JD, &#8220;Acceleration of fresh fracture repair using the sonic accelerated fracture healing system (SAFHS)&#8221;, Calcif. Tissue Int. 2000 February; 66(2):157-63).

&#160;

Research has further shown that ultrasound therapy has resulted in increased collagen repair (Da Cunha A, Parizotto NA, Vidal BC, &#8220;The effect of therapeutic ultrasound on repair of the achilles tendon (tendo calcaneus) of the rat&#8221;, Ultrasound Med. Biol. 2001 December; 27(12):1691-6), improved resolution of inflammation (Young SR, Dyson M, &#8220;Macrophage responsiveness to therapeutic ultrasound&#8221;, Ultrasound Med. Biol. 1990; 16(8):809-16) and increased tissue healing (Young SR, Dyson M, &#8220;Effect of therapeutic ultrasound on the healing of full-thickness excised skin lesions&#8221;, Ultrasonics. 1990 May; 28(3):175-80), which are all important factors in the wound healing process. Furthermore, research has shown that ultrasound therapy can contribute to increased membrane permeability (Sundaram J, Mellein BR, Mitragotri S, &#8220;An experimental and theoretical analysis of ultrasound-induced permeabilization of cell membranes,&#8221; Biophys. J. 2003 May; 84(5):3087-101) and accelerated fibrinolysis, a process that prevents blood clots from growing and becoming problematic (Harpaz D, &#8220;Ultrasound enhancement of thrombolytic therapy: observations and mechanisms&#8221;, Int. J. Cardiovasc Intervent. 2000 June; 3(2):81-89), which collectively improve the tissue regeneration process and healing of wounds. Sonophoresis, a process that increases the absorption of semisolid topical compounds, including medications, into the skin, is an additional significant effect of ultrasound therapy (Tezel A, Paliwal S, Shen Z, Mitragotri S, &#8220;Low-frequency ultrasound as a transcutaneous immunization adjuvant&#8221;, Vaccine 2005 May 31; 23(29):3800-7).

&#160;

In general, ultrasound causes the benefits cited above by increasing local blood circulation, increasing vascular wall permeability, promoting protein secretion, promoting enzymatic reactions, accelerating nitric oxide production, promoting angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels) and promoting fibroblast proliferation (fibroblasts are a type of cell that play a critical role in wound healing).

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our proprietary technology consists of a small, thin (1 millimeter) transducer that is capable of transmitting ultrasonic acoustic waves onto treatment surfaces with a radius of up to 10 centimeters. This technology allows us to treat wounds by implanting our transducers into a small, portable self-adhering acoustic patch, thereby eliminating the need for technicians and medical personnel to manually administer ultrasound therapy, which should reduce the cost of therapy. Moreover, we believe that the delivery of ultrasound through our portable devices is more effective than existing products, as our technology is better positioned to target the affected areas of the body.

&#160;

While there are currently a number of products on the market that treat pain through ultrasound therapy, we believe that our products differentiate themselves because they are portable, without the requirement to be plugged into an outlet and they have a frequency of 100kHz (in contrast to other devices, which have a frequency of 1MHz), which means they do not produce heat that can damage tissue. They can therefore be self-administered by the patient without the need to be moved about the treated area by the patient or a clinician, they can be applied for a significantly longer period without the risk of tissue damage and they do not require the use of gel. We are aware of one product, which has recently received U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared and also has CE Mark approval, that we understand does not need to be plugged in and operates at a frequency of 3 MHz, which its manufacturer claims overcomes the need for movement around the treated area and allows for a longer treatment period. We understand that this product does not generate surface acoustic waves as our products do, which means that the treatment area is generally limited to that of the transducer&#8217;s diameter (see the diagram below), that the use of transmission gel is still required and that the transducer thickness is significantly greater than ours (approximately 1.5cm). It is also our understanding that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has prohibited the manufacturer from labeling or promoting this product for use directly over bone that is near the skin surface. We are also aware of a small clinical study, for which results were reported in August 2013, in which a small ultrasound device showed positive results in the treatment of venous ulcers, a type of chronic wound. This product is sold under them of SAM&#174; Sport by a company called Zetroz Systems LLC ,aka Zetroz,Inc.. However this year Zetroz defaulted on a $5,000,000. loan from Horizon Technology Finance Corporation and it was sold at auction early this year. We are not certain of it&#8217;s current status.

&#160;

Traditional ultrasound device and our portable ultrasound patch-based device and a comparison of their energy distribution, where the X-axis represents treatment surface and the Y-axis represents ultrasound energy penetration depth within tissue. 

&#160;

In a comparison of a traditional ultrasound device and our portable ultrasound patch-based device, the bulk wave conventional ultrasound machines with handheld transducers distribute the energy deeply into the body, as shown above in diagram (A) on the left. In comparison, our device distributes the energy on the surface, as shown in diagram (B), thereby greatly increasing the treatment area. Our transducers may also be incorporated into treatment patches, including patches that are designed to deliver medicine and other compounds through the skin. The generation and delivery of low frequency ultrasound over a period of time to a specific area has been termed &#8220;targeted slow-release ultrasound&#8221;. We believe that this delivery method of ultrasound may be comparable to that of slow release medication in the pharmaceutical industry. This &#8220;targeted slow-release&#8221; capability is intended to allow for more frequent targeting of the intended treatment area and thus may result in a more effective therapeutic response.

&#160;

&#160; 

Micro Vibrations Technology and Our Products 

&#160;

It is well established that increasing blood flow to the wound and peri-wound area helps accelerate the healing of ischemic wounds. Micro vibrations applied on the skin tissue increase local blood flow and oxygen delivery to the wound area and stimulate angiogenesis and growth factors that are helpful for the wound healing process. Vibration therapy has been found to stimulate blood flow due to mechanical stresses of endothelial cells resulting in increased production of nitric oxide and vasodilation, as well as increase soft tissue and skin circulation (Maloney-Hinds et al., &#8220;The Role of Nitric Oxide in Skin Blood Flow Increases due to vibration in healthy adults and adults with type 2 diabetes,&#8221; School of Medicine, Loma Linda University. Ca. Diabetes Technology &#38; Therapeutics, 2009 p. 39-43). In addition, micro vibrations induce skin surface nerve axon reflex and type IIa muscle fibers contraction rates, resulting in vasodilation (Nakagami et al., &#34; Effect of vibration on skin blood flow in an in vivo microcirculatory model&#34;, The University of Tokyo, Bio-Science Trends 2007; 1 (3): 161-166). Ten minutes of vibration therapy with laser doppler revealed a consistent increase in blood supply (TJ Ryan et al.,&#34; The effect of mechanical forces (vibration or external compression) on the dermal water content of the upper dermis and epidermis, assessed by high frequency ultrasound&#34;, Oxford Wound Healing Institute, Journal of Tissue Viability, 2001. In another study, mean blood flow increase was higher in the vibration group than the placebo group. Improvements in local blood flow may be beneficial in the therapeutic alleviation of pain or other symptoms resulting from acute or chronic injuries (C. Button et al., &#34;The effect of multidirectional mechanical vibration on peripheral circulation of humans&#34;, University of Otago New Zealand,Clinical Physiology and functional Imaging, 2007 27, p211-216). A study on the effect of whole body vibration on lower extremity skin blood flow suggests, that short duration vibration alone significantly increases lower extremity skin blood flow, doubling skin blood for a minimum of 10 minutes following treatment (Lohman et al., &#34; The effect of whole body vibration on lower extremity skin blood flow in normal subjects&#34;, Department of Physical Therapy, Loma Linda university, USA, Med Sci Monit, 2007; 13(2) 71-76). Vibration has also been shown to stimulate angiogenesis and growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (Suhr F et al., &#34; Effects of short-term vibration and hypoxia during high intensity cycling exercise on circulating level of angiogenic regulators in humans&#34;, J Appl Physiol, 2007, 103:474-483,. Yue Z. et al., &#34; On the cardiovascular effects of whole-body vibration I. Longitudinal effects: hydrodynamic analysis&#34;, Studies Appl Math, 2007, 119:95-109). Of import with respect to diabetic wounds, in which a prolonged inflammatory phase occurs, vibration vasodilation has generated an indirect anti-inflammatory action, mainly by suppression of nuclear factor-kundefined, the key gene for inflammatory mediators (Marvin A., &#34; Nitric Oxide is released into circulation with whole-body, periodic acceleration&#34;, Chest 2005;127;30-39).

&#160;

We believe that the WoundShield Micro Therapy is the first patch device that provides micro vibrations (hertz range vibrations) to the healthy tissue adjacent to the wound in order to stimulate these biological effects, which we believe will lead to faster healing.

&#160;

Urinary catheter usage is associated with pain and discomfort caused by the friction between the catheter surface and the urethral tissue. Generally, this friction is treated by applying lubricating gels and low friction catheter coatings. These methods are effective for a short term during the catheter insertion as the lubricating gel is quickly absorbed into the surrounding tissue and loses its effect and the catheter coatings lose their lubricity within a few days, as the coating is covered by a thin film of mucous.

&#160;

CathBot provides vibrations along the surface of the urinary catheter that is in contact with urethral tissue. We believe that these vibrations create a continuous acoustic lubrication effect along the surface of the indwelling catheter that is in contact with the surrounding tissue, thus reducing catheter-tissue contact time, which may lessen trauma from urethra abrasion and adhesion.

&#160; 

Our Products 

&#160;

WoundShield&#174; 

&#160;

Our WoundShield product is intended to treat acute and chronic wounds with a disposable treatment patch that delivers localized therapeutic low frequency ultrasound. The WoundShield patch has two configurations: one that is placed adjacent to the wound and another, called the instillation patch, that is placed on the wound to enable instillation through sonophoresis, a process that increases the absorption of semisolid topical compounds, including medications, into the skin. Based on studies conducted by BIO-EC Microbiology Laboratory and Rosenblum, we believe that our WoundShield product possesses significant potential for the treatment of, among other things, diabetic foot ulcers and burns (Gasser P, Study Report delivered by BIO-EC Microbiology Laboratory, Dec 2007, which we ordered, paid for, and provided devices for; Rosenblum J, &#8220;Surface Acoustic Wave Patch Diathermy Generates Healing In Hard To Heal Wounds,&#8221; European Wound Management Association 2011, for which we supplied devices but had no further involvement).

&#160;

Picture of WoundShield Driver and Instillation Patch 

&#160;

WoundShield delivers surface acoustic waves to the location of the wound. Surface acoustic waves move laterally across the surface of the wound, which enables the transfer of the acoustic energy of the waves along the entire wound surface in a continuous and consistent mode, providing access to the waves&#8217; benefits for a longer treatment period than conventional ultrasound without the need for supervision or a treatment session by a clinician.

&#160;

This device has been found to have a positive effect on the epithelialization (healing by the growth of epithelial cells) of diabetic wounds, as well as on the stimulation of the precursors of dermal and epidermal (skin) growth. As such, it is a useful adjunct to wound care by increasing dermal and epidermal growth, including glycosaminoglycans, or GAGs (which bind to extracellular proteins like collagen, fibronectin, laminin, etc. and retain considerable amounts of water, thus preserving the skin structure) as well as the amount of collagen (a protein that helps skin heal) and decreasing the number of cells in mitosis (a type of cell division) (Gasser P, Study Report delivered by BIO-EC Microbiology Laboratory, Dec 2007, which we ordered, paid for, and provided devices for; Rosenblum J, &#8220;Surface Acoustic Wave Patch Diathermy Generates Healing In Hard To Heal Wounds,&#8221; European Wound Management Association 2011, for which we supplied devices but had no further involvement). In addition, the WoundShield instillation patch allows for administration of therapeutic agents into the wound area through a sonophoresis effect.

&#160;

Many key processes in wound healing are dependent upon an adequate supply of oxygen. Diabetic foot ulcers are particularly in need of an adequate oxygen supply because the disease often results from poor perfusion (blood flow) and decreased oxygen tension. Oxygen is also important for the immune system to ensure bacterial killing, synthesis of collagen, fibroblast proliferation (fibroblasts are a type of cell that play a critical role in wound healing), oxidative (taking place in the presence of oxygen) pathways for adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, formation (ATP transports chemical energy within cells for metabolism) and the nitric oxide dependent signaling pathways. It is generally believed that a lack of available oxygen is a basic contributing factor in the perpetuation of these wounds. Recently, wound healing experts have developed a technique of perfusing ischemic wounds (which occur when blood flow is blocked) with hyper-oxygenated saline, while the wound is being treated with ultrasound, also known as sonication. This localized oxygenation therapy has many advantages over the use of hyperbaric chambers (large chambers in which the oxygen pressure is above normal), a common method for delivering oxygen to wounds, as it is more cost-effective, can be done at the patient&#8217;s bedside and can be administered more frequently. The WoundShield instillation patch was tested as a potential ultrasound technology for this localized oxygen therapy and we believe that its performance would exceed the performance of the other ultrasound technologies. In one study (Morykwas M, &#8220;Oxygen Therapy with Surface Acoustic Waveform Sonication,&#8221; European Wound Management Association 2011; we supplied devices for this study, but had no further involvement with it), oxygen sensors were placed in the wound bed to directly measure partial pressure of oxygen in an ischemic wound bed on a pig. The wound was perfused with hyperbaric oxygen and sonicated using the WoundShield instillation patch. With surface acoustic wave ultrasound technology, tissue oxygen levels (partial pressure of oxygen in the blood, or PaO2) were raised from a range of 20 mmHg (millimeters of mercury) to 60 mmHg in peripheral (periwound) areas, a 3 centimeter distance away from the transducer, and from 40 mmHg to greater than 100 mmHg in the central wound bed lying below the WoundShield instillation patch (see table below). The results of this study illustrated that the WoundShield instillation patch allowed oxygen to directly enter into the wound. The direct entry of the oxygen increased the amount of oxygen reaching the wound, which has been shown to advance the healing process. In addition, we believe that WoundShield&#8217;s small size, lower cost and ease of use makes localized oxygen treatment commercially viable.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In 2012, results were published of a human feasibility trial for the WoundShield instillation patch that was performed at Duke University in North Carolina. Seven patients were treated with the WoundShield instillation patch for their wounds and average tissue oxygen levels (PaO2) increased by an average of 58% over baseline (Covington S, &#8220;Ultrasound-Mediated Oxygen Delivery to Lower Extremity Wounds,&#8221; Wounds 2012; 24(8)). We supplied devices for this trial, but had no further involvement with it. Based upon the results of this trial, we are planning a series of clinical trials with an end point claim that our WoundShield product enhances perfusion in chronic wounds.

&#160;

WoundShield Micro Therapy 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

WoundShield Micro Therapy Patch placed next to the wound 

&#160;

The WoundShield Micro Therapy device consists of a small electronic driver and a treatment patch. The patch is placed on the healthy skin next to the wound and the incorporated actuator vibrates in the hertz range and provides gentle vibrations to the surrounding tissue. The novelty of this technology is that the vibration effect is produced due to bending vibrations of the actuator (piezo element) and not by means of a motor. These micro vibrations applied on the skin tissue increase local blood flow, vasodilation , Nitric Oxide production and oxygen delivery to the wound area and stimulate angiogenesis and growth factors that help the healing process.

&#160;

In October 2014, Rosenblum et.al. published in Wounds Journal a study entitled &#8220;Surface Acoustic Wave Patch Therapy Affects Tissue Oxygenation in Ischemic Feet.&#8221; In this study, the WoundShield Micro Therapy device was found to significantly increase oxygen saturation level in the ischemic tissue in all patients by an average of more than 50%. The rate of the drop off after usage varied, but no patient&#8217;s value returned to pre-device usage levels.

Market for Wound-Healing Devices 

&#160;

The global wound care device market is continuously growing and expected to reach $20.3 billion by 2015 (&#8220;Anticipated market in 2015, Wound Care Products: A Global Strategic Business Report,&#8221; September 2011). According to a report entitled &#8220;Advances in Wound Closure Technology&#8221; by Frost and Sullivan (2005), approximately 25% of all patients with diabetes develop a foot or leg ulceration at some time during the course of their disease. Some 3.5 million individuals globally suffer from diabetes related foot or leg ulcerations each year. In addition, according to the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Survey (2000-2004), approximately 500,000 patients receive medical treatment annually for burn injuries in the U.S., with the global number estimated at 1 million. There are also policy-based factors that may increase the size of the wound care market. For example, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts announced a policy not to pay for patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 pressure ulcers acquired in a healthcare facility. We anticipate that these types of decisions will be made on a more widespread basis, which may create a large market opportunity for wound care products, including WoundShield. Furthermore, in 2009, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced that they would stop reimbursements for treatment of certain complications that they believed were preventable with proper care. One such complication was surgical site infections after certain elective procedures, including some orthopedic surgeries and bariatric surgery. We believe that such developments incentivize medical care providers to invest in reducing the risk of infection through the use of wound care products, including WoundShield.

&#160;

Competition for WoundShield and WoundShield Micro Therapy 

&#160;

The market for advanced wound care includes a large number of competitors, such as Kinetic Concepts, Inc., or KCI, Smith and Nephew plc and Convatec Inc., all of whom market wound-healing medical devices. Due to their size, in general these companies may have significant advantages over us. These competitors have their own distribution networks for their products, which gives them an advantage over us in reaching potential customers. In addition, they are vertically-integrated, which may allow them to maximize efficiencies that we cannot achieve with our third-party suppliers and distributors. Finally, because of their significantly greater resources, they could potentially choose to focus on research and development of technology similar to ours, more than we are able to. In general, we believe that these competitors have, and will continue to have, substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, regulatory and clinical, manufacturing, marketing and sales, distribution and personnel resources than we do. However, we believe that our products differentiate us from these competitors, and we will be competitive on the basis of our advantageous technology.

&#160;

At present, ultrasound treatment for wounds is limited only to wound debridement (removal of damaged tissue or foreign objects from a wound) and such products are marketed by Misonix Inc., which produces SonicOne products, and Celleration Inc., which produces the MIST Therapy System. Due to their size, in general these companies may have the same advantages over us discussed with respect to our competitors in the paragraph above. However, both of these ultrasound devices are indicated for use only in medical clinics and require an operator to deliver their treatment, thus limiting their use and application. The MIST Therapy System is a non-contact ultrasound device that delivers ultrasound through a mist that is applied directly on the wound.

&#160;

We believe that these therapies are less advantageous than WoundShield because they require an operator to deliver the treatment and the removal of bandages to target the wound bed. In contrast, the WoundShield patch sits on normal skin bordering the open wound and no manipulation of the wound bandage is required. Moreover, WoundShield can be self-administered, without an operator, in both clinics and home settings. We also believe that WoundShield will be able to provide superior wound care therapy at a lower price than the existing products being used by medical practitioners. As such, we believe that facilities that are reimbursed based upon diagnosis-related groups will be more inclined to adopt WoundShield because it will provide the same therapeutic results at a significantly lower cost than traditional ultrasound therapies.

&#160;

We are also aware of a small clinical study, for which results were reported in August 2013, in which a small ultrasound device showed positive results in the treatment of venous ulcers, a type of chronic wound. Based upon currently available information about this device, we believe it will be at least five years before this device is available on the market. We understand that this product does not generate surface acoustic waves as our products do, which means that the treatment area is generally limited to that of the transducer&#8217;s diameter. We believe our products would have certain other advantages over this potential device, if developed, including that our products weigh less and are thinner. However, given the early stage of development of this potential device, we cannot say with certainty how our products would compare.

&#160;

The most common method of oxygen administration for wound healing is hyperbaric oxygen therapy, especially to treat specific ulcerations in diabetic patients. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been shown to increase vascular endothelial growth factor expression, which measures the creation of new blood vessels (Fok TC, at el, &#34;Hyperbaric oxygen results in increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein expression in rabbit calvarial critical-sized defects&#34;, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Western Ontario, Canada). The activation of endothelial cells by VEGF sets in motion a series of steps toward the creation of new blood vessels (J Lewis et al, National Cancer Institute, Understanding Cancer and Related Topics, Understanding Angiogenesis). We believe that the WoundShield instillation patch, which can be used as an oxygen instillation system, will be complementary to, or in some cases an alternative, to the use of hyperbaric chamber therapy. This complementary treatment option will allow the treating physician greater therapeutic versatility in treating wounds. For a certain populace of patients, we believe that the WoundShield instillation patch could provide physicians with an alternative to hyperbaric oxygen therapy because it provides the same benefits as hyperbaric oxygen therapy at a lower cost to the patient. There are a number of competitors in the hyperbaric chamber therapy market, including over twelve companies in the U.S. Due to their size, in general these companies may have the same advantages over us discussed with respect to our competitors in the first paragraph of this section. However, we believe that the WoundShield instillation patch possesses certain advantages over the existing hyperbaric chamber therapy, including lower cost and greater ease of use. In addition, we do not believe that the WoundShield instillation patch will necessarily compete with hyperbaric chamber therapy, but rather will often complement such therapy. 

&#160;

While we believe that WoundShield is well positioned to capture a share of the wound care market, WoundShield may be unable to achieve its anticipated place in the wound care market due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, an inability to obtain the approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, its failure to treat wounds for which it is indicated and its failure to be adopted by health care practitioners and facilities or patients because of its status as a new product in a market that relies on patient-focused initiative to treat wounds.

&#160;

We are aware of one product that may be competitive with WoundShield Micro Therapy. The Vibro-Pulse is a large, vibrating surface that is placed under the patient&#8217;s limb that provides massaging vibration. It is marketed for the repair and regeneration of soft tissue and vascular structures primarily for stimulating wound healing. We believe that our product has the advantage of being smaller and capable of targeting a specific wound area in comparison to this product. In addition, the WoundShield Micro Therapy&#8217;s patch-based configuration allows a longer treatment period without limiting the patient to a stationary position.

&#160;

Regulatory Strategy 

&#160;

For a general discussion of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval process with respect to our products, and regulation of our products in general, see &#8220;&#8211;Government Regulation&#8221; below.

&#160;

Our general regulatory strategy for WoundShield is focused on seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for a variety of indications. WoundShield obtained CE Mark approval in November 2012 for use in wound healing.

&#160;

Following preliminary clinical studies that demonstrated WoundShield&#8217;s ability to enhance blood perfusion, in June 2014, we started a clinical trial for WoundShield with an end point of enhanced perfusion in chronic wounds at REX hospital in North Carolina. To date, only two patients have been recruited for this study, therefore we terminated this trial. We have not resumed it at another facility.

&#160;

WoundShield Micro Therapy is a Class I device that does not require a premarket notification application or U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance before it can be marketed in the U.S. We have listed it with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

We have sold limited numbers of our WoundShield products through our website. We intend to aggressively market WoundShield in Europe and pursue the necessary approvals to commence marketing in the United States. Our strategy for selling Woundshield in the U.S. is to find a strong partner in the wound care market .

We are actively pursuing this straegy.

&#160; 

Clinical Trials 

&#160;

With respect to WoundShield, to date, we have conducted the following evaluation studies:

&#160;

Purpose &#160; Doctor/Location &#160; Time, subjects &#160; Objectives &#160; Results Clinical evaluation

&#160; To evaluate novel technology on wound healing in diabetic foot ulcers. &#160; The device had a positive effect on both epitheliazation of diabetic wounds as and stimulating the precursors of dermal and epidermal growth. The duration of the trial was 20 days. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Clinical evaluation

Physician initiated

&#160; Dr. S. Covington &#160; 2010

7 patients

&#160; The study aimed to determine if hyper oxygenated saline delivered by surface acoustic waves improves tissue oxygenation in lower extremity wounds. &#160; Surface acoustic wave technology in conjunction with oxygenated saline can increase interstitial oxygen in wound bed. This trial to validate proof of concept was put on hold due to financial constraints. The duration of the trial was two weeks. &#160;

PainShield&#174; 

&#160;

PainShield is an ultrasound diathermy device (diathermy is the production of heat in a part of the body by high-frequency electric currents), consisting of a driver unit and a disposable patch, which contains our proprietary therapeutic transducer. It delivers a localized ultrasound effect to treat pain and induce soft tissue healing in a targeted area, while keeping the level of ultrasound energy at a safe and consistent level of 0.4 watts. We believe that PainShield is the smallest and most portable therapeutic ultrasound device on the market and the only product in which the ultrasound transducer is integrated in a therapeutic disposable application patch.

&#160;

The existing ultrasound therapy devices being used for pain reduction are primarily large devices used exclusively by clinicians in medical settings. PainShield is able to deliver ultrasound therapy without being located in a health care facility or clinic because it is portable, due to it being lightweight and battery operated. Because it is patch based and easy to apply, PainShield does not require medical personnel to apply ultrasound therapy to the patient. The patient benefits include its ease of application and use, faster recovery time, high compliance, safety and efficacy (Adahan M, et al, &#8220;A Sound Solution to Tendonitis: Healing Tendon Tears With a Novel Low-Intensity, Low-Frequency Surface Acoustic Ultrasound Patch,&#8221; American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Vol. 2, 685-687, July 2010). PainShield can be used by patients at home or work or in clinical setting and can be used even while the patient is sleeping. Its range of applications includes acute and chronic pain reduction and anti-inflammatory treatment.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Picture of PainShield with Patch 

&#160;

PainShield is used to treat tendon disease and trigeminal neuralgia (a chronic pain condition that affects the trigeminal or 5th cranial nerve, one of the most widely distributed nerves in the head); previously, the therapeutic options for these disorders have been very limited. PainShield has also been used to treat pelvic and abdominal pain. To date, the only treatment options for these conditions are pain medication and surgery.

&#160;

Market for PainShield 

&#160;

Pain is one of the most common conditions that hinder quality of life of vast populations of patients on a regular basis. Pain-related complaints are the most common reason patients seek treatment from physicians (Prince V, &#8220;Pain Management in Patients with Substance-Use Disorders,&#8221; Pain Management, PSAP-VII, Chronic Illnesses). According to Bonica&#8217;s Management of Pain (2001), a work considered current in the industry based on available industry data, and Landro L, &#8220;New Ways to Treat Pain: Tricking the Brain, Blocking the Nerves in Patients When all Else Has Failed,&#8221; Wall Street Journal, May 11, 2010, approximately 25% of the U.S. population, 75 million people, suffer from chronic pain. We estimate that approximately 150 million individuals globally suffer from chronic pain. Studies have shown that low-frequency ultrasound treatment has yielded positive results for a variety of indications, including tendon injuries and short-term pain relief (Warden SJ, &#8220;A new direction for ultrasound therapy in sports medicine,&#8221; Sports Med. 2003; 33 (2):95-107), chronic low back pain (Ansari NN, Ebadi S, Talebian S, Naghdi S, Mazaheri H, Olyaei G, Jalaie SA, &#8220;Randomized, single blind placebo controlled clinical trial on the effect of continuous ultrasound on low back pain,&#8221; Electromyogr Clin Neurophysiol. 2006 Nov; 46(6):329-36) and sinusitis (Ansari NN, Naghdi S, Farhadi M, Jalaie S, &#8220;A preliminary study into the effect of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound on chronic maxillary and frontal sinusitis,&#8221; Physiother Theory Pract. 2007 Jul-Aug; 23(4):211-8). We believe that PainShield&#8217;s technology, portability and ease of use may result in it becoming an attractive product in the pain management and therapy field.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

There are numerous products and approaches currently utilized to treat chronic pain. The pharmacological approach, which may be the most common, focuses on drug-related treatments. Alternatively, there are a large number of non-pharmacological pain treatment modalities available, such as ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, or TENS, laser therapy and pulsed electromagnetic treatment. In addition, there are some technologies and devices in the market that utilize low frequency ultrasound or patch technology. Many patients are initially prescribed anti-pain medication; however, ongoing use of drugs may cause substantial side effects and lead to addiction. Therefore, patients and clinicians have shown great interest in alternative pain therapy using medical devices that do not carry these side effects.

&#160;

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The currently available ultrasound treatments for chronic pain have generally been accepted by the medical community as standard treatment for pain management. However, the traditional ultrasound treatments, such as those manufactured or distributed by Mettler Electronics Corp, Metron USA and Zimmer MedizinSysteme, are stationary devices found only in clinics and other health care facilities that need to be administered to patients by health care professionals. We are aware of three companies that market smaller ultrasound devices capable of certain self-administered use for the treatment of pain: Koalaty Products, Inc., Sun-Rain System Corp. and PhysioTEC. These devices generally function in the same manner, at the same frequency and with the same administration and safety requirements and limitations as traditional, larger ultrasound devices. We are also aware of one product, which has recently received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval and also has CE Mark approval, marketed by ZetrOZ, Inc., that we understand may eliminate certain of these requirements and limitations, namely the requirement to be plugged in, the need for movement around the treated area and the relatively short safe treatment period. However, we understand that this product does not generate surface acoustic waves as our products do, which means that the treatment area is generally limited to that under the transducer, that the use of transmission gel is still required and that the transducer thickness is significantly greater than ours (approximately 1.5cm). It is also our understanding that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has prohibited the manufacturer from labeling or promoting this product for use directly over bone that is near the skin surface. In addition, there are other patch-based methods of pain treatment, such as TENS therapy. TENS therapy is generally not supported by widespread clinical evidence of its efficacy. In addition, TENS therapy may be painful and irritating for the patient due to the muscle contractions resulting from the electrical pulses. PainShield combines the efficacy of ultrasound treatment for pain with the ease of use and portability of a patch-based system. PainShield also may be self-administered by the patient, including while the patient is sleeping. However, if we are unable to obtain widespread insurance coverage and reimbursement for PainShield, its acceptance as a pain management treatment would likely be hindered, as patients may be reluctant to pay for the product out-of-pocket.

&#160;

Regulatory Strategy 

&#160;

PainShield received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in August 2008 for treatment of selected medical conditions such as relief of pain, muscle spasms and joint contraction. PainShield received CE Mark approval in July 2008 and was also approved for sale by the Israeli Ministry of Health in 2010. We have a Canadian medical device license for PainShield and we are able to sell PainShield in India and Ecuador based on our CE Mark.

&#160;

In the U.S., PainShield falls under the diathermy classification for the treatment of pain for initial reimbursement purposes. The permitted reimbursement codes can be used in the outpatient supervised medical setting. We intend to coordinate with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and private insurers so that reimbursement can be extended to cover the administration of PainShield outside of health care facilities and clinics. In addition, we intend to conduct clinical trials in order to effectively market PainShield for a larger range of indications.

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

PainShield was introduced in 2009 as a treatment for pain and other clinical problems, such as tendonitis, sports injuries, pelvic pain and neurologic pain and we have sold approximately 1,500 units and 8,000 treatment patches since its introduction. We have entered into distribution agreements in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East for the distribution of PainShield. We intend to seek additional distribution opportunities in Europe, East Asia and South America. In addition, we sell PainShield directly to patients through our website. We are currently ramping up our marketing efforts in North America. We anticipate that these efforts will include recruiting additional sales personnel and representatives, making in-office calls to physicians and attending trade shows and conferences.

&#160;

We have also identified a market for PainShield in the sports arena where in many cases reimbursement is either available from sports organizations or by self pay from wealthy sports figures. In order to pursue this market the Company is exhibiting at sports trainers meetings and advertising in their media

UroShield 

&#160;

UroShield is intended to prevent biofilm, increase antibiotic efficacy in the catheter lumen and decrease pain and discomfort associated with urinary catheter use. It is designed to be used with any type of indwelling urinary catheter regardless of the material or coating. We believe UroShield is the first medical device on the market that attempts to simultaneously address all of the aforementioned catheter-related issues. UroShield is similar in design to WoundShield and PainShield, in that it uses a driver unit that produces low frequency, low intensity ultrasound. The driver unit connects to a disposable transducer that is clipped onto the external portion of the catheter to deliver ultrasound therapy to all catheter surfaces as well as the tissue surrounding the catheter.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Picture of UroShield with actuator 

&#160;

The UroShield system has the following advantageous effects:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Prevention or Reduction of Biofilm. The low frequency ultrasound generated by UroShield has been shown to decrease adherence of bacteria to catheter surfaces, thereby reducing biofilm. Biofilm is the complex matrix required for bacteria to grow and cause infection. See the discussion of our Heidelberg 1 trial below. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Decreased Catheter Associated Pain and Discomfort. We believe that UroShield creates an acoustic envelope on the surfaces of the catheter, which decreases friction and tissue trauma, pain and discomfort caused by the catheter. In addition, the tissue in contact with the catheter remains healthier and less traumatized as a result of the application of low frequency and low intensity ultrasound (Tenke P, &#8220;The effectiveness of acoustic energy induced by UroShield in the prevention of bacteriuria and the reduction of patients&#8217; complaints related to long-term indwelling urinary catheters,&#8221; 26th Annual Congress of the European Association of Urology (EAU) Congress, Vienna, March 2011; we supplied devices for this study and paid for electron microscopy analysis, but had no further involvement with it). &#160;

&#160; &#183; Acoustically Augmented Antibiotic Therapy. Antibiotic resistance in biofilm bacteria is a well-known phenomenon. Although it has been known that ultrasound can increase antibiotic efficacy in in-vitro models, we do not believe that there has been a practical ultrasound-based medical device that was able to augment antibiotic efficacy in the clinical setting. UroShield technology has been shown to eradicate biofilm-residing bacteria by greater than 85% when applied simultaneously with an antibiotic in three clinically relevant species, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa (Banin E, et al., &#8220;Surface acoustic waves increase the susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms to antibiotic treatment,&#8221; Biofouling, August 2011; we supplied devices for this study, but had no further involvement with it). &#160;

&#160; &#183; Preservation of the Patency of Catheters. We believe that low frequency ultrasound applied to catheters will add an anti-clogging effect and will preserve patency of catheters. This effect is achieved by ultrasound waves creating an acoustic layer on the inner lumen of the urinary catheter, thereby preventing adherence of biological material and bilofilm formation. We believe that this anti-clogging benefit will help prevent local infection and sepsis secondary to catheter obstruction. &#160;

UroShield has undergone a number of clinical trials. The Heidelberg 1 trial, which we sponsored, was a 22 patient randomized, double blind, sham-controlled, independent trial that tested UroShield&#8217;s safety and ability to prevent biofilm in patients with an indwelling Foley catheter. The trial demonstrated that UroShield prevented biofilm in all patients with the active device as compared to biofilm being found in seven of eleven of the control patients. In addition, there was a marked decrease in pain, discomfort and spasm in the active UroShield patients, as evidenced by a statistically significant decrease in the requirement for the medications required to treat urinary catheter associated pain and discomfort (Ikinger U, &#8220;Biofilm Prevention by Surface Acoustic Nanowaves: A New Approach to Urinary Tract Infections?,&#8221; 25th World Congress of Endourology and SWL, Cancun, Mexico, October 2007).

&#160;

&#160; 16 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In a subsequent physician-sponsored trial known as Heidelberg 2, 40 patients who underwent radical prostatectomies were divided into two groups, with the active group receiving one intra-operative dose of antibiotics and UroShield and the control group receiving one intra-operative dose of antibiotics and then five subsequent doses over three days. At the end of the trial, the control group had four cases of bacteruria, as compared to one in the active group. In a third trial, a physician-sponsored open label trial, ten patients who received emergency placement of a urinary catheter due to acute obstruction were given a UroShield device and followed with regard to their pain, discomfort, spasm and overall well-being. Within 24 hours, all patients showed improvement and increased toleration of the catheter (Zillich S., Ikinger U, &#8220;Biofilmpr&#228;vention durch akustische Nanowellen: Ein neuer Aspekt bei katheterassoziierten Harnwegsinfektionen?,&#8221; Gesellschaft f&#252;r Urologie, Heilbronn, Germany, May 2008). We supplied devices for this trial, but had no further involvement with it.

&#160; 

Market for UroShield 

&#160;

According to State of the Globe: Catheterizations Continue to Cultivate Urinary Infections &#8211; Journal of Global Infectious Diseases May-Aug 2010 , over 55 million indwelling urinary catheters are consumed annually worldwide. In addition, as of October 1, 2008, Medicare stopped authorizing its payment to hospitals in which patients have developed a catheter-associated urinary tract infection that was not present on admission. This provides hospitals in the U.S. with a substantial financial incentive to reduce the occurrence of such infections through the use of products such as UroShield, which help prevent infections hospitals would otherwise have to treat without reimbursement. In addition, it has been noted that the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services may fine hospitals in the future when their patients develop catheter acquired urinary tract infection, which will likely increase the incentive of hospitals to invest in technologies that may prevent this complication (Brown J, et al. &#8220;Never Events: Not Every Hospital-Acquired Infection Is Preventable, Clinical Infectious Diseases, 2009, 49 (5)).

&#160; 

Competition for UroShield 

&#160;

Several types of products have been introduced to address the growing problem of catheter-acquired infection and biofilm formation on catheter surfaces. Manufacturers offer antibiotic-coated and antiseptic-impregnated catheters. In addition, manufacturers have produced silver-coated catheters, which have been shown in small studies to delay bacteruria for about two to four days. However, larger studies did not corroborate this result; on the contrary, silver hydrogel was associated with overgrowth of gram positive bacteria in the urine (Riley DK, Classen DC, &#8220;A large randomized clinical trial of a silver-impregnated urinary catheter: lack of efficacy and staphylococcal superinfection,&#8221; Am. J. Med. 1995 April; 98(4):349-56).

&#160;

UroShield has been designed to be added to any type of catheter, including Foley catheters and silver-coated catheters, to improve a catheter&#8217;s infection prevention performance. UroShield is not intended to replace any existing products or technologies, but instead is intended to assist these existing products or technologies in preventing catheter-acquired urinary injury and catheter associated complications. UroShield may be unable to achieve its anticipated catheter market share due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, an inability to obtain approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and failure to be adopted by health care practitioners and facilities because of its status as a new product in the market, without an established niche.

&#160;

Regulatory Strategy 

&#160;

UroShield received CE Mark approval in September 2007 and was also approved for sale by the Israeli Ministry of Health in 2008. We are able to sell UroShield in India and Ecuador based on our CE Mark.

&#160;

In the European Union, UroShield has been marketed for the prevention of biofilm, decreased pain and discomfort associated with urinary catheters and increased antibiotic efficacy. In the U.S., we intend to seek clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration through the de novo classification process for UroShield. We submitted our application for 510(k) approval on January 3, 2011. On March 11, 2011, we received a response from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration proposing that the approval go through the de novo route, which will require clinical trials with proposed study protocols to be pre-cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. We are currently seeking a strategic partner that is active in the urology market to help fund the clinical trials for UroShield to support our U.S. Food and Drug Administration application. We have not made any further submissions to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration related to UroShield.

Third Party Reimbursement 

&#160;

We anticipate that sales volumes and prices of the products we commercialize will depend in large part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third party payers. Third party payers include governmental programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and workers&#8217; compensation plans. These third party payers may deny coverage and reimbursement for a product or therapy, in whole or in part, if they determine that the product or therapy was not medically appropriate or necessary. The third party payers also may place limitations on the types of physicians or clinicians that can perform specific types of procedures. In addition, third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Some third party payers must also pre-approve coverage for new or innovative devices or therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use the products or therapies. Even though a new product may have been approved or cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for commercial distribution, we may find limited demand for the device until adequate reimbursement has been obtained from governmental and private third party payers.

&#160;

In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific product lines and procedures. There can be no assurance that procedures using our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost-effective by third party payers, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that the third party payers&#8217; reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.

&#160;

In the U.S., some insured individuals are receiving their medical care through managed care programs, which monitor and often require pre-approval of the services that a member will receive. Some managed care programs are paying their providers on a per capita basis, which puts the providers at financial risk for the services provided to their patients by paying these providers a predetermined payment per member per month, and consequently, may limit the willingness of these providers to use products, including ours.

&#160;

One of the components in the reimbursement decision by most private insurers and governmental payers, including the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, which administers Medicare, is the assignment of a billing code. Billing codes are used to identify the procedures performed when providers submit claims to third party payers for reimbursement for medical services. They also generally form the basis for payment amounts. We anticipate that our distributors will be responsible for the process for obtaining billing codes for our products.

&#160;

&#160; 19 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The initial phase of establishing a professional billing code for a medical service typically includes applying for a Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, Category III code. This is a tracking code without relative value assigned that allows third party payers to identify and monitor the service as well as establish value if deemed medically necessary. The process includes CPT application submission, clinical discussion with Medical Professional Society CPT advisors as well as American Medical Association CPT Editorial Panel review. A new CPT Category III code will be assigned if the American Medical Association CPT Editorial Panel committee deems it meets the applicable criteria and is appropriate.

&#160;

The secondary phase in the CPT billing code process includes the establishment of a permanent CPT Category I code in which relative value is analyzed and established by the American Medical Association. The approval of this code is based on, among other criteria, widespread usage and established clinical efficacy of the medical service.

&#160;

We believe that the overall escalating costs of medical products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services. In addition, recent healthcare reform measures, as well as legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels, create significant additional uncertainties. There can be no assurance that third party coverage and reimbursement will be available or adequate, or that future legislation, regulation, or reimbursement policies of third party payers will not adversely affect the demand for our products or our ability to sell these products on a profitable basis. The unavailability or inadequacy of third party payer coverage or reimbursement would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

&#160;

The Diagnosis Related Group System, or DRG, is the system of reimbursement that is used in the United States for hospitalized patients as well as patients who are cared for in skilled nursing facilities and long term care facilities. These facilities are not subject to the same reimbursement codes as described above. In the DRG system, each patient admitted to the hospital or facility is assigned a code based on his or her diagnosis. That code is known to be associated with an average hospital stay and the health care facility is reimbursed for the amount of days as defined by the DRG code, regardless of how many days the patient is in the facility. This system gives a strong incentive for these health care facilities to deliver efficient care and to complete the needed treatment as quickly as possible. For example, if the patient has a wound that requires healing before discharge and they succeed in treating the wound in less hospital days than allowed by the DRG code for this diagnosis, the facility will be rewarded by being paid more for more days than the patient was actually in the hospital for. Conversely, if the treatment takes longer, the facility would actually lose income, as they will be paid for the DRG code only. This system serves as a stimulus for these facilities to purchase and utilize devices and technologies that allow more efficient therapy.

&#160;

PainShield. PainShield is presently reimbursed in the U.S. by many private insurers for use of the ultrasound device in a supervised medical setting and is reimbursed in units of 15 minutes up to an hour a day, 5 hours a week and 20 hours a month. If the device is efficacious in the treatment of the patient&#8217;s condition, the treatment period can be extended in some cases for months. Presently, when purchased by a clinic, PainShield is typically purchased by the clinic that then bills the existing reimbursement codes. PainShield is not reimbursed for therapy in the home setting. When we have sufficient funding, we intend to work to obtain reimbursement in the home setting as well as codes that would allow for reimbursement for use of the non-disposable and disposable components of the PainShield device. Our anticipated clinical trials for PainShield would support this effort.

&#160; 

WoundShield We believe that the initial usage of these products will be in the hospital setting. Reimbursement in the hospital setting is governed by the diagnosis-related group system, which does not require specific reimbursement codes. In parallel to introducing these devices to hospitals, we intend to apply for reimbursement codes for outpatient use. Although obtaining these codes can take two to five years and may require extensive clinical data, we believe that the desirable characteristics of these products may serve as an incentive to insurance companies to grant these codes more quickly.

&#160; 

&#160; 20 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

UroShield. We expect these products to be used in hospital settings and therefore reimbursed under the diagnosis-related group reimbursement system. In addition, we anticipate that these products will initially be purchased privately until a reimbursement code is obtained. However, we believe that if we can empirically demonstrate UroShield&#8217;s efficacy in preventing recurrent hospitals admission in chronic Foley catheter patients and reducing overall per-patient cost, third party payers may accelerate the reimbursement approval process since the device could reduce their overall per-patient cost.

&#160;

New Products Under Development 

&#160;

Renooskin 

&#160;

We have started developing a device for the facial rejuvenation market called Renooskin. . Previous in vitro clinical studies on human skin were done showing that the SAW technology provided skin rejuvenation comparable to Retinol A which is a well-accepted anti-aging cream.

&#160;

The Company is developing a head band like applicator for the SAW treatment and has arranged for a pilot trial with a cosmetic dermatologist. The Company believes that pending proving efficacy of the Renooskin and receiving regulatory approval the device can be sold in a non-reimbursement market since cosmetic devices are private pay. We expect the first articles to test in the third quarter of 2016.

&#160;

Endotrachshield 

&#160;

We plan to undergo a pilot study of adapting the Uroshield technology to endotracheal tubes. The study will target reduction of infection and pain in endotracheal tubes. We are currently in negotiation with the hospital in order for the study to go ahead. We expect an indication of efficacy within the third quarter of 2016 assuming the contractual arrangements can be agreed to.

&#160; 

Research and Development Expenses 

&#160;

During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we spent approximately $398,000 and $431,000 on research and development activities, respectively.

&#160;

We have made all three of the required payments under this agreement.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

U.S. Food and Drug Administration Regulation 

&#160;

Each of our products must be approved, cleared by or registered with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration before it is marketed in the U.S. Before and after approval or clearance in the U.S., our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and/or the Public Health Service Act, as well as by other regulatory bodies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations govern, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, safety, storage, record-keeping, market clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, import and export, marketing and sales, and distribution of medical devices and pharmaceutical products. PainShield has already obtained 510(k) marketing approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. WoundShield Micro Therapy and CathBot are Class I devices and will not need a premarket notification application or U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance before they can be marketed in the U.S. However, we have listed them with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

&#160;

&#160; 22 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

U.S. Food and Drug Administration Approval or Clearance of Medical Devices 

&#160;

In the U.S., medical devices are subject to varying degrees of regulatory control and are classified in one of three classes depending on the extent of controls the U.S. Food and Drug Administration determines are necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and efficacy:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Class I: general controls, such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations; &#160; &#183; Class II: special controls, pre-market notification (510(k)), specific controls such as performance standards, patient registries and post-market surveillance and additional controls such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations; and &#160; &#183; Class III: special controls and approval of a pre-market approval, or PMA, application. &#160;

WoundShield and PainShield are classified as Class II medical devices and require U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorization prior to marketing, by means of 510(k) clearance, except for our UroShield product, which we intend to seek clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration through the de novo classification process, described below. WoundShield Micro Therapy and CathBot are classified as Class I medical devices, and do not require any additional authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. However, we have listed them with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

&#160;

To request marketing authorization by means of a 510(k) clearance, we must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed medical device, has the same intended use, and is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than a legally marketed device. 510(k) submissions generally include, among other things, a description of the device and its manufacturing, device labeling, medical devices to which the device is substantially equivalent, safety and biocompatibility information and the results of performance testing. In some cases, a 510(k) submission must include data from human clinical studies. Marketing may commence only when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issues a clearance letter finding substantial equivalence. The typical duration to receive 510(k) approval is approximately nine months from the date of the initial 510(k) submission, although there is no guaranty that the timing will not be longer.

&#160;

In the past, the 510(k) pathway for product marketing required only the proof of significant equivalence in technology for a given indication with a previously cleared device. Currently, there has been a trend of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requiring additional clinical work to prove efficacy in addition to technological equivalence. Thus, no matter which regulatory pathway we may take in the future towards marketing products in the U.S., we believe we will be required to provide clinical proof of device effectiveness.

&#160;

After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any product modification that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the product, or that would constitute a significant change in intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, if the device would no longer be substantially equivalent, would require a PMA. If the U.S. Food and Drug Administration determines that the product does not qualify for 510(k) clearance, then a company must submit and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration must approve a PMA before marketing can begin.

&#160;

A PMA application must provide a demonstration of safety and effectiveness, which generally requires extensive pre-clinical and clinical trial data. Information about the device and its components, device design, manufacturing and labeling, among other information, must also be included in the PMA. As part of the PMA review, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will inspect the manufacturer&#8217;s facilities for compliance with quality system regulation requirements, which govern testing, control, documentation and other aspects of quality assurance with respect to manufacturing. If the U.S. Food and Drug Administration determines the application or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration may outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. During the review period, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians and statisticians, is likely to be convened to review the application and recommend to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration whether, or upon what conditions, the device should be approved. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is not bound by the advisory panel decision. While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration often follows the panel&#8217;s recommendation, there have been instances where the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not. If the U.S. Food and Drug Administration finds the information satisfactory, it will approve the PMA. The PMA approval can include post-approval conditions, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, or requirements to do additional clinical studies post-approval. Even after approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement is required to authorize certain modifications to the device, its labeling or its manufacturing process. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the product covered by the original PMA. The typical duration to receive PMA approval is approximately two years from the date of submission of the initial PMA application, although there is no guaranty that the timing will not be longer.

&#160;

&#160; 23 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

As describe above, we anticipate that our UroShield product will receive, a de novo review from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. De novo is a two-step process that requires a company to submit a 510(k) and complete a standard review, including an analysis of the risk to the patient and operator associated with the use of the device and the substantial equivalence rationale. Once that has been accomplished, and the medical device in question has been determined to be not substantially equivalent to another approved device, the product is automatically classified as a Class III device. The manufacturer can then submit a request for an evaluation to have the product reclassified from Class III into Class I or Class II. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will review the device classification proposal and either recommend special controls to create a new Class I or II device classification or determine that the product is a Class III device. If the U.S. Food and Drug Administration determines that the level of risk associated with the use of the device is appropriate for a Class II or Class I designation, then the product can be cleared as a 510(k) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will issue a new classification regulation and product code. If the device is not approved through de novo review, then it must go through the standard PMA process for Class III devices.

&#160; 

Clinical Trials of Medical Devices 

&#160;

One or more clinical trials are generally required to support a PMA application and more recently are becoming necessary to support a 510(k) submission. Clinical studies of unapproved or uncleared medical devices or devices being studied for uses for which they are not approved or cleared (investigational devices) must be conducted in compliance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements. If an investigational device could pose a significant risk to patients, the sponsor company must submit an investigational device exemption application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration prior to initiation of the clinical study. An investigational device exemption application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device on humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The investigational device exemption will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration unless the U.S. Food and Drug Administration notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. Clinical studies of investigational devices may not begin until an institutional review board has approved the study.

&#160;

During the study, the sponsor must comply with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#8217;s investigational device exemption requirements. These requirements include investigator selection, trial monitoring, adverse event reporting, and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices, and comply with reporting and record keeping requirements. The sponsor, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the institutional review board at each institution at which a clinical trial is being conducted may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable risk. During the approval or clearance process, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration typically inspects the records relating to the conduct of one or more investigational sites participating in the study supporting the application.

&#160;

Post-Approval Regulation of Medical Devices 

&#160;

After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; the U.S. Food and Drug Administration quality systems regulation, which governs, among other things, how manufacturers design, test, manufacture, exercise quality control over, and document manufacturing of their products; &#160;

&#160; 24 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#183; labeling and claims regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or &#8220;off-label&#8221; uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; and &#160;

&#160; &#183; the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires reporting to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of certain adverse experiences associated with use of the product. &#160; 

Good Manufacturing Practices Requirements 

&#160;

Manufacturers of medical devices are required to comply with the good manufacturing practices set forth in the quality system regulations promulgated under section 520 of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Current good manufacturing practices regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. The manufacturing facility for an approved product must meet current good manufacturing practices requirements to the satisfaction of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration pursuant to a pre-PMA approval inspection before the facility can be used. Manufacturers, including third party contract manufacturers, are also subject to periodic inspections by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other authorities to assess compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, and civil and criminal penalties. Adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or in product withdrawal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following the approval.

&#160; 

International Regulation 

&#160;

We are subject to regulations and product registration requirements in many foreign countries in which we may sell our products, including in the areas of product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import and export restrictions and tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. The time required to obtain clearance required by foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance, and requirements for licensing a product in a foreign country may differ significantly from U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements.

&#160;

The primary regulatory environment in Europe is the European Union, which consists of 25 member states and 42 competent authorities encompassing most of the major countries in Europe. In the European Union, the European Medicines Agency and the European Union Commission determined that WoundShield, PainShield and UroShield are to be regulated as medical device products. These products are classified as Class II devices. These devices are CE Marked and as such can be marketed and distributed within the European Economic Area. We are required to be recertified each year for CE by Intertek, which conducts an annual audit. The audit procedure, which includes on-site visits at our facility, requires us to provide Intertek with information and documentation concerning our management system and all applicable documents, policies, procedures, manuals, and other information.

&#160;

The primary regulatory bodies and paths in Asia, Australia, Canada and Latin America are determined by the requisite country authority. In most cases, establishment registration and device licensing are applied for at the applicable Ministry of Health through a local intermediary. The requirements placed on the manufacturer are typically the same as those contained in ISO 9001 or ISO 13485, requirements for quality management systems published by the International Organization of Standardization. In some countries outside Europe, we are or will be able to sell on the basis of our CE Mark. We have the Health Canada medical device license for PainShield, a certificate by MOH allowing us to sell PainShield, WoundShield and UroShield in Israel, a certificate allowing us to sell PainShield in Australia, and we are able to sell PainShield, WoundShield and UroShield in India based on our CE Mark. In addition, our distributor in Korea has applied for approval to sell PainShield and UroShield. We generally apply, through our distributor, for approval in a particular country for a particular product only when we have a distributor in place with respect to such product.

&#160; 

&#160; 25 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

European Good Manufacturing Practices 

&#160;

In the European Union, the manufacture of medical devices is subject to good manufacturing practice, as set forth in the relevant laws and guidelines of the European Union and its member states. Compliance with good manufacturing practice is generally assessed by the competent regulatory authorities. Typically, quality system evaluation is performed by a notified body, which also recommends to the relevant competent authority for the European Community CE Marking of a device. The competent authority may conduct inspections of relevant facilities, and review manufacturing procedures, operating systems and personnel qualifications. In addition to obtaining approval for each product, in many cases each device manufacturing facility must be audited on a periodic basis by the notified body. Further inspections may occur over the life of the product.

&#160; 

U.S. Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws 

&#160;

In the U.S., there are federal and state anti-kickback laws that prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and services. Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. These laws are potentially applicable to manufacturers of products regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as medical devices, such as us, and hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of such products. Other provisions of federal and state laws provide civil and criminal penalties for presenting, or causing to be presented, to third-party payers for reimbursement, claims that are false or fraudulent, or which are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. In addition, certain states have implemented regulations requiring medical device and pharmaceutical companies to report all gifts and payments over $50 to medical practitioners. This requirement does not apply to instances involving clinical trials.

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160;

We initially sell our products both through our website and distribution agreements, with approximately 23% of our sales through distributors in 2015. We currently have exclusive distribution agreements for our products with medical product distributors based in the U.S. (for PainShield for abdominal and pelvic pain since 2012, Italy (since 2013), India (since 2012), United Kingdom (since 2010) and Israel (since 2012).

&#160;

We are currently in discussions with a number of distribution companies in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Current and future agreements with distributors stipulate that, while we are responsible for training, providing marketing guidance, marketing materials, and technical guidance, distributors will be responsible for carrying out local marketing activities and sales. In addition, in most cases, all sales costs, including sales representatives, incentive programs, and marketing trials, will be borne by the distributor. Under current agreements, distributors purchase our products from us at a fixed price. Our current agreements with distributors are generally for a term of approximately two to three years and automatically renew for an additional annual terms unless modified by either party.

We assemble our own products at our facilities in Nesher, Israel. All of the component parts of our products are readily available from a number of manufacturers and suppliers. We order component parts on an as-needed basis, generally from the manufacturer that provides us with the most competitive pricing. Our most significant suppliers are APC International, Ltd., Rotel Product Engineering Ltd. and Amit Industries L.T.D (AmiCell). We do not have written agreements with any of these suppliers, but we believe anyone could be easily replaced if necessary.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had 11 full-time employees and no part-time employees. Our employees are not party to any collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel.
