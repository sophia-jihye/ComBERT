 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

General Development of Business 

National HealthCare Corporation, which we also refer to as NHC or the Company, began business in 1971. Our principal business is the operation of skilled nursing facilities with associated assisted living and independent living facilities. Our business activities include providing sub-acute and post-acute skilled nursing care, intermediate nursing care, rehabilitative care, senior living services, and home health care services. We have a non-controlling ownership interest in a hospice care business that services NHC owned health care centers and others. In addition, we provide management services, accounting and financial services, and insurance services to third party operators of health care facilities. We also own the real estate of thirteen healthcare properties and lease these properties to third party operators. We operate in 10 states, and our owned and leased properties are located in the Southeastern, Northeastern, and Midwestern parts of the United States.

Narrative Description of the Business 

At December 31, 2015, we operate or manage 74 skilled nursing facilities with a total of 9,403 licensed beds. These numbers include 67 centers with 8,520 beds that we lease or own and seven centers with 883 beds that we manage for others. Of the 67 leased or owned facilities, 39 of the facilities are leased and 28 of the facilities are owned. Of the 39 leased facilities, 35 are leased from National Health Investors, Inc. (&#34;NHI&#34;). 

Our 20 assisted living facilities (nine leased, eight owned, and three managed) have 935 units (828 units leased or owned and 107 units managed). 

Our five independent living facilities (three leased, one owned, and one managed) have 475 retirement apartments (338 apartments leased or owned and 137 apartments managed). 

We operate 36 homecare programs licensed in four states (Tennessee, South Carolina, Missouri and Florida) and provided 455,551 homecare patient visits to 19,711 patients in 2015. 

We have a partnership agreement and a 75.1% non-controlling ownership interest in Caris Healthcare, LP (&#147;Caris&#148;), a business that specializes in hospice care services in NHC owned health care centers and in other settings. Caris provides hospice care to over 1,100 patients per day in 26 locations in Missouri, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. 

We operate specialized care units within certain of our healthcare centers such as Alzheimer's disease care units, sub-acute nursing units and a number of in-house pharmacies. Similar specialty units are under consideration at a number of our centers, as well as free standing projects. 

Net Patient Revenues. Health care services we provide include a comprehensive range of services. In fiscal 2015, 95.4% of our net operating revenues were derived from such health care services. Highlights of health care services activities during 2015 were as follows:

A.

Skilled Nursing Facilities. The most significant portion of our business and the base for our other health care services is the operation of our skilled nursing facilities. In our facilities, experienced medical professionals provide medical services prescribed by physicians. Registered nurses, licensed practical nurses and certified nursing assistants provide comprehensive, individualized nursing care 24 hours a day. In addition, our facilities provide licensed therapy services, quality nutrition services, social services, activities, and housekeeping and laundry services. We operate 74 skilled nursing facilities as of December 31, 2015. We manage seven facilities for third party owners. Revenues from the 67 facilities we own or lease are reported as net patient revenues in our financial statements. Management fee income is recorded as other revenues from the seven facilities that we manage. We generally charge 6% to 7% of facility net operating revenues for our management services. Occupancy in skilled nursing facilities we operate was 90.0% during the year ended December 31, 2015.

B.

Rehabilitative Services. We provide therapy services through Professional Health Services, a subsidiary of NHC. Our licensed therapists provide physical, speech, respiratory and occupational therapy for patients recovering from strokes, heart attacks, orthopedic conditions, neurological illnesses, or other illnesses, injuries or disabilities. We maintained a rehabilitation staff of over 1,600 highly trained, professional therapists in 2015. The majority of our rehabilitative services are for patients in our owned and managed skilled nursing facilities. However, we also provide services to over 75 additional health care providers. Our rates for these services are competitive with other market rates. 

C.

Medical Specialty Units. All of our skilled nursing facilities participate in the Medicare program, and we have expanded our range of offerings by the creation of center-specific medical specialty units such as our memory care units and subacute nursing units. Our trained staff provides care for Alzheimer&#146;s patients in early, middle and advanced stages of the disease. We provide specialized care and programs for persons with Alzheimer&#146;s or related disorders in dedicated units within many of our skilled nursing facilities. Our specialized rehabilitation programs are designed to shorten or eliminate hospital stays and help to reduce the cost of quality health care. We develop individualized patient care plans to target appropriate medical and functional planning objectives with a primary goal where feasible for a return to home or a similar environment.

D.

Assisted Living Facilities. Our assisted living facilities are dedicated to providing personal care services and assistance with general activities of daily living such as dressing, bathing, meal preparation and medication management. We perform resident assessments to determine what services are desired or required and our qualified staff encourages residents to participate in a range of activities. We own or lease 17 and manage three assisted living facilities. Of these 20 centers, thirteen are located within the physical structure of a skilled nursing facility or retirement center and seven are freestanding. In 2015, the rate of occupancy was 90.6%. Certificates of Need are not required to build these projects and we believe that overbuilding has occurred in some of our markets. 

E.

Independent Living Facilities. Our four owned or leased and one managed independent living facilities offer specially designed residential units for the active and ambulatory elderly and provide various ancillary services for our residents, including restaurants, activity rooms and social areas. Charges for services are paid from private sources without assistance from governmental programs. Independent living centers may be licensed and regulated in some states, but do not require the issuance of a Certificate of Need (&#34;CON&#34;) such as is required for skilled nursing facilities. We have, in several cases, developed independent living centers adjacent to our nursing facilities with an initial construction of 40 to 80 units. These units are rented by the month; thus these centers offer an expansion of our continuum of care. We believe these independent living units offer a positive marketing aspect of our skilled nursing facilities.

We have one owned retirement center which is a &#34;continuing care community&#34;, where the resident pays a substantial entrance fee and a monthly maintenance fee. The resident then receives a full range of services, including home health nursing, without additional charge.

F.

Homecare Programs. Our home health care programs (we call them homecares) assist those who wish to stay at home or in assisted living residences but still require some degree of medical care or assistance with daily activities. Registered and licensed practical nurses and therapy professionals provide skilled services such as infusion therapy, wound care and physical, occupational and speech therapies. Home health aides may assist with daily activities such as assistance with walking and getting in and out of bed, personal hygiene, medication assistance, light housekeeping and maintaining a safe environment. NHC operates 36 homecare licensed and Medicare-certified offices in four states (Tennessee, South Carolina, Missouri and Florida) and some of our homecare patients are previously discharged from our skilled nursing facilities. Medicare reimbursement for homecare services is paid under a prospective payment system. Under this payment system, we receive a prospectively determined amount per patient per 60 day episode as defined by Medicare guidelines. Medicare episodes were 21,736 in 2014 and 21,623 in 2015. We served 19,222 patients in 2014 and 19,711 patients in 2015. Visits provided were 477,323 in 2014 and 455,551 in 2015. 

G.

Pharmacy Operations. At December 31, 2015, we operated four regional pharmacy operations (one each in east Tennessee, central Tennessee, South Carolina, and Missouri). These pharmacy operations use a central location to supply pharmaceutical services (consulting and medications) 

and supplies. Regional pharmacies bill Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) electronically and directly for inpatients who have selected a PDP. Our regional pharmacies currently serve 56 owned facilities, six managed facilities, and 13 third party entities. 

Other Revenues. We generate revenues from management, accounting and financial services to third party operators of healthcare facilities, from insurance services to our managed healthcare facilities, and from rental income. In fiscal 2015, 4.6% of our net operating revenues were derived from such sources. The significant sources of our other revenues are described as follows:

A.

Management, Accounting and Financial Services. We provide management services to skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities and independent living facilities operated by third party operators. We typically charge 6% to 7% of the managed centers&#146; net operating revenues as a fee for these services. Additionally, we provide accounting and financial services to other skilled nursing facilities or related types of entities for small operators. No management services are provided for entities in which we provide accounting and financial services. As of December 31, 2015, we perform management services for 11 healthcare facilities and accounting and financial services for 20 healthcare facilities. 

B.

Insurance Services. NHC owns a Tennessee domestic licensed insurance company. The company is licensed in several states and provides workers&#146; compensation coverage to substantially all of NHC's operated and managed facilities in addition to other skilled nursing facilities, assisted living and independent living facilities. A second wholly owned insurance subsidiary is licensed in the Cayman Islands and provides general and professional liability coverage in substantially all of NHC&#146;s owned and managed centers. This company elects to be taxed as a domestic subsidiary. We also self-insure our employees&#146; (referred to as &#34;partners&#34;) health insurance benefit program at a cost we believe is less than a commercially obtained policy. Finally, we operate a long-term care insurance division, which is licensed to sell commercially underwritten long-term care policies. 

C.

Rental Income. The healthcare properties currently owned and leased to third party operators include nine skilled nursing facilities and four assisted living communities. 

Non-Operating Income. We generate non-operating income from equity in earnings of unconsolidated investments, from dividends and realized gains and losses on marketable securities, interest income, and other miscellaneous non-operating income. The significant source of non-operating income is described as follows:

Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Investments . Earnings from investments in entities in which we lack control but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for on the equity method. Our most significant equity method investment is a 75.1% non-controlling ownership interest in Caris Healthcare, L.P. (&#34;Caris&#34;), a business that specializes in hospice care services in NHC owned health care centers and in other settings. Caris currently has twenty-six locations serving four states (Missouri, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia).

For the projects under construction at December 31, 2015, the 90-bed skilled nursing facility and 80-unit assisted living facility located in Nashville, Tennessee is expected to begin operations in the third quarter of 2016; the 76-unit assisted living facility in Bluffton, SC is expected to begin operations in the third quarter of 2016; the 80-unit assisted living facility in Garden City, SC is expected to begin operations in the fourth quarter of 2016; and the 112 bed replacement center that will combine the 92 beds of NHC Hillview in Columbia, Tennessee with 20 beds from the existing skilled nursing unit at Maury Regional Medical Center is expected to being operations in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

During 2016, we plan to apply for Certificates of Need for additional beds in certain of our markets. We also will evaluate the feasibility of expansion into new markets by building private pay health care centers or assisted living communities.

Skilled Nursing Facilities 

The skilled nursing facilities operated by our subsidiaries provide in-patient skilled and intermediate nursing care services and in-patient and out-patient rehabilitation services. Skilled nursing care consists of 24-hour nursing service by registered or licensed practical nurses and related medical services prescribed by the patient's physician. Intermediate nursing care consists of similar services on a less intensive basis principally provided by non-licensed personnel. These distinctions are generally found in the health care industry although for Medicaid reimbursement purposes, some states in which we operate have additional classifications, while in other states the Medicaid rate is the same regardless of patient classification. Rehabilitative services consist of physical, speech, and occupational therapies, which are designed to aid the patient's recovery and enable the patient to resume normal activities.

Each health care facility has a licensed administrator responsible for supervising daily activities, and larger facilities have assistant administrators. All have medical directors, a director of nurses and full-time registered nurse coverage. All centers provide physical therapy and most have other rehabilitative programs, such as occupational or speech therapy. Each facility is located near at least one hospital and is qualified to accept patients discharged from such hospitals. Each facility has a full dining room, kitchen, treatment and examining room, emergency lighting system, and sprinkler system where required. Management believes that all facilities are in compliance with the existing fire and life safety codes.

We provide centralized management and support services to NHC operated healthcare facilities. The management and support services include operational support through the use of regional vice presidents and regional nurses, accounting and financial services, cash management, data processing, legal, consulting and services in the area of rehabilitative care. Our personnel are employed by our administrative services affiliate, National Health Corporation (&#34;National&#34;), which is also responsible for overall services in the area of personnel, loss control, health insurance, education and training. We reimburse the administrative services contractor by paying all the costs of personnel employed for our benefit as well as a fee. National is wholly owned by the National Health Corporation Employee Stock Ownership Plan and provides its services only to us. 

We provide management services to centers operated under management contracts and offsite accounting and financial services to other third party owners, all pursuant to separate contracts. The term of each contract and the amount of the management fee or accounting and financial services fee is determined on a case-by-case basis. Typically, we charge 6% to 7% of net operating revenues of the managed centers for our management contracts and specific item fees for our accounting and financial service agreements. The initial terms of the contracts range from two years to ten years. In certain contracts, we maintain a right of first refusal should the owner desire to sell a managed center.

Skilled Nursing Facility Occupancy Rates 

The following table shows certain information relating to occupancy rates for our owned and leased skilled nursing facilities:

&#160;

&#160;

Overall census

90.0%

&#160;

88.9%

&#160;

89.2%

Occupancy rates are calculated by dividing the total number of days of patient care provided by the number of patient days available (which is determined by multiplying the number of licensed beds by 365 or 366).

Customers and Sources of Revenues 

No individual customer, or related group of customers, accounts for a significant portion of our revenues. We do not expect the loss of a single customer or group of related customers would have a material adverse effect.

Certain groups of patients receive funds to pay the cost of their care from a common source. The following table sets forth sources of net patient revenues for the periods indicated:

The source and amount of the revenues are further dependent upon (i) the licensed bed capacity of our health care facilities, (ii) the occupancy rate of the facilities, (iii) the extent to which the rehabilitative and other skilled ancillary services provided at each facility are utilized by the patients in the centers, (iv) the mix of private pay, Medicare, Managed Care and Medicaid patients, and (v) the rates paid by our various payor sources. 

We attempt to attract an increased percentage of private, managed care and Medicare patients by providing rehabilitative and other post-acute care services. These services are designed to speed the patient's recovery and allow the patient to return home as soon as it is practical. 

Medicare is a health insurance program for the aged and certain other chronically disabled individuals operated by the federal government. Medicare covers nursing home services for beneficiaries who require nursing care and/or rehabilitation services following a hospitalization of at least three consecutive days. For each eligible day a Medicare beneficiary is in a skilled nursing facility, Medicare pays the facility a daily payment, subject to adjustment for certain factors such as wage index in the particular geographic area. The payment covers all services provided by the skilled nursing facility for the beneficiary that day, including room and board, nursing, therapy and drugs, as well as an estimate of capital-related costs to deliver those services. 

Medicaid is a medical assistance program for the indigent, operated by individual states with the financial participation of the federal government. The states in which we operate currently use prospective cost-based reimbursement systems. Under cost-based reimbursement systems, the skilled nursing facility is reimbursed for the reasonable direct and indirect allowable costs it incurred in a base year in providing routine resident care services as defined by the program.

Private pay, managed care, and other payment sources include commercial insurance, individual patient funds, managed care plans and the Veterans Administration. Although payment rates vary among these sources, market forces and costs largely determine these rates. Private paying patients, private insurance carriers and the Veterans Administration generally pay on the basis of the center's charges or specifically negotiated contracts. 

We contract with over 60 managed care organizations (&#34;MCO's&#34;) and insurance carriers for the provision of subacute and other medical specialty services by our owned and managed facilities. Managed care patient days were 259,471 in 2015; 242,621 in 2014; 181,152 in 2013. 

Regulation and Licenses 

Health care is an area of extensive regulatory oversight and frequent regulatory change. The federal government and the states in which we operate regulate various aspects of our business. These regulatory bodies, among other things, require us annually to license our skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities in some states and other health care businesses, including home health. In particular, to operate nursing facilities and provide health care services we must comply with federal, state and local laws relating to the delivery and adequacy of medical care, distribution of pharmaceuticals, equipment, personnel, operating policies, fire prevention, rate-setting, building codes and environmental protection.

Governmental and other authorities periodically inspect our skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies to assure that we continue to comply with their various standards. We must pass these inspections to continue our licensing under state law, to obtain certification under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and to continue our participation in the Veterans Administration program. We can only participate in other third-party programs if our facilities pass these inspections. In addition, these authorities inspect our record keeping and inventory control.

From time to time, we, like others in the health care industry, may receive notices from federal and state regulatory agencies alleging that we failed to comply with applicable standards. These notices may require us to take corrective action, and may impose civil money penalties and/or other operating restrictions. If our skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies fail to comply with these directives or otherwise fail to comply substantially with licensure and certification laws, rules and regulations, we could lose our certification as a Medicare and Medicaid provider and/or lose our licenses. 

Local and state health and social service agencies and other regulatory authorities specific to their location regulate, to varying degrees, our assisted living facilities. Although regulations and licensing requirements vary significantly from state to state, they typically address, among other things, personnel education, training and records; facility services, including administration of medication, assistance with supervision of medication management and limited nursing services; physical plant specifications; furnishing of resident units; food and housekeeping services; emergency evacuation plans; and resident rights and responsibilities. If assisted living facilities fail to comply with licensing requirements, these facilities could lose their licenses. Most states also subject assisted living facilities to state or local building codes, fire codes and food service licensure or certification requirements. In addition, the manner and extent to which the assisted living industry is regulated at federal and state levels are evolving. 

Changes in the laws or new interpretations of existing laws as applied to the skilled nursing facilities, the assisted living facilities or other components of our health care businesses, may have a significant impact on our operations.

In all states in which we operate, before a skilled nursing facility can make a capital expenditure exceeding certain specified amounts or construct any new skilled health care beds, approval of the state health care regulatory agency or agencies must be obtained and a Certificate of Need issued. The appropriate state health planning agency must review the Certificate of Need according to state specific guidelines before a Certificate of Need can be issued. A Certificate of Need is generally issued for a specific maximum amount of expenditure and the project must be completed within a specific time period. There is no advance assurance that we will be able to obtain a Certificate of Need in any particular instance. In some states, approval is also necessary in order to purchase existing health care beds, although the purchaser is normally permitted to avoid a full scale Certificate of Need application procedure by giving advance written notice of the acquisition and giving written assurance to the state regulatory agency that the change of ownership will not result in a change in the number of beds, services offered and, in some cases, reimbursement rates at the facility.

While there are currently no significant legislative proposals to eliminate Certificates of Need pertaining to skilled nursing care in the states in which we do business, deregulation in the Certificate of Need area would likely result in increased competition and could adversely affect occupancy rates and the supply of licensed and certified personnel.

Medicare and Medicaid Participation 

All health care centers, owned, leased or managed by us are certified to participate in Medicare. Health care centers participating in Medicare are known as SNFs (&#34;Skilled Nursing Facilities&#34;). All but seven of our affiliated nursing centers participate in Medicaid. All of our homecares (Home health agencies) participate in Medicare, which comprises over 80% of their revenue. Homecares also participate in Medicaid. 

During the fiscal years, we received payments from Medicare and, if participating, from Medicaid. We record as receivables the amounts we ultimately expect to receive under the Medicare and Medicaid programs and record into profit or loss any differences in amounts actually received at the time of interim or final settlements. Adjustments have not had a material adverse effect within the last three years.

Certifications and Participation Requirements; Efforts to Impose Reduced Payments 

Changes in certification and participation requirements of the Medicare and Medicaid programs have restricted, and are likely to continue to restrict further, eligibility for reimbursement under those programs. Failure to obtain and maintain Medicare and Medicaid certification at our nursing centers would result in denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments which would likely result in a significant loss of revenue. In addition, private payors, including managed care payors, increasingly are demanding that providers accept discounted payments resulting in lost revenue for specific patients. Efforts to impose reduced payments, greater discounts and more stringent cost controls by government and other payors are expected to continue. Any reforms that significantly limit rates of reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows. We are unable to predict what reform proposals or reimbursement limitations will be adopted in the future or the effect such changes will have on our operations. No assurance can be given that such reforms will not have a material adverse effect on us.

Medicare Legislation and Regulations 

Federal Health Care Reform 

In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (&#34;PPACA&#34; or, commonly, &#147;ACA&#148;) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (&#34;HCERA&#34;), which represents significant changes to the current U.S. health care system (collectively the &#34;Acts&#34;). The primary goals of the Acts are to: (1) expand coverage to Americans without health insurance, (2) reform the delivery system to improve quality and drive efficiency, (3) and to lower the overall costs of providing health care. The timeline of the enacted provisions span over several years &#150; some of the provisions were effective immediately in 2010 and others will be phased in through 2020. 

Since a significant goal of federal health care reform is to transform the delivery of health care by holding providers accountable for the cost and quality of care provided, Medicare and many commercial third party payors are implementing Accountable Care Organization (&#34;ACO&#34;) models in which groups of providers share in the benefit and risk of providing care to an assigned group of individuals. Other reimbursement methodology reforms in which we are participating or expect to participate in include value-based purchasing, in which a portion of provider reimbursement is redistributed based on relative performance on designated economic, clinical quality, and patient satisfaction metrics. Also, CMS is implementing demonstration programs, in which we are participating in a limited way, to bundle acute care and post-acute care reimbursement to hold providers accountable for costs across a broader continuum of care. These reimbursement methodologies and similar programs are likely to continue and expand, both in public and commercial health plans. In January 2015, CMS announced its goal by 2016 to have 30% of Medicare payments through alternative payment models such as ACOs or bundled payments and up to 50% by the end of 2018. Providers who respond successfully to these trends and are able to deliver quality care at lower costs are likely to benefit financially.

Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs) 

SNF PPS - Medicare is uniform nationwide and reimburses nursing centers under a fixed payment methodology named the Skilled Nursing Facility Prospective Payment System (&#34;SNF PPS&#34;). SNF PPS is an acuity based classification system that uses nursing and therapy indexes adjusted by geographical wage indexes to calculate per diem rates for each Medicare patient. Payment rates are updated annually and are generally increased or decreased each October when the federal fiscal year begins. The acuity classification system is named RUGs (Resource Utilization Groups IV). There are currently 66 classifications of RUG groups. 

In July 2015, CMS released its final rule outlining the fiscal year 2016 Medicare payments for skilled nursing facilities, which began October 1, 2015. The 2016 final rule provides for an approximate 1.2% rate update. This estimated increase consists of a 2.3% market basket increase, reduced by a 0.6% forecast error adjustment and further reduced 0.5% for a multifactor productivity adjustment required by the ACA. CMS estimates the update will increase overall payments to skilled nursing facilities in fiscal year 2016 by $430 million compared to fiscal year 2015 levels. The effect of the 2016 PPS rate update on our revenues will be dependent upon our census and the mix of our patients at the various PPS pay rates.

In August 2014, CMS released its skilled nursing facility PPS update for the fiscal year 2015, which began October 1, 2014. The final rule provided for a 2.0% rate update, which reflected a 2.5% market basket increase less a 0.5% multifactor productivity adjustment as required by the ACA. CMS estimated the update would increase overall payments to skilled nursing facilities in fiscal year 2015 by $750 million compared to fiscal year 2014 levels. The 2015 final rule also included wage index updates, revisions to the change of therapy (COT) other Medicare required assessment (OMRA) policy, and comments pertaining to CMS&#146; observations on therapy utilization trends. 

In July 2013, CMS released its skilled nursing facility PPS update for the fiscal year 2014, which began October 1, 2013. The notice provided for a 1.3% rate update, which reflected a 2.3% market basket increase less a 0.5% multifactor productivity adjustment and a 0.5% adjustment to correct market basket forecasting errors in fiscal year 2012. CMS estimated the update increased overall payments to skilled nursing facilities in fiscal year 2014 by $470 million compared to fiscal year 2013 levels. 

Homecares (HHAs) 

HH PPS - Medicare is uniform nationwide and reimburses homecares under a fixed payment methodology named the Home Health Prospective Payment System (&#34;HH PPS&#34;). Generally, Medicare makes payments under the HH PPS on the basis of a national standardized 60-day episode payment, adjusted for case mix and geographical wage index. Payment rates are updated at the beginning of each calendar year. The acuity classification system is named HHRGs (Home Health Resource Groups).

In October 2015 and effective January 1, 2016, CMS released its final rule for 2016 home health prospective payment system rates. CMS estimates that the net impact of the PPS rule will result in a 1.5% decrease ($260 million) in Medicare payments for agencies in 2016. The payment decrease reflects the impact of a 1.9% inflation update offset by a .97% decrease to account for upcoding of claims, a 2.4% decrease required by the third year of the four-year phase-in of the rebasing adjustments, and a decrease resulting from a change in the conversion factor for non-routine medical supplies. The final rule also establishes a value-based purchasing model set to begin January 1, 2016 for Medicare-certified agencies in nine states, including Tennessee and Florida. 

In October 2014 and effective January 1, 2015, CMS released its final rule for the 2015 home health prospective payment system. The final rule reduced home health payments overall by 0.3 percent from 2014 payment levels. The payment decrease reflected the impact of the 2.1% home health payment update ($390 million increase) and the second year of the four-year phase-in of the rebasing adjustments to the national, standardized 60-day episode payment rate, the national per-visit payment rates, and the non-routine medical supplies conversion factor (2.4% or $450 million decrease). The final rule also made adjustments to the new home health face-to-face requirements and updated the Home Health Quality Reporting Program. 

In November 2013 and effective January 1, 2014, CMS issued the final rule for 2014 home health prospective payment system rates, which included (i) a market basket increase of 2.3 percent, (ii) rebasing of Medicare reimbursement rates, with ann ual reductions of 3.5 percent for each of the next four years beginning January 2014, (iii) changes in the Wage Index with no overall impact and (iv) rebasing all case mix weights to 1.0 from an average case mix weight of 1.3464 in 2013, as provided for under the Affordable Care Act. The rule also provided for changes in low utilization payments amounts and the removal of 170 diagnosis codes, among other changes. 

Medicaid Legislation and Regulations 

Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNF) 

State Medicaid plans subject to budget constraints are of particular concern to us. Changes in federal funding coupled with state budget problems and Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act have produced an uncertain environment. States will more likely than not be unable to keep pace with nursing center inflation. States are under pressure to pursue other alternatives to long term care such as community and home-based services. 

Effective July 1, 2014 and for the fiscal year 2015, the state of Tennessee implemented individual skilled nursing facility rate changes. With new state legislation being passed for the 2015 fiscal year, there are four components that impact Tennessee Medicaid reimbursement for skilled nursing facilities: a Level I or Level II per diem, a quarterly acuity payment, a quarterly Quality Improvement in Long-Term Services and Supports (&#34;QuILTSS&#34;) payment (which are incentives based on qualifying criteria in several categories), and an assessment fee (expense). Effective July 1, 2014, each facility will now be charged an assessment fee based on 4.5% of net patient revenues. The assessment fee is replacing the former bed tax fee. In summary and for the 2015 fiscal year, 

the Tennessee Medicaid reimbursement changes increased income before income taxes by approximately $3,000,000 annually, or $750,000 per quarter. 

Effective July 1, 2015 and for the fiscal year 2016, the state of Tennessee implemented specific individual nursing facility rate increases. We estimate the resulting increase in revenue beginning July 1, 2015 will be approximately $4,000,000 annually, or $1,000,000 per quarter. 

Effective October 1, 2014 and for the fiscal year 2015, South Carolina implemented specific individual nursing facility rate increases. The resulting increase in revenue beginning October 1, 2014 was approximately $1,800,000 annually, or $450,000.

Effective October 1, 2015 and for the fiscal year 2016, South Carolina implemented specific individual nursing facility rate changes. We estimate the resulting rate changes for the 2016 fiscal year will have an immaterial impact on revenues.

Competition 

In most of the communities in which we operate health care centers, there are other health care centers with which we compete. We own, lease or manage (through subsidiaries) 74 skilled nursing facilities located in nine states. Each of these states is a certificate of need states which generally requires the state to approve the opening of any new skilled nursing facilities. There are hundreds of operators of skilled nursing facilities in each of these states and no single operator, including us, dominates any of these state&#146;s skilled nursing care markets, except for some small rural markets which might have only one skilled nursing facility. In competing for patients and staff with these facilities, we depend upon referrals from acute care hospitals, physicians, residential care facilities, church groups and other community service organizations. The reputation in the community and the physical appearance of our facilities are important in obtaining patients, since members of the patient&#146;s family generally participate to a greater extent in selecting skilled nursing facilities than in selecting an acute care hospital. We believe that by providing and emphasizing rehabilitative as well as skilled care services at our facilities, we are able to broaden our patient base and to differentiate our facilities from competing skilled nursing facilities.

As we expand into the assisted living market, we monitor proposed or existing competing assisted living centers. Our development goal is to link our skilled nursing facilities with our assisted living centers, thereby obtaining a competitive advantage for both. 

Our homecares compete with other home health agencies (HHA&#146;s) in most communities we serve. Competition occurs for patients and employees. Our homecares depend on hospital and physician referrals and reputation in order to maintain a healthy census. 

We experience competition in employing and retaining nurses, technicians, aides and other high quality professional and non-professional employees. In order to enhance our competitive position, we have an educational tuition loan program, an American Dietetic Association approved internship program, a specially designed nurse's aide training class, and we make financial scholarship aid available to physical therapy vocational programs. We support the Foundation for Geriatric Education. We also conduct an &#34;Administrator in Training&#34; course, 24 months in duration, for the professional training of administrators. Presently, we have nine full-time individuals in this program. Four of our six regional vice presidents, our regional administrator, and 49 of our 74 health care center administrators are graduates of this program.

We experience competition in providing management and accounting services to other long-term health care providers. Those services are provided primarily to owners with whom we have had previous involvement through ownership or leasing arrangements. Our insurance services are provided primarily to centers for which we also provide management and/or accounting services. 

Our employee benefit package offers a tuition reimbursement program. The goal of the program is to insure a well-trained qualified work force to meet future demands. While the program is offered to all disciplines, special emphasis has been placed on supporting students in nursing and physical therapy programs. Students are reimbursed at the end of each semester after presenting tuition receipts and grades to management. The program has been successful in providing a means for many bright students to pursue a formal education.

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, our Administrative Services Contractor (National Health Corporation) had approximately 13,225 full and part time employees, who we call &#34;Partners&#34;. No employees are represented by a bargaining unit. We believe our current relations with our employees are good.
