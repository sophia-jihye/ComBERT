 Item 1. 

Business 

The Company 

Gibraltar Industries, Inc. (the "Company") is a leading manufacturer and distributor of building products for industrial, transportation infrastructure, residential housing, renewable energy and resource conservation markets. Beginning in mid-2014, led by new executive leadership, the Company began a re-examination of its operations, competitive advantages, and strategies, all directed at re-setting a business strategy that would significantly elevate and accelerate the growth and financial returns of the Company. The new strategy, completed in late 2014, with execution initiated in 2015, is targeted at delivering best-in-class, sustainable value creation for our shareholders for the long-term. This value-generating strategy is intended to drive a transformational change in the Company&#8217;s portfolio and its financial results; and it has four key elements: operational excellence, product innovation, portfolio management, and acquisitions as a strategic accelerator. 

Operational excellence is our first pillar in this strategy. 80/20 simplification ("80/20") is core to this part of the strategy which is based on the proven theory that 25% of the customers typically generate 89% of the revenue in a business, and 150% of the profitability. We are refocusing on the relatively small set of customers who bring in the vast majority of our revenue and profits, while working to raise other customers&#8217; sales and margin profiles in a fair and responsible manner. Along these same lines, 25% of a company&#8217;s products are typically responsible for 89% of the revenue, so at the same time, we are focusing our resources on the high-volume customers and products that provide us with the greatest return. 

We started the simplification process in the fourth quarter of 2014, with a comprehensive data analysis. We initiated execution in 2015 and are still in the early stages of implementation. We believe that over the first three years, we will drive 200 to 300 basis points of operating margin improvement from the 80/20 process with corresponding benefits from the resulting reduction of operational assets. 

Product innovation is our second strategic pillar. Innovation is about allocating new and existing resources to opportunities that drive sustainable returns. We are focused on those products and technologies that have relevance to the end-user and can be differentiated from our competition. Our focus on innovation is centered on four areas: postal and parcel products, residential air management, infrastructure, and renewable energy. These respective markets are expected to grow based on demand for centralized mail and parcel delivery systems; zero carbon footprint homes; the large proportion of elevated bridges being structurally deficient or functionally obsolete; and energy sources not dependent on fossil fuels. 

The third pillar of our strategy is portfolio management, which is a natural adjunct to the 80/20 initiative. Using the 80/20 process, we are evaluating all aspects of our current portfolio for future profitable growth and greater shareholder returns which will lead to consideration of any necessary refinements. 

The final pillar of our strategy is acquisitions. We are focused on making strategic acquisitions in five key markets, four of which are served by existing platforms within the Company, including one platform acquired in June 2015, and the other is new. The existing platforms include the same areas where we are targeting the development of innovative products: postal and parcel solutions, infrastructure, residential air management and renewable energy. The remaining new platform is water management. What these growth platforms all have in common is that they are all large markets in which the underlying trends for customer convenience and safety, energy-savings and resource conservation are of increasing importance and are expected to drive long-term demand. These markets also offer the opportunity for higher returns on our investments than what we have generated in the past. The acquisition of Rough Brothers Manufacturing, Inc., RBI Solar, Inc., and affiliates, collectively known as "RBI" in June 2015 was the direct result of this fourth initiative. 

The Company serves customers primarily throughout North America, Europe, and, to a lesser extent Asia. Our customers include major home improvement retailers, wholesalers, industrial distributors, contractors, solar developers and institutional and commercial growers of plants. As of December 31, 2015 , we operated 48 &#32;facilities in 19 &#32;states, Canada, England, Germany, China and Japan which includes 33 &#32;manufacturing facilities and eight &#32;distribution centers, giving us a base of operations to provide customer support, delivery, service and quality to a number of regional and national customers and providing us with manufacturing and distribution efficiencies in North America, as well as a presence in the European and Asian markets. 

The Company operates and reports its results in the following three operating segments, entitled &#8220;Residential Products&#8221;, &#8220;Industrial and Infrastructure Products&#8221; and "Renewable Energy and Conservation". 

Our Residential Products segment focuses on the new residential housing construction and residential repair and remodeling activity. Its products are sold through major retail home centers, building material wholesalers, buying groups, roofing distributors, and residential contractors. 

Our Industrial and Infrastructure Products segment focuses on a variety of markets including discrete and process manufacturing, highway and bridge construction markets, energy and power generation. This segment&#8217;s products are distributed through industrial, commercial and transportation contractors, industrial distributors and original equipment manufacturers. 

Our Renewable Energy and Conservation segment focuses on the design, engineering, manufacturing and installation of solar racking systems and greenhouse structures. This segment's services and products are provided directly to end users and through product distribution channels. 

The following table sets forth the primary products, applications, and end markets for each segment:

We believe that we have established a reputation as an industry leader in our operating segments with respect to quality, service and innovation and have achieved strong competitive positions in our markets. We attribute our standing in the markets primarily to the following competitive strengths: 

Leading market share. &#32;We have a leading market position in many of the products and services we offer, and we estimate that a majority of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;were derived from the sale of products in which we had one of the leading U.S. market shares. We believe we have leading market shares in four distinct product families: roof-related ventilation; postal and parcel storage; bar grating; and structural bearings and expansion joints for bridges and other structures. &#32; Furthermore, as a result of the acquisition of RBI, we are one of the leading manufacturers of greenhouses for retail and institutional applications in the U.S., as well as, one of the U.S.'s fastest growing providers of racking for photovoltaic solar systems. 

Provider of value-added products and services. &#32;We increasingly focus on value-added products and services, such as mail and package storage solutions, expansion joints and structural bearings for roadways and bridges, ventilation products, solar racking systems, and greenhouses for innovative business opportunities to improve our margins and profitability. Our products use complex and demanding production and treatment processes that require advanced production equipment, sophisticated technology and exacting quality control measures, along with specialized design and engineering skills. We have also targeted our acquisition strategy on manufacturers of innovative value-added products in key growth markets. 

Solid relationships with blue-chip customers. &#32;We have strong relationships with our customers, which include some of the largest distributors, retailers, institutional customers and contractors in the markets we serve. We have gained long-standing relationships, and we maintain and develop those relationships by offering an increasing range of products and providing quality customer support. 

Commitment to quality . We place great importance on providing our customers with high quality products for use in critical construction applications. We carefully select our raw material vendors and use inspection and analysis to maintain our quality standards so our products meet critical customer specifications. To meet customer specifications, we use documented procedures utilizing statistical process control systems linked directly to processing equipment to monitor many stages of production. A number of our facilities&#8217; quality systems are registered under ISO 9001, an internationally recognized set of quality-assurance standards, and other industry standards. 

Strong liquidity profile . We strive to manage our cash resources to ensure we have sufficient liquidity to support the seasonality of our businesses, potential downturns in economic activity, and to fund growth initiatives. During the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;, we financed the purchase of RBI through a combination of approximately $118 million of cash on hand and borrowings of $30 million under the Company's revolving credit facility. These borrowings were subsequently paid prior to the end of 2015. Our liquidity as of December 31, 2015 &#32;was $ 348 million , including $69 million &#32;of cash and $279 million of availability under our revolving credit facility. We believe that our low leverage and ample liquidity allow us to successfully manage our business, meet the demands of our customers, weather the cyclicality of certain end markets and take advantage of growth opportunities. 

History of growth through acquisitions. &#32;Over the last decade, we also have grown through acquisitions, such as RBI, (solar racking systems and greenhouses), D.S. Brown (expansion joints and bearing for roads and bridges), and Florence Manufacturing (mail storage), to help diversify our products and customers while growing our net sales and earnings, and improving our operating characteristics. One of the key pillars of our Company's value-generating strategy is to use acquisitions as a strategic accelerator to drive a transformational change in our portfolio and its financial results. 

Recent developments 

On June 9, 2015, the Company acquired RBI for $148 million . RBI has established itself during the past six years among North America&#8217;s fastest-growing providers of solar racking solutions and is also one of the largest manufacturers of commercial greenhouses in North America. RBI is a full service provider that engineers, manufactures and installs solar racking systems for solar developers and power companies. In addition, RBI designs, manufactures and erects greenhouses for commercial, institutional and retail customers. The acquisition of RBI is expected to enable the Company to leverage its expertise in structural metals manufacturing, materials sourcing and logistics to help meet the fast-growing global demand for solar racking solutions. The results of RBI have been included in the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial results since the date of the acquisition. The acquisition was financed through cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 

Structured succession plan. &#32;As part of a multi-year strategy developed by the Company's Board of Directors, an executive search committee was created to execute a leadership succession plan. The executive search committee consisted of Board members who used an outside search firm to identify potential candidates to fill the vacated President and Chief Operating Officer role and eventually assume the Chief Executive Office role. After an extensive search process, Frank Heard was hired in May 2014 as President and Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Heard joined our Company with extensive experience in the building products industry, including his 32 years of employment at Illinois Tool Works, Inc. In December 2014, the Board announced the appointment of Mr. Heard as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and a member of the Board of Directors effective January 1, 2015. 

Mr. Heard succeeded Brian Lipke who had been our CEO since 1987, the Chairman of our Board since 1992 and a director since the Company&#8217;s initial public offering. Mr. Lipke announced in October 2014 his intention to retire. He served as CEO through January 1, 2015 and as Executive Chairman of the Board until May 31, 2015 when he retired from the Board. At that time, William Montague, the Company&#8217;s Lead Independent Director was elected as Chairman of the Board. 

In conjunction with the succession plan, several transitions were made on the Board of Directors in 2014 and 2015. Two directors retired at the end of 2014, three other directors, including Mr. Lipke, retired in 2015, and one additional director will retire in May 2016. Three new board members were elected and began service during 2014. In 2015, two additional new members were elected and began service during the year. The election and service of the new directors in both years occurred prior to the retirements of the seasoned directors in order to facilitate a smooth transition upon these retirements. These new board members bring a complement of industry, organizational development and governmental experience to the board. 

Experienced Management Team. Our executive management team is composed of talented and experienced managers possessing broad experience in operational excellence, new product development, and driving profitable growth gained over multiple business cycles. Along with the employment of Mr. Heard in 2014 as President and subsequent appointment as CEO, we made other senior leadership changes in early 2015, including the hiring and appointment of Kevin Viravec, the Industrial and Infrastructure Products President, along with the hiring of Paul Plourde, in the newly created position as leader of business development. Other developments include changes in leadership effective early 2015 in our Residential Products segment for both our postal and parcel products and our ventilation and roofing-related products, where Stephen Duffy and Charles Jerasa assumed new leadership positions, respectively. The acquisition of RBI resulted in the experienced hire of Rich Reilly, leader of the renewable energy group. 

Economic Trends 

End markets served by our business are subject to economic conditions which include but are not limited to interest rates, exchange rates, commodity costs, demand for residential construction, demand for repair and remodeling, government funding, tax policies and incentives, the level of industrial construction and transportation infrastructure projects, and demand for renewable energy sources. 

During 2015 and 2014, residential construction markets continued to steadily and slowly improve with U.S. new housing starts reaching 1.1 million in 2015. Residential repair and remodel activity also continued to improve over the past two years, along with a slight increase in re-roofing activity, which correlates to demand for our roof-related products. While a slight market lift from the residential housing market was experienced during 2015, we generated incremental sales of our centralized mail storage products as postal authorities undertook an initial effort to transition from door-to-door delivery. 

In our Industrial and Infrastructure Products segment, sales declined for 2015. The sales decrease was primarily impacted by a volume decline in our industrial products sold to the energy-related sector resulting from lower oil and gas prices as compared to 2014. Demand for our infrastructure products remained equivalent to 2014, but low due to the continued uncertainty of government funding for U.S. transportation products during the year. At the end of 2015, a new five-year infrastructure bill was passed reauthorizing U.S. federal transportation funding that should favorably impact demand for our products over the next few years. 

Demand for solar racking systems increased over the past year as end users continue to look for renewable energy sources that are not dependent on fossil fuels. In late 2015, U.S. legislation extending the Solar Investment Tax Credit was signed into law extending the credit beyond 2016 for both residential and commercial projects which is expected to stimulate additional demand for our solar racking systems. Also, demand for greenhouses increased in 2015 for locally grown produce and seed research. 

Commodity prices for materials such as steel and aluminum have also declined during the year. These fluctuations impact the cost of raw materials we purchase and the pricing we offer to our customers. 

Products 

Residential Products 

The Residential Products segment is primarily, but not exclusively, a manufacturer of metal and resin-based products used in residential new construction and for home repair and remodeling. This segment operates 12 &#32;manufacturing facilities and two &#32;distribution centers throughout the United States giving it a base of operations to provide customer support, delivery, service, and quality to a number of regional and national customers, while providing manufacturing and distribution efficiencies in North America. 

We manufacture an extensive variety of products that are sold through a number of sales channels including major retail home centers, building material wholesalers, buying groups, roofing distributors, and residential contractors. 

Our product offerings include a full line of roof and foundation ventilation products and accessories, including solar powered units; postal and parcel storage products, including single mailboxes, cluster boxes for multi-unit housing and package locker systems; roof edging and flashing; soffits and trim; drywall corner bead; metal roofing and accessories; rain dispersion products, including gutters and accessories; and exterior retractable awnings; each of which can be sold separately or as an integral part of a program sale. 

We improve our offerings of residential products by introducing new products, enhancing existing products, adjusting product specifications to respond to building code and regulatory changes, and providing additional solutions to homeowners and contractors. New products introduced in recent years include electronic parcel lockers, roof top safety kits, chimney caps, heat trace coils and exterior, remote-controlled deck awnings for sun protection, and solar-powered ventilation products. Our electronic parcel lockers provide residents in multifamily communities a secure receptacle to handle both package deliveries and receipt of other delivered goods. Our ventilation and roof flashing products afford protection and extend the life of structures while providing a safer, healthier environment for the residents. Our cluster box mail delivery products provide delivery cost savings to the postal service while offering secure storage for delivered mail and packages. Our building products are manufactured primarily from galvanized and painted steel, anodized and painted aluminum, and various resins. 

Our production capabilities allow us to process a wide range of metals and plastics necessary for manufacturing residential products. Most of our production is completed using automatic roll forming machines, stamping presses, paint lines, and 

injection molding equipment. We maintain our equipment with a thorough preventive maintenance program allowing us to meet the demanding quality and delivery requirements of our customers. Gibraltar also sources some products from third-party vendors when cost savings can be generated. 

Industrial and Infrastructure Products 

The Industrial and Infrastructure Products segment is primarily, but not exclusively, a manufacturer and distributor of metal products used in a variety of end markets such as discrete and process manufacturing, highway and bridge construction, energy and mining. We operate 16 &#32;manufacturing facilities and five &#32;distribution centers throughout the United States, Canada, England, and Germany, giving us a base of operations to provide customer support, delivery, service, and quality to a number of regional and national customers, and providing us with manufacturing and distribution efficiencies in North America, as well as a presence in the European market. 

We manufacture an extensive variety of products that are sold through a number of sales channels including industrial, commercial and transportation contractors and industrial fabricators. 

Our product offerings include a full line of fabricated bar grating and safety plank grating used in industrial flooring, walkways, stairs, platforms, safety barriers, drainage covers, and ventilation grates; expanded and perforated metal used in walkways, catwalks, automotive trim, shelving, fencing, barriers, and other applications where both visibility and security are necessary; fiberglass grating used in areas where high strength, light weight, low maintenance, and corrosion resistance are required; and expansion joint systems, bearing assemblies, and pavement sealing systems used in bridges, elevated highways, airport runways, and rail crossings. 

We improve our offerings of industrial and infrastructure products by introducing new products, enhancing existing products, adjusting product specifications to respond to commercial building code and regulatory changes, and providing additional solutions to original equipment manufacturers and contractors. New products introduced in recent years include customized perforated and expanded metal to penetrate a range of new markets such as architectural facades for buildings (museums, sports stadiums and retail outlets); front grilles for a major truck tractor manufacturer; interior ceilings and lighting fixtures; and outdoor railings and balustrades. Our expanded grating fabrication capabilities have been successfully serving new applications such as wind towers and our manufacturing process of aluminum-swaged grating has extended our sales penetration into the water and wastewater markets. In addition, we have extended our transportation infrastructure products into new markets. For example, long-lasting pavement sealants for roadways are now being installed on airport runways; structural bearings for elevated highways and bridges have been installed on an offshore oil production platform; and corrosion-protection products for cable-suspension bridges are now marketed and sold internationally. 

Our production capabilities allow us to process a wide range of metals necessary for manufacturing industrial products. Most of our production is completed using computer numerical control ("CNC&#8221;) machines, shears, slitters, press brakes, milling, welding, and numerous automated assembly machines. We maintain our equipment with a thorough preventive maintenance program, including in-house tool and die shops, allowing us to meet the demanding service requirements of many of our customers. 

Renewable Energy and Conservation 

The Renewable Energy and Conservation segment is primarily a designer and provider of fully-engineered solutions for solar racking systems and greenhouse structures. Our solar racking and greenhouse businesses employ a fully integrated approach with in-house engineering and design, fabrication, and installation capabilities. We have five manufacturing facilities and one distribution center and operate in the United States, Germany, China and Japan. 

An integral part of each project is the fabrication of specifically designed metal structures for highly- engineered applications including: racking for ground-mounted solar arrays; racking for solar installations on rooftops of carports, and commercial and residential structures; as well as, commercial-scale greenhouses and canopies. Both the solar racking and greenhouse projects involve attaching glass to metal and use the same raw materials including steel and aluminum. Most of our production is completed using CNC machines, roll forming machines, laser cutters and numerous fabrication tools. All structural metal components are designed, fabricated and erected in accordance with the latest structural steel and aluminum guidelines. 

We improve our offerings of products by introducing new products, enhancing existing products, adjusting product specifications to respond to commercial building codes and regulatory changes, and providing additional solutions to contractors and end users. New products introduced in recent years include greenhouse structures which focus on metal framed canopy structures, car washes and pool enclosures, and solar racking systems for carports. Our car washes and canopy 

structures serve a market preference for light transparent structures. Solar racking systems for carports serve as protection for cars from the effects of the sun and intense heat by providing a renewable energy resource. Similarly, solar racking systems installed on idle land, such as solid waste landfills, converts such land into a useful property by providing power generating capabilities. 

Engineering and Technical Services 

Our businesses employ engineers and other technical personnel to perform a variety of key tasks. They help maintain fully-equipped, modern laboratories to support our operations. These laboratories enable us to verify, analyze, and document the physical, chemical, metallurgical, and mechanical properties of our raw materials and products. In addition, our engineering staff employs a range of drafting software to design highly specialized and technically precise products. In our Renewable Energy and Conservation segment, drawings are designed, signed and sealed by licensed engineers. Technical service personnel also work in conjunction with our sales force to determine the types of products and services required for the particular needs of our customers. 

Suppliers and Raw Materials 

Our business is required to maintain sufficient quantities of raw material inventory in order to accommodate our customers&#8217; short lead times. Accordingly, we plan our purchases to maintain raw materials at sufficient levels to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers. We have implemented ERP systems to better manage our inventory, forecast customer orders, enable efficient supply chain management, and allow for more timely counter-measures to changing customer demand and market conditions. 

The primary raw materials we purchase are flat-rolled and plate steel, aluminum, and resins. We purchase flat-rolled and plate steel and aluminum at regular intervals on an as-needed basis, primarily from the major North American mills, as well as a limited amount from domestic service centers and foreign steel importers. Substantially all of our resins are purchased from domestic vendors, primarily through distributors, with a small amount direct from manufacturers. Supply has been adequate from these sources to fulfill our needs. Because of our strategy to develop longstanding relationships in our supply chain, we have been able to adjust our deliveries of raw materials to match our required inventory positions to support our on-time deliveries to customers while allowing us to manage our investment in inventory and working capital. 

The cost of our raw material purchases of steel, aluminum, and resins is significantly linked to commodity markets. The markets for commodities are highly cyclical and the costs of purchasing these raw materials can be volatile due to a number of factors including general economic conditions, domestic and worldwide demand, labor costs, competition, import duties, tariffs, and currency exchange rates. Changes in commodity costs not only impact the cost of our raw materials but also influence the prices we offer our customers. We have largely managed fluctuations in the market by maintaining lean inventory levels and increasing the efficiency of our manufacturing processes. However, in limited situations, where we have fixed price contacts to supply goods covering multiple quarters, we have used hedge contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in commodity costs. 

We purchase natural gas and electricity from suppliers in proximity to our operations. 

Even though we have long-term relationships with our suppliers, we have no long-term contractual commitments. Management continually examines and improves our purchasing practices across our geographically dispersed facilities in order to streamline purchasing across similar commodities. 

Intellectual Property 

We actively protect our proprietary rights throughout North America, Europe and Asia by the use of trademark, copyright, and patent registrations. While we do not believe that any individual item of our intellectual property is material, we believe our trademarks, copyrights, and patents provide us with a competitive advantage when marketing our products to customers. We also believe our brands are well recognized in the markets we serve and we believe they stand for high-quality manufactured goods at a competitive price. These trademarks and trade names allow us to maintain product leadership positions for the goods we offer. 

Sales and Marketing 

Our products and services are sold primarily by channel partners who are called on by our sales personnel and outside sales representatives located throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. We have organized sales teams to focus on specific customers and national accounts through which we provide enhanced supply solutions and improve our ability to increase the number of products that we sell. Our sales staff works with certain retail customers to optimize shelf space for our products which is expected to increase sales at these locations. Our sales regularly involve competitive bidding processes, and our reputation for meeting delivery time lines and strict specifications make us a preferred provider for many customers. 

We focus on providing our customers with industry leading customer service. Our business units generate numerous publications, catalogs, and other printed materials to facilitate the ordering process. In addition, we provide our retail customers with point-of-sale marketing aids to encourage consumer spending on our products in their stores. Continual communication with our customers allows us to understand their concerns and provides us with the opportunity to identify solutions that will meet their needs. We are able to meet our customers&#8217; demand requirements due to our efficient manufacturing processes and extensive distribution network. 

Customers and Distribution 

Our customers are located primarily throughout North America and Europe, and, to a lesser extent, in Asia. 

Our Residential Products segment operates principally in the residential new construction and repair and remodeling markets. A majority of our products are sold through sales channels. Major customers include home improvement retailers, building product distributors, residential contractors, and postal services for our Residential Products segment. 

Our Industrial and Infrastructure Products segment serves a variety of commercial construction and industrial markets; bridge and highway construction markets; and a variety of industrial markets. Discrete and process manufacturers, transportation contractors and automotive suppliers are major customers in our Industrial and Infrastructure Products segment. 

Our Renewable Energy and Conservation segment primarily contracts with solar developers, power system providers, retail garden centers, conservatories and botanical gardens, commercial growers, and schools and universities. 

One customer, a home improvement retailer, purchases from both the Residential Products segment and Renewable Energy and Conservation segment, represented 11% of our consolidated net sales for 2015 , and 12% for both 2014 &#32;and 2013 . No other customer in any segment accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales. 

Our products are distributed to our customers using common carriers and our own fleet of trucks. We maintain distribution centers that complement our manufacturing plants from which we ship products and ensure on-time delivery while maintaining efficiency within our distribution process. 

Backlog 

While the majority of our products have short lead time order cycles, we have aggregated approximately $154 million of backlog at December 31, 2015 . The backlog primarily relates to certain business units in our Industrial and Infrastructure Products and our Renewable Energy and Conservation segments. We believe that the majority of our backlog will be shipped during 2016 . 

Competition 

Gibraltar operates in highly competitive markets. We compete against several competitors in all three of our segments with different competitors in each major product category. A few of our competitors may be larger, have greater financial resources, or have less financial leverage than we do. As a result, these competitors may be better positioned to respond to any downward pricing pressure or other adverse economic or industry conditions or to identify and acquire companies or product lines compatible with their business. 

We compete with competitors based on the range of products offered, quality, price, and delivery, as well as, serving as a full service provider for project management in certain segments. Although some of our competitors are large companies, the majority are small to medium-sized and do not offer the large range of building products we do. 

The prices paid for raw materials used in our operations, primarily steel, aluminum, and resins, are volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control, including but not limited to supply shortages, general industry and economic conditions, labor costs, import duties, tariffs, and currency exchange rates. Although we have strategies to help mitigate the volatility in raw 

material costs, such as reducing inventory levels, our competitors who choose not to maintain inventories as large as ours may be better able to mitigate the effects of this volatility and, thereby, compete effectively against us on product price. 

We believe our broad range of products, high quality, and sustained ability to meet exacting customer delivery requirements gives us a competitive advantage over many of our competitors. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , we employed 2,628 and 2,416 employees, respectively. We also employ a number of temporary employees to address peaks in staffing requirements. Approximately 12% of our workforce was represented by unions through various collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) as of December 31, 2015 . Three of our six CBAs will expire and are expected to be renegotiated in 2016. We historically have had good relationships with our unions and we expect future negotiations with our unions to result in contracts that provide benefits that are consistent with those provided in our current agreements. 

Seasonality 

Our net sales and income are generally lower in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters primarily due to the seasonality of construction activity. Our sales volume is driven by residential renovation and other industrial construction activities which typically peak during warmer weather and decline due to inclement weather in the winter months. Operating margins are impacted by this seasonality because our operating costs have fixed cost components. 

Governmental Regulation 

Our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are subject to many federal, state, and local requirements relating to the protection of the environment. Our production processes use some environmentally sensitive materials. For example, we lubricate our machines with oil and use oil baths to treat some of our products. While we cannot guarantee that we will not incur material expenses to comply with environmental requirements, we believe that we operate our business in material compliance with all environmental laws and regulations, do not anticipate any material expenditures to continue to meet environmental requirements, and do not believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. However, we could incur operating costs or capital expenditures in complying with new or more stringent environmental requirements in the future or with current requirements if they are applied to our facilities in a way we do not anticipate. In addition, new or more stringent regulation of our energy suppliers could cause them to increase the price of energy they supply us. 

Our operations are also governed by many other laws and regulations covering our labor relationships, the zoning of our facilities, our general business practices, and other matters.
