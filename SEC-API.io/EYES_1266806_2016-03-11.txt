Overview 

&#160;

Second Sight was founded in 1998 with a mission to develop, manufacture, and market prosthetic devices that restore some useful vision to blind individuals. Our principal offices are located in Sylmar, California, approximately 25 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. We also have an office in Lausanne, Switzerland, that manages our commercial and clinical operations in Europe and the Middle East.

&#160;

Our current product, the Argus &#174; II System, treats outer retinal degenerations, such as retinitis pigmentosa, which we refer to as RP. RP is a hereditary disease, affecting an estimated 1.5 million people worldwide including about 100,000 people in the United States, that causes a progressive degeneration of the light-sensitive cells of the retina, leading to significant visual impairment and ultimately blindness. The Argus II System is the only retinal prosthesis approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and was the first approved retinal prosthesis in the world. By restoring some useful vision in patients who otherwise have total sight loss, the Argus II System can provide benefits which include: 

&#160;

&#183; improving patients&#8217; orientation and mobility, such as locating doors and windows, avoiding obstacles, and following the lines of a crosswalk, &#183; allowing patients to feel more connected with people in their surroundings, such as seeing when someone is approaching or moving away, &#183; providing patients with enjoyment from being &#8220;visual&#8221; again, such as locating the moon, tracking groups of players as they move around a field, and watching the moving streams of lights from fireworks, and &#183; improving patients&#8217; well-being and ability to perform activities of daily living. &#160;

The Argus II System provides an artificial form of vision that differs from the vision of people with normal sight. It does not restore normal vision and it does not slow or reverse the progression of the disease. Results vary among patients and while the majority of patients receive significant benefit from the Argus II, some patients report receiving little or no benefit.

&#160; 

Our major corporate, clinical and regulatory milestones include:

&#160;

&#183; In 1998, Second Sight was founded. &#183; In 2002, we commenced clinical trials in the US for our prototype product, the Argus I retinal prosthesis. &#183; In 2007, we commenced clinical trials in the US for the Argus II System, which later became our first commercial product. &#183; In 2011, we received marketing approval in Europe (CE Mark) for the Argus II System. &#183; In 2013, we received marketing approval in the United States (FDA) for the Argus II System. &#183; In 2014, we launched the Argus II in the US, completed our initial public offering (&#8220;IPO&#8221;), and began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol &#8220;EYES.&#8221; &#183; In 2015, we commenced a clinical trial in the UK for an expanded indication for the Argus II System in individuals with dry age related macular degeneration (AMD). &#160;

Currently, after more than 16 years of research and development, more than $160 million of investment and over $33 million of grants received in support of our technology development, we employ over 100 people in the development (engineering and clinical), manufacture, and commercialization of the Argus II System and future products.

&#160; 

Our Technology 

&#160;

The Argus II System employs electrical stimulation to bypass degenerated photoreceptor cells and to stimulate remaining viable retinal cells thereby inducing visual perception in blind individuals. The Argus II System works by converting video images captured by a miniature camera housed in a patient&#8217;s glasses into a series of small electrical pulses that are transmitted wirelessly to an array of electrodes that are implanted on the surface of the retina. These pulses are intended to stimulate the retina&#8217;s remaining cells, resulting in a corresponding perception of patterns of light in the brain. Following the implant surgery, patients learn to interpret these visual patterns thereby regaining some useful vision, allowing them to detect shapes of people and objects in their surroundings.

&#160;

3&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

We believe the Argus II System possesses several unique technological advancements compared to other neurostimulation devices including a hermetic package with the smallest size and largest number of individually programmable electrodes, and a patented electrode material that allows high charge densities and small electrode size. Several other engineering challenges, including device reliability, extended lifetime, and a safe and effective bio-interface, were overcome during the development of the product and these solutions have been protected both by patents and by trade secrets. As of March 1, 2016, we have 347 issued patents and 156 pending patent applications, on a worldwide basis. Additionally, from a competitive standpoint, the Argus II System possesses attractive technical and other features that include:

&#160;

&#183; A unique patented design that allows a demonstrated lifetime over 8.5 years, and a demonstrated stable clinical benefit over six years, &#183; Surgical implantation that can be performed in three to four hours using standard vitreoretinal techniques, &#183; A relatively large field of view (20 degrees), &#183; Implanted patients can undergo MRI procedures, and &#183; Individually programmable electrodes on the prosthesis which can permit further optimization of the device after implantation. &#160;

We have demonstrated the ability to design products with long-term reliability. The Argus I retinal prosthesis, a proof of concept device that was a predecessor to the Argus II, was implanted in six patients in the United States. Argus I patients were implanted an average of 5.8 years, with one patient having used the Argus I device for over 10 years. The Argus II System has been implanted in over 178 patients. The average implant duration for these patients is 2.4 years with several users continuing to use the system more than eight years following implantation. Our Markets 

&#160; 

Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) 

&#160; 

RP is a group of inherited disorders that affect the retina. The retina is a layer of nerve cells at the back of the eye. RP is a disease that gradually robs relatively young people of their vision over time. Onset of RP is often noted in the teen years or early twenties, typically as night blindness. This is followed by a period of peripheral vision loss, until the patient is left with a tunnel of vision and then no remaining sight. Although there are various genetic causes (over 100) and thus variability in the disease progression, many people with advanced RP have lost all functional vision by their 40s or 50s. The Argus II System works by bypassing rods and cones which are defunct in these patients and sending electrical signals directly to the retina&#8217;s remaining healthy cells.

&#160;

Although there are reported trials for other treatments underway, to our knowledge the Argus II System remains the only approved therapeutic option for end-stage RP in the US, and to our knowledge it is the only treatment option generally available to commercial patients anywhere in the world.

&#160;

Worldwide, an estimated 1.5 million people suffer from RP 1 , which includes about 100,000 in the US 2 . Pan-European data is not readily available, but we believe it is reasonable to estimate that the average prevalence throughout Europe is similar to the average prevalence within the US, and so the ratio of populations could be used to estimate the number of Europeans affected as 167,000 in the 28 EU countries 3 , 4 . Approximately 25% of people with RP in the US have vision that is 20/200 or worse (legally blind) 5 . Since the bare light perception or worse vision criterion for the US indication is worse than 20/200, we believe that the subset of patients that can be treated by the Argus II System is less than 25,000 in the US. In Europe, the indicated vision loss for Argus II patients is severe to profound which, while better than bare light perception, remains somewhat worse than 20/200. An estimated 42,000 patients in Europe with RP have vision worse than 20/200 and we estimate that the subset of RP patients that can be treated in Europe to be somewhat smaller than this number. Worldwide, we estimate that 375,000 people are legally blind due to RP, and that a portion of these would be candidates for the Argus II System.

&#160; 

&#160;

Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) 

&#160;

AMD is a relatively common eye condition and the leading cause of vision loss among people age 65 and older 6 . The macula is a small spot near the center of the retina and its damage results in loss of central vision. AMD can start as a blurred area near the center of vision and over time it can grow larger until loss of central vision occurs. Central vision is extremely important for everyday tasks such as reading, writing, and face recognition.

&#160;

There are three stages of AMD defined in part by the size of drusen (yellow deposits) under the retina. Early and intermediate stage AMD has few symptoms or vision loss. These earlier stages of the disease are usually left untreated or dealt with using diet supplementation. People with advanced AMD have vision loss from damage to the macula. There are two types of late stage AMD:

&#160;

&#183; Dry AMD: There is a breakdown of light sensitive cells in the macula that send visual information to the brain, and the supporting tissue beneath the macula. This damage causes vision loss. &#183; Wet AMD: Blood vessels grow underneath the retina. These vessels might leak blood which may lead to swelling and damage of the macula. This damage may be severe and can progress quickly. &#160;

Worldwide, between 20 and 25 million people suffer from vision loss due to AMD 7 , and of these about 2 million have vision that is considered legally blind, or worse 8 . In the US, just over two million people experience vision loss due to AMD according to a 2010 study by the National Eye Institute. Of the 1.3 million legally blind Americans 9 , we estimate that 42.5% (or 552,500) are due to AMD 10 . Applying this percent of legally blind due to AMD (42.5%) to the total number of legally blind people in Europe (2.55 million) 11 ,we estimate the population of legally blind individuals from AMD to be about 1.08 million individuals in Europe, we believe the Argus II System may be able to help a subset of these legally blind AMD patients who have severe to profound vision loss.

&#160;

Other diseases resulting in blindness that may be treated by Orion I cortical visual prosthesis system 

&#160;

Many diseases outside of RP and AMD can also cause blindness. Many of the largest causes of visual impairment (i.e. refractive error and cataracts) are avoidable or curable, and their prolonged or untreated impact on vision is largely observed in developing nations. Some other causes of blindness, such as brain trauma, may also not be suitable for treatment by a cortical stimulator. However, the remaining causes of severe vision loss which include glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, eye trauma, retinopathy of prematurity and many others can result in severe visual impairment that we anticipate to be treatable by an Orion I visual prosthesis system.

&#160;

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) 12 , 285 million people suffer from vision loss worldwide. Of these, 39 million people are considered legally blind. The WHO further estimates that 80% of legal blindness is avoidable, leaving 7.8 million legally blind individuals, including those blind due to AMD and RP, or 5.8 million excluding AMD and RP. In the US, 1.3 million people are legally blind 13 of which we estimate 44.3%, or 575,900, are legally blind due to causes other than preventable/treatable conditions, RP or AMD 14 . Applying the same logic, we estimate 1.13 million individuals are legally blind in Europe due to causes other than preventable/treatable conditions, RP or AMD.

&#160; 

Our Strategy 

&#160;

Second Sight&#8217;s strategy can be summarized as follows:

&#160;

&#183; Grow our commercial footprint, continue to expand reimbursement coverage in our target markets, and reach a larger proportion of eligible patients. &#183; Expand Argus II use in the RP population with improved product performance. &#183; Enter the AMD market with Argus II to access a substantially larger market. &#183; Leverage proven ARGUS technology to restore some vision with cortical stimulation and expand addressable markets to those patients who are blind from eye trauma, optic nerve disease, and other causes. &#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Grow commercial footprint, secure adequate reimbursement and connect with patients 

&#160;

We launched the Argus II System in Italy and Germany at the end of 2011; in Saudi Arabia, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom in 2013; in Switzerland, Spain, the US and Canada in 2014; and Austria and Turkey in 2015. We continue to employ a Centers of Excellence sales strategy, deploying the Argus II at prominent and reputable eye centers. We believe this strategy represents an efficient use of our capital after giving consideration to the following factors:

&#160;

&#183; The size of the RP patient population. &#183; The complexity of the technology, surgery, and treatment paradigm. &#183; The cost of selecting, qualifying, training and supporting new centers. &#160;

When selecting new sites, we focus on high quality health providers considering the following factors:

&#160;

&#183; Geographic location. &#183; Facility and surgeon skill &#38; reputation. &#183; Access to a pool of RP patients. &#183; Known regulatory pathway. &#183; Established reimbursement. &#183; Desire and capability of institution to perform a meaningful number of surgeries annually. &#160;

As we expand our commercial footprint beyond the initial eye centers, the capability and desire of the center to perform a meaningful number of surgeries and the presence of established reimbursement become increasingly critical to our ability to expand access to patients.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had 15 centers in the United States and Canada that are actively implanting the Argus II. We believe that we will be able to serve the domestic RP market by having approximately 50 implanting centers across the US. In Europe and the Middle East, we have 18 eye centers that are actively implanting the Argus II (eight in Germany, three in France, one in Saudi Arabia, two in Turkey, two in Spain, and two in Italy). We believe that we will be able to serve the European and Middle East markets for RP by having approximately 50 &#8211; 75 centers across Europe and the Middle East.

&#160;

To date, we have employed direct sales and clinical specialists to service our markets in the US and Canada. The majority of our markets in Europe are also serviced by a direct sales and clinical specialist team. As of December 31, 2015, the sales/clinical specialist team for North America numbered five persons and the sales team for Europe and the Middle East numbered four persons. In some cases, we believe that we can more efficiently expand our reach by securing distributors in key markets. To date, we have appointed distributors in Argentina, Spain, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. We expect that our distributors will commit to providing support services that include marketing, market access, sales, surgical support and service.

&#160;

The company is evaluating potential new markets including countries in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Latin America or Asia Pacific regions. We will selectively enter markets based on multiple factors including: the presence of RP patients, skilled surgeons, a facility with the necessary support infrastructure, a reliable source of funding or reimbursement, and our ability to effectively provide needed clinical or surgical support.

&#160;

Obtaining reimbursement from governmental and private insurance companies is critical to our future commercial success. Due to the cost of the Argus II System, our sales would be limited without the availability of third party reimbursement. In the US, coding, coverage, and payment are necessary for the surgical procedure and Argus II system to be reimbursed by payers. Coding has been established for the device and the surgical procedure. Coverage and payment vary by payer. Argus II patients are eligible for Medicare, and coverage is primarily provided through traditional Medicare (sometimes referred to as Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS)) or Medicare Advantage. A small percentage of patients are covered by commercial insurers.

&#160;

&#183; Medicare FFS patient s &#8211; Coverage is determined by Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) that administer various geographic regions of the US. As of March 1, 2016, five of 12 MACs (17 states, Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands) have made positive coverage decisions for the Argus II. Effective January 1, 2016, the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (CMS) established a New Technology Ambulatory Payment Class (APC) 1599, Level 48, with a payment rate of $95,000 for both the procedure and the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System. From October 1, 2013 through December 31, 2015, the Argus II was classified as having pass-through payment status and the device was paid separately from the procedure. 6&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#183; Medicare Advantage patients &#8211; Medicare Advantage plans are required to cover the same benefits as those covered by the MAC in that jurisdiction. For example, if a MAC in a jurisdiction has favorable coverage for the Argus II, then all Medicare Advantage plans in that MAC jurisdiction are required to offer the same coverage for the Argus II. Individual hospitals and ASCs may negotiate Medicare Advantage contracts specific to that individual facility, which may include additional separate payment for the Argus II implant system. In addition, procedural payment is variable and can be based on a percentage of billed charges, payment groupings or other individually negotiated payment methodologies. Medicare Advantage plans also allow providers to confirm coverage and payment for the Argus II procedure in advance of implantation. In 2015, 93% or 13 of 14 Medicare Advantage pre-authorization requests were granted. &#160;

&#183; Commercially insured patients &#8211; Commercial insurance plans make coverage and payment rate decisions independent of Medicare decisions and contracts are individually negotiated with facility and physician providers. &#160;

In 2015, 32 individuals in the US and Canada received and were implanted with the Argus II technology. Of these, nine were Medicare FFS patients, 13 were Medicare Advantage patients and three were commercially insured patients. The remaining seven patients were covered by private pay, Veteran&#8217;s Administration, or other insurers.

&#160;

A significant focus for 2016, and beyond, will be expanding US reimbursement coverage and working with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to establish Medicare hospital outpatient and ambulatory surgery center payment rates that are in line with facility costs. We have individuals working at Second Sight dedicated to reimbursement and employ a variety of consultants with expertise in this field. Currently, five MACs that oversee 17 states and two US Territories have agreed to cover the Argus II System when medically necessary for the FDA approved indications. The MACs now covering the Argus II include First Coast Service Options (covers on a case-by-case basis for Florida, Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands), CGS Administrators, LLC (for the states of Ohio and Kentucky), Palmetto GBA (for the states of North and South Carolina, West Virginia and Virginia, other than the counties of Arlington and Fairfax in Virginia and the City of Arlington in Virginia), National Government Services, Inc. (NGS), Jurisdiction 6 (for the states of Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin), and NGS, Jurisdiction K (for the states of Connecticut, New York, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont). We are actively engaged with the remaining MACs and are committed to providing them with clinical evidence to support our requests for coverage. We expect that additional positive coverage decisions will be issued over time but cannot predict timing or ultimate success with each MAC.

&#160;

We are actively engaged with CMS concerning the outpatient payment rate for Medicare FFS patients. As discussed above, the 2016 Medicare hospital outpatient payment rate for the Argus procedure is $95,000. Based on available cost information, the Medicare hospital outpatient payment rate should be at least $150,000 to fully cover the hospitals&#8217; costs for the device and procedure (with physician fees being billed and reimbursed separately). Our efforts have been focused on changing the 2016 payment rate to be more reflective of hospitals&#8217; actual costs. As of March 1, 2016, we are operating our business with the belief that the US outpatient payment rate will remain $95,000 in 2016. In parallel, the company is focused on obtaining a 2017 outpatient payment rate that adequately covers hospital costs. Several paths exist to accomplishing this goal including continued education of hospitals concerning the importance of properly coding, billing and submitting Argus II Medicare claims. This activity is important to establish an accurate claims data base that CMS will use to set future payment rates. Finally, the company is exploring other options for changes to Medicare payment policy that may facilitate appropriate reimbursement. No assurance can be given that the company will be successful in any of these endeavors.

&#160;

Within Europe, we have obtained reimbursement approval in Germany, France and two regions of Italy. We also are seeking reimbursement approval in other countries including the United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherlands, Switzerland and Turkey. In France, Second Sight was selected to receive the first &#34;Forfait Innovation&#34; (Innovation Bundle) from the Ministry of Health, which is a special funding program for breakthrough procedures to be introduced into clinical practice. As part of this program, Second Sight is conducting a post-market study in France which will enroll a total of 18 subjects and follow them for two years. The French program will fund implantation of up to 18 additional patients that will not be part of the post-market study. After review of the study&#8217;s results, we expect Argus II therapy to be covered and funded through the standard payment system in France, however, we can provide no assurance that the French government will continue to fund the Argus II after the first 36 implants. 

&#160;

To date, we have not faced traditional sales challenges in any of our markets, largely due to the currently unmet clinical need and the lack of any other available device or competitive treatment for RP-caused profound blindness. Our marketing activities have focused on raising awareness of the Argus II System with potential patients, implanting physicians, and referring physicians. Our marketing activities include exhibiting, sponsoring symposia, and securing podium presence at professional and trade shows, securing journalist coverage in popular and trade media, attending patient meetings focused on educating patients about existing and future treatments, and sponsoring information sessions for the Argus II System. In the US, our efforts in 2016 will focus on presenting media ads dedicated to RP patients and their families. These ads will be placed in geographic areas where we have proven implanting centers and established reimbursement. Based on pilot efforts we conducted in 2015 we believe this may be a cost-efficient method to connect qualified patients with Argus II implanting centers. As of March 1, 2016 the Company had a patient interest list with over 150 verbally qualified individuals.

&#160;

7&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Expand Argus II use in RP population with improved product performance 

&#160;

The Argus II System is currently approved for RP patients with bare or no light perception in the US, and in Europe for severe to profound vision loss due to outer retinal degeneration, such as from retinitis pigmentosa, choroideremia, and other similar conditions. The number of people who are legally blind due to RP is estimated to be about 25,000 in the US, 42,000 in Europe, and about 375,000 total worldwide. A subset of these patients would be eligible for the Argus II System since the approved baseline vision for the Argus II System is worse than legally blind (20/200). Scarce epidemiological data on visual acuity below legal blindness make it difficult to determine a precise estimate of the potential patient population for this device.

&#160;

The company believes an opportunity exists to expand the use of its technology to better sighted individuals with RP than are currently being treated. In order to achieve this market expansion, the company is undertaking multiple development efforts to improve the technology&#8217;s performance. These efforts include:

&#160;

&#183; External hardware - We expect to launch new externals in early 2017. These new externals will include the head mounted telemetry system (eyewear), camera and the video processing unit (VPU). We anticipate that the new VPU will possess processing power over 25 times greater than the current Argus II system and will enable enhanced image processing and retina stimulation protocols discussed further below. &#160;

&#183; Image processing software &#8211; We are developing advanced software to improve the quality and usefulness of the Argus II vision delivered to patients. The development of these software packages is in the early phases and no assurance can be made that our efforts will be successful. If successful, we expect that these software packages, which will run on the new external hardware platform, should be available commercially in 2017. &#160;

&#183; Retina stimulation protocols &#8211; Preliminary animal and human data by our team and other researchers suggests that we can achieve improved resolution by adjusting retinal stimulation protocols. Examples include long pulses and sine waves to create a more focused percept, and current steering to cause perception of pixels between electrodes. We expect to test these protocols in patients using the new external hardware platform in 2017 and, if successful, they could be available commercially in 2018. &#160;

&#183; 3 rd generation retina implants and external hardware &#8211; We are developing and evaluating multiple next generation retinal implants and external hardware that could improve visual performance in RP patients and patients with other forms of blindness. &#160;

As these development efforts proceed, the company will prioritize the technologies or approaches that offer the most potential benefit and attempt further to define the regulatory and reimbursement pathway to bring each to the market.

&#160;

Enter AMD market with Argus II to access a substantially larger market 

&#160;

We believe we can expand the market for the Argus II System beyond RP to patients with severe to profound vision loss due to dry age-related macular degeneration or dry AMD. We began a five-subject pilot study in the United Kingdom in June 2015, to determine the utility of the Argus II System for use in persons suffering from dry AMD. As of December 31, 2015, we have enrolled four of five patients. We expect that the fifth patient will be enrolled by end of the first Quarter or during early second Quarter of 2016. If this small study yields positive results, then we will conduct a larger pivotal study in Europe and the United States intended to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of this therapy. We intend to use these clinical trial data to support regulatory approval in the US and Europe that may expand our indications for use specifically to cover dry AMD, and seek reimbursement in these markets for this expanded indication. We estimate the population of people who are legally blind due to AMD to be about 552,500 in the US, 1.08 million in Europe, and two million worldwide. If approved for marketing, a subset of these patients (such as those with dry AMD) would be eligible for the Argus II.

&#160;

The size and timing of the pivotal study are dependent on multiple factors including the actual subset of AMD patients we target and whether we decide to modify the Argus II system prior to commencing a pivotal study. The subset of patients will influence the regulatory and reimbursement pathways, the size of the study and the length of time required to enroll the study. The company is also evaluating the potential benefits of system changes optimized for AMD. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in any of these endeavors.

&#160;

8&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Leverage proven ARGUS technology to restore vision with cortical stimulation and expand addressable market to those who are blind from eye trauma, optic nerve disease, and other causes. 

&#160;

We are developing another product for cortical stimulation that we expect will be able to treat nearly all forms of profound blindness. As currently planned, the Orion I visual prosthesis system will be based on technology that we utilize in our Argus II system.

&#160;

We believe we can further expand our market to include nearly all profoundly blind individuals, other than those who are blind due to preventable diseases or due to brain damage, by developing a visual cortical prosthesis. We refer to this product as the Orion TM I visual prosthesis system. Our objective in designing and developing the Orion I visual prosthesis system is to bypass the optic nerve and directly stimulate the part of the brain responsible for vision. We intend to develop the Orion I visual prosthesis by leveraging the Argus II system and plan to begin clinical trials of the Orion I visual prosthesis system in the first half of 2017. We estimate that there are about 575,900 people in the US, 1.13 million in Europe, and about 5.8 million worldwide who are legally blind due to causes other than preventable conditions, RP or AMD. If approved for marketing, the FDA will determine the subset of these patients who are eligible for the Orion I. 

&#160;

Our Competition 

&#160; 

The US life sciences industry is highly competitive and well-positioned for future growth. The treatment of blindness is a significant clinically unmet need and others continue to make progress. There are several approaches to treating blindness including:

&#160;

&#183; Retinal Prostheses (including the Argus II): aimed at giving more visual ability to a blind patient via implanting a device in the eye to stimulate remaining retina cells. Electrical neurostimulation technology has seen growing use in recent years for numerous applications&#8211; such as chronic pain, Parkinson&#8217;s Disease, Essential Tremor, Epilepsy, and others. &#183; Transplants: transplanting retinal tissue to stimulate remaining retina cells. &#183; Stem Cells : generally involves implanting immature retinal support cells aimed at slowing retinal degeneration. A single patient with wet AMD was recently implanted in London with an embryonic stem cell line. No data is yet available as to safety or efficacy of this implantation. &#183; Genetics and Gene Therapy : involves identifying a specific gene that is causing retinal problems (there are over 120 for retinitis pigmentosa alone) resulting in visual impairments and blindness; and inserting healthy genes into an individual&#8217;s cells using a virus to treat the diseases. A company recently announced phase 3 data for a 21 patient study with a median age of 11 for a gene that affects a very small percentage of retinitis pigmentosa patients, RPE65. They met their primary endpoint (completing a maze test) but did not improve visual acuity. They are expected to apply for FDA approval in 2016. Should this product garner FDA approval, we believe that there is essentially no overlap with our current market since our patients are generally older (Argus II is indicated for an age minimum of 25 in the US). That study involved injecting better sighted patients in attempting to show an improvement in residual vision rather than restoring vision that is completely lost which is the objective of the Argus II treatment. &#183; Optogenetics Therapy : aimed at bypassing compromised photoreceptors and inducing light sensitivity in other retinal cells. This therapy also requires infecting the patient&#8217;s cells with a virus. However, instead of fixing a gene defect, this approach would cause cells within the eye to become light sensitive. Animal work has shown that these cells are not sensitive enough to respond to ambient light, so this approach currently also requires a light amplifier outside the body to increase light delivered to the retina. &#183; Nutritional Therapy : involves diets or supplements that are thought to prevent or slow the progress of vision loss. &#183; Implantable Telescope : VisionCare Ophthalmic Technologies, Inc. offers an FDA approved implantable miniature telescope for AMD, a magnifying device that is implanted in the eye. The VisonCare telescope is approved for use in patients with severe to profound vision impairment (best corrected visual acuity of 20/160 to 20/800) due to dry AMD. &#183; The BrainPort&#174; V100, by Wicab, Inc ., includes a video camera mounted on a pair of sunglasses, a hand-held controller, and tongue array. The tongue array contains 400 electrodes and is connected to the glasses via a flexible cable. White pixels from the camera are felt on the tongue as strong stimulation, black pixels as no stimulation, and gray levels as medium levels of stimulation. This device is indicated for the profoundly blind. Wicab reports that The Brain Port V100 is currently commercially available in the US, EU and Hong Kong. &#183; There are currently no treatments for AMD after the disease has caused severe to profound vision loss nor are there any established treatments that delay or reverse the progression of Dry AMD other than supplements. &#183; Pharmaceutical therapies exist for Wet AMD that delay the progression of visual impairment or slightly improve the vision, rather than completely curing or reversing its course. These therapies are approved in many regions throughout the world, including the US and EU. &#160;

Commercial efforts to develop retinal implants by others include:

&#160;

&#183; Retina Implant AG: A German company that is developing the Alpha IMS, a wireless sub-retinal implant. Although this company had obtained CE Mark and was expected to begin commercialization during 2015 in the EU, to our knowledge this product is not generally available to commercial patients. Furthermore, there was a recent report of two clinical trial patients recently implanted in the UK. To our knowledge, Retina Implant has not applied for or obtained FDA approval to begin a clinical trial in the US as of March 11, 2016. Retina Implant has announced it raised 26 million euros for the purpose of establishing additional centers and initiating reimbursement applications. &#183; Pixium Vision S.A .: A French company that is developing the IRIS (Intelligent Retinal Implant System) that is surgically placed into the eye and attached to the surface of the retina. Similar to our Argus II technology, its system uses a camera and a wireless transmitter. Pixium is in clinical studies with IRIS (announced their first human IRIS II implant, which they plan to commercialize, in February 2016) and has submitted a CE mark application in 2015 and plans to begin commercialization of its product during 2016 in EU. To our knowledge, Pixium Vision has not applied for or obtained FDA approval to begin a clinical trial in the US as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. &#183; NanoRetina Inc., a company based in Israel, and several other early stage companies are reported to have developed intellectual property or technology that may improve retinal prostheses in the future, but to our knowledge none of these efforts has resulted in a completed system that has been tested clinically in patients. &#183; Academic entities are also working on vision restoring implants. These include Bionic Vision Australia (an early prototype device has been developed and to our knowledge implanted in three human subjects), Boston Retinal Implant project (preclinical phase), Stanford University (preclinical), and Monash Vision Group (preclinical phase). Of these projects, we believe most have not yet demonstrated a working implant, only one has reportedly begun long-term clinical work in humans, and to our knowledge none has received FDA approval to begin clinical trials in the US. &#160;

No other retinal prosthesis to our knowledge has been successful in long-term human trials, currently making the Argus II System the sole implant generally available to commercial patients for treating RP in the US, Canada, EU, and Saudi Arabia. We anticipate that our competitors are unlikely to obtain significant commercial traction in EU until they have developed in depth clinical data showing the reliability and functionality of their products.

&#160; 

Warranty 

&#160;

We generally provide a standard limited warranty for the Argus II System covering replacement over the following periods after implant:

&#160;

&#183; three years on implanted epiretinal prosthesis, &#183; two years on external components other than batteries and chargers, and &#183; three months on batteries and chargers. &#160;

Based on our experience to date, the Argus II System has proven to be a reliable device generally performing as intended. We have accrued warranty expense of $1.1 million as of December 31, 2015, which we believe to be adequate.

&#160; 

Our Manufacturing and Quality Assurance 

&#160;

We have a single manufacturing facility, located at our principal office in Sylmar, California. The manufacturing areas at this location are housed in a single building, and include approximately 10,000 square feet of controlled environment rooms (CERs) suitable for implant manufacturing. At present less than half of this space is being used for Argus II implant production. At the same site are spaces for assembling the external (non-implantable) components of our system and for the labeling, receiving and shipping, and stockroom functions. Finished goods are held at this location and at our contracted fulfillment partner in Europe.

&#160;

We rely on many suppliers to provide materials and services necessary to produce and test our products. Many of these materials or services are currently provided by sole source suppliers. In a number of instances we maintain sole source suppliers because our current purchasing volumes do not warrant developing more than one supplier. We expect to secure additional providers as our production volumes increase. If we experience a loss of a sole supplier before confirming an alternative, we risk possible disruptions in our operations. We attempt to mitigate the sole source risk, by among other things, increasing parts inventory as a partial hedge against interruptions in parts supply and by actively seeking to develop alternative suppler sources before experiencing any such disruptions.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015 our manufacturing department had 39 employees and the quality assurance department had an additional nine members. We operate a day shift and smaller swing shift, and at this staffing level we can manufacture up to 10 devices per month. To support future growth of the sales of the Argus II System, we believe that the space available at the current facility when fully utilized and operating at two full shifts will prove sufficient to build and assemble approximately 100 devices per month.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had 118 employees, including approximately 48 in operations; 17 in selling, marketing and distribution; 34 in clinical and regulatory and research and development; and 19 in administration. Of these employees, we employed 102 in the United States and 16 in Europe. We believe that the continued success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, and we are committed to developing our people and providing them with opportunities to contribute to our growth and success. None of these employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good to excellent.
