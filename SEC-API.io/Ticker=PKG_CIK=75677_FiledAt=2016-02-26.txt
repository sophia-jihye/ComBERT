Below is a map of our locations: 

Packaging 

Packaging Products 

Our corrugated products manufacturing plants produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging products, including conventional shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured goods, multi-color boxes, and displays with strong visual appeal that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail locations. In addition, we are a large producer of packaging for meat, fresh fruit and vegetables, processed food, beverages, and other industrial and consumer products. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015 , our Packaging segment produced 3.7 million &#32;tons of containerboard at our mills. Our corrugated products manufacturing plants sold 48.9 billion square feet (BSF) of corrugated products. Our net sales to third parties totaled $4.5 billion &#32;in 2015 . 

&#32;2 

Facilities 

We manufacture our Packaging products at five &#32; containerboard mills, one containerboard machine (at our Wallula, Washington white paper mill), corrugated manufacturing operations, and protective packaging operations. The following provides more details of our operations: 

Counce. Our Counce, Tennessee mill produces kraft linerboard. The year-end 2015 &#32;annual estimated production capacity, as reported to the American Forest and Paper Association (AF&#38;PA), was 1,105,000 tons. In 2015 , the mill produced 1,087,000 tons of kraft linerboard on two paper machines. The mill can produce basis weights from 26 lb. to 90 lb. The mill also produces a variety of performance and specialty grades of linerboard. 

DeRidder. Our DeRidder, Louisiana mill produces kraft linerboard on its No. 1 machine and linerboard and medium on its No. 3 machine. The year-end 2015 &#32;annual estimated capacity reported to the AF&#38;PA, on the two machines, was 995,000 tons. The No. 1 machine produced 578,000 tons of kraft linerboard during 2015 . The No. 3 machine produced 129,000 tons of medium and 167,000 tons of linerboard. The No. 3 machine was converted from a newsprint machine to a containerboard machine in 2014. The mill can produce linerboard in basis weights of 26 lb. to 69 lb. and medium in basis weights of 23 lb. to 33 lb. 

Valdosta. Our Valdosta, Georgia mill produces kraft linerboard. Its year-end 2015 &#32;annual estimated production capacity, as reported to the AF&#38;PA, was 605,000 tons. In 2015 , our single paper machine at Valdosta produced 603,000 tons of kraft linerboard. The mill can produce basis weights from 35 lb. to 96 lb. 

Tomahawk. Our Tomahawk, Wisconsin mill produces semi-chemical corrugating medium. Its year-end 2015 &#32;annual estimated production capacity, as reported to the AF&#38;PA, was 555,000 tons. In 2015 , the mill produced 534,000 tons of semi-chemical corrugating medium on two paper machines. The Tomahawk mill can produce basis weights from 23 lb. to 47 lb. and a variety of performance and specialty grades of corrugating medium. 

Filer City. Our Filer City, Michigan mill produces semi-chemical corrugating medium. Its year-end 2015 &#32;annual estimated production capacity, as reported to the AF&#38;PA, was 445,000 tons. In 2015 , the mill produced 428,000 tons on three paper machines. Filer City can produce corrugating medium in basis weights from &#32; 20 lb. to 47 lb. 

Wallula. Our Wallula, Washington mill primarily produces white paper, but also produces corrugating medium on one of its paper machines. Its year-end 2015 &#32;annual estimated production capacity of medium, as reported to the AF&#38;PA, was 145,000 tons. In 2015 , the mill produced 130,000 tons of corrugating medium. Wallula can produce corrugating medium in basis weights from 23 lb. to 45 lb. 

We operate 93 &#32;corrugated manufacturing operations, a technical and development center, eight regional design centers, a rotogravure printing operation, and a complement of packaging supplies and distribution centers. Of the 93 &#32;manufacturing facilities, 59 operate as combining operations, commonly called corrugated plants, which manufacture corrugated sheets and finished corrugated packaging products, 33 are sheet plants which procure combined sheets and manufacture finished corrugated packaging products, and one &#32;is a corrugated sheet-only manufacturer. 

Corrugated products plants tend to be located in close proximity to customers to minimize freight costs. Each of our plants serve a market radius of around 150 miles. Our sheet plants are generally located in close proximity to our larger corrugated plants, which enables us to offer additional services and converting capabilities such as small volume and quick turnaround items. 

&#32;3 

Major Raw Materials Used 

Fiber supply. Fiber is the largest raw material cost to manufacture containerboard. We consume both wood fiber and recycled fiber in our containerboard mills. We have no 100% recycled mills, or mills whose fiber consumption consists solely of recycled fiber. To reduce our fiber costs, we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high degree of fiber flexibility. Our mill system has the capability to shift a portion of its fiber consumption between softwood, hardwood, and recycled sources. All of our mills, other than the Valdosta mill, can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production. Our ability to use various types of virgin and recycled fiber helps mitigate the impact of changes in the prices of various fibers. Our corrugated manufacturing operations generate recycled fiber as a by-product from the manufacturing process, which is consumed by our mills. In 2015, we were a net recycled fiber buyer of less than 17% of our packaging mills' fiber requirements. 

We procure wood fiber through leases of cutting rights, long-term supply agreements, and market purchases. We currently lease the cutting rights to approximately 83,000 &#32;acres of timberland located near our Counce, Tennessee and Valdosta, Georgia mills. Virtually all of the acres under cutting rights agreements are located within 100 miles of these two mills which results in lower wood transportation costs and provides a secure source of wood fiber. These leased cutting rights agreements have terms with about 13 years remaining, on average. 

We participate in the Sustainable Forestry Initiative &#174; &#32;(SFI) and we are certified under the SFI sourcing standards. These standards are aimed at ensuring the long-term health and conservation of forestry resources. We are committed to sourcing wood fiber through environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable practices and promoting resource and conservation stewardship ethics. 

Energy supply. Energy at our packaging mills is obtained through purchased or self-generated fuels and electricity. Fuel sources include natural gas, by-products of the containerboard manufacturing and pulping process (including black liquor and wood waste), purchased wood waste, coal, and oil. Each of our mills self-generates process steam requirements from by-products (black liquor and wood waste), as well as from the various purchased fuels. The process steam is used throughout the production process and also to generate electricity. 

In 2015 , our packaging mills consumed about 59 million MMBTU&#8217;s of fuel to produce both steam and electricity. Of the 59 million MMBTU&#8217;s consumed, about 59% was from mill generated by-products, and 41% was from purchased fuels. Of the 41% &#32; in purchased fuels, 54% was from natural gas, 32% was from purchased wood waste, and 14% was from coal and other purchased fuels. 

Sales, Marketing, and Distribution 

Our corrugated products are sold through a direct sales and marketing organization, independent brokers, and distribution partners. We have sales representatives and a sales manager at most of our corrugated manufacturing operations and also have corporate account managers who serve customer accounts with a national presence. Additionally, our design centers maintain an on-site dedicated graphics sales force. In addition to direct sales and marketing personnel, we utilize new product development engineers and product graphics and design specialists. These individuals are located at both the corrugated plants and the design centers. General marketing support is located at our corporate headquarters. 

Our containerboard sales group is responsible for the coordination of linerboard and corrugating medium sales to our corrugated plants, to outside domestic customers, and to export customers. This group handles order processing for all shipments of containerboard from our mills to our corrugated plants. These personnel also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with other containerboard manufacturers. 

Containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or truck. Rail shipments typically represent approximately 65% of the tons shipped and the remaining 35% is shipped by truck. Our corrugated products are delivered by truck due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service. Our corrugated manufacturing operations typically serve customers within a 150 mile radius. We sometimes use third-party warehouses for short-term storage of corrugated products. 

Customers 

We sell corrugated products to approximately 17,000 customers in over 33,000 locations. About three-quarters of our corrugated products sales are to regional and local accounts, which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic 

&#32;4 

locations. The remaining one-quarter of our customer base consists primarily of national accounts that have multiple locations and are served by a number of PCA plants. No single customer exceeds 10% of segment sales.

Competition 

As of December 31, 2015 , we were the fourth largest &#32;producer of containerboard and corrugated packaging products in the United States, according to industry sources and our own estimates. According to industry sources, corrugated products are produced by about 525 U.S. companies operating approximately 1,200 plants. The primary basis for competition for most of our packaging products includes quality, service, price, product design, and innovation. Most corrugated products are manufactured to the customer&#8217;s specifications. Corrugated producers generally sell within a 150 -mile radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated producers in their local region. Competition in our corrugated products operations tends to be regional, although we also face competition from large competitors with significant national account presence. 

On a national level our primary competitors are International Paper Company, WestRock Company, Georgia-Pacific LLC, and KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation. However, with our strategic focus on regional and local accounts, we also compete with the smaller, independent producers. 

Paper 

Our Paper segment operating under the trade name Boise Paper, was acquired with the acquisition of Boise Inc. on October 25, 2013 . We are the third largest &#32;manufacturer of uncoated freesheet in North America, according to industry sources and our own estimates. We manufacture and sell white papers, including both commodity and specialty papers, which may have custom or specialized features such as colors, coatings, high brightness, and recycled content. White papers consist of communication papers (cut-size office papers and printing and converting papers) and pressure sensitive papers, including release liners, which our customers use to produce labels for use in consumer and commercially-packaged products. The Paper segment also produces market pulp on one paper machine at our Wallula, Washington mill, which is sold to outside customers to produce paper products. 

Facilities 

We have three white paper mills located in the United States. The following paragraphs describe our white paper mills: 

Jackson. Our Jackson, Alabama mill produces both commodity and specialty papers. Its year-end 2015 &#32;annual estimated production capacity of white papers on two paper machines, as reported to the AF&#38;PA, was 470,000 tons. In 2015 , the mill produced 471,000 tons of white papers. On a converted basis, from rollstock to cut-size white papers, the mill produced 412,000 tons in 2015 . 

International Falls. Our International Falls, Minnesota mill produces both commodity and specialty papers. Its year-end 2015 &#32;annual estimated production capacity of white papers on two paper machines, as reported to the AF&#38;PA, was 460,000 tons. In 2015 , the mill produced 458,000 tons of white papers. On a converted basis, from rollstock to cut-size white papers, the mill produced 348,000 tons in 2015 . 

Wallula. Our Wallula, Washington mill has the ability, on one machine, to switch production between pressure sensitive papers and a variety of white paper grades. The mill also produces corrugating medium and market pulp. Its year-end 2015 &#32;annual estimated production capacity of white paper grades and market pulp, as reported to the AF&#38;PA, was 190,000 tons and 100,000 tons, respectively. The corrugating medium produced at Wallula is included in our Packaging segment as discussed above. In 2015 , the mill produced 188,000 tons of white papers and 99,000 tons of market pulp. 

&#32;5 

Major Raw Materials Used 

Fiber supply. Fiber is our principal raw material in this segment, including wood fiber, recycled fiber, and purchased pulp. We purchase both whole logs and wood chips, which are a byproduct of lumber and plywood production. At our mill in Jackson, Alabama, we also purchase recycled fiber to produce our line of recycled office papers. Our Jackson and International Falls paper mills also purchase pulp from third parties pursuant to contractual arrangements. We purchase wood fiber through contracts and open-market purchases. 

We participate in the Sustainable Forestry Initiative &#174; &#32;(SFI) and the Forest Stewardship Council &#174; &#32;(FSC) and are certified under the SFI sourcing standards. We procure all wood fiber for our white paper mills through our certified systems that are managed in accordance with the SFI and FSC standards. These standards are aimed at ensuring the long-term health and conservation of forestry resources. 

Energy supply. We obtain energy through purchased or self-generated fuels and electricity. Fuel sources include natural gas, electricity, by-products of the manufacturing and pulping process (including black liquor and wood waste), and purchased wood waste. Each of the paper mills self-generates process steam requirements from by-products (black liquor and wood waste), as well as from the various purchased fuels. The process steam is used throughout the production process and also to generate electricity. 

In 2015 , our white paper mills consumed about 30 million MMBTU&#8217;s of fuel to produce both steam and electricity. Of the 30 million MMBTU&#8217;s consumed, about 66% was from mill generated by-products, and 34% was from purchased fuels. Of the 34% in purchased fuels, 78% was from natural gas and 22% from purchased wood waste. During the third quarter of 2015, we installed and started up a 53 megawatt turbine generator to replace four older units at our International Falls, Minnesota mill. With the new turbine generator, the mill is now capable of producing 70% of its electrical power requirements compared to 38% previously. 

Chemical supply. &#32;&#32;We consume various chemicals in the production of white papers and pulp, including starch, precipitated calcium carbonate, caustic soda, sodium chlorate, dyestuffs, and optical brighteners. Most of our chemicals are purchased under contracts, which are bid or negotiated periodically. 

Sales, Marketing, and Distribution 

Our white papers are sold primarily by our own sales personnel. We ship to customers both directly from our mills and through distribution centers and a network of outside warehouses by rail or truck. This allows us to respond quickly to customer requirements. Rail shipments typically represent approximately 65% of the tons shipped and the remaining 35% &#32; is shipped by truck. 

Customers 

We have over 200 customers in approximately 500 locations. These customers include paper merchants, commercial and financial printers, envelope converters, and customers who use our pressure sensitive paper for specialty applications such as consumer and commercial product labels. We have established long-term relationships with many of our customers. Office Depot, Inc. is our largest customer in the Paper segment. We have an agreement with Office Depot in which we will supply at least 50% of Office Depot's requirements for commodity office papers through December 2017; however, there are circumstances that could cause the agreement to terminate before 2017. If this were to occur, Office Depot's purchase obligations under the agreement would phase out over two years. Office Depot became our largest customer when it acquired OfficeMax Incorporated late in 2013. We previously had a long standing contractual relationship with OfficeMax Incorporated. In 2015 , our sales revenue to Office Depot represented 45% &#32;of our Paper segment sales revenue. 

Competition 

The markets in which our Paper segment competes are large and highly competitive. Commodity grades of white paper are globally traded, with numerous worldwide manufacturers, and as a result, these products compete primarily on the basis of price. All of our paper manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, and although we compete primarily in the domestic market, we do face competition from foreign producers and have experienced increased foreign competition in recent years. The level of this competition varies depending on domestic and foreign demand and foreign currency exchange rates. In general, paper production does not rely on proprietary processes or formulas, except in highly specialized or custom grades. 

&#32;6 

In January 2015, we, along with the United Steel Workers (USW) and other domestic office paper producers, filed a petition before the United States International Trade Commission and the United States Department of Commerce, alleging that paper producers in China, Indonesia, Australia, Brazil, and Portugal are selling products in the United States in violation of international trade rules. The domestic producers also alleged that Chinese and Indonesian producers are receiving illegal government subsidies. The agencies conducted their investigations in 2015 and early 2016. In January 2016, the U.S. Department of Commerce made determinations of antidumping and countervailing duties at rates varying by country and producer and, in February 2016, the International Trade Commission determined that the domestic industry has been materially injured by these imports. Accordingly, the antidumping and countervailing duties will be imposed on imports from these countries. 

Our largest competitors include Domtar Corporation, International Paper Company, and Georgia-Pacific LLC. Although price is the primary basis for competition in most of our paper grades, quality and service are also important competitive determinants. Our white papers compete with electronic data transmission, e-readers, electronic document storage alternatives, and paper grades we do not produce. Increasing shifts to these alternatives have had, and are likely to continue to have, an adverse effect on traditional print media and paper usage. 

Corporate and Other 

Our Corporate and Other segment includes corporate support staff services and related assets and liabilities, and foreign exchange gains and losses. This segment also includes transportation assets, such as rail cars and trucks, which we use to transport some of our products from our manufacturing sites and assets related to a 50% owned variable interest entity, Louisiana Timber Procurement Company, L.L.C. (LTP). For segment financial information see Note 18 , Segment Information , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 13,000 &#32;employees, including 3,900 &#32;salaried employees and 9,100 &#32;hourly employees. Approximately 70% &#32;of our hourly employees are represented by unions. The majority of our unionized employees are represented by the United Steel Workers (USW), the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), the International Association of Machinists (IAM), and the Association of Western Pulp and Paper Workers (AWPPW). &#32; We are currently in negotiations to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future, including the agreement at our International Falls, Minnesota paper mill with the IAM union, which expires on April 30, 2016. During 2015 , we experienced no work stoppages, and we believe we have satisfactory labor relations with our employees. 

Environmental Matters 

A discussion of the financial impact of our compliance with environmental laws is presented under the caption "Environmental Matters" in "Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Form 10-K.
