 Item 1. Business

&#160;

General

&#160;

ENB Financial Corp (&#8220;the Corporation&#8221;) is a bank holding company that was formed on July 1, 2008. The Corporation&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiary, Ephrata National Bank (&#8220;the Bank&#8221;), also referred to as ENB, is a full service commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States. Presently, no other subsidiaries exist under 

4&#160;

&#160; ENB FINANCIAL CORP

the bank holding company. The Corporation and the Bank are both headquartered in Ephrata, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The Bank was incorporated on April 11, 1881, pursuant to The National Bank Act under a charter granted by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures deposit accounts to the maximum extent provided by law. The Corporation&#8217;s retail, operational, and administrative offices are predominantly located in Northern Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Nine full service offices are located in Lancaster County with one full service office in Lebanon County, Pennsylvania.

&#160;

The basic business of the Corporation is to provide a broad range of financial services to individuals and small-to-medium-sized businesses in Northern Lancaster County as well as Berks and Lebanon Counties. The Corporation utilizes funds gathered through deposits from the general public to originate loans. The Corporation offers a range of demand accounts, in addition to savings and time deposits. The Corporation also offers secured and unsecured commercial, real estate, and consumer loans. Ancillary services that provide added convenience to customers include direct deposit and direct payments of funds through Electronic Funds Transfer, ATMs linked to the Star&#174; network, telephone banking, MasterCard&#174; debit cards, Visa&#174; or MasterCard credit cards, and safe deposit box facilities. In addition, the Corporation offers internet banking including bill pay and wire transfer capabilities, remote deposit capture, and an ENB Bank on the Go! app for iPhones or Android phones. The Corporation also offers a full complement of trust and investment advisory services through ENB&#8217;s Money Management Group.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, the Corporation employed 239 persons, consisting of 195 full-time and 44 part-time employees. The number of full-time employees decreased by one, and the number of part-time employees decreased by seven from the previous year-end . The decrease in the number of full-time and part-time employees is attributable directly to more open positions existing as of December 31, 2015 than as of December 31, 2014. The equivalent of over nine full-time positions were open as of December 31, 2015, more than twice the number of open positons as of December 31, 2014. A collective bargaining agent does not represent the employees.

&#160;

Operating Segments

&#160;

The Corporation&#8217;s business is providing financial products and services. These products and services are provided through the Corporation&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiary, the Bank. The Bank is presently the only subsidiary of the Corporation, and the Bank only has one reportable operating segment, community banking, as described in Note A of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. The segment reporting information in Note A is incorporated by reference into this Part I, Item 1.

&#160; 

Business Operations

&#160;

Products and Services with Reputation Risk 

The Corporation offers a diverse range of financial and banking products and services. In the event one or more customers and/or governmental agencies becomes dissatisfied with or objects to any product or service offered by the Corporation, negative publicity with respect to any such product or service, whether legally justified or not, could have a negative impact on the Corporation&#8217;s reputation. The discontinuance of any product or service, whether or not any customer or governmental agency has challenged any such product or service, could have a negative impact on the Corporation&#8217;s reputation.

&#160;

Market Area and Competition 

The Corporation&#8217;s primary market area is northern Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, where nine full service offices are located. However, the Corporation&#8217;s market area also extends into contiguous Lebanon and Berks Counties. The Corporation&#8217;s tenth full service office was opened in November 2013 in southeastern Lebanon County to extend physical presence to that county. The Corporation&#8217;s greater service area is considered to be Lancaster, Lebanon, and Berks Counties of Pennsylvania. The area served by the Corporation is a mix of rural communities and small to mid-sized towns. 

&#160; 

The Corporation&#8217;s headquarters and main campus are located in Ephrata, Pennsylvania. The Corporation&#8217;s main office and drive-up are located in downtown Ephrata, while the Cloister office is also located within Ephrata Borough. As such, the Corporation has a very strong presence in Ephrata Borough, a community with a population of approximately 13,000. When surrounding areas that also share an Ephrata address and zip code are included, the population is over 32,000 based on 2010 census data. The Corporation ranks a commanding first in deposit market share in the Ephrata area with 43.3% of deposits as of June 30, 2015, based on data compiled annually by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The Corporation&#8217;s deposit market share in the Ephrata area was 

5&#160;

&#160; ENB FINANCIAL CORP

44.1% as of June 30, 2014. The Corporation&#8217;s very high market share in the Ephrata area equates to a saturation of the local market that has led to the expansion of the Corporation&#8217;s branch network. 

&#160; 

In the past 15 years, the Corporation&#8217;s market area has expanded beyond the greater Ephrata area to encompass most of northern Lancaster County, with the exception of the most western parts of the County. The majority of this expansion has occurred in recent history with the addition of six new branch offices since 1999, bringing the total offices to ten. Lancaster County ranks high nationally as a favored place to reside due to its scenic and fertile farmland, low cost of living, diversity of the local economy, and proximity to several large metropolitan areas. As a result, the area has experienced significant population growth and development. The population growth of Lancaster County has remained above both Pennsylvania and national growth levels over the past fifty years. Additionally, the population of Lancaster County has recently eclipsed half a million, with 2010 census information showing an estimated population of 508,000. The FDIC deposit market share data ranked the Corporation 5 th in deposit market share in Lancaster County, with 6.3% of deposits as of June 30, 2015. The Corporation held 6.6% of deposit market share as of June 30, 2014. 

&#160;

In the course of attracting and retaining deposits and originating loans, the Corporation faces considerable competition. The Corporation competes with other commercial banks, savings and loan institutions, and credit unions for traditional banking products, such as deposits and loans. Based on FDIC summary of deposit data, there were 21 banks and savings associations and 12 credit unions operating in Lancaster County as of June 30, 2015, representing two more banks and the same number of credit unions compared to the prior year. The Corporation competes with consumer finance companies for loans, mutual funds, and other investment alternatives for deposits. The Corporation competes for deposits based on the ability to provide a range of products, low fees, quality service, competitive rates, and convenient locations and hours. The competition for loan origination generally relates to interest rates offered, products available, quality of service, and loan origination fees charged. Several competitors within the Corporation&#8217;s primary market have substantially higher legal lending limits that enable them to service larger loans and larger commercial customers. 

&#160; 

The Corporation continues to assess the competition and market area to determine the best way to meet the financial needs of the communities it serves. Management also continues to pursue new market opportunities based on the strategic plan to efficiently grow the Corporation, improve earnings performance, and bring the Corporation&#8217;s products and services to customers currently not being reached. Management strategically addresses growth opportunities versus competitive issues by determining the new products and services to be offered, expansion of existing footprint with new locations, as well as investing in the expertise of staffing for expansion of these services.

&#160;

Subsequent to December 31, 2015, but prior to the filing of this document, the Corporation entered into an agreement of sale in February 2016 to purchase improved real estate in Morgantown, Pennsylvania for a planned full-service branch office. The agreement is contingent on regulatory approval. Provided the Corporation does receive regulatory approval, management would continue with plans to prepare the property for opening in the third quarter of 2016. Management estimates the aggregate of the purchase price and other costs related to opening the branch to be $1.7 million.

&#160;

Concentrations and Seasonality 

The Corporation does not have any portion of its businesses dependent on a single or limited number of customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on its businesses. No substantial portion of loans or investments is concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries, although a significant amount of loans are secured by real estate located in northern Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Agricultural purpose loans make up approximately 34% of the loan portfolio; however, these loans are further diversified according to type of agriculture, of which dairy is the largest component accounting for approximately 16% of the loan portfolio. The business activities of the Corporation are generally not seasonal in nature. The sizable agricultural portfolio has minority elements that are predominately seasonal in nature due to typical farming operations. Financial instruments with concentrations of credit risk are described in Note P of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. The concentration of credit risk information in Note P is incorporated by reference into this Part I, Item 1.

Supervision and Regulation

&#160;

Bank holding companies operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely examined by federal and state regulatory authorities. The following discussion concerns various federal and state laws and regulations and the potential impact of such laws and regulations on the Corporation and the Bank.

&#160; 

To the extent that the following information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions themselves. Proposals to change laws and regulations are frequently introduced in Congress, the state legislatures, and before the various bank regulatory agencies. The Corporation cannot determine the likelihood or timing of any such proposals or legislation, or the impact they may have on the Corporation and the Bank. A change in law, regulations, or regulatory policy may have a material effect on the Corporation and the Bank&#8217;s business.

&#160; 

The operations of the Bank are subject to federal and state statutes applicable to banks chartered under the banking laws of the United States, to members of the Federal Reserve System, and to banks whose deposits are insured by the FDIC. Bank operations are subject to regulations of the OCC, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC.

&#160; 

Bank Holding Company Supervision and Regulation 

&#160; 

The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 

The Corporation is subject to the provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and to supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. The following restrictions apply:

&#160;

General Supervision by the Federal Reserve Board 

As a bank holding company, the Corporation&#8217;s activities are limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking. Bank holding companies are required to file periodic reports with and are subject to examination by the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted a risk-focused supervision program for small shell bank holding companies that is tied to the examination results of the subsidiary bank. The Federal Reserve Board has issued regulations under the Bank Holding Company Act that require a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks. As a result, the Federal Reserve Board may require that the Corporation stand ready to provide adequate capital funds to the Bank during periods of financial stress or adversity.

&#160;

Restrictions on Acquiring Control of Other Banks and Companies 

A bank holding company may not:

&#160;

&#183; acquire direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of any class of voting stock, or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or &#183; merge or consolidate with another bank holding company, without prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. &#160;

In addition, a bank holding company may not:

&#160;

&#183; engage in a non-banking business, or &#183; acquire ownership or control of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of any class of voting stock of any company engaged in a non-banking business, &#160;

unless the Federal Reserve Board determines the business to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to banking. In making this determination, the Federal Reserve Board considers whether these activities offer benefits to the public that outweigh any possible adverse effects.

&#160;

Anti-Tie-In Provisions 

A bank holding company and its subsidiaries may not engage in tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or provision of any property or services. These anti-tie-in provisions state generally that a bank may not:

&#160;

&#183; extend credit, 7&#160;

&#160; ENB FINANCIAL CORP

&#183; lease or sell property, or &#183; furnish any service to a customer &#160;

on the condition that the customer provides additional credit or service to a bank or its affiliates, or on the condition that the customer not obtain other credit or service from a competitor of the bank.

&#160;

Restrictions on Extensions of Credit by Banks to their Holding Companies 

Subsidiary banks of a holding company are also subject to restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on:

&#160;

&#183; any extensions of credit to the bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries, &#183; investments in the stock or other securities of the Corporation, and &#183; taking these stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. &#160;

Risk-Based Capital Guidelines 

Bank holding companies must comply with the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s current risk-based capital guidelines, which are amended provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. The required minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets, including some off-balance sheet activities, such as standby letters of credit, is 8%. At least half of the total capital is required to be Tier I Capital, consisting principally of common shareholders&#8217; equity, less certain intangible assets. The remainder, Tier II Capital, may consist of:

&#160;

&#183; some types of preferred stock, &#183; a limited amount of subordinated debt, &#183; some hybrid capital instruments, &#183; other debt securities, and &#183; a limited amount of the general loan loss allowance. &#160;

The risk-based capital guidelines are required to take adequate account of interest rate risk, concentrations of credit risk, and risks of nontraditional activities.

&#160;

Capital Leverage Ratio Requirements 

The Federal Reserve Board requires a bank holding company to maintain a leverage ratio of a minimum level of Tier I capital, as determined under the risk-based capital guidelines, equal to 3% of average total consolidated assets for those bank holding companies that have the highest regulatory examination rating and are not contemplating or experiencing significant growth or expansion. All other bank holding companies are required to maintain a ratio of at least 1% to 2% above the stated minimum. The Bank is subject to similar capital requirements pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.

&#160;

Restrictions on Control Changes 

The Change in Bank Control Act of 1978 requires persons seeking control of a bank or bank holding company to obtain approval from the appropriate federal banking agency before completing the transaction. The law contains a presumption that the power to vote 10% or more of voting stock confers control of a bank or bank holding company. The Federal Reserve Board is responsible for reviewing changes in control of bank holding companies. In doing so, the Federal Reserve Board reviews the financial position, experience and integrity of the acquiring person, and the effect the change of control will have on the financial condition of the Corporation, relevant markets, and federal deposit insurance funds.

&#160;

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), also known as the &#8220;Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act,&#8221; was established in 2002 and introduced major changes to the regulation of financial practice. SOX was established as a reaction to the outbreak of corporate and accounting scandals, including Enron and WorldCom. SOX represents a comprehensive revision of laws affecting corporate governance, accounting obligations, and corporate reporting. SOX is applicable to all companies with equity or debt securities that are either registered, or file reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

&#160;

Section 404 of SOX requires publicly held companies to document and test their internal controls that impact financial reporting and report on the findings, known as Section 404a. External auditors also must test and report on the effectiveness of a company&#8217;s internal controls to ensure accurate financial reporting, which is known as Section 404b. Companies must report any deficiencies or material weaknesses in their internal controls, as well as their 

8&#160;

&#160; ENB FINANCIAL CORP

remediation efforts. To ensure greater investor confidence in corporate disclosures from public companies, SOX restricts the services that public accounting firms can provide to publicly traded companies. The Corporation does not engage the same professional accounting firm for external and internal auditing.

&#160;

The provisions of Sections 404a and 404b of SOX vary according to the publically traded market capitalization, referred to as accelerated or non-accelerated filers. While accelerated filers had to comply with Section 404a and 404b since 2004, with their auditors required to report on the effectiveness of internal controls, the Corporation has been a non-accelerated filer with a publicly traded market capitalization under $75 million, and therefore was not required to comply with Section 404b. The Corporation has always been subject to Section 404a.

&#160; 

In 2008, the SEC expanded the definitions of smaller public companies beyond non-accelerated filers to include a new definition of smaller reporting company. The smaller reporting company definition was more favorable to smaller businesses that qualified under certain conditions. On July 1, 2008, the Corporation came into existence as ENB Financial Corp, which succeeded Ephrata National Bank. With the new entity and new SEC registration statement, the Corporation changed the filing status from non-accelerated filer to smaller reporting company. The Corporation continues to meet the definition of a smaller reporting company as it has a public equity float of approximately $57.1 million as of June 30, 2015.

&#160;

On July 21, 2010, when the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law, Section 404b was permanently deferred for all smaller reporting companies. The Corporation would become subject to Section 404b requirements of SOX at the end of 2016 if public float exceeds $75 million on June 30, 2016, at which time the Corporation would be considered an accelerated filer.

&#160;

Bank Supervision and Regulation 

&#160;

Safety and Soundness 

The primary regulator for the Bank is the OCC. The OCC has the authority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to prevent a national bank from engaging in any unsafe or unsound practice in conducting business or from otherwise conducting activities in violation of the law.

&#160;

Federal and state banking laws and regulations govern, but are not limited to, the following:

&#160;

&#183; Scope of a bank&#8217;s business &#183; Investments a bank may make &#183; Reserves that must be maintained against certain deposits &#183; Loans a bank makes and collateral it takes &#183; Merger and consolidation activities &#183; Establishment of branches &#160;

The Corporation is a member of the Federal Reserve System. Therefore, the policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board have a significant impact on many elements of the Corporation&#8217;s operations, including:

&#160;

&#183; Loan and deposit growth &#183; Rate of interest earned and paid &#183; Types of securities &#183; Breadth of financial services provided &#183; Levels of liquidity &#183; Levels of required capital &#160;

Management cannot predict the effect of changes to such policies and regulations upon the Corporation&#8217;s business model and the corresponding impact they may have on future earnings.

&#160;

FDIC Insurance Assessments 

The FDIC imposes a risk-related premium schedule for all insured depository institutions that results in the assessment of premiums based on the Bank&#8217;s capital and supervisory measures. Under the risk-related premium schedule, the FDIC assigns, on a semi-annual basis, each depository institution to one of three capital groups, the best of these being &#8220;Well Capitalized.&#8221; For purposes of calculating the insurance assessment, the Bank was considered &#8220;Well Capitalized&#8221; as of December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014. This designation has benefited 

9&#160;

&#160; ENB FINANCIAL CORP

the Bank in the past and continues to benefit it in terms of a lower quarterly FDIC rate. The FDIC adjusts the insurance rates when necessary. FDIC insurance rates have been significantly higher in recent years compared to years prior to the financial crisis. In 2008, during the financial crisis, the FDIC insurance limit was increased from $100,000 to $250,000 along with unlimited insurance coverage on non-interest bearing deposits and interest bearing deposit balances with interest rates less than or equal to 0.50%. Significant increases in the FDIC insurance costs were assessed in 2009 to both cover the increased level of bank failures that were occurring and the higher level of coverage. Since then the number of bank failures has significantly declined and the FDIC has been able to decrease the cost of the insurance. The total FDIC assessments paid by the Bank in 2015 were $440,000, compared to $378,000 in 2014.

&#160; 

In addition to FDIC insurance costs, the Bank is subject to assessments to pay the interest on Financing Corporation Bonds. Congress created the Financing Corporation to issue bonds to finance the resolution of failed thrift institutions. These assessment rates are set quarterly. The total Financing Corporation assessments paid by the Bank in 2015 were $47,000 compared to $46,000 in 2014.

&#160; 

On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act made the temporary $250,000 FDIC insurance coverage the permanent standard maximum deposit insurance amount. Additionally, on February 7, 2011, the Board of Directors of the FDIC approved a final rule based on the Dodd-Frank Act that revises the assessment base from one based on domestic deposits to one based on assets. This change, which was effective in April 2011, saved the Corporation a significant amount of FDIC insurance premiums.

&#160;

Community Reinvestment Act 

Under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), as amended, the OCC is required to assess all financial institutions that it regulates to determine whether these institutions are meeting the credit needs of the community that they serve. The Act focuses specifically on low and moderate income neighborhoods. The OCC takes an institution&#8217;s CRA record into account in its evaluation of any application made by any of such institutions for, among other things:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Approval of a new branch or other deposit facility &#160; &#183; Closing of a branch or other deposit facility &#160; &#183; An office relocation or a merger &#160; &#183; Any acquisition of bank shares &#160; 

The CRA, as amended, also requires that the OCC make publicly available the evaluation of a bank&#8217;s record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. This evaluation includes a descriptive rating of either outstanding, satisfactory, needs to improve, or substantial noncompliance, along with a statement describing the basis for the rating. These ratings are publicly disclosed. The Bank received an outstanding rating on the most recent CRA Performance Evaluation completed on June 22, 2015.

&#160; 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 

&#160; 

Capital Adequacy 

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), institutions are classified in one of five defined categories as illustrated below:

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Tier I Capital &#160; &#160; &#160; Common Equity Tier I &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Capital Category &#160; &#160; Total Capital Ratio &#160; &#160; &#160; Ratio &#160; &#160; &#160; Capital Ratio &#160; &#160; &#160; Leverage Ratio &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Well Capitalized &#160; &#160; &#62; 10.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#62;8.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#62; 6.5 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#62; 5.0 &#160; Adequately Capitalized &#160; &#160; &#62; 8.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#62;6.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#62; 4.5 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#62; 4.0* &#160; Undercapitalized &#160; &#160; &#60; 8.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#60;6.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#60;4.5 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#60;4.0* &#160; Significantly Undercapitalized &#160; &#160; &#60; 6.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#60;4.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#60;3.5 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#60;3.0 &#160; Critically Undercapitalized &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#60; 2.0 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; *3.0 for those banks having the highest available regulatory rating. &#160;

The Bank&#8217;s and Corporation&#8217;s capital ratios exceed the regulatory requirements to be considered well capitalized for Total Risk-Based Capital, Tier I Risk-Based Capital, Common Equity Tier I Capital, and Tier I Leverage Capital. The capital ratio table and Consolidated Financial Statement Note M &#8211; Regulatory Matters and Restrictions, are 

10&#160;

&#160; ENB FINANCIAL CORP

&#160;

incorporated by reference herein, from Item 8, and made a part hereof. Note M discloses capital ratios for both the Bank and the Corporation, shown as Consolidated.

&#160;

Regulatory Capital Changes 

In July 2013, the federal banking agencies issued final rules to implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The phase-in period for community banking organizations began January 1, 2015, while larger institutions (generally those with assets of $250 billion or more) began compliance on January 1, 2014. The final rules call for the following capital requirements:

&#160;

&#183; A minimum ratio of common equity tier I capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%. &#183; A minimum ratio of tier I capital to risk-weighted assets of 6%. &#183; A minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%. &#183; A minimum leverage ratio of 4%. &#160;

In addition, the final rules established a common equity tier I capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets applicable to all banking organizations. If a banking organization fails to hold capital above the minimum capital ratios and the capital conservation buffer, it will be subject to certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The phase-in period for the capital conservation and countercyclical capital buffers for all banking organizations will begin on January 1, 2016.

&#160;

Under the initially proposed rules, accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) would have been included in a banking organization&#8217;s common equity tier I capital. The final rules allowed community banks to make a one-time election not to include these additional components of AOCI in regulatory capital and instead use the existing treatment under the general risk-based capital rules that excludes most AOCI components from regulatory capital. The opt-out election was made by the Corporation with the filing of the first quarter Call Report as of March 31, 2015.

&#160;

The final rules permanently grandfather non-qualifying capital instruments (such as trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock) issued before May 19, 2010 for inclusion in the tier I capital of banking organizations with total consolidated assets less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009, and banking organizations that were mutual holding companies as of May 19, 2010. The Corporation does not have trust preferred securities or cumulative perpetual preferred stock with no plans to add these to the capital structure.

&#160;

The proposed rules would have modified the risk-weight framework applicable to residential mortgage exposures to require banking organizations to divide residential mortgage exposures into two categories in order to determine the applicable risk weight. In response to commenter concerns about the burden of calculating the risk weights and the potential negative effect on credit availability, the final rules do not adopt the proposed risk weights but retain the current risk weights for mortgage exposures under the general risk-based capital rules.

&#160;

Consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, the new rules replace the ratings-based approach to securitization exposures, which is based on external credit ratings, with the simplified supervisory formula approach in order to determine the appropriate risk weights for these exposures. Alternatively, banking organizations may use the existing gross-up approach to assign securitization exposures to a risk weight category or choose to assign such exposures a 1,250 percent risk weight. The Corporation does not securitize assets and has no plans to do so.

&#160;

Under the new rules, mortgage servicing assets (MSAs) and certain deferred tax assets (DTAs) are subject to stricter limitations than those applicable under the current general risk-based capital rule. The new rules also increase the risk weights for past-due loans, certain commercial real estate loans, and some equity exposures, and makes selected other changes in risk weights and credit conversion factors.

&#160; 

Management has evaluated the impact of the above rules on levels of the Corporation&#8217;s capital. The final rulings were highly favorable in terms of the items that would have a more significant impact to the Corporation and community banks in general. Specifically, the AOCI final ruling, which would have had the greatest impact, now provides the Corporation with an opt-out provision. The final ruling on the risk weightings of mortgages was favorable and did not have a material negative impact. The rulings as to trust preferred securities, preferred stock, and securitization of assets are not applicable to the Corporation, and presently the revised treatment of MSAs is not material to capital. The remaining changes to risk weightings on several items mentioned above such as past-due loans and certain 

11&#160;

&#160; ENB FINANCIAL CORP

&#160;

commercial real estate loans do not have a material impact to capital presently, but could change as these levels change.

&#160;

Real Estate Lending Standards 

Pursuant to the FDICIA, federal banking agencies adopted real estate lending guidelines which would set loan-to-value (&#8220;LTV&#8221;) ratios for different types of real estate loans. The LTV ratio is generally defined as the total loan amount divided by the appraised value of the property at the time the loan is originated. If the institution does not hold a first lien position, the total loan amount would be combined with the amount of all junior liens when calculating the ratio. In addition to establishing the LTV ratios, the guidelines require all real estate loans to be based upon proper loan documentation and a recent appraisal or certificate of inspection of the property.

&#160;

Prompt Corrective Action 

In the event that an institution&#8217;s capital deteriorates to the Undercapitalized category or below, FDICIA prescribes an increasing amount of regulatory intervention, including:

&#160;

&#183; Implementation of a capital restoration plan and a guarantee of the plan by a parent institution &#183; Placement of a hold on increases in assets, number of branches, or lines of business &#160;

If capital reaches the significantly or critically undercapitalized level, further material restrictions can be imposed, including restrictions on interest payable on accounts, dismissal of management, and (in critically undercapitalized situations) appointment of a receiver. For well-capitalized institutions, FDICIA provides authority for regulatory intervention where they deem the institution to be engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, or if the institution receives a less than satisfactory examination report rating for asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, or sensitivity to market risk.

&#160; 

Other FDICIA Provisions 

Each depository institution must submit audited financial statements to its primary regulator and the FDIC, whose reports are made publicly available. In addition, the audit committee of each depository institution must consist of outside directors and the audit committee at &#8220;large institutions&#8221; (as defined by FDIC regulation) must include members with banking or financial management expertise. The audit committee at &#8220;large institutions&#8221; must also have access to independent outside counsel. In addition, an institution must notify the FDIC and the institution&#8217;s primary regulator of any change in the institution&#8217;s independent auditor, and annual management letters must be provided to the FDIC and the depository institution&#8217;s primary regulator. The regulations define a &#8220;large institution&#8221; as one with over $500 million in assets, which does include the Bank. Also, under the rule, an institution's independent public accountant must examine the institution's internal controls over financial reporting and perform agreed-upon procedures to test compliance with laws and regulations concerning safety and soundness.

&#160;

Under the FDICIA, each federal banking agency must prescribe certain safety and soundness standards for depository institutions and their holding companies. Three types of standards must be prescribed:

&#160;

&#183; asset quality and earnings &#183; operational and managerial, and &#183; compensation &#160;

Such standards would include a ratio of classified assets to capital, minimum earnings, and, to the extent feasible, a minimum ratio of market value to book value for publicly traded securities of such institutions and holding companies. Operational and managerial standards must relate to:

&#160;

&#183; internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems &#183; loan documentation &#183; credit underwriting &#183; interest rate exposure &#183; asset growth, and &#183; compensation, fees and benefits &#160;

The FDICIA also sets forth Truth in Savings disclosure and advertising requirements applicable to all depository institutions.

USA PATRIOT Act of 2001/Bank Secrecy Act 

In October 2001, the USA Patriot Act of 2001 (Patriot Act) was enacted in response to the terrorist attacks in New York, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C., which occurred on September 11, 2001. The Patriot Act is intended to strengthen U.S. law enforcement&#8217;s and the intelligence communities&#8217; abilities to work cohesively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts. The impact of the Patriot Act on financial institutions of all kinds is significant and wide ranging. The Patriot Act contains sweeping anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and imposes various regulations, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering.

&#160; 

Under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), banks and other financial institutions are required to report to the Internal Revenue Service currency transactions of more than $10,000 or multiple transactions of which a bank is aware in any one day that aggregate in excess of $10,000 and to report suspicious transactions under specified criteria. Civil and criminal penalties are provided under the BSA for failure to file a required report, for failure to supply information required by the BSA, or for filing a false or fraudulent report.

&#160;

Loans to Insiders/Regulation O 

Regulation O, also known as Loans to Insiders, governs the permissible lending relationships between a bank and its executive officers, directors, and principal shareholders and their related interests. The primary restriction of Regulation O is that loan terms and conditions, including interest rates and collateral coverage, can be no more favorable to the insider than loans made in comparable transactions to non-covered parties. Additionally, the loan may not involve more than normal risk. The regulation requires quarterly reporting to regulators of the total amount of credit extended to insiders.

&#160;

Under Regulation O, a bank is not required to obtain approval from the bank&#8217;s Board of Directors prior to making a loan to an executive officer, as long as a first lien on the executive officer&#8217;s residence secures the loan. Further amendments allow bank insiders to take advantage of preferential loan terms that are available to substantially all employees. Regulation O does permit an insider to participate in a plan that provides more favorable credit terms than the bank provides to non-employee customers provided that the plan:

&#160;

&#183; Is widely available to employees &#183; Does not give preference to any insider over other employees &#160;

The Bank has a policy in place that offers general employees more favorable loan terms than those offered to non-employee customers. The Bank&#8217;s policy on loans to insiders allows insiders to participate in the same favorable rate and terms offered to all other employees; however, any loan to an insider that does not fall within permissible regulatory exceptions must receive the prior approval of the Bank&#8217;s Board of Directors.

&#160;

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

Among other things, Dodd-Frank created a new Financial Stability Oversight Council to identify systemic risks in the financial system and gave federal regulators new authority to take control of and liquidate financial firms. Dodd-Frank is expected to have a significant impact on the Corporation&#8217;s business operations as its provisions take effect. It is difficult to predict at this time what specific impact Dodd-Frank, with its implementing rules and regulations, will have on community banks. However, it is expected that, at a minimum, they will increase the Corporation&#8217;s operating and compliance costs and could increase interest expense. Among the provisions that are likely to affect the Corporation are the following:

&#160;

Holding Company Capital Requirements 

Dodd-Frank requires the Federal Reserve to apply consolidated capital requirements to bank holding companies that are no less stringent than those currently applied to depository institutions. Under these standards, trust preferred securities will be excluded from Tier I capital unless such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010, by a bank holding company with less than $15 billion in assets. Dodd-Frank additionally requires that bank regulators issue countercyclical capital requirements so that the required amount of capital increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction, are consistent with safety and soundness.

&#160;

Corporate Governance 

Dodd-Frank requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation at least every three years, a non-binding vote regarding the frequency of the vote on executive compensation at least 

13&#160;

&#160; ENB FINANCIAL CORP

&#160;

every six years, and a non-binding vote on &#8220;golden parachute&#8221; payments in connection with approvals of mergers and acquisitions unless previously voted on by shareholders. The SEC has finalized the rules implementing these requirements which took effect on January 21, 2011. The Corporation was exempt from these requirements until January 21, 2013, due to its status as a smaller reporting company. Additionally, Dodd-Frank directs the federal banking regulators to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of depository institutions and their holding companies with assets in excess of $1 billion, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded. Dodd-Frank also gives the SEC authority to prohibit broker discretionary voting on elections of directors and executive compensation matters.

&#160;

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) 

Dodd-Frank created a new, independent federal agency called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which is granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Act, the Consumer Financial Privacy Provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and certain other statutes. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Smaller institutions are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. The CFPB has authority to prevent unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. Dodd-Frank authorized the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages including a determination of the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay. In addition, Dodd-Frank allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; as defined by the CFPB. Dodd-Frank permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations.

Ability-to-Repay and Qualified Mortgage Rule 

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB issued a final rule on January 10, 2013 (effective on January 10, 2014), amending Regulation Z as implemented by the Truth in Lending Act, requiring mortgage lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. Mortgage lenders are required to determine consumers&#8217; ability to repay in one of two ways. The first alternative requires the mortgage lender to consider the following eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision: (1) current or reasonably expected income or assets; (2) current employment status; (3) the monthly payment on the covered transaction; (4) the monthly payment on any simultaneous loan; (5) the monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations; (6) current debt obligations, alimony, and child support; (7) the monthly debt-to-income ratio or residual income; and (8) credit history. Alternatively, the mortgage lender can originate &#8220;qualified mortgages,&#8221; which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. In general, a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; is a mortgage loan without negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years. In addition, to be a qualified mortgage the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed 3% of the total loan amount. Loans which meet these criteria will be considered qualified mortgages, and as a result generally protect lenders from fines or litigation in the event of foreclosure. Qualified mortgages that are &#8220;higher-priced&#8221; (e.g. subprime loans) garner a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay rules, while qualified mortgages that are not &#8220;higher-priced&#8221; (e.g. Prime loans) are given a safe harbor of compliance. The final rule, as issued, is not expected to have a material impact on the Corporation&#8217;s lending activities and on the Corporation&#8217;s Statements of Income or Financial Condition.

&#160;

Interchange Fees 

Under the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve adopted rules establishing standards for assessing whether the interchange fees that may be charged with respect to certain electronic debit transactions are &#8220;reasonable and proportional&#8221; to the costs incurred by issuers for processing such transactions.

&#160;

Interchange fees or &#8220;swipe&#8221; fees, are charges that merchants pay to the Corporation and other card-issuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions. The Federal Reserve Board has ruled that for financial institutions with assets of $10 billion or more the maximum permissible interchange fee for an electronic debit transaction is the sum of 21 cents per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction. The Federal Reserve Board also has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product. While the Corporation&#8217;s asset size is presently under $1 billion, there is concern that these requirements impacting financial institutions over $10 billion in assets will eventually be 

14&#160;

&#160; ENB FINANCIAL CORP

&#160;

pushed down to either financial institutions over $1 billion or to all financial institutions. This would negatively impact the Corporation&#8217;s non-interest income.

&#160;

TILA/RESPA Integrated Disclosure (TRID) Rules 

The TRID rules were mandated by Dodd-Frank to address the problem of the sometimes duplicative and overlapping disclosures required by the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) involving consumer purpose, closed end loans secured by real property. The CFPB was tasked with developing the new disclosures, defining the regulatory compliance parameters, and implementation. The timing elements built around these new disclosures were established to provide the consumer with ample time to consider the credit transaction and its associated costs. The final rules were implemented by amending the Truth in Lending Act; however implementation proved to be difficult as this marked the first time in thirty years that these standard disclosures were changed. Much reliance was placed on third party providers to the financial institutions to make all the necessary changes to the disclosures. After one delay, the rules became effective October 3, 2015. The Corporation partnered with its loan document software providers to ensure timely, compliant implementation.

&#160;

Cybersecurity

&#160;

In March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement instructed financial institutions to design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management practices cover the risk of compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution&#8217;s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution&#8217;s operations after a cyber-attack involving malware. Financial institutions are expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address the rebuilding of network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers are victim to a cyber-attack. The Corporation could be subject to fines or penalties if it fails to observe this regulatory guidance. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity.

&#160; 

Ongoing Legislation

&#160;

As a consequence of the extensive regulation of the financial services industry and specifically commercial banking activities in the United States, the Corporation&#8217;s business is particularly susceptible to changes in federal and state legislation and regulations. Over the course of time, various federal and state proposals for legislation could result in additional regulatory and legal requirements for the Corporation. Management cannot predict if any such legislation will be adopted, or if adopted, how it would affect the business of the Corporation. Past history has demonstrated that new legislation or changes to existing legislation usually results in a heavier compliance burden and generally increases the cost of doing business.

&#160; 

Management believes that the effect of any current legislative proposals on the liquidity, capital resources and the results of operations of the Corporation and the Bank will be minimal. It is possible that there will be regulatory proposals which, if implemented, could have a material effect upon our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations. In addition, the general cost of compliance with numerous federal and state laws does have, and in the future may have, a negative impact on our results of operations. As with other banks, the status of the financial services industry can affect the Bank. Consolidations of institutions are expected to continue as the financial services industry seeks greater efficiencies and market share. Bank management believes that such consolidations may enhance the Bank&#8217;s competitive position as a community bank. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information.
