Our Business 

We are a company engaged in the electronic cigarette and personal vaporizer industry. We own a portfolio of electronic cigarette and personal vaporizer patents (the &#8220;Patents&#8221;) which are the basis for our efforts to: 

&#149; Design, market and distribute a line of e liquids under the &#8220;HELUIM&#8221; brand; &#160; &#149; Design, market and distribute electronic cigarettes; &#160; 

&#160; &#149; Prosecute and enforce our patent rights; &#160;

&#160; &#149; Develop private label manufacturing programs. &#160; 

Electronic Cigarettes and Personal Vaporizers 

&#160; 

&#8220;Electronic cigarettes&#8221; or &#8220;e-cigarettes,&#8221; are battery-powered products that enable users to inhale nicotine vapor without smoke, tar, ash, or carbon monoxide. Electronic cigarettes look like traditional cigarettes and, regardless of their construction are comprised of three functional components: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; a mouthpiece, which is a small plastic cartridge that contains a liquid nicotine solution; &#160; 

&#160; &#149; the heating element that vaporizes the liquid nicotine so that it can be inhaled; and &#160; 

&#160; &#149; the electronics, which include: a lithium-ion battery, an airflow sensor, a microchip controller and an LED, which illuminates to indicate use. &#160;

When a user draws air through the electronic cigarette, the air flow is detected by a sensor, which activates a heating element that vaporizes the solution stored in the mouthpiece /cartridge, the solution is then vaporized and it is this vapor that is inhaled by the user. The cartridge contains either a nicotine solution or a nicotine free solution, either of which may be flavored. 

&#160; 

Personal vaporizers are similar in form and function to electronic cigarettes but typically have a larger form factor and are used to vaporize solutions that are not nicotine based and may include flavors and or flavor combinations. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our Electronic Cigarettes, Personal Vaporizers 

&#160; 

Electronic Cigarettes 

&#160; 

We have developed a line of electronic cigarette e liquids which are currently sold under the brand name &#8220;Helium.&#8221; We plan to develop a complete line of disposable and rechargeable electronic cigarettes and personal vaporizers. Our electronic cigarettes will be available in multiple sizes, puff counts, flavors and nicotine strengths. 

&#160; 

Disposable electronic cigarettes feature a one-piece construction that houses all the components and is utilized until the nicotine or nicotine free solution is depleted. 

&#160; 

Rechargeable electronic cigarettes feature a rechargeable battery and replaceable cartridge. The cartridges are changed when the solution is depleted from use. 

&#160; 

Personal Vaporizers 

&#160; 

Personal Vaporizers or vaporizers typically feature a tank and a chamber, a heating element and a battery. The vaporizer user fills the tank with a liquid solution or the chamber with wax, dry herb or leaf. The vaporizer battery can be recharged and the tank and chamber can be refilled. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

The Market for Electronic Cigarettes, US, China 

&#160; 

Electronic cigarettes are generally marketed as an alternative to traditional tobacco burning cigarettes. Because electronic cigarettes offer a &#8220;smoking&#8221; experience without the burning of tobacco leaf, electronic cigarettes offer users the ability to satisfy their nicotine cravings without the byproducts of smoke, tar, ash or carbon monoxide. In many cases electronic cigarettes are not subject to the use prohibitions of tobacco-burning cigarettes and therefore may be used in more places than conventional cigarettes, however, certain states, cities, businesses, providers of transportation and public venues in the U.S. have already banned the use of electronic cigarettes, while others are considering banning the use of electronic cigarettes. We cannot provide any assurances that the use of electronic cigarettes will not be banned anywhere traditional tobacco burning cigarette use is banned. 

&#160; 

Global Market 

&#160; 

The global e-cigarette market is expected to grow over $50 billion by 2025, at an estimated compound annual growth rate (&#8220;CAGR&#8221;) of 22.36% from 2015 to 2025. The market will witness a staggering growth until 2017, by when most of the regulatory and policy framework will fall into place. The growth rate will significantly increase thereafter, with significant revenue generation from evolving markets of Asia Pacific (&#8220;APAC&#8221;) and Europe. 

&#160; 

Moreover, while disposable e-cigarettes dominated the global e-cigarette product market till 2014, rechargeable e-cigarettes, followed by personal vaporizers and mods will soon take over the top market positions in terms of revenue generation. The U.S. market will continue with its dominance through the forecast period, however, China is expected to grow at the fastest CAGR to become the second largest revenue generating country by the end of 2025. 

&#160; 

Distribution and Sales 

&#160; 

The distribution and sales strategy for our products is tailored to the characteristics of each market, whether it be geographical or demographical. 

&#160; 

Our sales and distribution channels are: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; Direct Sales and Distribution, where we have set up our own distribution directly to retailers. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Single independent distributors who are responsible for distribution within a single market. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Exclusive Territory and Exclusive Channel Distribution, where distributors have an exclusive territory within a country or an exclusive right to sell within a distribution channel (e.g. gas station). &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Distribution through wholesalers, where we supply either national or regional wholesalers who then service retailers. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; Internet/E-commerce Sales, where we sell directly to end users through one of our internet websites and or landing pages. &#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

VPR Brands is a technology holding company, whose assets include issued U.S. and Chinese patents for atomization related products including technology for medical marijuana vaporizers and electronic cigarette products and components. The company is also engaged in product development for the vapor or vaping market, including e-liquids. Electronic cigarettes (also known as ecigs or e-cigs) are electronic devices which deliver nicotine through atomization, or vaping of e-liquids and without smoke and other chemicals constituents typically found in traditional tobacco burning cigarette products. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

Our portfolio of electronic cigarette and personal vaporizer patents (the "Patents") are the basis for our efforts to:

&#160;

&#149; Design, market and distribute a line of e liquids under the &#8220;HELUIM&#8221; brand; &#160; &#149; Design, market and distribute electronic cigarettes; &#160; 

&#160; &#149; Prosecute and enforce our patent rights; &#160; 

&#160; &#149; License our intellectual property; and &#160; 

&#160; &#149; Develop private label manufacturing programs. &#160; 

Our branded electronic cigarette e-liquids: HELIUM 

&#160;

We design, develop and market electronic cigarette e liquids sold under the Heluim brand. Our electronic cigarette e liquids are marketed as an alternative to tobacco burning cigarettes. We launched the Heluim brand in limited U.S. markets in the first quarter of 2016 and grow distribution through third party distributors. Shortly after our U.S. launch we plan to introduce our electronic cigarette brand to the Chinese market. China is the largest producer and consumer of tobacco products in the world, however we believe that Chinese consumption of electronic cigarettes trails U.S. adoption and use. We believe that an opportunity exists to develop and expand our business and our Helium brand electronic cigarette e-liquids in China. 

&#160;

On March 4, 2016, the Company announced a new e-liquid innovation, namely Helium Hi Definition E-Liquid, that is chilled 20 degrees below room temperature by mini-chillers or desktop chillers designed by the Company to maintain optimum flavor, freshness and aroma by cooling the e-liquids (reducing the escape of molecules from the mixture of e-liquids into the headspace). Helium Hi Definition E-Liquid will come in (i) a 50ml, squeezable bottle with a drip tip, for our mini chillers, (ii) a 180ml bottle for our personal desktop chiller, or (iii) a sample pack of the 5 flavors offered which are a one-time use in 2ml tubes that are air tight. Helium Hi Definition E-Liquids were available for pre-orders on March 15, 2016 on VapeHelium.com and will be available for sale in Vape shops in the United States by April 1, 2016. 

&#160; 

Patent Rights 

&#160; 

We are evaluating our options and conducting investigations to determine if and which parties may be infringing our intellectual property, both in the United States of American and in the Peoples Republic of China. In the U.S., we are exploring legal options and strategies related to prosecuting infringers and pursuing available remedies. 

&#160; 

License our Technology 

&#160; 

In light of recent lawsuits filed against several electronic cigarette companies, we believe that an opportunity exists to license our patented technology to companies named in those lawsuits and others who may be seeking an alternative to the electronic cigarette technologies which are or may be subject to patent litigation. 

&#160;

Private label 

&#160;

As an extension of our plan to license our technology to other electronic cigarette companies, we plan to offer private label manufacturing programs for electronic cigarette companies that would rather purchase a finished 

&#160;

manufactured product, rather than simply purchasing a license to manufacture their products using our technology. We believe that we have a greater understanding of the manufacturing process than a licensee would and that we can better oversee the manufacturing process of our patented technologies and offer a more reliable and higher quality product through our supply chain than can otherwise be achieved by third parties. 

&#160; &#160; Corporate Information 

&#160; 

We were incorporated in New York on July 19, 2004, as Jobsinsite.com, Inc. Our articles of incorporation were amended on August 5, 2004, to change our name to Jobsinsite, Inc. On June 18, 2009, we merged with a Delaware corporation and became Jobsinsite, Inc. On July 1, 2009 we filed articles of conversion with the secretary of state of Delaware and became Soleil Capital L.P., a Delaware limited partnership. On September 2, 2015, we amended our articles of incorporation to change our name to VPR Brands, LP. We are managed by Soleil Capital Management LLC, a Delaware limited liability company. 

&#160; 

The Company is engaged in various monetization strategies of a portfolio of patents the Company owns in both the US and China, covering electronic cigarette, electronic cigar and personal vaporizer patents. We currently market a brand of electronic cigarette e liquids marketed under the brand &#8220;Helium&#8221; in the United States and are undertaking efforts to establish distribution of our electronic cigarette e liquids brand in China. We are currently also identifying electronic cigarette companies that may be infringing our patents and exploring options to license and or enforce our patents. 

&#160; 

Since our inception, the Company has generated nominal revenues through the sale of software items related to the job search industry and in 2009 management actively explored opportunities to manage private capital, specifically the Company had plans to sponsor and manage limited partnerships organized for the purpose of exploring opportunities to acquire securities in secondary transactions of venture backed businesses and dispensing capital to seed stage venture capital opportunities. As a result of the Company&#8217;s new business direction and in an effort to establish operations in the venture capital and private equity industry, the Company has reorganized the business and restructured the Company as a public limited partnership. In 2013, management identified an opportunity to acquire a portfolio of electronic cigarette and personal vaporizers patents. In connection with this transaction the Company&#8217;s business objectives pivoted and the Company is now focusing its efforts on the electronic cigarette and personal vaporizer industry and is pursuing plans to commercialize and monetize its portfolio of electronic cigarette and personal vaporizer patents. Prior to the Company&#8217;s decision to design, develop and market electronic cigarette e liquids sold under the Heluim brand in March 2016, the Company had designed, developed and marketed electronic cigarettes sold under the RED brand. 

&#160; 

On December 27, 2013, the Company entered into a patent acquisition agreement (the &#34;Purchase Agreement&#34;), by and among the Company and Guocheng &#34;Greg&#34; Pan, a natural person, pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase certain electronic cigarette and personal vaporizer patents owned and invented by Mr. Pan (the &#34;Purchased Assets&#34;). Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement and in consideration for the acquisition of the Purchased Assets, the Company issued to Mr. Pan (and certain of his designees) 10,501,700 common units representing limited partnership units of the Company and a warrant to purchase 2,000,000 common units representing limited partnership units of the Company. The warrants entitle Mr. Pan (or his designees) to purchase common units of the Company at $0.15 per common unit with an expiration date ten years from the effective date of the Purchase Agreement. 

&#160; 

The patents were originally valued based on number of shares issued, warrants issued, valuation of the traded stock at the time of issuance and similar patents sold during the year. Based on these assumptions the Company has valued the assets purchased at approximately $5.5 million at the time of purchase. During the year ended December 31, 2014 the Company determined due to lack of sales and projected sales and completion in the industry the value of the patent should be significantly reduced. As a result the Company has written off the entire patent. 

&#160; 

In April 2015, the Company issued 25,000 of the Company&#8217;s Common Units to Gordon Hung in exchange for services for the Company valued at $12,500. 

&#160;

&#160; 

On May 29, 2015, the Company, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Kevin Frija (&#8220;Frija Share Purchase Agreement&#8221;) for a private placement (&#8220;Private Placement&#8221;) of up to 50,000,000 common units representing limited partnership interest of the Company. The Private Placement has been expected to occur in multiple tranches. For the first tranche, on June 4, 2015, the Company issued 10,000,000 shares of its Common Units to Kevin Frija at a purchase price of $0.01 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $100,000 to the Company. In subsequent tranches, Kevin Frija has the right to buy an additional 40,000,000 Common Units at a purchase price of $0.01 per share. The Company has been expecting to receive gross proceeds of $400,000 in the aggregate upon the closing of the subsequent tranches of the Private Placement, which is expected to be completed by September, 2016. No placement agent has participated in the Private Placement. 

&#160; 

In connection with the Share Purchase Agreement, the Company has named Kevin Frija chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of the Company and as a manager of the Company&#8217;s general partner, Soleil Capital Management LLC (the &#8220;General Partner&#8221;). Contemporaneous with Mr. Frija&#8217;s appointment as chief executive officer and chairman of the board of Directors, the Company&#8217;s current chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors, Messrs. Jon Pan and Greg Pan, respectively, have resigned from their respective positions. Notwithstanding, Mr. Greg Pan continues to serve as a member of the board of directors of the Company and as a manager of the General Partner and Mr. Jon Pan continues to serve as a consultant to the Company. In consideration and as severance, for Jon Pan&#8217;s resignation as chief executive officer, the Company and the General Partner have entered into that certain Share Purchase Agreement with Jon Pan wherein the Company agreed to grant Jon Pan the right to purchase 10,000,000 of the Company&#8217;s Common Units, at a price of $0.01 per share. 

&#160; 

In August 2015, the Company issued 1,980,000 of the Company&#8217;s common unit to the former CEO, Jon Pan in exchange for repayment of funds advanced of $8,000 and future consulting services totaling $11,800. The Company will amortize the prepaid expenses over the next 15 months starting October 1, 2015. 

&#160; 

On September 2, 2015, in accordance with authority granted to the General Partner under the Company&#8217;s Limited Partnership Agreement, the General Partner changed the Company&#8217;s name (&#8220;Name Change&#8221;) from Soleil Capital L.P. to VPR Brands, LP by filing an amendment to the Company&#8217;s Certificate of Limited Partnership with the Delaware Secretary of State. Accordingly, on September 10, 2015, the Company&#8217;s General Partner also amended the Company&#8217;s Limited Partnership Agreement to reflect the Name Change from Soleil Capital L.P. to VPR Brands, LP. On September 17, 2015, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) approved the Name Change and the Company&#8217;s new trading symbol VPRB. 

&#160; 

The Company, Soleil Capital Management LLC and Greg Pan entered into a Termination of Share Purchase Agreement on August 18, 2015, which terminated the Share Purchase Agreement, dated June 1, 2015, among the Company, Soleil Capital Management LLC and Greg Pan. 

&#160; 

On December 9, 2015, Kevin Frija sold an aggregate of 9,000,000 of his shares of Common Units at a sale price of $0.01 per share (for an aggregate of $90,000) to Jacob Levy (1,000,000 shares), Nissim Levy (1,000,000 shares), Sara Morad (1,000,000 shares), Yaron Edery (1,000,000 shares), Barry Rub (2,000,000 shares), Hannah Frija (2,000,000 shares), and Ralph Frija (1,000,000 shares). 

&#160; 

On March 28, 2016, Mr. Frija exercised a right to buy 15,000,000 shares of the Common Units at a purchase price of $0.01 per share, resulting in 15,000,000 shares of Common Units issued to Mr. Frija in exchange for gross proceeds of $150,000 to the Company, pursuant to the terms of the Frija Share Purchase Agreement , leaving a balance of 25,000,000 shares of Common Units to purchase at $0.01 per share under the right to buy under the Frija Share Purchase Agreement. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Competition in the electronic cigarette industry is intense. We compete with other sellers of electronic cigarettes, the nature of our competitors is varied as the market is highly fragmented and the barriers to entry into the business are low. Our direct competitors sell products that are substantially similar to ours and through the same channels through which we sell our electronic cigarette products. We compete with these direct competitors for sales 

&#160;

through distributors, wholesalers and retailers, including but not limited to national chain stores, tobacco shops, gas stations, travel stores, shopping mall kiosks, in addition to direct to public sales through the internet, mail order and telesales. As a general matter, we have access to and market and sell the similar electronic cigarettes as our competitors and since we sell our products at substantially similar prices as our competitors. 

&#160; 

Part of our business strategy focuses on the establishment of contractual relationships with distributors. We are aware that e-cigarette competitors in the industry are also seeking to enter into such contractual relationships. In many cases, competitors for such contracts may have greater management, human, and financial resources than we do for entering into such contracts and for attracting distributor relationships. Furthermore, certain of our electronic cigarette competitors may have better control of their supply and distribution, be, better established, larger and better financed than our Company. 

&#160; 

We also compete against &#8220;big tobacco&#8221;, U.S. cigarette manufacturers of both conventional tobacco cigarettes and electronic cigarettes like Altria Group, Inc., Lorillard, Inc. and Reynolds American, Inc. We compete against &#8220;big tobacco&#8221; who offers not only conventional tobacco cigarettes and electronic cigarettes but also smokeless tobacco products such as &#8220;snus&#8221; (a form of moist ground smokeless tobacco that is usually sold in sachet form that resembles small tea bags), chewing tobacco and snuff. &#8220;Big tobacco&#8221; has nearly limitless resources, global distribution networks in place and a customer base that is fiercely loyal to their brands. Furthermore, we believe that &#8220;big tobacco&#8221; will devote more attention and resources to developing and offering electronic cigarettes as the market for electronic cigarettes grows. Because of their well-established sales and distribution channels, marketing expertise and significant resources, &#8220;big tobacco&#8221; is better positioned than small competitors like us to capture a larger share of the electronic cigarette market. 

&#160; 

We may also face competition from other patent holders, including but not limited to, Imperial Tobacco Group Plc, Europe&#8217;s second-biggest tobacco company, who in September, 2013 acquired a portfolio of electronic cigarette patents from buy Dragonite International Ltd.&#8217;s (formerly Ruyan Group Holdings Limited) for $75 million, as we attempt to negotiate and contract with other electronic cigarette companies to license our intellectual property. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

We depend on third party manufacturers for our electronic cigarettes, vaporizers and accessories. Our customers associate certain characteristics of our products including the weight, feel, draw, unique flavor, packaging and other attributes of our products to the brands we market, distribute and sell. Any interruption in supply and/or consistency of our products may adversely impact our ability to deliver our products to our wholesalers, distributors and customers and otherwise harm our relationships and reputation with customers, and have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

&#160; 

Although we believe that several alternative sources for our products are available, any failure to obtain the components, chemical constituents and manufacturing services necessary for the production of our products would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

&#160; 

Source and Availability of Raw Materials 

&#160; 

We believe that an adequate supply of product and raw materials will be available to us as needed and from multiple sources and suppliers. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We own a portfolio of issued electronic cigarette and personal vaporizer related patents. Our Patents, listed below are issued by the United State Patent and Trademark Office and the Patent Office of the People&#8217;s Republic of China. Our Patents include: 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; Electronic Cigarette, Patent 8,205,622 as issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office on May 14, 2012, &#160; 

&#160; &#149; Multifunctional Electronic Inhaler, Patent ZL2011-2-0096290.6 as issued by the Patent Office of The People's Republic of China on 11/23/2011, &#160; 

&#160; &#149; Electronic Pipe, Patent ZL2008-2-0123801.7 as issued by the Patent Office of The People's Republic Of China on September 2, 2009, &#160;

&#160; &#149; Electronic Cigarette, Patent ZL2009-2-0106627.x as issued by the Patent Office of The People's Republic of China on January 3, 2010, &#160; 

&#160; &#149; Disposable Integrated E-Atomizing Inhaler, Patent ZL2008-2-0124683.1 as issued by the Patent Office of The People's Republic of China on January 13, 2010, &#160; 

&#160; &#149; Electronic Atomizer, Patent ZL2008-3-0084421.2 as issued by the Patent Office of The People's Republic of China on May 27, 2009, and &#160; 

&#160; &#149; Electronic Cigar, Patent ZL2008-3-0132968.5 as issued by the Patent Office of The People's Republic of China on October 10, 2009. &#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Pursuant to a December 2010, decision, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in Sottera, Inc. v. Food &#38; Drug Administration, 627 F.3d 891 (D.C. Cir. 2010), the United States Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;FDA&#8221;) is permitted to regulate electronic cigarettes as &#8220;tobacco products&#8221; under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 (the &#8220;Tobacco Control Act&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Under this Court decision, the FDA is not permitted to regulate electronic cigarettes as &#8220;drugs&#8221; or &#8220;devices&#8221; or a &#8220;combination product&#8221; under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act unless they are marketed for therapeutic purposes. 

&#160; 

Because we do not market our electronic cigarettes for therapeutic purposes, our electronic cigarettes are subject to being classified as &#8220;tobacco products&#8221; under the Tobacco Control Act. The Tobacco Control Act grants the FDA broad authority over the manufacture, sale, marketing and packaging of tobacco products, although the FDA is prohibited from issuing regulations banning all cigarettes or all smokeless tobacco products, or requiring the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero. 

&#160; 

The Tobacco Control Act also requires establishment, within the FDA&#8217;s new Center for Tobacco Products, of a Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee to provide advice, information and recommendations with respect to the safety, dependence or health issues related to tobacco products. 

&#160; 

The Tobacco Control Act imposes significant new restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products. For example, the law requires the FDA to finalize certain portions of regulations previously adopted by the FDA in 1996 (which were struck down by the Supreme Court in 2000 as beyond the FDA&#8217;s authority). As written, these regulations would significantly limit the ability of manufacturers, distributors and retailers to advertise and promote tobacco products, by, for example, restricting the use of color, graphics and sound effects in advertising, limiting the use of outdoor advertising, restricting the sale and distribution of non-tobacco items and services, gifts, and sponsorship of events and imposing restrictions on the use for cigarette or smokeless tobacco products of trade 

&#160;

or brand names that are used for non-tobacco products. The law also requires the FDA to issue future regulations regarding the promotion and marketing of tobacco products sold or distributed over the internet, by mail order or through other non-face-to-face transactions in order to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors. 

&#160; 

It is likely that the Tobacco Control Act could result in a decrease in tobacco product sales in the United States, including sales of our electronic cigarettes. 

&#160; 

On April 24, 2014 the Food and Drug Administration released a proposed set of deeming regulations on electronic cigarettes and other nicotine and tobacco based products. The proposed regulations include the following requirements: 

&#160; &#8226; Manufacturers would need to register each of their manufacturing facilities with the FDA, submit a product list including a list of ingredients, and report any harmful and potentially harmful constituents. &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; Retailers would not be allowed to provide free samples of electronic cigarettes to adults. &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; The minimum age to purchase electronic cigarettes in addition to other deemed tobacco products would be 18 years old and retailers will be required to verify through photographic identification the legal minimum age of a customer who is younger than 27 years old. &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; For newer tobacco products that were not on the market as of February 15, 2007, manufacturers of these products would need to submit what is called a premarket tobacco application (PMTA) to the FDA within 24 months following the effective date of the final deeming regulations. If a PMTA application is filed with the FDA during this 24 month period, then the manufacturer can continue to market its products unless and until the FDA responds to the application. &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; The FDA would require under a new health warning on the packaging and advertisements for electronic cigarettes which would read: &#8220;WARNING: This product contains nicotine derived from tobacco. Nicotine is an addictive chemical.&#8221; &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; The proposed deeming regulation does not ban flavors for electronic cigarettes. &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; In the proposed deeming regulations, the FDA acknowledges that the agency does not have sufficient scientific data about e-cigarettes to determine what effect they have on the public health. The FDA will continue to analyze the potential benefits and harms of e-cigarettes and is seeking additional scientific data to determine how e-cigarettes should be regulated given the fact that the products may be lower risk than combustible tobacco products. The FDA may consider additional regulations on e-cigarettes in the future. &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; The deeming regulations do not include a ban on the Internet sale of e-cigarettes. In addition, the regulations do not restrict or prohibit television advertising of e-cigarettes. &#160; 

E-cigarette manufacturers are required to complete and file a premarket tobacco application to continue to sell their products. This application procedure is a complicated, expensive and time consuming process. The FDA estimates that it will take a manufacturer approximately 5,000 hours to complete one premarket tobacco application for a tobacco product (electronic cigarette), which would includes conducting scientific studies on the new product and submitting all of the relevant paperwork. 

The FDA is accepting comments on the deeming regulations for a period of 75 days, which ends on July 9, 2014. These comments will be important since industry recommendations and data provided to the FDA would all 

&#160;

be taken into consideration by the agency in establishing the final rules and regulations for electronic cigarette products. 

From a timing perspective, the process to finalize the deeming regulations may take many months and as long as two years. 

We cannot predict the impact the regulations may have on our company specifically or the electronic cigarette industry generally, and the effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition the regulation will have. 

&#160; 

In this regard, total compliance and related costs are not possible to predict and depend substantially on the future requirements imposed by the FDA under the Tobacco Control Act. Costs, however, could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, failure to comply with the Tobacco Control Act and with FDA regulatory requirements could result in significant financial penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and ability to market and sell our products. At present, we are not able to predict whether the Tobacco Control Act will impact us to a greater degree than competitors in the industry, thus affecting our competitive position. 

&#160; 

State and local governments currently legislate and regulate tobacco products, including what is considered a tobacco product, how tobacco taxes are calculated and collected, to whom and by whom tobacco products can be sold and where tobacco products may or may not be smoked. Certain states and cities have enacted laws which preclude the use of electronic cigarettes where traditional tobacco burning cigarettes cannot be used and others have proposed legislation that would categorize electronic cigarettes as tobacco products, equivalent to their tobacco burning counterparts. If the use of electronic cigarettes is banned anywhere the use of traditional tobacco burning cigarettes is banned, electronic cigarettes may lose their appeal as an alternative to cigarettes; which may have the effect of reducing the demand for our products and as a result have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

&#160; 

At present, neither the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act (which prohibits the use of the U.S. Postal Service to mail most tobacco products and which amends the Jenkins Act, which would require individuals and businesses that make interstate sales of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco to comply with state tax laws) nor the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (which governs how cigarettes can be advertised and marketed) apply to electronic cigarettes. The application of either or both of these federal laws to electronic cigarettes would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. &#160; The Tobacco industry expects significant regulatory developments to take place over the next few years, driven principally by the World Health Organization&#8217;s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (&#8220;FCTC&#8221;). The FCTC is the first international public health treaty on tobacco, and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation. Regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; &#160; the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges; &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; &#160; restrictions or bans on advertising, marketing and sponsorship; &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; &#160; the display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements; &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; &#160; restrictions on packaging design, including the use of colors and generic packaging; &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; &#160; restrictions or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale, and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; &#160; requirements regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and other smoke constituents levels; &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; &#160; requirements regarding testing, disclosure and use of tobacco product ingredients; &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; &#160; increased restrictions on smoking in public and work places and, in some instances, in private places and outdoors; &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; &#160; elimination of duty free allowances for travelers; and &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; &#160; encouraging litigation against tobacco companies. &#160; 

On January 28, 2016, President Obama signed the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act of 2015, legislation that &#34;requires the packaging of liquid nicotine containers for use in electronic cigarettes to be subject to existing child poisoning prevention packaging standards.&#34; 

&#160; 

&#34;Liquid nicotine container&#34; is described in the bill to: (1) include a package from which nicotine in a solution or other form is accessible through normal and foreseeable use by a consumer and that is used to hold soluble nicotine in any concentration; and (2) exclude a sealed, pre-filled, and disposable container of nicotine in a solution or other form in which such container is inserted directly into an electronic cigarette, electronic nicotine delivery system, or other similar product, if the nicotine in the container is inaccessible through customary or reasonably foreseeable handling or use, including reasonably foreseeable ingestion or other contact by children. 

&#160; 

The definition covers bottles of refillable nicotine-containing e-liquid sold directly to consumers for use in &#34;open-system&#34; electronic vaping devices, but not packaging for zero-nicotine e-liquid, according to a report by The National Law Review. 

&#160; 

Special packaging requirements also would not apply to &#34;closed-system&#34; e-cigarettes (cigalikes) where the e-liquid is not intended to come into contact with or be handled by the consumer, said the report. 

&#160; 

The new bill, which would take effect 180 days after it was signed into law, does not limit or preempt the U.S. Food &#38; Drug Administration's (FDA) authority to regulate e-cigarettes, and the FDA would still be empowered to impose its own packaging requirements, the report said. 

&#160; 

If electronic cigarettes are subject to one or more significant regulatory initiates enacted under the FCTC, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
