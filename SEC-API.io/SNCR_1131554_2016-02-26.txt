Our various platforms described above are combined together to form our Integrated Life&#8482; Platform. All our platforms are designed to be: &#160; 

&#160; 

Carrier Grade: We designed our platforms to handle high-volume transactions from carriers (such as the launch of the new iPhone 6) rapidly and efficiently, with very little down-time. Our platforms are also capable of simultaneously handling millions of device content related transactions on a daily basis to ensure that personal content on all subscriber devices stays fresh and synchronized with the Cloud. 

&#160; 

Highly Automated : We designed our platforms to eliminate manual processes and to automate otherwise labor-intensive tasks, with the goal of improving operating efficiencies and order accuracy, and reducing costs. By tracking every order and identifying those that are not provisioned properly, our platforms are designed to substantially reduce the need for manual intervention and reduce unnecessary customer service center calls. The technology of our platforms automatically guides a customer's request for service through the entire series of required steps. 

&#160; 

Predictable and Reliable: We are committed to providing high-quality, dependable services to our customers. To ensure reliability, system uptime and other service offerings, our transaction management is guaranteed through SLAs. Our platforms offer a complete customer management solution, including exception handling, which we believe is one of the main factors that differentiates us from our competitors. In performing exception handling, our platforms recognize and isolate transaction orders that are not configured to specifications, process them in a timely manner and communicate these orders back to our customers, thereby improving efficiency and reducing backlog. If manual intervention is required, our exception handling services are performed internally as well as outsourced to centers located in the United States and Canada and, where applicable, to other cost-effective geographies. Additionally, our database is designed to preserve data integrity while ensuring fast, efficient, transaction-oriented data retrieval methods. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Seamless: Our platforms integrate information across our customers' entire operation, including subscriber information, order information, delivery status, installation scheduling and content stored on the device to allow for the seamless activation and content transfer during the device purchase flow. Through our platforms, the device is automatically activated and consumer's content is available for use via the Cloud, ensuring continuity of service and reducing subscriber churn propensity. CSPs and multi-channel retailers can bundle additional applications during retail phone purchases, and also provide live updates to support new features and new devices. We have built our platforms using an open design with fully-documented software interfaces, commonly referred to as application programming interfaces, or APIs. Our APIs enable our customers, strategic partners and other third parties to integrate our platforms with other software applications and to build best-in-class cloud-based applications incorporating third-party or customer-designed capabilities. Through our open design and alliance program, we believe we provide our customers with superior solutions that combine our technology with best-of-breed applications with the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of commercial, packaged interfaces. 

&#160; 

Scalable: Our platforms are designed to process expanding transaction volumes reliably and cost effectively. While our transaction volume has increased rapidly and substantially since our inception, we anticipate substantial future growth in transaction volumes, and we believe our platforms are capable of scaling their output commensurately, requiring principally routine computer hardware and software updates. Our synchronization and activation platforms routinely support our customers' transactions at the highest level of demands when needed with our current production deployments. We continue to see the number of transactions for connected devices, such as smartphones, MIDs, laptops, tablets and wirelessly enabled consumer electronics such as cameras, tablets, e-readers, personal navigation devices, GPS enabled devices, and other connected consumer electronics, to be one of the fastest growing transaction types across all our platforms, products and services. Our Synchronoss Personal Cloud platform is deployed across more than 65 million devices, managing 10 billion entities in the Cloud and performing more than 7 million synchronizations per day. 

&#160; 

Value-add Reporting Tools: Our platforms' attributes are tightly integrated into the critical workflows of our customers and have analytical reporting capabilities to provide near real-time information for every step of the relevant transaction processes. In addition to improving end-user customer satisfaction, these capabilities are designed to provide our customers with value-added insights into historical and current transaction trends. We also offer mobile reporting capabilities for users to receive critical data about their transactions on connected devices. 

&#160; 

Build Consumer Loyalty and Create New Revenue Streams: Our synchronization services help drive consumers to CSPs, OEMs or multi-channel retailers by presenting them with a branded application and fully-integrated Web portal that provides convenience, security, and continuity for end user customers, which we believe helps our customers by further building the brand loyalty of their subscribers. We believe our Synchronoss Personal Cloud solution helps reduce subscriber churn by making it easy for subscribers to migrate smartphone content from an old device to a new device. Our Synchronoss Personal Cloud solution enables our carrier customers to sell premium value-add cloud storage solutions as well as cloud enabling premium partner opportunities. We are designing solutions that are capable of allowing carriers, OEMs and retail distributors to promote and fulfill new services through mobile channels to better monetize their cloud subscriber base. 

&#160; 

Efficient: Our platforms' capabilities provide what we believe to be a more cost-effective, efficient and productive approach to enabling new activations across services and channels. Our solutions allow our customers to reduce overhead costs associated with building and operating their own customer transaction management infrastructure. With automated activation and integrated fall out support, our e-commerce platforms centralize customer service expectations, which we believe dramatically reduces our customers&#8217; subscriber acquisition/retention costs in addition to operating expenses for training and staffing costs. We also provide our customers with the information and tools intended to more efficiently manage marketing and operational aspects of their business, as well as business intelligence required to do targeted up-selling of their products and services. 

&#160; 

Quick Concept to Market Delivery: The automation and ease of integration of our on-demand platform allows our customers to accelerate the deployment of their services and new service offerings by shortening the time between a subscribers&#8217; order and the provisioning of service or activation and enabling of a connected device(s). 

&#160;

Our platforms and solutions are built in a modular fashion, which make them conducive to be extended dynamically and enable our customers to offer solutions that are relevant to current market situations, with the goal of providing them with the competitive edge required for them to be successful. The platforms are also designed to be highly customizable to each carrier&#8217;s specific back-office systems as well as branding requirements. 

&#160; 

Secure: By leveraging our identity and access management capabilities consumers can self-register their identity, be verified and credentialed and manage their profile in order to have the best customer experience possible. This solution also supports identity proofing and scoring in order to conduct fraud and cyber security detection and prevention and multifactor authentication. 

&#160; 

Ease of Use: By leveraging our persona management capability in conjunction with our identity management functions the platform allows users to establish and manage personalized experiences across a variety of personas they may choose to build. This creates convenient navigation, predictable actions and frictionless transactions. 

&#160; 

Designed to integrate with back-office systems, our platforms allow work to flow electronically across our customers&#8217; operations while providing ready access to performance and resource usage information in providing activation and subscriber management. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Demand Drivers for Our Business 

&#160; 

Our products and services are capable of managing a wide variety of transactions across multiple customer delivery channels and services, which we believe enables us to benefit from increased growth, complexity and technological change in the communications technology industry. As the communications technology industry continues to evolve, new access networks, connected devices and applications with multiple services and modes are emerging. More significantly, the accumulation of multiple connected devices per subscriber is creating new opportunities for network and cloud-driven service continuity. This proliferation of services and advancement of technologies is accelerating subscriber revenue growth, significantly expanding the types and volume of rich content accessed and stored by consumers, and increasing the number of transactions between our customers and their subscribers. In addition to this dynamic, we believe our core electronic transaction management business is further being driven by the following factors: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

A proliferation of connected devices led by 

o 

new and richer operating systems, 

o 

increasing connected devices adoption, 

o 

broadband networks experiencing critical mass and 

o 

enhanced cloud computing enabling access to rich content 

&#183; 

New and evolving business models by North American carriers encouraging more frequent device upgrades by subscribers 

&#183; 

New emerging connected devices are giving consumers multiple smart devices and create a more compelling need for cloud sharing and identity management 

&#183; 

Wireless ecosystem continues to experience a paradigm shift in its buying patterns 

&#183; 

Continued growth of the online channel for the communications marketplace 

&#183; 

Expansion of communication service bundles to be utilized across multiple devices 

&#183; 

Pressure on operators to improve efficiency while delivering a superior subscriber experience 

&#183; 

Growth of the on-demand delivery model 

&#183; 

Mobile Network Operators&#8217; shift in focus from new subscriber additions to new connections added, as well as an increasing concentration adding new non-traditional devices to family share plans 

&#183; 

Mobile applications and cloud-enabled services combined with innovative devices and the Internet of Things offer new opportunities to connect, transact business and consume an array of content and information 

&#183; 

Increased need for tighter security, additional ways to secure customer information and the ability to access information 

&#160; 

Increased Embedded Connectivity . We continue to see embedded connectivity technology within a vast array of common electronic devices. According to Machina Research, total connected devices are projected to grow from 15 billion in 2015 to 27.1 billion by 2020 and according to the GSM Association (GSMA), the number of unique mobile subscribers is expected to increase from 4.7 billion in 2015 to 5.6 billion by 2020. 

&#160; 

We see the following drivers behind this development: 

&#160; 

New and Richer Operating Systems. Device operating systems like iOS for the iPhone/iTouch/iPad portfolio, Android produced by Google, Windows&#174; mobile devices, and BlackBerry OS for the BlackBerry portfolio have accelerated the adoption and usage of smartphones. Other growing markets are in smart wearables and connected vehicles. Apple has watchOS and CarPlay, while Google has Android Wear and Android Auto, respectively. According to IDC, the smartwatch market has a CAGR of 42.8% from 2015-2019. For connected vehicles, BI Intelligence forecasts that 75% of all cars will ship with connectivity capabilities by 2020. 

&#160; 

Increasing Mobile Adoption Worldwide: According to estimates by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), in 2015 there were 3.4 billion active mobile-broadband subscriptions in the world or 47.2 percent of the global population, and fixed broadband penetration is expected to reach approximately 10.8 percent globally. The GSMA has stated that half of the world&#8217;s population in 2015 had a mobile subscription, up from just one in five in 2002 and predicts an additional one billion subscribers by 2020, increasing the global penetration rate to approximately 60%. 

&#160; 

Smartphone Sales and Diversification: IDC estimates that approximately 1.5 billion smartphones were shipped worldwide in 2015, approximately an 11.9% year-over-year growth rate. Slower annual growth continues throughout the forecast period with unit shipments of 2.0 billion by 2019 resulting in a five-year CAGR of 8.5%. Despite a number of mature markets nearing smartphone saturation, the demand for low-cost computing in emerging markets continues to drive the smartphone market forward. These smartphones, tablets and other connected devices have a need to store, synchronize and share content across multiple devices which drive the need for personal cloud solutions in the marketplace. 

&#160; 

Wireless Broadband Networks Experiencing Critical Mass: The establishment of multiple broadband mobile networks (e.g., Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, High-Speed Packet Access, Evolution-Data Optimized, WiMax, and LTE among others) has provided broader bandwidth to CSPs, while decreasing the cost per bit transmitted, thus enabling the proliferation of mobile devices and equipment with embedded connectivity. As more of these devices enter the market, and many of them having lower average revenue per user (ARPU) than traditional wireless services, they will necessitate an efficient and seamless activation/provisioning system with a best-in-class customer experience to differentiate them. 

&#160;

&#160; 

4G-LTE Networks: The continued emergence and advancement of 4G-LTE networks is expected to improve the connected devices customer experience with higher data speeds and reduced latency. In addition, devices such as mobile routers and tablets can generate mobile hotspots. With fixed mobile broadband, mobile carriers and MSOs can also offer bundled services. These networks are focused on enhancing Machine to Machine (M2M) communications. 

&#160; 

Wireless Ecosystem Continues to Experience a Paradigm Shift in its Buying Patterns: Consumers have traditionally been accustomed to purchasing their devices and service plans directly from CSPs. That is, if they wanted a particular wireless service, they first had to decide which operator they wanted, and then only after they made this decision, could they select a phone. We are seeing considerable forces altering this typical buy flow and in doing so generating considerable innovation and a change in the ecosystem. Managing the activation, provisioning, connectivity and synchronization of these devices and handling the connectivity with the different service providers is something that is not core to OEMs or multi-channel retailers. As this dynamic evolves, we expect that there will be an increasing need for automated connect-sync-activate services as well as other transaction areas such as device integration, certification, credit card billing, inventory management, and trouble ticketing. 

&#160; 

Continued Growth of the Online Channel for the Communications Space: Cloud-based commerce provides our customers with the opportunity to cost-effectively gain new subscribers, provide service and interact more effectively. Specifically, we estimate that the cost per gross add (CPGA) for a customer obtained via e-commerce can be up to 50% less than those obtained via traditional means. With the dramatic increase in Internet usage and desire to directly connect with end users over the course of the customer lifecycle, service providers are increasingly focusing on e-commerce as a channel for customer acquisition and delivery of ongoing services. According to Forrester, e-commerce sales were approximately 10% of all sales in the U.S in 2015 and they estimate that e-Commerce will experience a strong compound annual growth rate of 10% over the next five years, translating to $480 billion in online sales by 2019. 

&#160; 

Expansion of Communication Service Bundles: &#8220;Quad Play&#8221; services are bundled offerings that include fixed voice, broadband, television and mobile voice. According to Ovum, quad-play bundles are predicted to be the fastest-growing bundle type, rising to almost 46 million subscriptions by 2019, a 31 percent compound annual growth rate. With subscribers expecting CSPs to offer all services under one contract, communications companies continue the development of bundled style offerings of their available services. In this environment, more CSPs are utilizing an array of communication delivery technologies to become all-in-one providers of communication services. For example, MSOs are increasingly creating true quad-play's (i.e., voice, video, high speed data and wireless) with the creation, acquisition and/or development of their own wireless networks. As wireless technology proliferates further into the consumer device market, we believe we will see an emergence of service bundling that surpasses the traditional perception of a quad-play, where the wireless component will encompass an added array of wireless enabled devices. As quad-play offerings gain more traction and service bundles begin encompassing emerging devices and technologies, we believe that the level of complexity in seamlessly delivering these services will increase significantly and that CSPs will need transaction management systems that can effectively handle those delivery challenges. 

&#160; 

Faster Upgrade Cycles for Smartphones: With the operators and OEMs offering smartphone upgrade and trade-in programs, customers have the option to upgrade earlier than the typical two-year cycle. According to GSMA, in 2015 the mobile industry generated $3.1 trillion to the world economy in economic value added terms, a contribution of 4.2% of the world&#8217;s total GDP. By 2020, GSMA predicts this amount will be $3.7 trillion. Two key areas of our business are involved in this process. Subscribers placing their orders on-line with our operator customers, transparently use our Activation platform for these upgrades resulting in growth of transactions processed by us. Secondly, subscribers who upgrade need to back up their data from old phones and restore that data on their new devices, which increases the need for our cloud solutions. With the storage capacity of Smartphones increasing each year, the requirements for storage to back up the data on these devices will likely also increase. Adding to this is the growing size of file types. Higher megapixel counts and resolutions have contributed to the expanding file sizes of photos and videos. According to 451 Research, photos and videos occupied the most storage capacity for the average smartphone user. The biggest drivers impacting mobile content creation were more on-device storage capacity and cloud storage capacity. 

&#160; 

Pressure on Customers to Improve Efficiency while Delivering a Superior Subscriber Experience: Increased competition, recessionary markets, and the cost of network capacity have placed significant pressure on our customers to reduce costs and increase revenues. At the same time, due to deregulation, the emergence of new network technologies and the proliferation of services, the complexity of back-office operations has increased significantly. Customers with multiple back-end systems are looking for ways to help their systems interoperate for a better customer experience. In addition, customers are moving to automated provisioning systems that enable them to more easily purchase, upgrade or add new features, application and content. As a result, we believe customers are looking for ways to offer new communications services more rapidly and efficiently to existing and new customers. Increased competition and demand for superior subscriber experience have placed significant pressure on our customers to improve customer-centric processes. CSPs are increasingly turning to transaction-based, cost effective, scalable and automated third-party solutions that can offer guaranteed levels of service delivery. 

&#160; 

Growth in On-Demand Delivery Model: Our on-demand business model enables delivery of our proprietary solutions over the Internet as a service. As such, customers do not have to make large and potentially risky upfront investments in software, additional hardware, extensive implementation services and additional IT staff. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Services, Networks and Device Complexity: The wireless industry is changing. CSPs are moving away from unlimited data plans, networks are becoming multi-layered with varying levels of complexity and devices are becoming more feature rich and capable, driving bandwidth consuming traffic over the networks. We believe all of these require CSPs and OEMs to be more creative in the services they offer, requiring an increased need for automation in device integration, certification and activation. This will require complex policy-based device and network management. Certain functions of our platforms can help address these needs. 

&#160; 

Security &#8211; Fraud and Cyber Threat Detection and Prevention : There is a continuing increase in threats against consumers and companies from a variety of sources. The main point of attack is the credentials of the users that access applications and commercial sites. It has become critically important to assure complete confidence in the identification and authentication of users. 

&#160; 

Consumer identity verification and authentication: Consumers today are burdened with having too many username and passwords to manage across their personal and professional lives. At the same time they don&#8217;t want to be burdened with intrusive authentication methods. They desire simple safe and security identity and authentication methods. 

&#160; 

Mobile productivity and security: The enterprise mobile world, including the proliferation of BYOD, creates the need for an additional level of security, given the nature of the platform and operating systems. Additionally, according to the Yankee Group, an enterprise user is working on their mobile device 50% to 60% of the time, this establishes the need for increasing productivity for the user based at the point of the experience. 

&#160; 

&#160; Our Growth Strategy 

&#160; 

Our growth strategy is to establish our platforms as the de-facto industry standard for CSPs, MSOs, OEMs, enterprise customers and multi-channel retailers while investing in logical extensions of our product and services portfolio. We plan to continue to focus our technology and development efforts around improving functionality, helping customers drive higher ARPU and subscriber retention, embracing alternative channels and allowing more capabilities for ordering bundled applications and content offerings across these same complex and advanced networks. 

&#160; 

Key elements of this strategy are: 

&#160; 

Expand our Product Portfolio to Communication Service Providers. Given the explosive growth of connected mobile broadband devices and the increasing need to backup, restore and share content across those devices, our objective is to play a vital role in monetizing those devices with our connect-sync-activate strategy. Methods of monetization may include licenses per device, maintenance fees, professional service fees, active user fees as well as data storage fees. Our acquisition s of Newbay Software, Limited, VoxMobili Limited and the assets of F-Secure have enabled us to expand the functionality of our Synchronoss Personal Cloud platform and improve the scalability of these existing platforms to offer a more robust solution to our customers. We believe we will be able to integrate this solution with other potential revenue generating offers from service providers and other customers. 

&#160; 

Expanding into Enterprise Cloud. Following up on the success of our Synchronoss Personal Cloud&#8482; offering, we have also leveraged that platform to support the increased need for cloud-based document sharing and collaboration needs in the Small and Medium Business (SMB) area. SMB&#8217;s rely heavily on CSP&#8217;s for support of new trends, such as Bring Your Own Technology (BYOT/BYOD). Our Synchronoss WorkSpace&#8482; offering combined with our Orbit platform acquired through our Goldman Sachs venture, are ideally suited for such solutions, as they are designed to assure an IT manager that employees can enhance productivity by using their own mobile devices, while complying with their internal security and other IT policies. 

&#160; 

Expand Into New Geographic Markets. Although the majority of our revenue has traditionally been generated in North America, we continue to expand globally. Today, we have several instances of our platforms deployed in Europe and new customer engagements with a variety of carriers, such as Virgin Mobil and British Telecom to support their customers. In addition, our various acquisitions, including those of assets of F-Secure in 2015 and VoxMobili and Clarity in 2014 have helped expand our operations and customer engagements in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. We believe that the growth of connected devices will further drive opportunities to penetrate new geographic markets within the coming years. The Asia/Pacific and Latin America regions are of particular interest, as these markets experience similar trends to those that have driven growth in North America and Europe. 

&#160; 

Expand through Strategic Partnerships or Acquisitions. We are in the process of integrating our various acquisitions and we will continue to assimilate the synergies and efficiencies that these acquisitions may afford us. In 2015, we entered into ventures with Verizon on the Identity Access market and Goldman Sachs on BYOD with the goal of establishing a foothold and launch our entry in the enterprise market. As we explore new opportunities, we continue to look for strategic partnership or acquisition candidates that may enable us to more rapidly enter new markets or enhance our offerings. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Broaden Customer Base and Expand Offering to Existing Customers . As our existing customers continue to expand into new distribution channels, such as the rapidly growing e-commerce channels, they will likely need to support new types of transactions that are managed by our platforms. In addition, we believe our customers will require new transaction management solutions as they expand their subscriber customer base, which will provide us with opportunities to drive increasing amounts of volume over our platforms. Many customers purchase multiple services from us, and we believe we are well positioned to cross-sell additional services to customers who do not currently purchase our full services portfolio. The expansion of our relationship with AT&#38;T, Verizon and other customers highlight further penetration of existing customers as well as the development of a major growth initiative in consumer digital convergence. 

&#160; 

Expand into the Enterprise &#160; Market. Launch &#160; directly with Enterprise customers through our direct sales efforts as well as key strategic partnerships. These efforts are designed to allow us to capture direct customer relationships in the enterprise space via our partners&#8217; direct subject matter expertise in industry verticals and/or their broad reach as clear market leaders that drive a significant share of the market opportunities. 

&#160; 

Expand into Emerging Devices and Internet of Things Space . Various forecasts, such as Gartner, GSMA and IDC have cited explosive growth in the non-traditional connected devices space. Such devices include connected cars, connected homes, health and wellness and health care domains. According to Gartner, there will be over 30 billion devices connected by 2020. The increased growth will come from the non-traditional IT market. We plan on expanding both our activation platforms (focused on the new activation needs emerging from such devices on the service provider networks) as well as our cloud platforms (focused on storing data from the varying devices to be stored securely in the Cloud) in an effort to capitalize on the growth emerging from these new opportunities. 

&#160; 

Maintain Technology Leadership . We strive to continue to build upon our technology leadership by continuing to invest in research and development to increase the automation of processes and workflows and develop complementary product modules that leverage our platforms and competitive strengths, thus driving increased interest by making it more economical for customers to use us as a third-party solutions provider. In addition, we believe our close relationships with our Tier 1 customers will continue to provide us with valuable insights into the dynamics that are creating demand for next-generation solutions. 

&#160; 

Leverage and Enforce our Intellectual Property. We have a significant repository of intellectual property assets, and we expect to use this as a differentiator of our products and services in the marketplace. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

We strive to maintain strong and collaborative relationships with our customers, which we believe to be one of our core competencies and critical to our success. We are generally the only provider of the services we offer to our customers. Contracts extend up to 60 months from execution and include minimum transaction or revenue commitments from our customers. All of our significant customers may terminate their contracts for convenience upon written notice and in many cases payment of contractual penalties. Contract penalties received by us were immaterial to our Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. 

&#160; 

Each of AT&#38;T and Verizon accounted for more than 10% of our revenues &#160; for &#160; the years ended 2015, 2014 and 2013. AT&#38;T and Verizon in the aggregate accounted for 75%, 73% and 66% of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The loss of either AT&#38;T or Verizon as a customer would have a material negative impact on our company. We believe that if either AT&#38;T or Verizon terminated their relationship with us, they would encounter substantial costs in replacing Synchronoss' solutions. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

Sales 

&#160; 

We market and sell our services primarily through a direct sales force and through our strategic partners. To date, we have concentrated our sales efforts on a range of CSPs, OEMs, enterprises, government and multi-channel retailers both domestically and internationally. Typically our sales process involves an initial consultative process that allows our customers to better assess the operating and capital expenditure benefits associated with an optimal activation, provisioning, and cloud-based content management architecture. Our sales teams are well trained in our Activation Services, Synchronoss Personal Cloud, Synchronoss Workspace, Secure Mobility, Identity and Access Management and Integrated Life platforms and on the market trends and conditions that our current and potential customers are facing. This enables them to easily identify and qualify opportunities that are appropriate for our platform deployments to benefit these customers. Following each sale, we assign account managers to provide ongoing support and to identify additional sales opportunities. We generate leads from contacts made through trade-shows, seminars, conferences, events, market research, our Web site, customers, strategic partners and our ongoing public relations program. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Marketing 

&#160; 

We focus our marketing efforts on supporting new product initiatives, creating awareness of our services and generating new sales opportunities. We base our product management strategy on analysis of market requirements, customer needs, industry direction, competitive offerings and projected customer cost savings and revenue opportunities. Our team is active in numerous technology and industry forums and regularly gets invited to speak at tradeshows such as the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA), GSMA (Mobile World Congress), Mobile Future Forward Series, Wireless Influencers Forum, Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) and National Cable &#38; Telecommunications Association (NCTA), in which we also demonstrate our solutions. In addition, through our product marketing and marketing communications functions, we also have an active public relations program and maintain relationships with recognized trade media and industry analysts such as ABI Research, International Data Corporation (IDC), Gartner Inc., Forrester Research, Inc., Ovum, Frost &#38; Sullivan and Yankee Group. We also manage and maintain our Web site, blog, social media profiles on LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook, utilize search engine optimization (SEO) and search engine marketing (SEM), publish product related content and educational white papers, videos and conduct seminars and user group meetings. Finally, we also actively sponsor technology-related conferences and demonstrate our solutions at trade-shows targeted at providers of communications services. 

&#160; 

Operations and Technology 

&#160; 

We leverage common proprietary information technology platforms to deliver carrier grade services to our customers across communication and digital convergence market segments. Constructed using a combination of internally developed and licensed technologies, our platforms integrate our order management, gateway, workflow, cloud-based content management, and reporting into a unified system. The platforms are secure foundations on which to build and offer additional services and maximize performance, scalability and reliability. 

&#160; 

Exception Handling Services 

&#160; 

We differentiate our services from both the internal and competitive offerings by handling exceptions through our technology and human touch solutions, a substantial portion of which are provided by third-party vendors. Our business process engineers optimize each workflow; however, there are exceptions and we handle these with the goal of ensuring the highest quality customer experience at the lowest cost. Our exception handling services deal with the customer communication touch points including provisioning orders, inbound calls, automated interactive voice responses (e.g., order status, address changes), Web forums, inbound and outbound email, proactive outbound calls (e.g., out of stock, backorders, exceptions) and self-correct order tools. These services are continuously reviewed for improved workflow and automation. We use third-party vendors in providing exception handling services, each of whom provide services under automatically renewable contracts. We believe our unique exception handling services help reduce the cost of each transaction by driving more automation, over time, into a better and more cost effective way to manage our customers' subscriber experiences. 

&#160; 

Locations 

&#160; 

Our locations are distributed across various time zones in the United States, Asia and Europe to help us serve our customers in a timely manner. We believe these diverse locations afford us access to key talent in all major markets in the U.S. and around the globe. 

&#160; 

Data Center Facilities 

&#160; 

We own and maintain data center facilities in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, Bangalore, India, and Tucson, Arizona. These facilities are currently expected to support our growth objectives. These secure facilities house all customer-facing, production, test and development systems that are the backbone of the services delivered to our customers. The facilities and systems are monitored 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, and are protected via multiple layers of physical and electronic security measures. In addition, a redundant power supply ensures constant, regulated power into the managed data facility and a backup generator system provides power indefinitely to the facility in the event of a utility power failure. All systems in the managed data facility are monitored for availability and performance using industry standard tools. We also host equipment in data center colocation facilities with Terremark Inc., VCHS, Saavis, Rackspace, and several other third parties, which enables us to offer geographically diversified hosting and storage for our Synchronoss Personal Cloud&#8482; solutions. 

&#160; 

Network 

&#160; 

We use AT&#38;T, Verizon, Level 3 and Sprint to provide a managed, fully-redundant network solution at each of our data center facilities to deliver enterprise scale services to customers. Wide Area Network connectivity between our locations is achieved via redundant Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) circuits and Internet access to selected locations via multiple dedicated circuits. A dedicated Metro Ethernet solution is utilized to provide a data center backbone connection between our primary data center facility in Bethlehem and our primary disaster recovery site, should the need arise. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Disaster Recovery Facility 

&#160; 

We operate disaster recovery solutions in our Tucson, Arizona and in our colocation facilities that are used to provide hot sites for real time data backup and disaster recovery purposes. 

&#160; 

Customer Support 

&#160; 

Our Customer Service Center (CSC) acts as an initial point of contact for all customer-related issues and requests. The CSC staff is available 7 days a week via phone, email or pager to facilitate the diagnosis and resolution of application and service-related issues with which they are presented. Issues that require further investigation are immediately escalated to our product and infrastructure support teams on behalf of the customer as part of our continuing effort to provide the greatest speed of problem resolution and highest levels of customer service. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Competition in our markets is intense and includes rapidly-changing technologies and customer requirements, as well as evolving industry standards and frequent product introductions. We compete primarily on the basis of the breadth of our domain expertise, our proprietary exception handling, and the breadth of our Synchronoss Personal Cloud content synchronization and sharing capabilities, as well as on the basis of price, time-to-market, functionality, quality and breadth of product and service offerings. We believe the most important factors making us a strong competitor include: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Breadth and depth of our transaction and content management solutions, including our exception handling technology 

&#183; 

Carrier grade nature and scalability of our solutions 

&#183; 

Quality and performance of our products 

&#183; 

High-quality customer service 

&#183; 

Ability to implement and integrate solutions 

&#183; 

Overall value of our platforms 

&#183; 

References of our customers 

&#160; 

We are aware of other software developers and smaller entrepreneurial companies that are focusing significant resources on developing and marketing products and services that will compete with our platforms. We anticipate continued growth in the communications industry and the entrance of new competitors in the order processing and transaction management solutions market and expect that the market for our products and services will remain intensely competitive. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

We are not currently subject to any federal, state or local government regulation, other than regulations that apply to businesses generally. Many of our customers are subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC. Changes in FCC regulations that affect our existing or potential customers could lead them to spend less on transaction management solutions, which would reduce our revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We also comply with industry required regulations, such as PCI compliance and all of our employees have completed the required compliance education. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

To establish and protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trade secret, patent and trademark rights, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions. Synchronoss&#174;, the Synchronoss&#174; logo, ConvergenceNow&#174; and ActivationNow&#174; are registered trademarks of Synchronoss. In addition, we regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our research and development, and have obtained and filed applications for over 120 patents in the United States and other countries. No single patent is solely responsible for protecting our products or services. In addition to legal protections, we rely on the technical and creative skills of our employees, deep technical integration with our customer&#8217;s networks and back-office systems, frequent product enhancements and improved product quality to maintain a technology-leadership position. We maintain a program to protect our investment in technology by attempting to ensure respect for our intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and confidentiality agreements with our alliance partners and customers, and we control access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

We believe that our recent growth and success is attributable in large part to our employees and an experienced management team, many members of which have years of industry experience in building, implementing, marketing and selling transaction management solutions critical to business operations. We intend to continue training our employees as well as developing and promoting our culture and believe such efforts provide us with a sustainable competitive advantage. We offer a work environment that enables employees to make meaningful contributions, as well as incentive programs to continue to motivate and reward our employees. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 1,895 full &#8209;time employees. None of our employees are covered by any collective bargaining agreements.
