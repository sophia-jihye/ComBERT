Business and Operating Strategy 

&#160; 

Our Strategic Plan focuses on: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

owning high-quality, differentiated office buildings in the BBDs of our core markets; 

&#8226; 

improving the operating results of our existing properties through concentrated leasing, asset management, cost control and customer service efforts; 

&#8226; 

developing and acquiring office buildings in BBDs that improve the overall quality of our portfolio and generate attractive returns over the long term for our stockholders; 

&#8226; 

disposing of properties no longer considered to be core assets primarily due to location, age, quality and overall strategic fit; and 

&#8226; 

maintaining a conservative and flexible balance sheet with ample liquidity to meet our funding needs and growth prospects. 

Local Market Leadership . We focus our real estate activities in markets where we have extensive local knowledge and own a significant amount of assets. In each of our core markets, we maintain offices that are led by division officers with significant real estate experience. Our real estate professionals are seasoned and cycle-tested. Our senior leadership team has significant experience and maintains important relationships with market participants in each of our core markets. 

&#160; 

&#32;4 

Customer Service-Oriented Organization . We provide a complete line of real estate services to our customers. We believe that our in-house leasing and asset management, development, acquisition and construction management services generally allow us to respond to the many demands of our existing and potential customer base. We provide our customers with cost-effective services such as build-to-suit construction and space modification, including tenant improvements and expansions. In addition, the breadth of our capabilities and resources provides us with market information not generally available. We believe that operating efficiencies achieved through our fully integrated organization and the strength of our balance sheet also provide a competitive advantage in retaining existing customers and attracting new customers as well as setting our lease rates and pricing other services. In addition, our relationships with our customers may lead to development projects when these customers seek new space. 

&#160; 

Geographic Diversification . Our core portfolio consists primarily of office properties in Raleigh, Atlanta, Tampa, Nashville, Memphis, Pittsburgh, Richmond and Orlando, office and industrial properties in Greensboro and retail and office properties in Kansas City. We do not believe that our operations are significantly dependent upon any particular geographic market. 

&#160; 

Conservative and Flexible Balance Sheet . We are committed to maintaining a conservative and flexible balance sheet that allows us to capitalize on favorable development and acquisition opportunities as they arise. Our balance sheet also allows us to proactively assure our existing and prospective customers that we are able to fund tenant improvements and maintain our properties in good condition. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Our properties compete for customers with similar properties located in our markets primarily on the basis of location, rent, services provided and the design, quality and condition of the facilities. We also compete with other domestic and foreign REITs, financial institutions, pension funds, partnerships, individual investors and others when attempting to acquire, develop and operate properties. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015 , we had 447 &#32;full-time employees.
