Introduction

Our Company

We are the largest recreational boat and yacht dealer in the United States. Through 56 retail locations in Alabama, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and Texas, we sell new and used recreational boats, including pleasure and fishing boats, with a focus on premium brands in each segment. We also sell related marine products, including engines, trailers, parts, and accessories. In addition, we provide repair, maintenance, and slip and storage services; we arrange related boat financing, insurance, and extended service contracts; we offer boat and yacht brokerage sales; and we operate a yacht charter business.

We are the nation&#8217;s largest retailer of Sea Ray and Boston Whaler recreational boats and yachts which are manufactured by Brunswick Corporation (&#8220;Brunswick&#8221;). Sales of new Brunswick boats accounted for approximately 40% of our revenue in fiscal 2016. Sales of new Sea Ray and Boston Whaler boats, both divisions of Brunswick, accounted for approximately 24% and 14%, respectively, of our revenue in fiscal 2016. Brunswick is a world leading manufacturer of marine products and marine engines. We believe our sales represented approximately 10% of all Brunswick marine sales, including approximately 53% of its Sea Ray boat sales, during our fiscal 2016. We have agreements with Brunswick covering Sea Ray products and Boston Whaler products and are the exclusive dealer of Sea Ray and Boston Whaler boats in almost all of our geographic markets. We also are the exclusive dealer for Meridian Yachts, and Harris aluminum boats, both divisions of Brunswick, in most of our geographic markets. We also are the exclusive dealer for Italy-based Azimut-Benetti Group, or Azimut, for Azimut mega-yachts, yachts, and other recreational boats for the United States. Sales of new Azimut boats accounted for approximately 11% of our revenue in fiscal 2016. Additionally, we are the exclusive dealer for certain other premium brands that serve certain industry segments in our markets as shown by the table on page four.

We commenced operations as a result of the March 1, 1998 acquisition of five previously independent recreational boat dealers. Since that time, we have acquired 26 additional previously independent recreational boat dealers, two boat brokerage operations, and two full-service yacht repair operations. We attempt to capitalize on the experience and success of the acquired companies in order to establish a high national standard of customer service and responsiveness in the highly fragmented retail boating industry. As a result of our emphasis on premium brand boats, our average selling price for a new boat in fiscal 2016 was approximately $198,000, an increase of approximately 16% from approximately $171,000 in fiscal 2015, compared with the industry average selling price for calendar 2015 of approximately $42,000 based on industry data published by the National Marine Manufacturers Association. Our stores that operated at least 12 months averaged approximately $18.5 million in annual sales in fiscal 2016. We consider a store to be one or more retail locations that are adjacent or operate as one entity. Our same-store sales increased 6% in fiscal 2014 and increased 22% in fiscal 2015 and 2016.

We attempt to adopt the best practices developed by us and our acquired companies as appropriate to enhance our ability to attract and retain more customers, foster an overall enjoyable boating experience, and offer boat manufacturers stable and professional retail distribution and a broad geographic presence. We believe that our full range of services, hassle free approach, prime retail locations, premium product offerings, extensive facilities, strong management and team members, and emphasis on customer service and satisfaction before and after a boat sale are competitive advantages that enable us to be more responsive to the needs of existing and prospective customers. We strive to provide superior customer service and support before, during, and after the sale.

The U.S. recreational boating industry generated approximately $35.9 billion in retail sales in calendar 2015, which is down from the peak of $39.5 billion in calendar 2006. Total powerboats sold in calendar 2015 were approximately 183,100 units as compared to 298,100 units sold in calendar 2006. The retail sales include sales of new and used boats; marine products, such as engines, trailers, equipment, and accessories; and related expenditures, such as fuel, insurance, docking, storage, and repairs. Retail sales of new and used boats, engines, trailers, and accessories accounted for approximately $26.7 billion of these sales in 2015 based on industry data from the National Marine Manufacturers Association. The highly fragmented retail boating industry generally consists of small dealers that operate in a single market and provide varying degrees of merchandising, professional management, and customer service. We believe that many small dealers are finding it increasingly difficult to make the managerial and capital commitments necessary to achieve higher customer service levels and upgrade systems and facilities as required by boat manufacturers and often demanded by customers. We also believe that many dealers lack an exit strategy for their owners. We believe these factors contribute to our opportunity to gain a competitive advantage in current and future markets, through market expansions and acquisitions.

Strategy 

Our goal is to enhance our position as the nation&#8217;s leading recreational boat dealer. Key elements of our operating and growth strategy include the following:

&#160;

&#8226; 

emphasizing customer satisfaction and loyalty by creating an overall enjoyable boating experience, beginning with a hassle-free purchase process, customer training, superior customer service, company-led events called Getaways! &#174;, and premier facilities; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

achieving efficiencies and synergies among our operations to enhance internal growth and profitability; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

promoting national brand name recognition and the MarineMax connection; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

offering additional marine products and services, including those with higher profit margins; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

expanding our Internet marketing; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

pursuing strategic acquisitions to capitalize upon the consolidation opportunities in the highly fragmented recreational boat dealer industry by acquiring additional dealers and related operations and improving their performance and profitability through the implementation of our operating strategies; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

opening additional retail facilities in our existing and new territories; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

emphasizing employee recruitment and retention through training, motivation, and development; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

emphasizing the best practices developed by us and our acquired dealers as appropriate throughout our dealerships; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

operating with a decentralized approach to the operational management of our dealerships; and 

&#160;

&#8226; 

utilizing common platform information technology throughout operations, which facilitates the interchange of information sharing and enhances cross-selling opportunities throughout our company. 

Development of the Company; Expansion of Business

MarineMax was founded in January 1998. MarineMax itself, however, conducted no operations until the acquisition of five independent recreational boat dealers on March 1, 1998, and we completed our initial public offering in June 1998. Since the initial acquisitions in March 1998, we have acquired 26 additional recreational boat dealers, two boat brokerage operations, and two full-service yacht repair operations. Acquired dealers operate under the MarineMax name.

We continually attempt to enhance our business by providing a full range of services, offering extensive and high-quality product lines, maintaining prime retail locations, pursuing the MarineMax One Price hassle-free sales approach, and emphasizing a high level of customer service and satisfaction.

We also from time to time evaluate opportunities to expand our operations by acquiring recreational boat dealers to expand our geographic scope, expanding our product lines, opening new retail locations within or outside our existing territories, and offering new products and services for our customers.

Acquisitions of additional recreational boat dealers represent an important strategy in our goal to enhance our position as the nation&#8217;s largest retailer of recreational boats. The following table sets forth information regarding the businesses that we have acquired and their geographic regions.

Initially a joint venture; full ownership acquired in February 2016.

Apart from acquisitions, we have opened 33 new retail locations in existing territories, excluding those opened on a temporary basis for a specific pu rpose. We also monitor the performance of our retail locations and close retail locations that do not meet our expectations. Based on these factors and previous depressed economic conditions, we have closed 63 retail locations since March 1998, excluding those opened on a temporary basis for a specific purpose, including 26 in fiscal 2009 and a total of six during the last three fiscal years. 

As a part of our acquisition strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with various recreational boat dealers regarding their potential acquisition by us. In connection with these discussions, we and each potential acquisition candidate exchange confidential operational and financial information; conduct due diligence inquiries; and consider the structure, terms, and conditions of the potential acquisition. In certain cases, the prospective acquisition candidate agrees not to discuss a potential acquisition with any other party for a specific period of time, grants us an option to purchase the prospective dealer for a designated price during a specific time period, and agrees to take other actions designed to enhance the possibility of the acquisition, such as preparing audited financial information and converting its accounting system to the system specified by us. Potential acquisition discussions frequently take place over a long period of time and involve difficult business integration and other issues, including in some cases, management succession and related matters. As a result of these and other factors, a number of potential acquisitions that from time to time appear likely to occur do not result in binding legal agreements and are not consummated.

In addition to acquiring recreational boat dealers and opening new retail locations, we also add new product lines to expand our operations. The following table sets forth certain of our current product lines that we have added to our existing locations during the years indicated.

We add brands with the intent to either offer a migration path for our existing customer base or fill a gap in our product offerings. As a result, we believe that new brands we offer are generally complementary and do not cannibalize the business generated from our other prominent brands. We also discontinue offering product lines from time to time, primarily based upon customer preferences . 

During the nine-year period from the commencement of our operations through our fiscal year ended September 30, 2007, our revenue increased from $291.0 million to more than $1.2 billion. Our revenue and net income increased in seven of those nine years over the prior year revenue and net income. This period was marked by an increase in retail locations from 41 on September 30, 1998 to 88 on September 30, 2007, resulting from acquisitions and opening new stores in existing territories.

Our growth was interrupted during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007, primarily as a result of factors related to the deteriorating housing market and general economic conditions. The substantially deteriorating economic and financial conditions, reduced consumer confidence and spending, increased fuel prices, reduction of credit availability, financial market declines, and asset value deterioration all contributed to substantially lower financial performance in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2008 and 2009, including significant net losses, followed by pre-tax losses in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2010 and 2011. We returned to profitability in fiscal 2012. 

As industry conditions continue to recover, we strive to maintain our core values of high customer service and satisfaction and plan to continue to pursue strategies that we believe will enable us to achieve long-term success and growth. As noted in the earlier table, we have capitalized on a number of brand expansion opportunities in the markets in which we operate. We believe our expanded product offerings have strengthened our same-store sales growth. We plan to further expand our business through both acquisitions in new territories and new store openings in existing territories. In addition, we plan to continue to expand our other traditional and newly offered services, including conducting used boat sales at our retail locations, at offsite locations, and on the Internet; selling related marine products, including engines, trailers, parts, and accessories at our retail locations and at various offsite locations, and through our print catalog; providing maintenance, repair, and storage services at most of our retail locations; offering our customers the ability to finance new or used boats; offering extended service contracts; arranging insurance coverage, including boat property, credit-life, accident, disability, and casualty coverage; offering boat and yacht brokerage sales at most of our retail locations and at various offsite locations; and conducting our yacht charter business. Our expansion plans will depend, in large part, upon economic and industry conditions.

We maintain our executive offices at 2600 McCormick Drive, Suite 200, Clearwater, Florida 33759, and our telephone number is (727) 531-1700. We were incorporated in the state of Delaware in January 1998 and then re-incorporated in Florida in March 2015. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to &#8220;MarineMax&#8221; mean MarineMax, Inc. prior to its acquisition of five previously independent recreational boat dealers in March 1998 (including their related real estate companies) and all references to the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;our company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; mean, as a combined company, MarineMax, Inc. and the 26 recreational boat dealers, two boat brokerage operations, and two full-service yacht repair operations acquired to date (the &#8220;acquired dealers,&#8221; and together with the brokerage and repair operations, &#8220;operating subsidiaries,&#8221; or the &#8220;acquired companies&#8221;).

Our website is located at www.MarineMax.com . Through our website, we make available free of charge our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K, our proxy statements, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These reports are available as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file those reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;). We also post on our website the charters of our Audit, Compensation, and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committees; our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and Code of Ethics for the CEO and Senior Financial Officers, and any amendments or waivers thereto; and any other corporate governance materials contemplated by the SEC or the regulations of the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE. These documents are also available in print to any stockholder requesting a copy from our corporate secretary at our principal executive offices. Because our common stock is listed on the NYSE, our Chief Executive Officer is required to make an annual certification to the NYSE stating that he is not aware of any violation by us of the corporate governance listing standards of the NYSE. Our Chief Executive Officer made his annual certification to that effect to the NYSE on February 29, 2016.

Business

General

We are the largest recreational boat dealer in the United States. Through 56 retail locations in Alabama, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and Texas, we sell new and used recreational boats, including pleasure boats (such as sport boats, sport cruisers, sport yachts, and yachts), and fishing boats, with a focus on premium brands in each segment.

We are the nation&#8217;s largest retailer of Sea Ray and Boston Whaler recreational boats and yachts, which are manufactured by Brunswick Corporation, or Brunswick. Sales of new Brunswick boats accounted for approximately 40% of our revenue in fiscal 2016. Sales of new Sea Ray and Boston Whaler boats, both divisions of Brunswick, accounted for approximately 24% and 14%, respectively, of our revenue in f iscal 2016. Brunswick is a world leading manufacturer of marine products and marine engines. We believe our sales represented approximately 10% of all Brunswick marine sales, including approximately 53% of its Sea Ray boat sales, during our fiscal 2016. We have agreements with Brunswick covering Sea Ray products and Boston Whaler products and are the exclusive dealer of Sea Ray and Boston Whaler boats in almost all of our geographic markets. We also are the exclusive dealer for Meridian Yachts and Harris aluminum boats, both divisions of Brunswick, in most of our geographic markets. We also are the exclusive dealer for Italy-based Azimut-Benetti Group, or Azimut, for Azimut mega-yachts, yachts, and other recreational boats for the United States. Sales of new Azimut boats accounted for approximately 11% of our revenue in fiscal 2016. Additionally, we are the exclusive dealer for certain other premium brands that serve specific industry segments in our markets as shown by the table on page four. 

We also are involved in other boating-related activities. We sell used boats at our retail locations, online, and at various third-party marinas and other offsite locations; we sell marine engines and propellers, primarily to our retail customers as replacements for their existing engines and propellers; we sell a broad variety of parts and accessories at our retail locations and at various offsite locations, and through our print catalog; we offer maintenance, repair, and slip and storage services at most of our retail locations; we offer finance and insurance, or F&#38;I, products at our retail locations and at various offsite locations and to our customers and independent boat dealers and brokers; we offer boat and yacht brokerage sales at most of our retail locations and at various offsite locations; and we conduct a yacht charter business in which we offer customers the opportunity to charter third-party and company owned power and sailing yachts in exotic locations.

U.S. Recreational Boating Industry

The U.S. recreational boating industry generated approximately $35.9 billion in retail sales in calendar 2015, which is down from the peak of $39.5 billion in calendar 2006. The retail sales include sales of new and used recreational boats; marine products, such as engines, trailers, parts, and accessories; and related boating expenditures, such as fuel, insurance, docking, storage, and repairs. Retail sales of new and used boats, engines, trailers, equipment, and accessories accounted for approximately $26.7 billion of such sales in calendar 2015. Total powerboats sold in calendar 2015 were approximately 183,100 units as compared to 298,100 units sold in calendar 2006. Annual retail recreational boating sales were $17.9 billion in 1988, but declined to a low of $10.3 billion in 1992 based on industry data published by the National Marine Manufacturers Association. We believe this decline was attributable to several factors, including a recession, the Gulf War, and the imposition throughout 1991 and 1992 of a luxury tax on boats sold at prices in excess of $100,000. The luxury tax was repealed in 1993, and retail boating sales increased each year thereafter except for 1998, 2003, and 2007 through 2010.

The recreational boat retail market remains highly fragmented with little consolidation having occurred to date and consists of numerous boat retailers, most of which are small companies owned by individuals that operate in a single market and provide varying degrees of merchandising, professional management, and customer service. We believe that many boat retailers are encountering increased pressure from boat manufacturers to improve their levels of service and systems, increased competition from larger national retailers in certain product lines, and, in certain cases, business succession issues.

Strategy

Our goal is to enhance our position as the nation&#8217;s leading recreational boat dealer. Key elements of our operating and growth strategy include the following.

Emphasizing Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty . We seek to achieve a high level of customer satisfaction and establish long-term customer loyalty by creating an overall enjoyable boating experience beginning with a hassle-free purchase process. We seek to further enhance and simplify the purchase process by helping to arrange financing and insurance at our retail locations with competitive terms and streamlined turnaround. We offer the customer a thorough in-water orientation of boat operations where available, as well as ongoing boat safety, maintenance, and use seminars and demonstrations for the customer&#8217;s entire family. We also continue our customer service after the sale by leading and sponsoring MarineMax Getaways! group boating trips to various destinations, rendezvous gatherings, and on-the-water organized events to provide our customers with pre-arranged opportunities to enjoy the pleasures of the boating lifestyle. We also endeavor to provide superior maintenance and repair services, often through mobile service at the customer&#8217;s wet slip and with extended service department hours and emergency service availability, that minimize the hassles of boat maintenance. 

Achieving Operating Efficiencies and Synergies . We strive to increase the operating efficiencies of and achieve certain synergies among our dealerships in order to enhance internal growth and profitability. We centralize various aspects of certain administrative functions at the corporate level, such as accounting, finance, insurance coverage, employee benefits, marketing, 

strategic planning, legal support, purchasing and distribution, and management information systems. Centralization of these functions reduces duplicative expenses and permits the dealerships to benefit from a level of scale and expertise that would otherwise be unavailable to eac h dealership individually. We also seek to realize cost savings from reduced inventory carrying costs as a result of purchasing boat inventories on a national level and directing boats to dealership locations that can more readily sell such boats; lower f inancing costs through our credit sources; and volume purchase discounts and rebates for certain marine products, supplies, and advertising. The ability of our retail locations to offer the complementary services of our other retail locations, such as off ering customer excursion opportunities, providing maintenance and repair services at the customer&#8217;s boat location, and giving access to broader inventory selections, increases the competitiveness of each retail location. By centralizing these types of act ivities, our store managers have more time to focus on the customer and the development of their teams. 

Promoting Brand Name Recognition and the MarineMax Connection . We are promoting our brand name recognition to take advantage of our status as the nation&#8217;s only coast-to-coast marine retailer. This strategy also recognizes that many existing and potential customers who reside in Northern markets and vacation for substantial periods in Southern markets will likely prefer to purchase and service their boats from the same well-known company. We refer to this strategy as the &#8220;MarineMax Connection.&#8221; As a result, our signage emphasizes the MarineMax name at each of our locations, and we conduct national advertising in various print and other media. 

Offering Additional Products and Services, Including Those Involving Higher Profit Margins . We plan to continue to offer additional product lines and services throughout our dealerships and, when appropriate, online and various offsite locations. We are increasingly offering throughout our dealerships product lines that previously have been offered only at certain of our locations. We also obtain additional product lines through the acquisition of distribution rights directly from manufacturers and the acquisition of dealerships with distribution rights. In either situation, such expansion is typically done through agreements that appoint us as the exclusive dealer for a designated geographic territory. We plan to continue to grow our financing and insurance, parts and accessories, service, and boat storage businesses to better serve our customers and thereby increase revenue and improve profitability of these higher margin businesses. We also have implemented programs to increase the generation of leads and sales of boats over the Internet. In addition, we have established a yacht charter business and are conducting programs to sell used boats, offer F&#38;I products, and sell boating parts and accessories at various offsite locations. 

Marketing over the Internet . Our web initiatives span across multiple websites, including our core site, www.MarineMax.com . The websites provide customers with the ability to learn more about our company and our products. Our website generates direct sales and provides our stores with leads to potential customers for new and used boats, brokerage sales, finance and insurance products, and repair and maintenance services. In addition, we utilize various feeder websites and social networking websites to drive additional traffic and leads for our various product and service offerings. As mentioned above, we also maintain multiple online storefronts for customers to submit an inquiry, purchase boats, and purchase a wide variety of boating parts and accessories. 

Pursuing Strategic Acquisitions . One of our strategies is to capitalize upon the significant consolidation opportunities available in the highly fragmented recreational boat dealer industry by acquiring independent dealers and improving their performance and profitability through the implementation of our operating strategies. The primary acquisition focus is on well-established, high-end recreational boat dealers in geographic markets not currently served by us, particularly geographic markets with strong boating demographics, such as areas within the coastal states and the Great Lakes region. We also may seek to acquire boat dealers that, while located in attractive geographic markets, have not been able to realize favorable market share or profitability and that can benefit substantially from our systems and operating strategies. We may expand our range of product lines, service offerings, and market penetration by acquiring companies that distribute recreational boat product lines or boating-related services different from those we currently offer. As a result of our considerable industry experience and relationships, we believe we are well positioned to identify and evaluate acquisition candidates and assess their growth prospects, the quality of their management teams, their local reputation with customers, and the suitability of their locations. We believe we are regarded as an attractive acquirer by boat dealers because of: (1) the historical performance and the experience and reputation of our management team within the industry; (2) our decentralized operating strategy, which generally enables the managers of an acquired dealer to continue their involvement in dealership operations; (3) the ability of management and employees of an acquired dealer to participate in our growth and expansion through potential stock ownership and career advancement opportunities; and (4) the ability to offer liquidity to the owners of acquired dealers through the receipt of common stock or cash. We have entered into an agreement regarding acquisitions with the Sea Ray Division of Brunswick. Under the agreement, acquisitions of Sea Ray dealers will be mutually agreed upon by us and Sea Ray with reasonable efforts to be made to include a balance of Sea Ray dealers that have been successful and those that have not been. The agreement provides that Sea Ray will not unreasonably withhold its consent to any proposed acquisition of a Sea Ray dealer by us, subject to the conditions set forth in the agreement, as further described in &#8220;Business &#8212; Brunswick Agreement Relating to Acquisitions.&#8221; 

Opening New Facilities . We will continue to establish additional retail facilities in our existing and new markets subject to conditions. We believe that the demographics of our existing geographic territories support the opening of additional facilities, and we have opened 33 new retail facilities, excluding those opened on a temporary basis for a specific purpose, since our formation in January 1998. We continually monitor the performance of our retail locations and close retail locations that do not meet our 

expectations or that were opened for a specific purpose that is no longer relevant. Based on these factors since March 1998, we have closed 63 retail locations, excluding those opened on a temporary basis for a specific purpose, including 26 in fiscal 2009 (and a total of six during the last three fiscal years). 

Emphasizing Employee Recruitment and Retention through Training, Motivation, and Development . We devote substantial efforts to recruit employees that we believe to be exceptionally well qualified for their position and to train our employees to understand our core retail philosophies, which focus on making the purchase of a boat and its subsequent use as hassle-free and enjoyable as possible. Through our MarineMax University, or MMU, we teach our retail philosophies to existing and new employees at various locations and online, through MMU-online. MMU is a modularized and instructor-led educational program that focuses on our retailing philosophies and provides instruction on such matters as the sales process, customer service, F&#38;I, accounting, leadership, and human resources. 

Emphasizing Best Practices . We emphasize the best practices developed by us and our acquired dealers as appropriate throughout our locations. As an example, we have implemented a hassle-free approach at each of our dealerships. Under the MarineMax One Price hassle-free sales approach, we sell our boats at prices generally representing a discount from the manufacturer&#8217;s suggested retail price, thereby eliminating the anxieties of price negotiations that occur in most boat purchases. In addition, we adopt the best practices developed by us and our acquired dealers as applicable, considering location, design, layout, product purchases, maintenance and repair services (including extended service hours and mobile or dockside services), product mix, employee training, and customer education and services. 

Operating with Decentralized Management . We maintain a generally decentralized approach to the operational management of our dealerships. The decentralized management approach takes advantage of the extensive experience of local managers, enabling them to implement policies and make decisions, including the appropriate product mix, based on the needs of the local market. Local management authority also fosters responsive customer service and promotes long-term community and customer relationships. In addition, the centralization of certain administrative functions at the corporate level enhances the ability of local managers to focus their efforts on day-to-day dealership operations and the customers. 

Utilizing Technology Throughout Operations . We believe that our management information system, which currently is being utilized by each of our dealerships and was developed over a number of years through cooperative efforts with a common vendor, enhances our ability to integrate successfully the operations of our dealerships and future acquired dealers. The system facilitates the interchange of information and enhances cross-selling opportunities throughout our company. The system integrates each level of operations on a company-wide basis, including but not limited to purchasing, inventory, receivables, payables, financial reporting, budgeting, and sales management. The system also provides sales representatives with prospect and customer information that aids them in tracking the status of their contacts with prospects, automatically generates follow-up correspondence to such prospects, facilitates the availability of boats company-wide, locates boats needed to satisfy particular customer requests, and monitors the maintenance and service needs of customers&#8217; boats. Our representatives also utilize the computer system to assist in arranging customer financing and insurance packages. Our managers use a web-based tool to access essentially all financial and operational data from anywhere at any time. 

Products and Services

We offer new and used recreational boats and related marine products, including engines, trailers, parts, and accessories. While we sell a broad range of new and used boats, we focus on premium brand products. In addition, we assist in arranging related boat financing, insurance, and extended service contracts; provide boat maintenance and repair services; offer slip and storage accommodations; provide boat and yacht brokerage sales; and conduct a yacht charter business.

New Boat Sales

We primarily sell recreational boats, including pleasure boats and fishing boats. A number of the products we offer are manufactured by Brunswick, a leading worldwide manufacturer of recreational boats, including Sea Ray pleasure boats, Boston Whaler fishing boats, Harris aluminum boats, and Meridian Yachts. Sales of new Brunswick boats accounted for approximately 40% of our revenue in fiscal 2016. Sales of new Sea Ray and Boston Whaler boats, both divisions of Brunswick, accounted for approximately 24% and 14%, respectively, of our revenue in fiscal 2016. We believe our sales represented approximately 10% of all Brunswick marine sales, including approximately 53% of its Sea Ray boat sales, during our fiscal 2016. Certain of our dealerships also sell luxury yachts, fishing boats, and pontoon boats provided by other manufacturers, including Italy-based Azimut. Sales of new Azimut boats accounted for approximately 11% of our revenue in fiscal 2016. During fiscal 2016, new boat sales accounted for 68.5% or $645.3 million of our revenue.

We offer recreational boats in most market segments, but have a particular focus on premium quality pleasure boats and yachts as reflected by our fiscal 2016 average new boat sales price of approximately $198,000 an increase of approximately 16% from 

appro ximately $171,000 in fiscal 2015, compared with an estimated industry average selling price for calendar 2015 of approximately $42,000 based on industry data published by the National Marine Manufacturers Association. Given our locations in some of the mo re affluent, offshore boating areas in the United States and emphasis on high levels of customer service, we sell a relatively higher percentage of large recreational boats, such as mega-yachts, yachts, and sport cruisers. We believe that the product line s we offer are among the highest quality within their respective market segments, with well-established trade-name recognition and reputations for quality, performance, and styling. 

The following table is illustrative of the range and approximate manufacturer suggested retail price range of new boats that we currently offer, but is not all inclusive.

Motor Yachts . Hatteras Yachts, Ocean Alexander Yachts, and Azimut are three of the world&#8217;s premier yacht builders. The motor yacht product lines typically include state-of-the-art designs with live-aboard luxuries. Hatteras offers a flybridge with extensive guest seating; covered aft deck, which may be fully or partially enclosed, providing the boater with additional living space; an elegant salon; and multiple staterooms for accommodations. Azimut yachts are known for their Americanized open layout with Italian design and powerful performance. The luxurious interiors of Azimut yachts are accented by windows and multiple accommodations that have been designed for comfort. Ocean Alexander Yachts are known for their excellent engineering, performance, and functionality combined with luxuries typically found on larger mega yachts. 

Convertibles . Hatteras Yachts is one of the world&#8217;s premier convertible yacht builders and offers state-of-the-art designs with live-aboard luxuries. Convertibles are primarily fishing vessels, which are well equipped to meet the needs of even the most serious tournament-class competitor. Hatteras features interiors that offer luxurious salon/galley arrangements, multiple staterooms with private heads, and a cockpit that includes a bait and tackle center, fishbox, and freezer. 

Pleasure Boats . Sea Ray and Meridian pleasure boats target both the luxury and the family recreational boating markets and come in a variety of configurations to suit each customer&#8217;s particular recreational boating style. Sea Ray sport yachts and yachts serve the luxury segment of the recreational boating market and include top-of-the-line living accommodations with a salon, a fully equipped galley, and multiple staterooms. Sea Ray sport yachts and yachts are available in cabin, bridge cockpit, and cruiser models. Sea Ray sport boat and sport cruiser models are designed for performance and dependability to meet family recreational needs and include many of the features and accommodations of Sea Ray&#8217;s sport yacht and yacht models. Meridian sport yachts and yachts are known for their solid performance and thoughtful use of space with 360-degree views and spacious salon, galley, and stateroom accommodations. Meridian sport yachts and yachts are generally available in sedan and motoryacht models. All Sea Ray and Meridian pleasure boats feature custom instrumentation that may include an electronics package; various hull, deck, and cockpit 

designs that can include a swim platform; bow pulpit and raised bridge; and various amenities, such as swivel bucket helm seats, loung e seats, sun pads, wet bars, built-in ice chests, and refreshment centers. Most Sea Ray and Meridian pleasure boats feature Mercury or MerCruiser engines. We believe Atlantis sport cruisers offer a unique-on-the-water experience with the Azimut expertise expressed in a design concept that merges sportiness with the comfort and relative ease of navigation. Galeon is one of Europe&#8217;s leading boat manufacturers. We believe Galeon yachts combine the latest technology and design with unparalleled modern styling and convenience. Aquila power catamarans provide form, function, and offer practicality and comfort with trend setting innovation. Harris is one of the most innovative and premium pontoon boats offered and provides a variety of models to fit boaters&#8217; need s. Crest provides a variety of high quality pontoon models to meet family recreational needs. 

Fishing Boats . The fishing boats we offer, such as Boston Whaler, Grady White, Scout, Sailfish and Sea Pro, range from entry level models to advanced models designed for fishing and water sports in lakes, bays, and off-shore waters, with cabins with limited live-aboard capability. The fishing boats typically feature livewells, in-deck fishboxes, rodholders, rigging stations, cockpit coaming pads, and fresh and saltwater washdowns. 

Ski Boats . The ski boats we offer are Nautique by Correct Craft, which range from entry level models to advanced models and all of which are designed to achieve an ultimate wake for increased skier and wakeboarder performance and safety. With a variety of designs and options, Nautique ski boats appeal to the competitive and recreational user alike. 

Jet Boats . The Scarab jet boats we offer range from entry level models to advanced models, all of which are designed for performance and with exclusive design elements to meet family recreational needs. With a variety of designs and options, the jet boats we offer will appeal to a broad audience of jet boat enthusiasts as well as existing customers. 

Used Boat Sales

We sell used versions of the new makes and models we offer and, to a lesser extent, used boats of other makes and models generally taken as trade-ins. During fiscal 2016, used boat sales accounted for 17.5% or $165.5 million of our revenue, and 62.8% of the used boats we sold were Brunswick models. 

Our used boat sales depend on our ability to source a supply of high-quality used boats at attractive prices. We acquire substantially all of our used boat inventory through customer trade-ins. We intend to continue to increase our used boat business as a result of the availability of quality used boats generated from our new boat sales efforts, the increasing number of used boats that are well-maintained through our service initiatives, our ability to market used boats throughout our combined dealership network to match used boat demand, and the experience of our yacht brokerage operations. Additionally, substantially all of our used boat inventory is posted on our website, which expands the awareness and availability of our products to a large audience of boating enthusiasts. We also sell used boats at various marinas and other offsite locations throughout the country.

To further enhance our used boat sales, we offer the Brunswick Product Protection warranty plan available for used Brunswick boats less than nine years old. The Brunswick Product Protection plan applies to each qualifying used boat, which has passed a 48-point inspection, and provides protection against failure of most mechanical parts for up to three years. We believe these type of programs enhance our sales of used boats by motivating purchasers of used boats to complete their purchases through our dealerships.

Marine Engines, Related Marine Equipment, and Boating Parts and Accessories

We offer marine engines and equipment, substantially all of which are manufactured by Mercury Marine, a division of Brunswick. We sell marine engines and propellers primarily to retail customers as replacements for their existing engines or propellers. Mercury Marine has introduced various new engine models that reduce engine emissions to comply with current Environmental Protection Agency requirements. See &#8220;Business &#8212; Environmental and Other Regulatory Issues.&#8221; An industry leader for over seventy-five years, Mercury Marine specializes in state-of-the-art marine propulsion systems and accessories. Many of our dealerships have been recognized by Mercury Marine as &#8220;Premier Service Dealers.&#8221; This designation is generally awarded based on meeting certain standards and qualifications.

We also sell a broad variety of marine parts and accessories at our retail locations, at various offsite locations, and through our print catalog. These marine parts and accessories include marine electronics; dock and anchoring products, such as boat fenders, lines, and anchors; boat covers; trailer parts; water sport accessories, such as tubes, lines, wakeboards, and skis; engine parts; oils; lubricants; steering and control systems; corrosion control products and service products; high-performance accessories, such as propellers and instruments; and a complete line of boating accessories, including life jackets, inflatables, and water sports equipment. We also offer novelty items, such as shirts, caps, and license plates bearing the manufacturer&#8217;s or dealer&#8217;s logos. In all of our parts and accessories business, we utilize our industry knowledge and experience to offer boating enthusiasts high-quality products with which we have experience.

The sale of marine engines, related marine equipment, and boating pa rts and accessories, which are all tangible products, accounted for 3.5% or $32.6 million of our fiscal 2016 revenue. 

Maintenance, Repair, and Storage Services

Providing customers with professional, prompt maintenance and repair services is critical to our sales efforts and contributes to our success. We provide maintenance and repair services at most of our retail locations, with extended service hours at certain of our locations. In addition, in many of our markets, we provide mobile maintenance and repair services at the location of the customer&#8217;s boat. We believe that this service commitment is a competitive advantage in the markets in which we compete and is critical to our efforts to provide a trouble-free boating experience. To further this commitment, in certain of our markets, we have opened stand-alone maintenance and repair facilities in locations that are more convenient for our customers and that increase the availability of such services. We also believe that our maintenance and repair services contribute to strong customer relationships and that our emphasis on preventative maintenance and quality service increases the potential supply of well-maintained boats for our used boat sales.

We perform both warranty and non-warranty repair services, with the cost of warranty work reimbursed by the manufacturer in accordance with the manufacturer&#8217;s warranty reimbursement program. For warranty work, most manufacturers, including Brunswick, reimburse a percentage of the dealer&#8217;s posted service labor rates, with the percentage varying depending on the dealer&#8217;s customer satisfaction index rating and attendance at service training courses. We derive the majority of our warranty revenue from Brunswick products, as Brunswick products comprise the majority of products sold. Certain other manufacturers reimburse warranty work at a fixed amount per repair. Because boat manufacturers permit warranty work to be performed only at authorized dealerships, we receive substantially all of the warranted maintenance and repair work required for the new boats we sell. The third-party extended warranty contracts we offer also result in an ongoing demand for our maintenance and repair services for the duration of the term of the extended warranty contract.

Our maintenance and repair services are performed by manufacturer-trained and certified service technicians. In charging for our mechanics&#8217; labor, many of our dealerships use a variable rate structure designed to reflect the difficulty and sophistication of different types of repairs. The percentage markups on parts are similarly based on manufacturer suggested prices and market conditions for different parts.

At many of our locations, we offer boat storage services, including in-water slip storage and inside and outside land storage. These storage services are offered at competitive market rates and include in-season and winter storage.

Maintenance, repair, and storage services accounted for 5.5% or $51.5 million of our revenue during fiscal 2016 of which, 3.5% or $33.2 million related to repair services, 0.8% or $7.5 million related to parts and accessories for repairs, and 1.2% or $10.8 million related to income from storage service rentals. This includes warranty and non-warranty services.

F&#38;I Products

At each of our retail locations and at various offsite locations where applicable, we offer our customers the ability to finance new or used boat purchases and to purchase extended service contracts and arrange insurance coverage, including boat property, credit life, and accident, disability, undercoating, and casualty insurance coverage (collectively, &#8220;F&#38;I&#8221;). We have relationships with various national marine product lenders under which the lenders purchase retail installment contracts evidencing retail sales of boats and other marine products that are originated by us in accordance with existing pre-sale agreements between us and the lenders. These arrangements permit us to receive a portion of the finance charges expected to be earned on the retail installment contract based on a variety of factors, including the credit standing of the buyer, the annual percentage rate of the contract charged to the buyer, and the lender&#8217;s then current minimum required annual percentage rate charged to the buyer on the contract. This participation is subject to repayment by us if the buyer prepays the contract or defaults within a designated time period, usually 90 to 180 days. To the extent required by applicable state law, our dealerships are licensed to originate and sell retail installment contracts financing the sale of boats and other marine products.

We also offer third-party extended service contracts under which, for a predetermined price, we provide all designated services pursuant to the service contract guidelines during the contract term at no additional charge to the customer above a deductible. While we sell all new boats with the boat manufacturer&#8217;s standard hull and engine warranty, extended service contracts provide additional coverage beyond the time frame or scope of the manufacturer&#8217;s warranty. Purchasers of used boats generally are able to purchase an extended service contract, even if the selected boat is no longer covered by the manufacturer&#8217;s warranty. Generally, we receive a fee for arranging an extended service contract. Most required services under the contracts are provided by us and paid for by the third-party contract holder.

We also are able to assist our customers with the opportunity to purchase credit life insurance, accident and disability insu rance, and property and casualty insurance. Credit life insurance policies provide for repayment of the boat financing contract if the purchaser dies while the contract is outstanding. Accident and disability insurance policies provide for payment of the monthly contract obligation during any period in which the buyer is disabled. Property and casualty insurance covers loss or damage to the boat. We do not act as an insurance broker or agent or issue insurance policies on behalf of insurers. We do, how ever, provide marketing activities and other related services to insurance companies and brokers for which we receive marketing fees. One of our strategies is to generate increased marketing fees by offering more competitive insurance products. 

During fiscal 2016, fee income generated from F&#38;I products accounted for 2.5% or $23.3 million of our revenue. We believe that our customers&#8217; ability to obtain competitive financing quickly and easily at our dealerships complements our ability to sell new and used boats. We also believe our ability to provide customer-tailored financing on a &#8220;same-day&#8221; basis gives us an advantage over many of our competitors, particularly smaller competitors that lack the resources to arrange boat financing at their dealerships or that do not generate sufficient volume to attract the diversity of financing sources that are available to us.

Brokerage Sales

Through employees or subcontractors that are licensed boat or yacht brokers where applicable, we offer boat or yacht brokerage sales at most of our retail locations. For a commission, we offer for sale brokered boats or yachts, listing them on various Internet sites, advising our other retail locations of their availability through our integrated computer system, and posting them on our website, www.MarineMax.com . Often sales are co-brokered, with the commission split between the buying and selling brokers. We believe that our access to potential used boat customers and methods of listing and advertising customers&#8217; brokered boats or yachts is more extensive than is typical among brokers. In addition to generating revenue from brokerage commissions, our brokerage sales also enable us to offer a broad array of used boats or yachts without increasing related inventory costs. During fiscal 2016, brokerage sales commissions accounted for 2.0% or $18.7 million of our revenue.

Our brokerage customers generally receive the same high level of customer service as our new and used boat customers. Our waterfront retail locations enable in-water demonstrations of an on-site brokered boat. Our maintenance and repair services, including mobile service, also are generally available to our brokerage customers. The purchaser of a boat brokered through us also can take advantage of MarineMax Getaways! weekend and day trips and other rendezvous gatherings and in-water events, as well as boat operation and safety seminars. We believe that the array of services we offer are unique in the brokerage business.

Yacht Charter

In 2011 we launched a yacht charter business in which we offer customers the opportunity to charter power and sailing yachts in exotic destinations, starting with our initial location in the British Virgin Islands (BVI). In this business, we sell specifically designed yachts to third parties for inclusion in our yacht charter fleet; enter into yacht management agreements under which yacht owners enable us to put their yachts in our yacht charter program for a period of four to five years for a fixed monthly fee payable by us; provide our services in storing, insuring, and maintaining their yachts; and charter these yachts to vacation customers at agreed fees payable to us. The yacht owners will be able to utilize the yachts for personal use for a designated number of weeks during the term of the management agreement and take possession of their yachts following the expiration of the yacht management agreements. 

In addition to the specific business we launched in the BVI, we also offer yacht charter services. For a fee, we assist yacht owners in the charter of their vessel by third-parties. During fiscal 2016, the income from rentals of chartering power and sailing yachts and yacht charter fees, accounted for 0.5% or $5.1 million of our revenue.

Offsite Sales

We sell used boats, offer F&#38;I products, and sell parts and accessories at various third-party offsite locations, including marinas.

Retail Locations

We sell our recreational boats and other marine products and offer our related boat services through 56 retail locations in Alabama, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and Texas. Each retail location generally includes an indoor showroom (including some of the industry&#8217;s largest indoor boat showrooms) and an outside area for displaying boat inventories, a business office to assist customers in arranging financing and insurance, and maintenance and repair facilities.

Many of our retail locations are waterfront properti es on some of the nation&#8217;s most popular boating locations, including the San Diego Bay in California; Norwalk Harbor and Westbrook Harbor in Connecticut; multiple locations on the Intracoastal Waterway, the Atlantic Ocean, Biscayne Bay, Boca Ciega Bay, Cal oosahatchee River, Naples Bay, Tampa Bay, Pensacola Bay, and the Saint Andrews Bay in Florida; Lake Lanier in Georgia; Chesapeake Bay in Maryland; Lake Minnetonka, and the St. Croix River in Minnesota; Lake of the Ozarks and Table Rock Lake in Missouri; Ba rnegat Bay, Lake Hopatcong, Little Egg Harbor Bay, and the Manasquan River in New Jersey; Great South Bay, the Hudson River, and Huntington Harbor in New York; Boston Harbor and Weymouth Black River in Massachusetts; Masonboro Inlet in North Carolina; Lake Erie in Ohio; Grand Lake in Oklahoma; Newport Harbor and Greenwich Bay in Rhode Island; and Clear Lake, Lake Lewisville, and Lake Conroe in Texas. Our waterfront retail locations, most of which include marina-type facilities and docks at which we display our boats, are easily accessible to the boating populace, serve as in-water showrooms, and enable the sales force to give customers immediate in-water demonstrations of various boat models. Most of our other locations are in close proximity to water. 

Operations

Dealership Operations and Management

We have adopted a generally decentralized approach to the operational management of our dealerships. While certain administrative functions are centralized at the corporate level, local management is primarily responsible for the day-to-day operations of the retail locations. Each retail location is managed by a general manager, who oversees the day-to-day operations, personnel, and financial performance of the individual store, subject to the direction of a regional president, who generally has responsibility for the retail locations within a specified geographic region. Typically, each retail location also has a staff consisting of an F&#38;I manager, a parts manager, and a service manager, sales representatives, maintenance and repair technicians, and various support personnel.

We attempt to attract and retain quality employees by providing them with ongoing training to enhance sales professionalism and product knowledge, career advancement opportunities within a larger company, and favorable benefit packages. We maintain a formal training program, called MarineMax University or MMU, which provides training for employees in all aspects of our operations. Training sessions are held at our various regional locations covering a variety of topics. MMU-online offers various modules over the Internet. Highly trained, professional sales representatives are an important factor to our successful sales efforts. These sales representatives are trained at MMU to recognize the importance of fostering an enjoyable sales process, to educate customers on the operation and use of the boats, and to assist customers in making technical and design decisions in boat purchases. The overall focus of MMU is to teach our core retailing values, which focus on customer service.

Sales representatives receive compensation primarily on a commission basis. Each general manager is a salaried employee with incentive bonuses based on the performance of the managed dealership. Maintenance and repair service managers receive compensation on a salary basis with bonuses based on the performance of their departments. Our management information system provides each store and department manager with daily financial and operational information, enabling them to monitor their performance on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. We have a uniform, fully integrated management information system serving each of our dealerships.

Sales and Marketing

Our sales philosophy focuses on selling the pleasures of the boating lifestyle. We believe that the critical elements of our sales philosophy include our appealing retail locations, no-hassle sales approach, highly trained sales representatives, high level of customer service, emphasis on educating the customer and the customer&#8217;s family on boating, and providing our customers with opportunities for boating through our MarineMax Getaways!. We strive to provide superior customer service and support before, during, and after the sale. Our team and customers are United by Water&#174;.

Each retail location offers the customer the opportunity to evaluate a variety of new and used boats in a comfortable and convenient setting. Our full-service retail locations facilitate a turn-key purchasing process that includes attractive lender financing packages, extended service agreements, and insurance. Many of our retail locations are located on waterfronts and marinas, which attract boating enthusiasts and enable customers to operate various boats prior to making a purchase decision.

The brands we offer are diverse in size and use and are spread across our customer activities of leisure, fishing, watersports, luxury, and vacations. We believe the transformative qualities of the water should be shared by everyone, so we created our boat lineup accordingly. Our promise gives them meaning and reason to exist next to one another on our showroom floor.

We sell our boats at posted MarineMax &#8220;One&#8221; Prices that generally represent a discount from the manufacturer&#8217;s suggested retail price. Our sales approach focuses on customer service by minimizing customer anxiety associated with price negotiation.

As a part of our sales and marketing efforts, our online marketing activity is important, with the majority of leads coming through our website, www.MarineMax.com , and emails used as the primary marketing tool for our stores to connect with their customers. Social media is a growing venue for customer engagement with stores and prospecting of new leads. 

We also participate in boat shows and in-the-water sales events at area boating locations, typically held in January and February and toward the end of the boating season, in each of our markets and in certain locations in close proximity to our markets. These shows and events are normally held at convention centers or marinas, with area dealers renting space. Boat shows and other offsite promotions are an important venue for generating sales orders. The boat shows also generate a significant amount of interest in our products resulting in boat sales after the show.

We emphasize customer education through one-on-one education by our sales representatives and, at some locations, our delivery captains, before and after a sale, and through in-house seminars for the entire family on boating safety, the use and operation of boats, and product demonstrations. Typically, one of our delivery captains or the sales representative delivers the customer&#8217;s boat to an area boating location and thoroughly instructs the customer about the operation of the boat, including hands-on instructions for docking and trailering the boat. To enhance our customer relationships after the sale, we lead and sponsor MarineMax Getaways! group boating trips to various destinations, rendezvous gatherings, and on-the-water organized events that promote the pleasures of the boating lifestyle. Each company-sponsored event, planned and led by a company employee, also provides a favorable medium for acclimating new customers to boating, sharing exciting boating destinations, creating friendships with other boaters, and enabling us to promote new product offerings to boating enthusiasts.

As a result of our relative size, we believe we have a competitive advantage within the industry by being able to conduct an organized and systematic advertising and marketing effort. Part of our marketing effort includes an integrated customer relationship management system that tracks the status of each sales representative&#8217;s contacts with a prospect, automatically generates follow-up correspondence, and facilitates company-wide availability of a particular boat or other marine product desired by a customer.

Suppliers and Inventory Management

We purchase substantially all of our new boat inventory directly from manufacturers, which allocate new boats to dealerships based on the amount of boats sold by the dealership and their market share. We also exchange new boats with other dealers to accommodate customer demand and to balance inventory.

We purchase new boats and other marine-related products from Brunswick, which is a world leading manufacturer of marine products, including Sea Ray, Boston Whaler, Harris, and Meridian. We also purchase new boats and other marine related products from other manufacturers, including Azimut, Hatteras, Grady White, Scout, Sailfish, and Nautique by Correct Craft. In fiscal 2016, sales of new Brunswick and Azimut boats accounted for approximately 40% and 11% of our revenue, respectively. Sales of new Sea Ray and Boston Whaler boats, both divisions of Brunswick, accounted for approximately 24% and 14%, respectively, of our revenue in fiscal 2016. No purchases of new boats and other marine related products from any other manufacturer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in fiscal 2016. We believe our Sea Ray boat purchases represented approximately 53% of Sea Ray&#8217;s new boat sales, and approximately 10% of all Brunswick marine product sales during fiscal 2016.

We have entered into multi-year agreements with Brunswick covering Sea Ray, Boston Whaler, and Meridian products. We also have a multi-year agreement with Azimut-Benetti Group for its Azimut product line. We typically deal with each of our manufacturers, other than Brunswick and Azimut-Benetti Group, under an annually renewable, non-exclusive dealer agreement.

The dealer agreements do not restrict our right to sell any product lines or competing products provided that we are in compliance with the material obligations of our dealer agreements. The terms of each dealer agreement appoints a designated geographical territory for the dealer, which is exclusive to the dealer provided that the dealer is able to meet the material obligations of its dealer agreement.

Manufacturers generally establish prices on an annual basis, but may change prices at their sole discretion. Manufacturers typically discount the cost of inventory and offer inventory financing assistance during the manufacturers&#8217; slow seasons, generally October through March. To obtain lower cost of inventory, we strive to capitalize on these manufacturer incentives to take product delivery during the manufacturers&#8217; slow seasons. This permits us to gain pricing advantages and better product availability during the selling season. Arrangements with certain other manufacturers may restrict our right to offer some product lines in certain markets.

We transfer individual boats among our retail locations to fill customer orders that otherwise might take substantially longer to fill from the manufacturer. This reduces delays in delivery, helps us maximize inventory turnover, and assists in minimizing potential overstock or out-of-stock situations. We actively monitor our inventory levels to maintain levels appropriate to meet current anticipated market demands. We are not bound by contractual agreements governing the amount of inventory that we must purchase in any year from any manufacturer, but the failure to purchase at agreed upon levels may result in the loss of certain manufacturer 

incentives or dealership rights. We participate in numerous end-of-summer man ufacturer boat shows, which manufacturers sponsor to sell off their remaining inventory at reduced costs before the introduction of new model year products, typically beginning in September. 

Inventory Financing

Marine manufacturers customarily provide interest assistance programs to retailers. The interest assistance varies by manufacturer and may include periods of free financing or reduced interest rate programs. The interest assistance may be paid directly to the retailer or the financial institution depending on the arrangements the manufacturer has established. We believe that our financing arrangements with manufacturers are standard within the industry.

We account for consideration received from our vendors in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification 605-50, &#8220;Revenue Recognition&#8210;Customer Payments and Incentives&#8221; (&#8220;ASC 605-50&#8221;). ASC 605-50 requires us to classify interest assistance received from manufacturers as a reduction of inventory cost and related cost of sales as opposed to netting the assistance against our interest expense incurred with our lenders. Pursuant to ASC 605-50, amounts received by us under our co-op assistance programs from our manufacturers are netted against related advertising expenses.

We are party to an Inventory Financing Agreement (the &#8220;Amended Credit Facility&#8221;) led by Wells Fargo Commercial Distribution Finance LLC (formerly GE Commercial Distribution Finance Corporation). The Amended Credit Facility provides a floor plan financing commitment of up to $300 million. The Amended Credit Facility matures in October 2019 and the Amended Credit Facility includes two additional one-year extension periods, with lender approval.

The interest rate under the Amended Credit Facility is 345 basis points above the one-month London Inter-Bank Offering Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;). There is an unused line fee of ten basis points on the unused portion of the line.

The Amended Credit Facility has certain financial covenants. The covenants include provisions that our leverage ratio not exceed 2.75 to 1.0 and that our current ratio must be greater than 1.2 to 1.0. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all the covenants under the Amended Credit Facility.

The initial advance under the Amended Credit Facility was used to pay off our prior credit facility. Subsequent advances have been, and will be, initiated by the acquisition of eligible new and used inventory or will be re-advances against eligible new and used inventory that has been partially paid-off. Advances on new inventory will generally mature 1,080 days from the original invoice date. Advances on used inventory will mature 361 days from the date we acquire the used inventory. Each advance is subject to a curtailment schedule, which requires that we pay down the balance of each advance on a periodic basis starting after six months. The curtailment schedule varies based on the type of inventory and the value of the inventory.

The collateral for the Amended Credit Facility is all of our personal property with certain limited exceptions. None of our real estate has been pledged for collateral for the Amended Credit Facility.

As of September 30, 2016, we owed $166.6 million under the Amended Credit Facility. Outstanding short-term borrowings accrued interest at a rate of 3.9% as of September 30, 2016, and the Amended Credit Facility provided us with an additional net borrowing availability of approximately $69.8 million, based upon the outstanding borrowing base availability. We have no indebtedness associated with our real estate holdings.

Management Information System

We believe that our management information system, which is utilized by each of our dealerships and was developed over a number of years through cooperative efforts with a common vendor, enhances our ability to integrate successfully the operations of our dealerships and future acquisitions, facilitates the interchange of information, and enhances cross-selling opportunities throughout our company. The system integrates each level of operations on a company-wide basis, including but not limited to purchasing, inventory, receivables, payables, financial reporting, budgeting, and sales management. The system enables us to monitor each dealership&#8217;s operations in order to identify quickly areas requiring additional focus and to manage inventory. The system also provides sales representatives with prospect and customer information that aids them in tracking the status of their contacts with prospects, automatically generates follow-up correspondence to such prospects, facilitates the availability of a particular boat company-wide, locates boats needed to satisfy a particular customer request, and monitors the maintenance and service needs of customers&#8217; boats. Company representatives also utilize the system to assist in arranging financing and insurance packages.

Brunswick Agreement Relating to Acquisitions 

We and the Sea Ray Division of Brunswick are parties to an agreement that provides a process for the acquisition of additional Sea Ray boat dealers that we elect to acquire. The agreement extends through August 31, 2018, with automatic annual one-year extensions at each twelve month anniversary of the agreement, provided that our dealer agreements with the Sea Ray Division of Brunswick are still then in effect. Under the agreement, acquisitions of Sea Ray dealers will be mutually agreed upon by us and Sea Ray with reasonable efforts to be made to include a balance of Sea Ray dealers that have been successful and those that have not been. The agreement provides that Sea Ray will not unreasonably withhold its consent to any proposed acquisition of a Sea Ray dealer by us, subject to the conditions set forth in the agreement. Among other things, the agreement provides for us to provide Sea Ray with a business plan for each proposed acquisition, including historical financial and five-year projected financial information regarding the acquisition candidate; marketing and advertising plans; service capabilities and managerial and staff personnel; information regarding the ability of the candidate to achieve performance standards within designated periods; and information regarding the success of our previous acquisitions of Sea Ray dealers. The agreement also contemplates Sea Ray reaching a good faith determination whether the acquisition would be in its best interest based on our dedication and focus of resources on the Sea Ray brand and Sea Ray&#8217;s consideration of any adverse effects that the approval would have on the resulting territory configuration of adjacent or other dealers and the absence of any violation of applicable laws or rights granted by Sea Ray to others.

Dealer Agreements with Brunswick

We and the Sea Ray Division of Brunswick and Boston Whaler, Inc. are parties to Sales and Service Agreements relating to Sea Ray and Boston Whaler products respectively, effective September 1, 2014 and extending through August 31, 2018 with automatic annual one-year extensions at each twelve-month anniversary of the agreement, provided that we are not in breach of a material term of the agreement, following written notice and expiration of applicable cure periods without cure (certain termination provisions are summarized below).

The agreements appoint certain of our operating subsidiaries as a dealer for the retail sale, display, and servicing of all Sea Ray or Boston Whaler products, parts, and accessories currently or in the future sold by Sea Ray or Boston Whaler, as applicable. The agreements specify a designated geographical territory and dealer region or location for the dealer, which is exclusive to the dealer. The agreement also specifies retail locations, which the dealer may not close, change, or add to without the prior written consent of the relevant manufacturer, provided that such manufacturer may not unreasonably withhold its consent. The manufacturer reserves the right to modify the territory or appoint other dealers to sell, display, and service product from dealer locations within the territory at any time if we close a dealer location without prior written notice to Sea Ray and prior written approval by Sea Ray, which will not be unreasonably withheld or in the case of Boston Whaler, in the event that a dealer location fails to meet performance standards while carrying competitive product following written notice and a period of 60 days to cure or six months for matters for which a cure cannot be completed in 60 days. The agreements also restrict the dealer from selling, advertising (other than in recognized and established marine publications), soliciting for sale, or offering for resale any products outside its territory except as otherwise provided by the relevant manufacturer&#8217;s advertising policy or other applicable policy as long as similar restrictions also apply to all domestic dealers selling comparable products. In addition, the agreements provide for the lowest product prices charged by the relevant manufacturer from time to time to other domestic dealers, subject to the dealer meeting all the requirements and conditions of applicable programs and the right of the manufacturer in good faith to charge lesser prices to other dealers to meet existing competitive circumstances, for unusual and non-ordinary business circumstances, or for limited duration promotional programs.

Among other things, the dealer agreements require each dealer to achieve performance standards including inventory stocking levels, provision of annual sales forecasts, submission of orders pursuant to the manufacturer&#8217;s current buying program, unit retail sales, customer satisfaction and marketing support. The sales performance will be in accordance with fair and reasonable standards and sales levels established by the manufacturer in collaboration with the dealer based on factors such as population, sales potential, market share percentage of products sold in the territory compared with competitive products sold in the territory, product availability, local economic conditions, competition, past sales history, historical product mix and stocking practices, existing product inventory, number of retail locations, and other special circumstances that may affect the sale of the relevant products or the dealer, in each case established in a manner similar to those applied to domestic dealers selling comparable products.

The dealer is also required to maintain at each retail location, or at another acceptable location, a service department that is properly staffed and equipped to service Sea Ray or Boston Whaler products, as applicable, promptly and professionally and to maintain parts and supplies to service such products properly on a timely basis, to provide or arrange for warranty and service work for such products.

Sea Ray and Boston Whaler respectively have each agreed to indemnify us against any losses to third parties resulting from their respective negligent acts or omissions involving the design or manufacture of any of its products or any breach by it of the agreement. We have agreed to indemnify Sea Ray or Boston Whaler respectively against any losses to third parties resulting from our negligent acts or omissions involving the dealer&#8217;s application, use, or repair of Sea Ray or Boston Whaler products respectively, statements or 

representation not specifically authorized by the relevant manufacturer, the installation of any af ter-market components or any other modification or alteration of the products, and any breach by us of the agreement. 

The agreements may be terminated:

&#160;

&#8226; 

by the manufacturer, upon 60 days&#8217; prior written notice, if we do not have an ability to purchase products via floor plan financing or self-financing or fail to meet our financial obligations as they become due to the relevant manufacturer or to our lenders; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

as to any dealer region, or in the case of Boston Whaler, any dealer location, if we are failing to meet performance standards and begin selling, displaying or advertising products that are competitive with the products being sold under the agreement (other than products of another Brunswick brand or new products currently carried), if we do not cure our failure within 90 days after written notice, or if we are meeting the performance standards and then start failing to meet performance standards after beginning selling, displaying or advertising products that are competitive with products sold under the agreement (other than products of another Brunswick brand or new products currently carried) and do not cure our failure within six months after written notice, or with respect to Boston Whaler and dealer&#8217;s locations in New York, in the event such dealer location fails to meet performance standards and does not cure such failure within 6 months after written notice; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

with respect to the Sea Ray agreements, by either party upon prior written notice to the other given within 60 days after the 6 th anniversary of the agreement, with termination effective at the end of the 7 th year, failing which the agreement will renew for a 3 year term beginning on the 7 th anniversary; with respect to the Boston Whaler agreements, by either party upon prior written notice to the other given within 60 days after the 4th anniversary of the agreement, with termination effective at the end of the 5 th year, failing which the agreement will renew for a 2 year term beginning on the 5 th anniversary; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

with respect to Sea Ray, following the 7 th anniversary of the agreement, upon 24 months&#8217; notice (or with respect to Boston Whaler, following the 5 th anniversary of the agreement, upon 12 months&#8217; notice), in the event of a material breach or default of any of the material obligations, performance standards, covenants, representations, warranties or duties imposed in the agreement or in the applicable manufacturer&#8217;s policies or programs applicable to domestic dealers which breach is not cured during the notice period and through the parties working in good faith to resolve any issue; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

by Sea Ray or Boston Whaler, as applicable, or us upon 60 days&#8217; written notice if the other makes a fraudulent misrepresentation that is material to the agreement or in the event of the insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership of the other; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

by Sea Ray or Boston Whaler, as applicable, in the event of the assignment of the agreement by the dealer without the prior written consent of Sea Ray or Boston Whaler, as applicable; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

by Sea Ray or Boston Whaler, as applicable, upon at least 60 days' prior written notice in the event of the commission by dealer of an act of fraud upon Sea Ray or Boston Whaler, as applicable, or the commission by us or one of our officers of a felony or act of fraud which is materially detrimental to Sea Ray&#8217;s or Boston Whaler&#8217;s respective reputation or business or which materially impairs our ability to perform our duties under the agreement or we fail to pay any lender financing products under the agreement after the sale of products by us; or 

&#160;

&#8226; 

upon the mutual consent of Sea Ray or Boston Whaler, as applicable, and us. 

Either party may elect to not extend the term at the expiration of each applicable 12 month period in the event of a material breach or default by the other of any of the material obligations, performance standards, covenants, representations, warranties, or duties imposed by the agreement or the manufacturer&#8217;s manual that is not remedied or cured following notice thereof. In the event of a remedy or cure, the additional 12 month period shall be added to the term.

Dealer Agreements with Azimut

We are parties to Dealership Agreements with Azimut Benetti S.P.a. for the retail sale, display, and servicing of designated Azimut products and parts sold by Azimut. The Dealership Agreements automatically renew each year provided that we are able to agree in good faith on acceptable retail sales goals. The dealership agreements grant us the exclusive right to sell the Azimut products and parts in designated geographical areas. Among other things, each dealership agreement requires the applicable dealer to:

&#160;

&#8226; 

display the Azimut products in the most appropriate and effective manner; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

maintain an adequate inventory of Azimut products and meet mutually agreed upon minimum purchase requirements; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

use commercially reasonable best efforts to establish the best image for Azimut and to promote the sales of the products; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

operate through at least one permanent office to ensure adequate promotion of the products; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

maintain adequate signage to show Azimut at its offices or service yards; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

promote the products at various events and meetings; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

advertise and market the products in accordance with agreed upon marketing plans and budgets; 

&#160;

&#8226;

&#160;

&#8226; 

comply with Azimut&#8217;s warranty procedures; and 

&#160;

&#8226; 

perform maintenance services for Azimut boats. 

Azimut has agreed to indemnify each of our dealers against any losses resulting from an alleged breach of warranty or injury or damage caused by a defect in design, manufacture or assembly of a product. Each of our dealers has agreed to indemnify Azimut against any losses resulting from the dealer&#8217;s failure to comply with any material obligation with respect to a product or customer; any actual negligence, errors or omissions in connection with the sale, preparation, repairs, or service of products; any modification of products except as approved by Azimut; a breach of any material agreement; or unauthorized warranties, misleading statements, misrepresentations or deceptive or unfair practices.

Each dealer agreement may be terminated upon 30 days prior written notice in event that the defaulting party has not remedied a default during such period, in the event of any of the following:

&#160;

&#8226; 

by Azimut or dealer, for failure of the other to maintain a necessary license; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

by Azimut or dealer, for the change, transfer, or attempted transfer by the other party of the whole or any part of the agreement other than to an affiliate as part of a corporate restructuring or any change in control without the prior consent of Azimut; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

by Azimut or dealer, for the knowing submission of an intentional fraudulent statement, application, request, refund, credit, or warranty claim; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

by Azimut or dealer, for the knowing use of a deceptive or fraudulent practice in the sale of a product; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

by Azimut or dealer, for the indictment for or conviction of a crime or violation of law which will have an adverse and material effect on the other&#8217;s reputation or operations; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

by Azimut or dealer, for the other entering into an agreement or understanding to fix prices for the products; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

by dealer for Azimut&#8217;s material and continuous failure to supply product or appointing another dealer in the territory or failure to fulfill warranty obligations; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

by Azimut for dealer&#8217;s abandonment of operations or failure to maintain business as a going concern; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

by Azimut for dealer&#8217;s material and continuous failure to represent, promote, sell, or service the products, achieve minimum yearly sales or comply with purchase orders as agreed by the parties considering various factors such as the economy, the Euro impact, product availability, and growth potential; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

by Azimut or dealer for the insolvency, bankruptcy, commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, appointment of a receiver or other officer with similar powers, levy under attachment, garnishment or execution, or similar process, which is not vacated or removed within ten days; and 

&#160;

&#8226; 

by mutual agreement of the dealer and Azimut. 

Upon termination of the dealer agreements by Azimut without cause, termination by dealer with cause and nonrenewal and expiration, Azimut is required to repurchase unsold inventory within sixty days of termination.

Employees

As of September 30, 2016, we had 1,422 employees, 1,313 of whom were in store-level operations and 109 of whom were in corporate administration and management. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with our employees to be excellent.

Trademarks and Service Marks 

We have registered trade names and trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for various names, including &#8220;MarineMax,&#8221; &#8220;MarineMax Getaways!,&#8221; &#8220;MarineMax Care,&#8221; &#8220;Delivering the Dream,&#8221; &#8220;MarineMax Delivering the Boating Dream,&#8221; &#8220;Newcoast Financial Services,&#8221; &#8220;MarineMax Boating Gear Center,&#8221; &#8220;MarineMax Vacations,&#8221; &#8220;United by Water&#8221; and &#8220;Women on Water.&#8221; We have registered the name &#8220;MarineMax&#8221; in the European Union, China, Australia, Brazil, India, and Cuba; &#8220;Maximizing Your Enjoyment on the Water&#8221; in the European Union, Cuba, and Australia; and &#8220;United by Water&#8221; in the European Union, China, Australia and Cuba. We have trade names and trademarks registered in Canada for various names, including &#8220;MarineMax,&#8221; &#8220;Delivering the Dream,&#8221; &#8220;United by Water,&#8221; and &#8220;The Water Gene.&#8221; We have various trade name and trademark applications including &#8220;MarineMax,&#8221; &#8220;United by Water,&#8221; and &#8220;Maximizing Your Enjoyment on Water&#8221; pending in Brazil, China, European Union, and India. There can be no assurance that any of these applications will be granted.

Seasonality and Weather Conditions

Our business, as well as the entire recreational boating industry, is highly seasonal, with seasonality varying in different geographic markets. Over the three-year period ended September 30, 2016, the average revenue for the quarters ended December 31, March 31, June 30, and September 30 represented approximately 19%, 22%, 34%, and 25%, respectively, of our average annual revenues. With the exception of Florida, we generally realize significantly lower sales and higher levels of inventories and related short-term borrowings, in the quarterly periods ending December 31 and March 31. The onset of the public boat and recreation shows in January generally stimulates boat sales and typically allows us to reduce our inventory levels and related short-term borrowings throughout the remainder of the fiscal year.

Our business is also subject to weather patterns, which may adversely affect our results of operations. For example, prolonged winter conditions, drought conditions (or merely reduced rainfall levels) or excessive rain, may limit access to area boating locations or render boating dangerous or inconvenient, thereby curtailing customer demand for our products. In addition, unseasonably cool weather and prolonged winter conditions may lead to a shorter selling season in certain locations. Hurricanes and other storms could result in disruptions of our operations or damage to our boat inventories and facilities, as has been the case when Florida and other markets were affected by hurricanes. Although our geographic diversity is likely to reduce the overall impact to us of adverse weather conditions in any one market area, these conditions will continue to represent potential, material adverse risks to us and our future financial performance.

Environmental and Other Regulatory Issues

Our operations are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and licensing under various federal, state, and local statutes, ordinances, and regulations. While we believe that we maintain all requisite licenses and permits and are in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain all requisite licenses and permits. The failure to satisfy those and other regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The adoption of additional laws, rules, and regulations could also have a material adverse effect on our business. Various federal, state, and local regulatory agencies, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, and similar federal and local agencies, have jurisdiction over the operation of our dealerships, repair facilities, and other operations with respect to matters such as consumer protection, workers&#8217; safety, and laws regarding protection of the environment, including air, water, and soil.

The EPA has various air emissions regulations for outboard marine engines that impose more strict emissions standards for two-cycle, gasoline outboard marine engines. The majority of the outboard marine engines we sell are manufactured by Mercury Marine. Mercury Marine&#8217;s product line of low-emission engines, including the OptiMax, Verado, and other four-stroke outboards, have achieved the EPA&#8217;s mandated 2006 emission levels. Any increased costs of producing engines resulting from EPA standards, or the inability of our manufacturers to comply with EPA requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Certain of our facilities own and operate underground storage tanks, or USTs, for the storage of various petroleum products. The USTs are generally subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations that require testing and upgrading of USTs and remediation of contaminated soils and groundwater resulting from leaking USTs. In addition, if leakage from company-owned or operated USTs migrates onto the property of others, we may be subject to civil liability to third parties for remediation costs or other damages. Based on historical experience, we believe that our liabilities associated with UST testing, upgrades, and remediation are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.

As with boat dealerships generally, and parts and service operations in particular, our business involves the use, handling, storage, and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, including environmentally sensitive materials, such as motor oil, waste motor oil and filters, transmission fluid, antifreeze, freon, waste paint and lacquer thinner, batteries, solvents, lubricants, degreasing agents, gasoline, and diesel fuels. Accordingly, we are subject to regulation by federal, state, and local 

authorities esta blishing requirements for the use, management, handling, and disposal of these materials and health and environmental quality standards, and liability related thereto, and providing penalties for violations of those standards. We are also subject to laws, ordinances, and regulations governing investigation and remediation of contamination at facilities we operate to which we send hazardous or toxic substances or wastes for treatment, recycling, or disposal. 

We do not believe we have any material environmental liabilities or that compliance with environmental laws, ordinances, and regulations will, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. However, soil and groundwater contamination has been known to exist at certain properties owned or leased by us. We have also been required and may in the future be required to remove aboveground and underground storage tanks containing hazardous substances or wastes. As to certain of our properties, specific releases of petroleum have been or are in the process of being remedied in accordance with state and federal guidelines. We are monitoring the soil and groundwater as required by applicable state and federal guidelines. In addition, the shareholders of the acquired dealers have indemnified us for specific environmental issues identified on environmental site assessments performed by us as part of the acquisitions. We maintain insurance for pollutant cleanup and removal. The coverage pays for the expenses to extract pollutants from land or water at the insured property, if the discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release, or escape of the pollutants is caused by or results from a covered cause of loss. We also have additional storage tank liability insurance and &#8220;Superfund&#8221; coverage where applicable. In addition, certain of our retail locations are located on waterways that are subject to federal or state laws regulating navigable waters (including oil pollution prevention), fish and wildlife, and other matters.

Three of the properties we own were historically used as gasoline service stations. Remedial action with respect to prior historical site activities on these properties has been completed in accordance with federal and state law. We, however, do not believe that these environmental issues will result in any material liabilities to us.

Additionally, certain states have required or are considering requiring a license in order to operate a recreational boat. While such licensing requirements are not expected to be unduly restrictive, regulations may discourage potential first-time buyers, thereby limiting future sales, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Product Liability

The products we sell or service may expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or property damage claims relating to the use of those products. Historically, the resolution of product liability claims has not materially affected our business. Our manufacturers generally maintain product liability insurance, and we maintain third-party product liability insurance, which we believe to be adequate. However, we may experience legal claims in excess of our insurance coverage, and those claims may not be covered by insurance. Furthermore, any significant claims against us could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and result in negative publicity. Excessive insurance claims also could result in increased insurance premiums.

Competition

We operate in a highly competitive environment. In addition to facing competition generally from recreation businesses seeking to attract consumers&#8217; leisure time and discretionary spending dollars, the recreational boat industry itself is highly fragmented, resulting in intense competition for customers, quality products, boat show space, and suitable retail locations. We rely to a certain extent on boat shows to generate sales. Our inability to participate in boat shows in our existing or targeted markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We compete primarily with single-location boat dealers and, with respect to sales of marine equipment, parts, and accessories, with national specialty marine stores, catalog retailers, sporting goods stores, and mass merchants. Competition among boat dealers is generally based on the quality of available products, the price and value of the products, and attention to customer service. There is significant competition both within markets we currently serve and in new markets that we may enter. We compete in each of our markets with retailers of brands of boats and engines we do not sell in that market. In addition, several of our competitors, especially those selling boating accessories, are large national or regional chains that have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. However, we believe that our integrated corporate infrastructure and marketing and sales capabilities, our cost structure, and our nationwide presence enable us to compete effectively against these companies. Private sales of used boats represent an additional significant source of competition.
