 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General 

RCM Technologies, Inc. is a premier provider of business and technology solutions designed to enhance and maximize the operational performance of its customers through the adaptation and deployment of advanced engineering and information technology services. RCM is also a provider of specialty health care services to major health care institutions and educational facilities. RCM has been an innovative leader in the design, development, and delivery of these services to commercial and government sectors for over 40 years. Over the years, the Company has developed and assembled an attractive, diverse and extensive portfolio of capabilities, service offerings and delivery options, established a proven record of performance and credibility, and built an efficient pricing structure. This combination offers clients a compelling value proposition with the potential to substantially accelerate the successful attainment of their business objectives . 

RCM consists of three operating segments: Engineering, Information Technology and Specialty Health Care Services. RCM&#8217;s Engineering segment provides engineering and design, engineering analysis, technical writing and technical support services, Engineer, Procure and Construction Management (&#8220;EPC&#8221;) as well as Demand Side Management/Energy Conservation Services. The Company&#8217;s Information Technology, or IT, segment provides enterprise business solutions, application services, infrastructure solutions, competitive advantage &#38; productivity solutions, life sciences solutions and other selected vertical market specific offerings. The Company&#8217;s Specialty Health Care Services segment provides the staffing of health care professionals, primarily therapists, nurses and care givers. 

The Company services some of the largest national and international companies in North America as well as a lengthy roster of Fortune 1000 and mid-sized businesses in such industries as Aerospace/Defense, Energy, Financial Services, Life Sciences, Manufacturing &#38; Distribution, the Public Sector and Technology. RCM believes it offers a range of solutions that fosters long-term client relationships, affords cross-selling opportunities, and minimizes the Company&#8217;s dependence on any single technology or industry sector. RCM sells and delivers its services through a network of 29 offices in selected regions throughout North America. 

The Company is a Nevada corporation organized in 1971. The address of its principal executive office is 2500 McClellan Avenue, Suite 350, Pennsauken, NJ 08109-4613. 

During the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016, approximately 43.4% of RCM&#8217;s total revenues were derived from Engineering services, 31.7% from IT services, and the remaining 24.9% from Specialty Health Care services. 

Demand for the Company&#8217;s services and spending by its customers can be significantly impacted by changes in the general level of economic activity, particularly technology spending. During periods of reduced economic activity, such as the environment in the United States and the world in general that followed the economic dislocations that commenced in mid-2007, the Company may also be subject to increased pricing pressure in its markets due to reduced spending by clients and potential clients of the Company. Extended periods of weakness in the economy can have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business and results of operations. 

Industry Overview 

Businesses today face intense competition, the challenge of constant technological change and the ongoing need for business process optimization. To address these issues and to compete more effectively, companies are continually evaluating the need for implementing innovative solutions to upgrade their systems, applications and processes. As a result, the ability of an organization to integrate and align advanced technologies with new business objectives is critical. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) 

Industry Overview (Continued) 

Although most companies recognize the importance of optimizing their systems, applications and processes to compete in today&#8217;s challenging environment, the process of designing, developing and implementing business and technology solutions is becoming increasingly complex. The Company believes that many businesses are focused on return on investment analysis in prioritizing their initiatives. The Company believes that as a consequence, over the past few years, companies have elected to defer, redefine or cancel investments in new systems, software, and solutions and have focused on making extended and more effective use of previous technological investments. 

On the other hand, the current economic environment challenges many companies to integrate and manage computing environments consisting of multiple computing platforms, operating systems, databases and networking protocols and off-the-shelf software applications to support business objectives. Companies also need to keep pace with new technology developments, which often rapidly render existing equipment and internal skills obsolete. At the same time, external economic factors have caused many organizations to focus on core competencies and trim workforces in the IT management area. Accordingly, these organizations often lack the quantity, quality and variety of IT skills necessary to design and support IT solutions. IT managers are charged with supporting increasingly complex systems and applications of significant strategic value, while working under budgetary, personnel and expertise constraints within their own organizations. 

The Company&#8217;s Engineering group continues to focus on areas of growth within the energy, aerospace and commercial building industries. In recent years, many businesses have been adversely impacted by oil prices and other energy-related costs and developments, and for that and various other reasons, there has been growing sentiment around the world for the development of alternative sources of energy, including a renewed interest in nuclear power. 

The Company believes its target market for IT services is among middle-market companies, which typically lack the time and technical resources to satisfy all of their IT needs internally. These companies commonly require sophisticated, experienced IT assistance to achieve their business objectives and often rely on IT service providers to help implement and manage their systems. However, many middle-market companies rely on multiple providers for their IT needs. Generally, the Company believes that this reliance on multiple providers results from the fact that larger IT service providers do not target these companies, while smaller IT service providers, which do target these companies, lack sufficient breadth of services or industry knowledge to satisfy all of these companies' needs. The Company believes this reliance on multiple service providers creates multiple relationships that are more difficult and less cost-effective to manage than a single relationship and can adversely influence the quality and compatibility of IT solutions. RCM is structured to provide middle-market companies a single source for their IT needs. 

In the health care services industry, a shortage of nurses and other medical personnel in the United States has led to increases in business activity for health care service companies, including the Company&#8217;s Specialty Health Care Services group. Due in part to an aging population and improved medical technology, the demand for selected health care professionals is expected to continue over the next several years. 

Business Strategy 

RCM is dedicated to providing solutions to meet its clients&#8217; business needs by delivering engineering and information technology services. The Company&#8217;s objective is to remain a recognized leader of specialized professional consulting services and solutions in major markets throughout North America. The Company adapts operating strategies to achieve this objective. The following is a discussion of the key elements of its growth and operating strategies: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) 

Growth Strategy 

Promote Full Life Cycle Solution Capability 

The Company promotes a full life cycle solution capability to its customers. The goal of the full life cycle solution strategy is to fully address a client&#8217;s project implementation cycle at each stage of its development and deployment. This entails the Company working with its clients from the initial conceptualization of a project through its design and project execution, and extending into ongoing management and support of the delivered product. RCM&#8217;s strategy is to build projects and solutions offerings selectively, utilizing its extensive resource base. 

The Company believes that the effective execution of this strategy will generate improved margins on its existing resources. The completion of this service-offering continuum is intended to afford the Company the opportunity to strengthen long-term client relationships that will further contribute to a more predictable revenue stream. 

In addition to a full life cycle solution offering, the Company continues to focus on transitioning into higher value oriented services in an effort to increase its margins on its various service lines and generate revenue that is more sustainable. The Company believes this transition is accomplished by pursuing additional vertical market specific solutions in conjunction or combination with longer-term based solutions, through expansion of its client relationships and by pursuing strategic alliances and partnerships. 

Achieve Internal Growth 

The Company continues to promote its internal growth strategies which it designed to better serve the Company&#8217;s customers, generate higher revenue and achieve greater operating efficiencies. Business units are collaborating on penetrating and servicing accounts as sales teams are increasing their activity levels. This enables clients to be supported by specialists in their areas of need while RCM productivity increases. 

RCM provides an orientation program in which sales managers and professionals receive relevant information about Company operations. 

RCM has adopted an industry-centric approach to sales and marketing. This initiative contemplates that clients within the same industry sectors tend to have common business challenges. It therefore allows the Company to present and deliver enhanced value to those clients in the vertical markets in which RCM has assembled the greatest work experience. RCM&#8217;s consultants continue to acquire project experience that offers differentiated awareness of the business challenges that clients in that industry are facing. This alignment also facilitates and creates additional cross-selling opportunities. The Company believes this strategy will lead to greater account penetration and enhanced client relationships. 

Operational strategies contributing to RCM&#8217;s internal productivity include the delineation of certain new solutions practice areas in markets where its clients had historically known the Company as a contract service provider. The formation of these practice areas should facilitate the flow of project opportunities and the delivery of project-based solutions. 

Pursue Selective Strategic Acquisitions 

The industry in which the Company operates continues to be highly fragmented, and the Company plans to continue to selectively assess opportunities to make strategic acquisitions as such opportunities are presented to the Company. The Company's acquisition strategy is designed to broaden the scope of services and technical competencies and grow its full life cycle solution capabilities. In considering acquisition opportunities, the Company focuses principally on companies with (i) technologies or market segments RCM has targeted for strategic value enhancement, (ii) margins that are accretive to existing margins, (iii) experienced management personnel, (iv) substantial growth prospects and (v) sellers who desire to join the Company&#8217;s management team. To retain and provide incentives for management of its acquired companies, the Company has generally structured a significant portion of the acquisition price in the form of multi-tiered consideration based on growth of operating profitability of the acquired company over a two to four year period. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) 

Operating Strategy 

Develop and Maintain Strong Customer Relationships 

The Company seeks to develop and maintain strong interactive customer relationships by anticipating and focusing on its customers&#8217; needs. The Company emphasizes a relationship-oriented approach to business, rather than the transaction or assignment-oriented approach that the Company believes is used by many of its competitors. This industry-centric strategy is designed to allow RCM to expand further its relationships with clients in RCM&#8217;s targeted sectors. 

To develop close customer relationships, the Company&#8217;s practice managers and/or sales people regularly meet with both existing and prospective clients to identify areas of need and help design solutions and identify the resources needed to execute their strategies. The Company&#8217;s managers also maintain close communications with their customers during each project and on an ongoing basis after its completion. The Company believes that this relationship-oriented approach can result in greater customer satisfaction. Additionally, the Company believes that by collaborating with its customers in designing business solutions, it can generate new opportunities to cross-sell additional services that the Company has to offer. The Company focuses on providing customers with qualified individuals or teams of experts compatible with the business needs of its customers and makes a concerted effort to follow the progress of such relationships to ensure their continued success. 

Attract and Retain Highly Qualified Consultants and Technical Resources 

The Company believes it has been successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified consultants and contractors by (i) providing stimulating and challenging work assignments, (ii) offering competitive wages, (iii) effectively communicating with its candidates, (iv) providing selective training to maintain and upgrade skills and (v) aligning the needs of its customers with appropriately skilled personnel. The Company believes it has been successful in retaining these personnel due in part to its use of practice managers who are dedicated to maintaining contact with, and monitoring the satisfaction levels of, the Company&#8217;s consultants and contractors while they are on assignment. 

Centralize Administrative Functions 

The Company continues to improve its operational efficiencies by integrating general and administrative functions at the corporate or regional level, and reducing or eliminating redundant functions formerly performed at smaller branch offices. This enables the Company to realize savings and synergies and to control and monitor its operations efficiently, as well as to quickly integrate new acquisitions. It also allows local branches to focus more on growing their local operations. 

To accomplish this, the Company&#8217;s financial reporting and accounting systems are centralized in the Company&#8217;s operational headquarters in Parsippany, NJ. The systems have been configured to perform all back office functions, including payroll, project management, project cost accounting, billing, human resource administration and financial reporting and consolidation. The Company anticipates a comprehensive review of its financial reporting and accounting system platform in fiscal 2016. The Company utilizes third-party software for its financial reporting and accounting system which was implemented in 1999 and has not undergone significant upgrades since its initial implementation. The Company believes that it will become necessary to upgrade or replace its third-party financial reporting and accounting system. The Company has not determined when this contemplated replacement may be necessary but it could be as early as late fiscal 2016. The Company estimates this upgrade or replacement of the third-party system will cost somewhere between $1.0 million and $2.0 million. These estimates are subject to change. 

&#160;

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) 

Engineering 

The Company&#8217;s Engineering segment consists of four business units &#8211; Engineering Services and Projects, Power Systems Services USA and Power Systems Services Canada and Facilities Design and Construction. The Engineering Services and Projects unit includes Aerospace, Manufacturing and Industrial Engineering divisions. The Power Systems units focus primarily on the nuclear power, fossil fuel, transmission and distribution and electric utility industries. 

RCM provides a full range of Engineering services including Engineering &#38; Design, Engineering Analysis, Engineer-Procure-Construct, Configuration Management, Hardware/Software Validation &#38; Verification, Quality Assurance, Technical Writing &#38; Publications, Manufacturing Process Planning &#38; Improvement, Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM), Component &#38; Equipment Testing and Risk Management Engineering. Engineering services are provided at the site of the client or, less frequently, at the Company&#8217;s own facilities. 

The Company believes that the deregulation of the utilities industry and the aging of nuclear power plants offer the Company an opportunity to capture a greater share of professional services and project management requirements of the utilities industry both in engineering services and through cross-selling of its information technology services. Heightened competition, deregulation and rapid technological advances are forcing the utilities industry to make fundamental changes in its business process. These pressures have compelled the utilities industry to focus on internal operations and maintenance activities and to increasingly outsource their design and engineering modification requirements. Additionally, the Company believes that competitive performance demands from deregulation should increase the importance of information technology to this industry. The Company believes that its expertise and strong relationships with certain customers within the utilities industry position the Company to be a leading provider of professional services to the utilities industry. 

RCM provides a wide array of turnkey energy management services offering clients/customers opportunities for demand side management from concept to turnover. Deploying advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) systems is the catalyst and benchmarking tool necessary for today&#8217;s cost effective, energy efficient and sustainable programs. 

The Company provides its engineering services through a number of delivery methods. These include managed tasks and resources, complete project services, outsourcing, both on and off-site, and a full complement of resourcing alternatives. 

As of January 2, 2016, the Company assigned approximately 610 engineering and technical personnel to its customers.

Branch offices are primarily located in markets that the Company believes have strong growth prospects for the Company&#8217;s services. The Company&#8217;s branches are operated in a decentralized, entrepreneurial manner with most branch offices operating as independent profit centers. The Company&#8217;s branch managers are given significant autonomy in the daily operations of their respective offices and, with respect to such offices, are responsible for overall guidance and supervision, budgeting and forecasting, sales and marketing strategies, pricing, hiring and training. Branch managers are paid on a performance-based compensation system designed to motivate the managers to maximize growth and profitability.

The Company believes that substantial portions of the buying decisions made by users of the Company&#8217;s services are made on a local or regional basis and that the Company&#8217;s branch offices most often compete with local and regional providers. Since the Company&#8217;s branch managers are in the best position to understand their local markets and customers often prefer local providers, the Company believes that a decentralized operating environment enhances operating performance and contributes to employee and customer satisfaction. 

From its headquarters locations in New Jersey, the Company provides its branch offices with centralized administrative, marketing, finance, MIS, human resources and legal support. Centralized administrative functions minimize the administrative burdens on branch office managers and allow them to spend more time focusing on sales and marketing and practice development activities. 

The Company&#8217;s principal sales offices typically have one general manager, one sales manager, three to six sales people, several technical delivery or practice managers and several recruiters. The general managers report to regional vice presidents who are responsible for ensuring that performance goals are achieved. The Company&#8217;s regional vice presidents meet frequently to discuss &#8220;best practices&#8221; and ways to increase the Company&#8217;s cross selling of its professional services. The Company&#8217;s practice managers meet periodically to strategize, maintain continuity, and identify developmental needs and cross-selling opportunities. 

Sales and Marketing 

Sales and marketing efforts are conducted at the local and national level through the Company&#8217;s network of branch offices. Sales activities and productivity are tracked and rankings established and published. Sales between business units is recognized and financially encouraged. The Company emphasizes long-term personal relationships with customers that are developed through regular assessment of customer requirements and proactive monitoring of service performance. The Company&#8217;s sales personnel make regular visits to existing and prospective customers. New customers are obtained through active sales programs and referrals. The Company encourages its employees to participate in national and regional trade associations, local chambers of commerce and other civic associations. The Company seeks to develop strategic partnering relationships with its customers by providing comprehensive solutions for all aspects of a customer&#8217;s engineering, information technology and other professional services needs. The Company concentrates on providing carefully screened professionals with the appropriate skills in a timely manner and at competitive prices. The Company regularly monitors the quality of the services provided by its personnel and obtains feedback from its customers as to their satisfaction with the services provided. 

The Company has elevated the importance of working with and developing its partner alliances with technology firms. Partner programs are in place with firms RCM has identified as strategically important to the completeness of the service offering of the Company. Relations have been established with firms such as ADP, IBM, Mercury, Microsoft and Oracle among others. The partner programs may be managed either at a national level from RCM&#8217;s corporate offices or at a regional level from its branch offices.

Sales and Marketing (Continued) 

The Company&#8217;s larger recognizable customers include 3M, ADP, Amgen, Atrium Medical, Bimbo Bakeries, Black and McDonald, Bruce Power Limited Partnership (&#8220;Bruce Power&#8221;), Bruckner Supply Company, Chicago Public Schools, Chrysler Corporation, Con Edison, Covanta, CR Bard, Entergy, Exelon Nuclear, FlightSafety International, Hamilton Sundstrand, Hawaii Department of Education, Hawaii State Hospital, Johnson and Johnson, Lilly del Caribe, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, New York City Board of Education, New York Power Authority, Novartis, Ontario Power Generation, Pfizer, Pragmatics, Pratt and Whitney, PSE&#38;G, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Ryder, Sikorsky Aircraft, United Health Group, United Technologies Corporation, Verizon, Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power and Zimmer Holdings, Inc. The Company serves Fortune 1000 companies and many middle market clients. The Company&#8217;s relationships with these customers are typically formed at the customers&#8217; local or regional level and from time to time, when appropriate, at the corporate level for national accounts. 

During the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016, no client accounted for 10% or more of the Company&#8217;s revenues. The Company&#8217;s five, ten and twenty largest customers accounted for approximately 33.7%, 48.3% and 60.5%, respectively, of the Company&#8217;s revenues for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2016. 

Recruiting and Training 

The Company devotes a significant amount of time and resources, primarily at the branch level, to locating, training and retaining its professional personnel. Full-time recruiters utilize the Company&#8217;s proprietary databases of available personnel, which are cross-indexed by competency and skill to match potential candidates with the specific project requirements of the customer. The qualified personnel in the databases are identified through numerous channels, including networking, referrals, trade shows, job fairs, schools, newspaper and trade journal advertising, Internet recruiting services and the Company&#8217;s website. 

The Company believes that a significant element of the Company&#8217;s success in retaining qualified consultants and contract personnel is the Company&#8217;s use of consultant relationship managers and technical practice managers. Consultant relationship managers are qualified Company personnel dedicated to maintaining on-site contact with, and monitoring the satisfaction levels of, the Company&#8217;s consultants and contract personnel while they are on assignment. Practice managers are consulting managers responsible for the technical development and career development of the Company&#8217;s technical personnel within the defined practice areas. The Company provides technical training and skills development through vendor-sponsored courses, computer-based training tools and on the job mentoring programs. 

Information Systems 

RCM has continued to engage in strategic initiatives to improve upon its ability to secure data, deliver services and improve on its communication infrastructure. 

RCM has partnered with several internationally recognized vendors to deploy their business solutions internally, with systems designed to provide centralized management and a supported network. 

RCM has upgraded its perimeter network and WAN architecture throughout the U.S. and Canada to a secure centralized model. The hub datacenter at its operational headquarters has been outfitted with redundant fiber circuits, and redundant firewalls, routers and switching architecture protects against hardware failure. Access to the network is restricted for security reasons. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) 

Information Systems (Continued) 

The Company has enhanced its ERP hardware, Application and Operating system to accommodate its growing needs. The branch offices of the Company are networked to the corporate offices via private circuits, which enable the ERP application to be accessed securely at all operational locations. The ERP system supports Company-wide operations such as payroll, billing, human resources, project systems, accounts receivable, accounts payable, all general ledger accounting, budgeting and consolidation reporting functionality. The Company believes that it will become necessary to upgrade or replace its financial reporting and accounting system. The Company has not determined when this contemplated replacement may be necessary but it could be as early as late fiscal 2016. The Company estimates this upgrade or replacement of its ERP system will cost somewhere between $1.0 million and $2.0 million. These estimates are subject to change. 

The Company&#8217;s internet presence is an integral part of its strategic initiative to improve visibility and contextualize its business offerings. The company&#8217;s website has been revised, making the site more interactive, with improved web analytics. 

The Company uses an application service provider (ASP) solution for sourcing candidates and fulfilling client requirements. The integrated solution allows RCM to track all client requirements on an enterprise level. RCM recruiters are able to search multiple sources (e.g. job boards) to identify and match suitable candidates for an opportunity or need, and to build and maintain a proprietary database of prequalified candidates, thereby enhancing our ability to respond quickly to client demands. Customized reporting and query capabilities allow RCM management to monitor personnel performance and client responsiveness. All data and information is accessible via a web portal. 

In the interest of consolidation and being green, RCM is currently deploying sophisticated virtualization technology. The server footprint at the primary datacenter in Parsippany, NJ has been reduced by 90% without compromising systems integrity or redundancy. Implementation of V-motion, fault tolerance, high availability and centralized management are an integral part of this solution. Green initiatives include partnerships with vendors for the recycling of used printers, toners, servers, desktops and mobile devices. 

Other Information 

Safeguards - Business, Disaster and Contingency Planning 

RCM has implemented a number of safeguards to protect the Company from various system-related risks including Redundant Telecommunications and server systems architecture, multi-tiered server and desktop backup infrastructure, and data center physical and environmental controls. In addition, RCM has developed disaster recovery / business continuity procedures for all offices. 

Given the significant amount of data generated in the Company&#8217;s key processes including recruiting, sales, payroll and customer invoicing, RCM has established redundant procedures, functioning on a daily basis, within the Company&#8217;s primary data center. This redundancy should mitigate the risks related to hardware, application and data loss by utilizing the concept of live differential backups of servers and desktops to Storage Area Network (SAN) devices on its backup LAN, culminating in offsite tape storage at an independent facility. Controls within the data center environment ensure that all systems are proactively monitored and data is properly archived. 

Additionally, RCM has contracted and brokered strategic relationships with third-party vendors to meet its recovery objectives in the event of a system disruption. For example, comprehensive service level agreements for RCM&#8217;s data circuits and network devices guarantee minimal outages as well as network redundancy and scalability. 

&#160;

&#160;

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED) 

Other Information (Continued) 

The Company&#8217;s ability to protect its data assets against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, and facility violations is critical. To address potential cyber security threats, the Company uses a third-party mail management service to filter all emails destined for the RCMT domain before being delivered to the corporate mail servers. The service has also been deployed to safeguard the enterprise from malicious internet content. The deployment of virus, spam, and patch management controls extends from the perimeter network to all desktops and is centrally monitored and managed. In addition to the virus and malware controls, an Intrusion Protection System (IPS) monitors and alerts on changes in network traffic patterns as well as known hostile signatures. 

The Company maintains a disaster recovery plan that outlines the recovery time / point objectives (RTO / RPO), organization structure, roles and procedures, including site addendum disaster plans for all of its key operating offices. Corporate IT personnel regulate the maintenance and integrity of backed-up data throughout the Company. 

The Parsippany Datacenter moved in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 to a third-party Internet Data Center (&#8220;IDC&#8221;). The IDC provides RCM with a robust data center environment with redundant HVAC, commercial power feeds, ten 2000kW diesel generator sets with five 10,000 gallon above ground fuel oil storage tanks to provide standby power and dry pipe fire suppression. In addition the IDC provides 24x7 security staffing, closed-circuit monitors, secure-card key access, biometrics scanners, man traps, and alarmed doors. 

Competition 

The market for engineering and IT services is highly competitive and is subject to rapid change. As the market demand has shifted, many software companies have adopted tactics to pursue services and consulting offerings making them direct competitors when in the past they may have been alliance partners. Primary competitors include participants from a variety of market segments, including publicly and privately held firms, systems consulting and implementation firms, application software firms, service groups of computer equipment companies, facilities management companies, general management consulting firms and staffing companies. In addition, the Company competes with its clients&#8217; internal resources, particularly where these resources represent a fixed cost to the client. Such competition may impose additional pricing pressures on the Company. 

The Company believes its principal competitive advantages in the engineering and IT services market include: strong relationships with existing clients, a long-term track record with over 1,000 clients, a broad range of services, technical expertise, knowledge and experience in multiple industry sectors, quality and flexibility of service, responsiveness to client needs and speed in delivering IT solutions. 

Additionally, the Company competes for suitable acquisition candidates based on its differentiated acquisition model, its entrepreneurial and decentralized operating philosophy, and its strong corporate-level support and resources.

Seasonality 

The Company&#8217;s operating results can be affected by the seasonal fluctuations in client expenditures. Expenditures in the Engineering and Information Technology segments can be negatively impacted during the first quarter of the year when clients are finalizing their budgets. Quarterly results generally fluctuate depending on, among other things, the number of billing days in a quarter and the seasonality of clients&#8217; businesses. The business is also affected by the timing of holidays and seasonal vacation patterns, generally resulting in lower revenues and gross profit in the fourth quarter of each year, not considering any non-seasonal impact. Extreme weather conditions may also affect demand in the first and fourth quarters of the year as certain clients&#8217; facilities are located in geographic areas subject to closure or reduced hours due to inclement weather. The Company generally experiences an increase in its cost of sales and a corresponding decrease in gross profit and gross margin percentage in the first and second fiscal quarters of each year as a result of resetting certain state and federal employment tax rates and related salary limitations. Also, the Company&#8217;s Specialty Health Care segment typically experiences a significant decline in revenues due to the substantial closure of one of its largest customers, the New York City Department of Education, and other educational institution clients during the third quarter due to their summer recess.
