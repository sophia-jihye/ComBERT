 Items 1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES 

Business Activities 

Adams Resources &#38; Energy, Inc. (&#8223;ARE&#8221;), a Delaware corporation organized in 1973, and its subsidiaries (collectively, the &#8223;Company&#8221;), are engaged in the business of crude oil marketing, tank truck transportation of liquid chemicals, and oil and gas exploration and production. The Company&#8217;s headquarters are located in 27,932 square feet of office space located at 17 South Briar Hollow Lane Suite 100, Houston, Texas 77027 and the telephone number of that address is (713) 881-3600. The revenues, operating results and identifiable assets of each industry segment for the three years ended December 31, 2015 are set forth in Note (8) to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere herein. 

Marketing Segment Subsidiary 

Gulfmark Energy, Inc. (&#8223;Gulfmark&#8221;), a subsidiary of ARE, purchases crude oil and arranges sales and deliveries to refiners and other customers. Activity is concentrated primarily onshore in Texas and Louisiana with additional operations in Michigan and North Dakota. Gulfmark operates 207 tractor-trailer rigs and maintains over 120 pipeline inventory locations or injection stations. Gulfmark has the ability to barge oil from four oil storage facilities along the intercoastal waterway of Texas and Louisiana and maintains 400,000 barrels of storage capacity at the dock facilities in order to access waterborne markets for its products. During 2015, Gulfmark purchased approximately 106,400 barrels per day of crude oil at the field (wellhead) level. Gulfmark delivers physical supplies to refiner customers or enters into commodity exchange transactions when the cost to exchange is less than the alternate cost to transport or store the crude oil. During 2015, Gulfmark had sales to two customers that comprised 24.4 percent and 13.8 percent, respectively, of total Company wide revenues. Management believes alternative market outlets for its commodity sales are readily available and a loss of any of these customers would not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s operations. See discussion under &#8223;Concentration of Credit Risk&#8221; in Note (3) to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Operating results for the marketing segment are sensitive to a number of factors. Such factors include commodity location, grades of product, individual customer demand for grades or location of product, localized market price structures, availability of transportation facilities, actual delivery volumes that vary from expected quantities, and the timing and costs to deliver the commodity to the customer. 

Transportation Segment Subsidiary 

Service Transport Company (&#8223;STC&#8221;), a subsidiary of ARE, transports liquid chemicals on a &#8223;for hire&#8221; basis throughout the continental United States and Canada. Transportation service is provided to over 400 customers under multiple load contracts in addition to loads covered under STC&#8217;s standard price list. Pursuant to regulatory requirements, STC holds a Hazardous Materials Certificate of Registration issued by the United States Department of Transportation (&#8223;DOT&#8221;). STC operates 324 truck tractors of which 293 are Company owned with 31 independent owner-operator units. The Company also owns and operates 580 tank trailers. In addition, STC operates truck terminals in Houston, Corpus Christi, and Nederland, Texas as well as Baton Rouge (St. Gabriel), Louisiana, St. Rose, Louisiana and Mobile (Saraland), Alabama. Transportation operations are headquartered at a terminal facility situated on 26.5 Company-owned acres in Houston, Texas. This property includes maintenance facilities, an office building, tank wash rack facilities and a water treatment system. The St. Gabriel, Louisiana terminal is situated on 11.5 Company-owned acres and includes an office building, maintenance bays and tank cleaning facilities. 

STC is compliant with International Organization for Standardization (&#8223;ISO&#8221;) 9001:2000 Standard. The scope of this Quality System Certificate covers the carriage of bulk liquids throughout STC&#8217;s area of operations as well as the tank trailer cleaning facilities and equipment maintenance. STC&#8217;s quality management process is one of its major assets. The practice of using statistical process control covering safety, on-time performance and customer satisfaction aids continuous improvement in all areas of quality service. In addition to its ISO 9001:2000 practices, the American Chemistry Council recognizes STC as a Responsible Care &#211; Partner. Responsible Care Partners serve the chemical industry and implement and monitor the seven Codes of Management Practices. The seven codes address compliance and continuing improvement in (1) Community Awareness and Emergency Response, (2) Pollution Prevention, (3) Process Safety, (4) Distribution, (5) Employee Health and Safety, (6) Product Stewardship, and (7) Security. 

Oil and Gas Segment Subsidiary 

Adams Resources Exploration Corporation (&#8223;AREC&#8221;), a subsidiary of ARE, is actively engaged in the exploration and development of domestic oil and natural gas properties primarily in Texas and the south central region of the United States. AREC&#8217;s offices are maintained in Houston and the Company holds an interest in 513 producing wells of which 26 are Company operated. 

Producing Wells--The following table sets forth the Company&#8217;s gross and net productive wells as of December 31, 2015. Gross wells are the total number of wells in which the Company has an interest, while net wells are the sum of the fractional interests owned.

&#160; &#160; 4,835 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5,611 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6,286 &#160; Future net cash flows before income taxes 

&#160; $ 8,413 &#160; &#160; $ 41,396 &#160; &#160; $ 45,169 &#160; Standardized measure of oil and gas reserves 

&#160; $ 3,527 &#160; &#160; $ 15,744 &#160; &#160; $ 17,836 &#160; 

The estimated value of oil and natural gas reserves and future net revenues derived therefrom are highly dependent upon oil and gas commodity price assumptions. In such estimates, the Company&#8217;s independent petroleum engineers assumed market prices as presented in the table below (in thousands): 

&#160; &#160; 2015 

&#160; &#160; 2014 

&#160; &#160; 2013 

&#160; Assumed market price 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Crude oil per barrel 

&#160; $ 45.83 &#160; &#160; $ 89.60 &#160; &#160; $ 94.99 &#160; Natural gas per thousand cubic feet (mcf) 

&#160; $ 2.62 &#160; &#160; $ 5.42 &#160; &#160; $ 4.69 &#160; 

Such prices were based on the unweighted arithmetic average of the prices in effect on the first day of the month for each month of the respective twelve month periods as required by SEC regulations. The prices reported in the reserve disclosures for natural gas include the value of associated natural gas liquids. Oil and gas reserve values and future net cash flow estimates are very sensitive to pricing assumptions and will vary accordingly. 

Reserve estimates are based on many subjective factors. The accuracy of these estimates depends on the quantity and quality of geological data, production performance data, reservoir engineering data, the pricing assumptions utilized as well as the skill and judgment of petroleum engineers in interpreting such data. The process of estimating reserves requires frequent revision as additional information is made available through drilling, testing, reservoir studies and acquiring historical pressure and production data. In addition, the discounted present value of estimated future net revenues should not be construed as the fair market value of oil and natural gas producing properties. Such reserve valuations do not necessarily portray a realistic assessment of current value or future performance of such properties. These calculations are based on estimates as to the timing of oil and natural gas production, and there is no assurance that the actual timing of production will conform to or approximate such calculations. Also, certain assumptions have been made with respect to pricing. The estimates assume prices will remain constant from the date of the engineer&#8217;s assessment, except for changes reflected under natural gas sales contracts. There can be no assurance that actual future prices will not vary as industry conditions, governmental regulation and other factors impact the market price for oil and natural gas. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s net oil and natural gas production for the three years ended December 31, 2015 was as follows:

Railroad Commission of Texas (&#8223;RRC&#8221;) --The RRC regulates, among other things, the drilling and operation of oil and natural gas wells, the operation of oil and gas pipelines, the disposal of oil and natural gas production wastes, and certain storage of unrefined oil and gas. RRC regulations govern the generation, management and disposal of waste from such oil and natural gas operations and provide for the clean up of contamination from oil and natural gas operations. 

Louisiana Office of Conservation --This agency has primary statutory responsibility for regulation and conservation of oil, gas, and other natural resources in the State of Louisiana. Their objectives are to (i) regulate the exploration and production of oil, natural gas and other hydrocarbons, (ii) control and allocate energy supplies and distribution thereof, and (iii) protect public safety and the environment from oilfield waste, including the regulation of underground injection and disposal practices. 

State and Local Government Regulation --Many states are authorized by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (&#8223;EPA&#8221;) to enforce regulations promulgated under various federal statutes. In addition, there are numerous other state and local authorities that regulate the environment, some of which impose more stringent environmental standards than federal laws and regulations. The penalties for violations of state law vary, but typically include injunctive relief and recovery of damages for injury to air, water or property as well as fines for non-compliance. 

Oil and Gas Operations --The Company&#8217;s oil and gas drilling and production activities are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental quality and pollution control. One aspect of the Company&#8217;s oil and gas operation is the disposal of used drilling fluids, saltwater, and crude oil sediments. In addition, low-level naturally occurring radiation may, at times, occur with the production of crude oil and natural gas. The Company&#8217;s policy is to comply with environmental regulations and industry standards. Environmental compliance has become more stringent and the Company, from time to time, may be required to remediate past practices. Management believes that such required remediation in the future, if any, will not have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s financial position or results of operations. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

All states in which the Company owns producing oil and gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas. Regulations typically require permits for the drilling of wells and regulate the spacing of wells, the prevention of waste, protection of correlative rights, the rate of production, prevention and clean-up of pollution, and other matters. 

Trucking Activities --The Company&#8217;s marketing and transportation businesses operate truck fleets pursuant to authority of the DOT and various state authorities. Trucking operations must be conducted in accordance with various laws relating to pollution and environmental control as well as safety requirements prescribed by states and the DOT. Matters such as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations. These regulations also require mandatory drug testing of drivers and require certain tests for alcohol levels in drivers and other safety personnel. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes such as increasingly stringent environmental requirements or limits on vehicle weight and size. Regulatory change may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for private and common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services. In addition, the Company&#8217;s tank wash facilities are subject to increasingly stringent local, state and federal environmental regulations. 

The Company has implemented security procedures for drivers and terminal facilities. Satellite tracking transponders installed in the power units are used to communicate emergencies to the Company and to maintain constant information as to the unit&#8217;s location. If necessary, the Company&#8217;s terminal personnel will notify local law enforcement agencies. In addition, the Company is able to advise a customer of the status and location of their loads. Remote cameras and better lighting coverage in the staging and parking areas have augmented terminal security. 

Regulatory Status and Potential Environmental Liability --The operations and facilities of the Company are subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations including those described above, as well as associated permitting and licensing requirements. The Company regards compliance with applicable environmental regulations as a critical component of its overall operation, and devotes significant attention to providing quality service and products to its customers, protecting the health and safety of its employees, and protecting the Company&#8217;s facilities from damage. Management believes the Company has obtained or applied for all permits and approvals required under existing environmental laws and regulations to operate its current business. Management has reported that the Company is not subject to any pending or threatened environmental litigation or enforcement actions which could materially and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. The Company has, where appropriate, implemented operating procedures at each of its facilities designed to assure compliance with environmental laws and regulation. However, given the nature of the Company&#8217;s business, the Company is subject to environmental risks and the possibility remains that the Company&#8217;s ownership of its facilities and its operations and activities could result in civil or criminal enforcement and public as well as private actions against the Company, which may necessitate or generate mandatory clean up activities, revocation of required permits or licenses, denial of application for future permits, and/or significant fines, penalties or damages, any and all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211; Environmental liabilities and environmental regulations may have an adverse effect on the Company.&#8221; At December 31, 2015, the Company is unaware of any unresolved environmental issues for which additional accounting accruals are necessary. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015, the Company employed 809 persons, 10 of whom were employed in the exploration and production of oil and gas, 348 in the marketing of crude oil, 433 in transportation operations, and 18 in administrative capacities. None of the Company&#8217;s employees are represented by a union. Management believes its employee relations are satisfactory. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Federal and State Taxation 

The Company is subject to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8223;Code&#8221;). In accordance with the Code, the Company computes its income tax provision based on a 35 percent tax rate. The Company&#8217;s operations are, in large part, conducted within the State of Texas. Texas operations are subject to a one-half percent state tax on its revenues net of cost of goods sold as defined by the state. Oil and gas activities are also subject to state and local income, severance, property and other taxes. Management believes the Company is currently in compliance with all federal and state tax regulations. 

&#160;
