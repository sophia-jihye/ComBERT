Business Overview 

For reporting purposes, SVB Financial Group has three operating segments for which we report financial information in this report: Global Commercial Bank, SVB Private Bank and SVB Capital. 

Global Commercial Bank 

Our Global Commercial Bank segment is comprised of results primarily from our Commercial Bank, our Private Equity Division, SVB Wine, SVB Analytics and our Debt Fund Investments, each as further described below.

Our Commercial Bank products and services are provided by the Bank and its subsidiaries to commercial clients in the technology, life science/healthcare, and private equity/venture capital industries. The Bank provides solutions to the financial needs of commercial clients through credit, global treasury management, foreign exchange, global trade finance, and other services. We broadly serve clients within the U.S., as well as non-U.S. clients in key international innovation markets. 

Through our credit products and services, the Bank extends loans and other credit facilities to commercial clients. These loans may be secured by clients' assets or based on clients' cash flows. In some cases, loans may be unsecured.

Through its broker-dealer subsidiary, SVB Securities, the Bank offers clients access to investments in third party money market mutual funds and fixed-income securities. The Bank also offers investment solutions through our repurchase agreement program. 

Private Equity Division. &#32;&#32;Our Private Equity Division provides banking products and services primarily to our private equity and venture capital clients. 

SVB Wine . SVB Wine provides banking products and services to our premium wine industry clients, including vineyard development loans. 

SVB Analytics . SVB Analytics provides equity valuation services to companies and private equity/venture capital firms.

SVB Private Bank 

SVB Private Bank is the private banking division of the Bank, which provides a range of personal financial solutions for consumers. Our clients are primarily private equity/venture capital professionals and executive leaders of the innovation companies they support. We offer a customized suite of private banking services, including mortgages, home equity lines of credit, restricted stock purchase loans, capital call lines of credit, and other secured and unsecured lending. We also help our private banking clients meet their cash management needs by providing deposit account products and services, including checking, money market, certificates of deposit accounts, online banking, credit cards and other personalized banking services.

SVB Capital 

SVB Capital is the venture capital investment arm of SVB Financial Group, which focuses primarily on funds management. SVB Capital manages over $2.5 billion &#32; of funds on behalf of third party limited partner investors, and on a more limited basis, SVB &#160; Financial Group. The SVB Capital family of funds is comprised of direct venture funds that invest in companies and funds of funds that invest in other venture capital funds. SVB Capital generates income for the Company primarily through investment returns (including carried interest) and management fees. See Note 2- &#8220; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Principles of Consolidation and Presentation &#8221; &#32;of the &#8220;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; &#32;under Part II, Item &#160; 8 in this report. &#32; 

For more information about our three operating segments, including financial information and results of operations, see &#8220; Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Operating Segment Results &#8221; &#32;under Part II, Item &#160; 7 in this report, and Note 22- &#8220; Segment Reporting &#8221; &#32;of the &#8220;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; &#32;under Part II, Item &#160; 8 in this report. 

Revenue Sources 

Our total revenue is comprised of our net interest income and noninterest income. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis and noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;were $1.0 billion &#32;and $473 million , respectively. 

Net interest income is primarily income generated from interest rate differentials. The difference between the interest rates received on interest-earning assets, such as loans extended to clients and securities held in our fixed income securities portfolio, and the interest rates paid by us on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings, accounts for the major portion of our earnings. Our deposits are largely obtained from commercial clients within our technology, life science/healthcare and private equity/venture capital industry sectors. Deposits are also obtained from the premium wine industry commercial clients and from our Private Bank clients. We do not obtain deposits from conventional retail sources. 

Noninterest income is primarily income generated from our fee-based services and gains on our investments and derivative securities. We offer a wide range of fee-based financial services to our clients, including global commercial banking, private banking and other business services. Our ability to integrate and cross-sell our diverse financial services to our clients is a strength of our business model. Additionally, we hold available-for-sale, held-to-maturity, non-marketable and marketable investment securities. Subject to applicable regulatory requirements, we manage and invest in private equity/venture capital funds that invest directly in privately-held companies, as well as funds that invest in other private equity/venture capital funds. Gains on these investments are reported in our consolidated statements of income and include noncontrolling interests. We also recognize gains from warrants to acquire stock in client companies, which we obtain in connection with negotiating credit facilities and 

certain other services. See &#8220;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Noninterest Income-Gains on Investment Securities, Net&#8221; - and "-Gains on Derivative Instruments, Net" under Part II, Item 7 in this report. 

We derive substantially all of our revenue from U.S. clients. &#160; &#32;We derived less than 10 percent of our total revenues from foreign clients for each of 2015, 2014 and 2013. 

Industry Niches 

In each of the industry niches we serve, we provide services to meet the needs of our clients throughout their life cycles, beginning with the emerging, start-up stage. 

Technology and Life Science/Healthcare 

We serve a variety of clients in the technology and life science/healthcare industries. Our technology clients tend to be in the industries of: hardware (such as semiconductors, communications, data storage, and electronics); software and internet (such as infrastructure software, applications, software services, digital content and advertising technology), and energy and resource innovation ("ERI"). Because of the diverse nature of ERI products and services, for our loan-related reporting purposes, ERI-related loans are reported under our hardware and software, as applicable. Our life science/healthcare clients primarily tend to be in the industries of biotechnology, medical devices, healthcare information technology and healthcare services. A key component of our technology and life science/healthcare business strategy is to develop relationships with clients at an early stage and offer them banking services that will continue to meet their needs as they mature and expand. We serve these clients primarily through three practices: 

&#8226; 

Our SVB Accelerator &#32;practice focuses on serving our &#8220; emerging &#8221; &#32;or &#8220; early stage &#8221; &#32;clients. These clients are generally in the start-up or early stages of their life cycles. They are typically privately-held and funded by friends and family, &#8220; seed &#8221; &#32;or &#8220; angel &#8221; &#32;investors, or have gone through an initial round of venture capital financing. They are typically engaged in research and development, have little or no revenue and may have only brought a few products or services to market. SVB Accelerator clients tend to have annual revenues below $5 million, with many being pre-revenue companies. 

&#8226; 

Our SVB Growth &#32;practice serves our &#8220; mid-stage &#8221; &#32;and &#8220; late-stage &#8221; &#32;clients. These clients are in the intermediate or later stages of their life cycles and are generally privately-held, and many are dependent on venture capital for funding. Some of these clients are in the more advanced stages of their life cycles and may be publicly held or poised to become publicly held. Our SVB Growth clients generally have a solid or more established product or service offering in the market, with more meaningful or considerable revenue. They also may be expanding globally. SVB Growth clients tend to have annual revenues between $5 million and $75 million. 

&#8226; 

Our SVB Corporate Finance &#32;practice serves primarily our large corporate clients, which are more mature and established companies. These clients are generally publicly-held or large privately-held companies, have a more sophisticated product or service offering in the market, with significant revenue. They also may be expanding globally. SVB Corporate Finance clients tend to have annual revenues over $75 million. 

Private Equity/Venture Capital 

We provide financial services to clients in the private equity/venture capital community. Since our founding, we have cultivated strong relationships within the private equity/venture capital community, particularly with venture capital firms worldwide, many of which are also clients, facilitating deal flow to and from these firms. 

Premium Wine 

We are one of the leading providers of financial services to premium wine producers across the Western United States, primarily in California's Napa Valley, Sonoma County and Central Coast regions, and the Pacific Northwest. We focus on vineyards and wineries that produce grapes and premium wines. 

Competition 

The banking and financial services industry is highly competitive, and continues to evolve as a result of changes in regulation, technology, product delivery systems, and the general market and economic climate. Our competitors include other banks, debt funds, specialty and diversified financial services intermediaries and other "Fintech" disruptors that offer lending, leasing, payments, investment, foreign currency exchange, advisory and other financial products and services to our target client base. We compete with alternative lenders, such as &#8220;marketplace&#8221; lenders, peer-to-peer lenders and other non-traditional lenders that have merged in recent years. We compete with non-financial service providers, particularly payment facilitators/processors or other nonbanking technology providers in the payments industry, which may offer specialized services to our client base. In addition, we compete with hedge funds and private equity funds. The principal competitive factors in our markets include product 

offerings, service, pricing, and transaction size and structure. Given our established market position within the client segments that we serve, our continued efforts to develop products and services, and our ability to integrate and cross-sell our diverse financial services to extend the length of our relationships with our clients, we believe we compete favorably in all our markets in our core business areas. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed 2,089 &#32;full-time equivalent employees. 

Supervision and Regulation 

Our bank and bank holding company operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal and state regulatory agencies. This regulation is intended primarily for the stability of the U.S. banking system as well as the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund (the &#8220;DIF&#8221;). This regulation is not intended for the benefit of our security holders. As a bank holding company that has elected financial holding company status, SVB Financial Group is subject to primary inspection, supervision, regulation, and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the "Federal Reserve") under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;BHC Act&#8221;). The Bank, as a California state-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System, is subject to primary supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve, as well as the California Department of Business Oversight (the "DBO") - Division of Financial Institutions. In addition, and to the extent provided by law, the Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") and the DIF. Our consumer banking activities also are subject to regulation and supervision by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;). SVB Financial Group&#8217;s other non-bank subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve and other applicable federal and state regulatory agencies and self-regulatory organizations, including the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;). In addition, we are subject to regulation by certain foreign regulatory agencies in international jurisdictions where we may conduct business, including the United Kingdom, Israel, Hong Kong and China. (See &#8220;-International Regulation&#8221; below.) 

The following discussion of statutes and regulations is a summary and does not purport to be complete. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the statutes and regulations referred to in this discussion. Regulators, Congress, state legislatures and international consultative bodies continue to enact rules, laws and policies to regulate the financial services industry and public companies and to protect consumers and investors, and regulators also have substantial discretion in the interpretation of their authority. The nature of these laws and regulations and the effect of such policies on the Company&#8217;s business cannot be predicted and in some cases, may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. 

Regulation of Parent: SVB Financial 

Under the BHC Act, SVB Financial, as a bank holding company, is subject to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s regulation and its authority to, among other things: 

&#8226; 

Require periodic reports and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require in its discretion; 

&#8226; 

Require the maintenance of certain levels of capital; 

&#8226; 

Restrict the ability of bank holding companies to service debt, pay dividends or to receive dividends or other distributions from their subsidiary banks; 

&#8226; 

Require prior approval for senior executive officer and director changes under certain circumstances; 

&#8226; 

Require that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to their banks and commit resources as necessary to support their banks. A bank holding company&#8217;s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of Federal Reserve regulations or inconsistent with applicable statutory standards, or all of the foregoing; 

&#8226; 

Terminate an activity or terminate control of or liquidate or divest certain subsidiaries, affiliates or investments if the Federal Reserve believes the activity or the control of the subsidiary or affiliate constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary, or if there is a failure to maintain certain capital and management standards; 

&#8226; 

Regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt, including the authority to impose interest ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt and require prior approval to purchase or redeem our securities in certain situations; and 

&#8226; 

Approve acquisitions and mergers with banks and large financial companies and consider certain competitive, management, financial, financial stability and other factors in granting these approvals. Similar California and other state banking agency approvals may also be required. 

Bank holding companies generally are prohibited, except in certain statutorily prescribed instances including exceptions for financial holding companies, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of 5% or more of the outstanding voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or furnishing services to its subsidiaries. However, subject to prior notice or Federal Reserve approval, bank holding companies may engage in, or acquire shares of companies engaged in, activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. As a financial holding company, SVB Financial generally may engage in these nonbanking activities and certain other broader securities, insurance, merchant banking and other activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be &#8220;financial in nature&#8221; or are incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature without prior Federal Reserve approval, subject to the requirement imposed by the Dodd&#8209;Frank Act that SVB Financial must obtain prior Federal Reserve approval (subject to certain exceptions) in order to acquire a nonbanking company engaged in financial activities with more than $10 billion in consolidated assets. 

Pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (&#8220;GLBA&#8221;), in order to elect and retain financial holding company status, all depository institution subsidiaries of a bank holding company must be well-capitalized, well-managed, and, except in limited circumstances, in satisfactory compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;). In addition, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, a financial holding company, and no longer just its bank, is required to be well-capitalized and well-managed. Failure to maintain compliance with these requirements or correct any non-compliance within a specified time could lead to divestiture of subsidiary banks, require all activities to conform to those permissible for a bank holding company (as opposed to the greater range of activities permissible for a financial holding company), or subject the financial holding company to other regulatory restrictions. 

Because we are a holding company, our rights and the rights of our creditors and security holders to participate in the assets of any of our subsidiaries upon the subsidiary&#8217;s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary&#8217;s creditors, except to the extent we may ourselves be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary. In addition, there are various statutory and regulatory limitations on the extent to which the Bank can finance or otherwise transfer funds to us or to our non&#8722;bank subsidiaries, including certain investment funds to which the Bank serves as an investment adviser, whether in the form of loans or other extensions of credit, including a purchase of assets subject to an agreement to repurchase, securities investments, the borrowing or lending of securities to the extent that the transaction causes the Bank or a subsidiary to have credit exposure to the affiliate, or certain other specified types of transactions, as discussed in further detail below. Furthermore, loans and other extensions of credit by the Bank to us or any of our non&#8722;bank subsidiaries are required to be secured by specified amounts of collateral and are required to be on terms and conditions consistent with safe and sound banking practices. 

SVB Financial is also treated as a bank holding company under the California Financial Code. As such, SVB Financial and its subsidiaries are subject to periodic examination by and may be required to file reports with the DBO. 

Securities Registration and Listing 

SVB Financial&#8217;s securities are registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), and listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. As such, SVB Financial is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading, corporate governance, and other requirements and restrictions of the Exchange Act, as well as the Marketplace Rules and other requirements promulgated by the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. 

As a public company, SVB Financial is also subject to the accounting oversight and corporate governance requirements of the Sarbanes&#8722;Oxley Act of 2002, including, among other things, required executive certification of financial presentations, increased requirements for board audit committees and their members, and enhanced requirements relating to disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act was intended to make significant structural reforms to the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act broadly affects the financial services industry by creating new resolution authorities, requiring ongoing stress testing of capital, mandating higher capital and liquidity requirements, increasing regulation of executive and incentive-based compensation and requiring numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector. Various aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act apply based on the asset size of the financial institution. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for: 

&#8226; 

Capital standards applicable to bank holding companies may be no less stringent than those generally applicable to insured depository institutions; 

&#8226; 

Annual stress tests for financial entities, including SVB Financial and the Bank; 

&#8226; 

Additional risk management and other enhanced prudential standards for larger bank holding companies with $50 billion or greater in total consolidated assets (See "-Enhanced Prudential Standards" below); 

&#8226; 

Restrictions on a banking institution&#8217;s ability to engage in proprietary trading and to sponsor, invest in or lend to certain funds, including venture capital, hedge and private equity funds; 

&#8226; 

Repeal of the federal prohibition (Regulation Q) on the payment of interest on demand deposits, including business checking accounts, and establishment of the $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance; 

&#8226; 

The establishment of the CFPB with responsibility for promulgating and enforcing regulations designed to protect consumers&#8217; financial interests and prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices by financial institutions; 

&#8226; 

The CFPB to directly examine those financial institutions with $10 billion or more in assets, such as SVB Financial, for compliance with the regulations promulgated by the CFPB; 

&#8226; 

Limits, or imposes significant burdens and compliance and other costs on, certain activities traditionally conducted by banking organizations, such as originating and securitizing mortgage loans and other financial assets, arranging and participating in swap and derivative transactions, proprietary trading and investing in private equity and other funds and restrictions on debit charge interchange fees; and 

&#8226; 

The establishment of new compensation restrictions and standards regarding the time, manner and form of compensation given to key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation, including documentation and governance, proxy access by stockholders, deferral and claw-back requirements. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the issuance of numerous implementing regulations, some of which have not yet been issued. Some of the final regulations will continue to take effect over several more years, continuing to make it difficult to anticipate the overall impact to us, our customers, or the financial industry in general. Individually and collectively, both proposed and final regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may materially and adversely affect our businesses, financial conditions and results of operations. Furthermore, the Dodd-Frank Act imposes enhanced prudential standards on bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. See "-Enhanced Prudential Standards" below. As we approach a total consolidated asset size of $50 billion, we may experience heightened regulatory expectations with respect to our risk management practices and other matters, even though we are not yet formally subject to such enhanced prudential standards. 

Enhanced Prudential Standards 

Under the Federal Reserve&#8217;s regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act&#8217;s enhanced prudential standards, bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets are subject to more stringent prudential requirements, including requirements for risk-based and leverage capital, liquidity, risk management, resolution planning, supervisory capital stress testing, single counterparty credit exposure limits, and early remediation. Certain requirements, including the single counterparty credit exposure limits and early remediation standards, have not yet been implemented. 

Pursuant to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s regulations, a bank holding company becomes subject to the more stringent prudential standards at the end of a four-quarter period over the course of which the bank holding company averages total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. We refer to the conclusion of that four-quarter period as the time at which a bank holding company becomes &#8220;subject to enhanced prudential standards.&#8221; Once a bank holding company becomes subject to enhanced prudential standards, certain of the standards include a transition period before the bank holding company is required to comply. Below we describe several of the enhanced prudential standards&#8217; requirements and the associated transition periods that apply once a bank holding company becomes subject to the requirements. 

&#8226; 

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (&#8220;CCAR&#8221;). &#32;&#32;Bank holding companies are required to submit an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve. Failure to submit a satisfactory plan can result in dividend and other restrictions. A bank holding company must comply with the requirements of the CCAR program on January 1 of the first year after becoming subject to enhanced prudential standards. 

&#8226; 

Stress Testing . Bank holding companies are required to submit to the Federal Reserve the results of a mid-year and annual company-run stress test and make summaries of such results available to the public (SVB Financial already is subject to the annual company-run stress test requirements by virtue of having more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets). In addition, bank holding companies are subject to an annual supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve, which publicly discloses summaries of the results of the supervisory stress tests. If a bank holding company becomes subject to the bi-annual company-run and supervisory stress test requirements on or before March 31st of a given year, it must comply with such requirements on January 1st of the following year. However, if a bank holding company becomes subject to the requirements after March 31st of a given year, it must 

comply with the requirements on January 1st of the second year following the year in which it becomes subject to the requirements. 

&#8226; 

Resolution Planning . Bank holding companies are required to annually submit to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a plan for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. Separately, under its regulatory authority, the FDIC requires insured depository institutions that have average total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, based on a four-quarter average, to annually submit to the FDIC a plan that enables the FDIC as receiver to resolve the bank under Sections 11 and 13 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (the &#8220;FDIA&#8221;). A subject bank holding company or bank must submit its first resolution plan by the first July 1st after becoming subject to the rule, so long as it becomes subject to the rule at least 270 days before the first July 1st (i.e., approximately by October of that year). If the first July 1st is fewer than 270 days after becoming subject to the rule, the bank holding company or bank, as the case may be, must submit its first resolution plan by the second July 1st after becoming subject to the rule. 

&#8226; 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio . Pursuant to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (&#8220;LCR&#8221;) requirement, bank holding companies are required to maintain high-quality liquid assets in accordance with specific quantitative requirements. A modified, less stringent version of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s LCR rule applies to bank holding companies with greater than $50 billion in total consolidated assets, but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets and $10 billion in foreign exposures (so-called &#8220;advanced approaches&#8221; banking organizations). The modified LCR rule, which would apply to SVB Financial on our becoming subject to enhanced prudential standards, requires subject bank holding companies to maintain sufficient high-quality liquid assets to meet anticipated cash outflows on the last business day of the applicable calendar month. A bank holding company must comply with the modified LCR rule immediately after becoming subject to it. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Risk Management . Bank holding companies must comply with enhanced risk management requirements. These requirements impose standards on the board of director&#8217;s risk committee and for a chief risk officer. The enhanced prudential requirements also impose liquidity risk management standards and require subject bank holding companies to conduct regular liquidity stress testing over various time horizons and maintain a buffer of liquid assets based on the results of such stress testing. Bank holding companies are required to comply with such risk management and liquidity risk management requirements on the first day of the fifth quarter after becoming subject to the enhanced prudential standards. 

&#8226; 

Pillar III Disclosure . Bank holding companies are required to make timely qualitative and quantitative disclosures about their regulatory capital, referred to as &#8220;Pillar III disclosures.&#8221; Quantitative disclosures must be made quarterly; qualitative disclosures that do not change each quarter may be disclosed annually. Bank holding companies are required to make Pillar III disclosures after reporting $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets in their year-end reports to the Federal Reserve. Because the disclosures are backward looking, a bank holding company makes its first disclosures with respect to data from prior quarters. 

Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank 

The Bank is a California state-chartered bank, a member and stockholder of the Federal Reserve and a member of the FDIC. The Bank is subject to primary supervision, periodic examination and regulation by the DBO and the Federal Reserve, as the Bank&#8217;s primary federal regulator. In general, under the California Financial Code, California banks have all the powers of a California corporation, subject to the general limitation of state bank activities and investments under the FDIA, to those permissible for national banks. Specific federal and state laws and regulations which are applicable to banks regulate, among other things, the scope of their business, their investments, their transactions with affiliates, their foreign operations, their reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds and the nature and amount of and collateral for certain loans. The regulatory structure also gives the bank regulatory agencies extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. If, as a result of an examination, the DBO or the Federal Reserve should determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of the Bank&#8217;s operations are unsatisfactory or that the Bank or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation, the DBO and the Federal Reserve, and separately FDIC as insurer of the Bank&#8217;s deposits, have prudential authority to: 

&#8226; 

Require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice; 

&#8226; 

Require prior approval for senior executive officer and director changes; 

&#8226; 

Direct an increase in capital and the maintenance of specific minimum capital ratios which may preclude the Bank from being deemed well capitalized for regulatory purposes; 

&#8226; 

Restrict the Bank&#8217;s growth geographically, by products and services, or by mergers and acquisitions; 

&#8226; 

Enter into informal or formal enforcement orders, including memoranda of understanding, written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders to take corrective action and enjoin unsafe and unsound practices; 

&#8226; 

Restrict or prohibit the Bank from paying dividends or making other distributions to SVB Financial; 

&#8226; 

Remove officers and directors and assess civil monetary penalties; and 

&#8226; 

Take possession of and close and liquidate the Bank. 

Pursuant to applicable California and federal law, state chartered commercial banks are permitted to engage in any activity permissible for national banks. Therefore, the Bank may form subsidiaries to engage in the many so-called &#8220;closely related to banking&#8221; or &#8220;nonbanking&#8221; activities commonly conducted by national banks in operating subsidiaries, and further, the Bank may conduct certain &#8220;financial&#8221; activities in a subsidiary that would be impermissible for the Bank itself to the same extent as may a national bank, provided the Bank remains &#8220;well-capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;well-managed&#8221; and in satisfactory compliance with the CRA. The Bank continues to be in satisfactory compliance with the CRA. 

Regulatory Capital 

In July 2013, the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC published final rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The agencies said that they believe that the new rules will result in capital requirements that better reflect banking organizations&#8217; risk profiles. The rules implement the &#8220;Basel III&#8221; regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. &#8220;Basel III&#8221; refers to the internationally agreed regulatory capital framework released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the "Basel Committee"). The new rules became effective for SVB Financial and the Bank in January 2015, with some rules being transitioned into full effectiveness over two to four years. The new capital rules, among other things, (i) require elevated capital levels for the Bank and SVB Financial; (ii) introduce a new capital measure limited to common equity called &#8220;Common Equity Tier 1&#8221; (&#8220;CET1&#8221;) and a related regulatory capital ratio of CET 1 to risk-weighted assets; (iii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and &#8220;Additional Tier 1 capital&#8221; instruments meeting specified requirements; (iv) change the risk-weightings of certain on- and off-balance sheet assets for purposes of risk-based capital ratios; (v) create an additional capital conservation buffer (which will limit dividends and other discretionary bonus payments to certain executive officers if not satisfied) above the required capital ratios; (vi) limit what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting the various capital requirements; (vii) apply most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, thus potentially requiring higher levels of CET1 in order to meet minimum ratios; and (viii) expand the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to prior regulations. 

In addition, the Bank is required to demonstrate its ability to maintain sufficient capital ratios under the scenarios of adverse and severely adverse financial conditions that are part of Federal Reserve's stress testing requirements. Bank holding companies with total consolidated assets between $10 billion and $50 billion and state member banks with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion, such as SVB Financial and the Bank, are now generally required to conduct annual company-run stress tests, the results of which could require us to take certain actions, including raising additional capital. We are required to submit to the Federal Reserve the results of the annual company-run stress tests and to make summaries of the results of the company-run stress tests available to the public. 

Under the new capital rules, CET1 is defined as common stock, plus related surplus, and retained earnings plus limited amounts of minority interest in the form of common stock, less the majority of the regulatory deductions. The new capital rules, like the prior capital rules, specify that total capital consists of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. Tier 1 capital for SVB Financial and the Bank consists of common stock, plus related surplus and retained earnings. Under the new capital rules, for most banking organizations, the most common form of Additional Tier 1 capital is noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common form of Tier 2 capital is subordinated notes and a portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses (&#8220;ALLL&#8221;), in each case, subject to the new capital rules&#8217; specific requirements. 

The new capital rules require a number of changes to regulatory capital deductions and adjustments, subject to a transition period. These changes include, for example, the requirement that deferred tax assets (&#8220;DTAs&#8221;) arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceed 15% of CET1. In addition, under the previous capital rules, certain effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss items included in shareholders&#8217; equity were reversed for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Under the new capital rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are not excluded; however, non-advanced approaches banking organizations, including SVB Financial and the Bank, may make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items. We made this election in April 2015 to reduce the impact of market volatility on SVB Financial&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s 

regulatory capital levels. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and will be phased-in over a four-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and a 20% percentage-point increase per year until reaching 100%). 

The newly effective capital rules also include changes in the risk-weighting of assets to better reflect perceived credit risk and other risk exposure and require higher tangible common equity components of capital. These include a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and for non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise in nonaccrual status and a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable (currently set at 0%). Under the new capital rules, the minimum capital ratios beginning January 1, 2015 are as follows: 

&#8226; 

4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets 

&#8226; 

6.0% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 

&#8226; 

8.0% Total capital to risk-weighted assets 

&#8226; 

4.0% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the &#8220;leverage ratio&#8221;) 

The new capital rules will require SVB Financial and the Bank to meet a capital conservation buffer requirement in order to avoid constraints on capital distributions, such as dividends and equity repurchases, and certain bonus compensation for executive officers. To meet the requirement when it is fully phased in, the organization must maintain an amount of CET1 capital that exceeds the buffer level of 2.5% above each of the minimum risk-weighted capital ratios. The requirement will be phased in over a four year period, starting January 1, 2016, when the amount of such capital must exceed the buffer level of 0.625%. The buffer level will increase by 0.625 percentage point each year until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019. When the capital conservation buffer requirement is fully phased in, to avoid constraints, a banking organization must maintain the following capital ratios (after any distribution): (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets more than 7.0%, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets more than 8.5%, and (iii) total capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets more than 10.5%. 

With respect to the Bank, the new capital rules also revise the &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; regulations effective January 1, 2015, by (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each level (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8% (as compared to the current 6%); and (iii) eliminating the current provision that provides that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3% leverage ratio and still be adequately capitalized. The new capital rules do not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; category. See &#8220;-Prompt Corrective Action and Other General Enforcement Authority&#8221; below. 

Although we continue to evaluate the impact that the new capital rules have on SVB Financial and the Bank, we believe that SVB Financial and the Bank meet all capital requirements under the new capital rules on a fully phased-in basis as if such requirements were effective as of December 31, 2015. The estimate is based on management&#8217;s current interpretation, expectations, and understanding of the new capital rules. We anticipate that the Bank will continue to exceed the well-capitalized minimum capital requirements, and that SVB Financial will continue to qualify as a financial holding company. 

Capital Planning 

Banking organizations must have appropriate capital planning processes, with proper oversight from the Board of Directors. Accordingly, pursuant to a separate, general supervisory letter from the Federal Reserve, bank holding companies are expected to conduct and document comprehensive capital adequacy analyses prior to the declaration of any dividends (on common stock, preferred stock, trust preferred securities or other Tier 1 capital instruments), capital redemptions or capital repurchases. Moreover, the federal banking agencies have adopted a joint agency policy statement, stating that the adequacy and effectiveness of a bank&#8217;s interest rate risk management process and the level of its interest rate exposures are critical factors in the evaluation of the bank&#8217;s capital adequacy. A bank with material weaknesses in its interest rate risk management process or high levels of interest rate exposure relative to its capital will be directed by the relevant federal banking agencies to take corrective actions. 

Proprietary Trading and Certain Relationships with Hedge Funds and Private Equity Funds 

The &#8220;Volcker Rule&#8221; under the Dodd-Frank Act restricts, among other things, a bank's proprietary trading activities and a bank's ability to sponsor or invest in certain privately offered funds, including certain venture capital, hedge and private equity funds. On December 10, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies, the SEC and the CFTC adopted final regulations implementing the Volcker Rule. The final regulations became effective on April 1, 2014, subject to a conformance timeline pursuant to which affected entities (referred to as &#8220;banking entities&#8221;) are required to bring their activities and investments into conformance with the prohibitions and restrictions of the Volcker Rule and the final regulations thereunder. 

Subject to certain exceptions, the Volcker Rule prohibits a banking entity from engaging in &#8220;proprietary trading,&#8221; which is defined as engaging in purchases or sales of securities or certain other financial instruments, as principal, for the &#8220;trading account&#8221; of the banking entity. Certain forms of proprietary trading may qualify as &#8220;permitted activities,&#8221; and thus not be subject to the ban on proprietary trading, such as market-making related activities, risk-mitigating hedging activities, trading in U.S. government or agency obligations, or certain other U.S. state or municipal obligations, and the obligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. Based on this definition and the exceptions provided under the final regulations, we do not believe that we engage in any proprietary trading that is prohibited under the Volcker Rule. 

Additionally, subject to certain exceptions, the rule prohibits a banking entity from sponsoring or investing in &#8220;covered funds,&#8221; which includes many venture capital, private equity and hedge funds. One such exception permits a banking entity to sponsor and invest in a covered fund that it organizes and offers to customers, provided that additional requirements are met. These permitted investments generally are limited to three percent of the total ownership interests in each covered fund. In addition, the aggregate investments a banking entity makes in all covered funds generally are limited to three percent of the institution&#8217;s Tier 1 capital. 

Under the final regulations, the Volcker Rule&#8217;s prohibitions and restrictions apply to SVB Financial, the Bank and any affiliate of SVB Financial or the Bank. SVB Financial maintains investments in certain venture capital and private equity funds that it did not sponsor; maintains investments in sponsored-funds that exceed three percent of each such fund&#8217;s total ownership interests; and its aggregate investments in all covered funds may exceed three percent of its Tier 1 capital. SVB Financial (including its affiliates) expects, therefore, that it will be required to reduce the level of its investments in covered funds over time and to forego investment opportunities in certain funds in the future. SVB Financial is generally required by the final rules to come into conformance with the Volcker Rule&#8217;s requirements regarding covered funds by July 2016 with respect to covered funds in which SVB Financial invested or SVB Financial sponsored as of December 31, 2013. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it intends to extend this conformance deadline to July 2017. In addition, the Federal Reserve may extend the conformance deadline for up to an additional five years (until July 2022) for investments that are considered illiquid. We intend to seek the maximum extensions (up to July 2022) available to us. However, the process and standards that apply to any such additional extensions are not clear at this time, and there is no guarantee that the Federal Reserve will grant any of these extensions. 

We estimate that our total venture capital and private equity fund investments deemed to be prohibited covered fund interests and therefore subject to the Volcker Rule&#8217;s restrictions, had, as of December 31, 2015, an aggregate carrying value of approximately $210 million (and an aggregate fair value of $321 million). These covered fund interests are comprised of interests attributable, solely, to the Company in our consolidated managed funds and certain of our non&#8722;marketable securities. 

We continue to assess the financial impact of these rules on our fund investments, as well as the impact of other Volcker Rule restrictions on other areas of our business. (See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; under Item 1A of Part I below.) 

The Volcker Rule also requires banking entities to design and implement a compliance program reasonably designed to ensure and monitor compliance with the Volcker Rule. If SVB Financial reports total consolidated assets as of the previous calendar year end of $50 billion or more, it will become subject to the Volcker Rule&#8217;s enhanced compliance program requirements, which, among other things, require an annual attestation from the chief executive officer regarding the design and effectiveness of the compliance program. 

Prompt Corrective Action and Other General Enforcement Authority 

State and federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take corrective and other supervisory action against an insured bank and its holding company. The FDIA requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions, including those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios. The law requires each federal banking agency to promulgate regulations defining five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed, based on the level of its capital ratios: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency, and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. 

Bank holding companies and insured banks also may be subject to potential enforcement actions of varying levels of severity by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business, or for violation of any law, rule, regulation, condition imposed in writing by the agency or term of a written agreement with the agency. In more serious cases, enforcement actions may include the issuance of directives to increase capital; the issuance of formal and informal agreements; the imposition of civil monetary penalties; the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced; the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against officers, directors, and other institution&#8722;affiliated parties; the termination of the bank&#8217;s deposit insurance; the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the bank; and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted. 

Safety and Soundness Guidelines 

Banking regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines to assist in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines establish operational and managerial standards generally relating to: (i) internal controls, information systems, and internal audit systems; (ii) loan documentation; (iii) credit underwriting; (iv) interest-rate exposure; (v) asset growth and asset quality; and (vi) compensation, fees and benefits. In addition, the bank regulatory agencies have adopted safety and soundness guidelines for asset quality and for evaluating and monitoring earnings to ensure that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s enhanced prudential standards require bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more to establish and maintain risk management committees for their boards of directors to oversee the bank holding companies&#8217; risk management frameworks. In January 2015, we formed a risk committee of our Board of Directors. Bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion and greater are subject to more stringent board risk committee and risk management requirements, including liquidity risk requirements. 

Restrictions on Dividends 

Dividends from the Bank constitute one of the primary sources of cash for SVB Financial. The Bank is subject to various federal and state statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends, including applicable provisions of the California Financial Code and the prompt corrective action regulations. In addition, the banking agencies have the authority to prohibit the Bank from paying dividends, depending upon the Bank&#8217;s financial condition, if such payment is deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Furthermore, under the federal prompt corrective action regulations, the Federal Reserve may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company&#8217;s bank subsidiary is classified as &#8220;undercapitalized.&#8221; 

It is the Federal Reserve&#8217;s policy that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization&#8217;s expected future needs and financial condition. It is also the Federal Reserve&#8217;s policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. Additionally, in consideration of the recent financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. 

Transactions with Affiliates 

Transactions between the Bank and its operating subsidiaries (such as SVB Securities and SVB Asset Management) on the one hand, and the Bank&#8217;s affiliates (such as SVB Financial, SVB Analytics, Inc. or an entity affiliated with our SVB Capital business) on the other, are subject to restrictions imposed by federal and state law, designed to protect the Bank and its subsidiaries from engaging in unfavorable behavior with their affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act further extended the definition of an &#8220;affiliate&#8221; to include any investment fund to which the Bank or an affiliate serves as an investment adviser. More specifically, these restrictions, contained in the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Regulation W, prevent SVB Financial and other affiliates from borrowing from, or entering into other credit transactions with, the Bank or its operating subsidiaries unless the loans or other credit transactions are secured by specified amounts of collateral, and also requires that the Bank enter into such transaction on terms no less favorable to the Bank than the terms of an arms&#8217; length transaction with an unaffiliated party. Moreover, all loans and credit transactions and other &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; by the Bank and its operating subsidiaries with any one affiliate are limited, in the aggregate, to 10% of the Bank&#8217;s capital and surplus; and all loans and credit transactions and other &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; by the Bank and its operating subsidiaries with all affiliates are limited, in the aggregate, to 20% of the Bank&#8217;s capital and surplus. For this purpose, a &#8220;covered transaction&#8221; generally includes, among other things, a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate, including a purchase of assets subject to an agreement to repurchase; a purchase of or investment in securities issued by an affiliate; the acceptance of a security issued by an affiliate as collateral for an extension of credit to any borrower; the borrowing or lending of securities 

where the Bank has credit exposure to the affiliate; the acceptance of &#8220;other debt obligations&#8221; of an affiliate as collateral for a loan to a third party; any derivative transaction that causes the Bank to have credit exposure to an affiliate; and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance, or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. The Dodd-Frank Act treats derivative transactions resulting in credit exposure to an affiliate as covered transactions. It expands the transactions for which collateral is required to be maintained, and for all such transactions, it requires collateral to be maintained at all times. In addition, the Volcker Rule under the Dodd-Frank Act establishes certain prohibitions, restrictions and requirements (known as &#8220;Super 23A&#8221; and &#8220;Super 23B&#8221;) on transactions between a covered fund and a banking entity that serves as an investment manager, investment adviser, organizer and offeror, or sponsor with respect to that covered fund, regardless whether the banking entity has an ownership interest in the fund. 

Loans to Insiders &#32; 

Extensions of credit by the Bank to insiders of both the Bank and SVB Financial are subject to prohibitions and other restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Regulation O. For purposes of these limits, &#8220;insiders&#8221; include directors, executive officers and principal stockholders of the Bank or SVB Financial and their related interests. The term &#8220;related interest&#8221; means a company controlled by a director, executive officer or principal stockholder of the Bank or SVB Financial. The Bank may not extend credit to an insider of the Bank or SVB Financial unless the loan is made on substantially the same terms as, and subject to credit underwriting procedures that are no less stringent than, those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-insiders. Under federal banking regulations, the Bank may not extend credit to insiders in an amount, when aggregated with all other extensions of credit, is greater than $500,000 without prior approval from the Bank&#8217;s Board of Directors (with any interested person abstaining from participating directly or indirectly in the voting). California law, the federal regulations and the Dodd-Frank Act place additional restrictions on loans to insiders, and generally prohibit loans to executive officers other than for certain specified purposes. The Bank is required to maintain records regarding insiders and extensions of credit to them. 

&#160; 

Premiums for Deposit Insurance 

The FDIC insures our customer deposits through the DIF up to prescribed limits for each depositor. In recent years, due to higher levels of bank failures, the FDIC&#8217;s resolution costs increased, which depleted the DIF. In order to restore the DIF to its statutorily mandated minimum of 1.35% of total deposits, the FDIC has increased deposit insurance premium rates. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more, such as the Bank, are responsible for funding the increase. The Bank bases its assessment rate on a risk&#8722;based scorecard calculation provided by the FDIC. In addition, the FDIC retains the authority to further increase the Bank&#8217;s assessment rates and the FDIC has established a higher reserve ratio of 2% as a long-term goal which goes beyond what is required by statute. Continued increases in our FDIC insurance premiums could have an adverse effect on the Bank&#8217;s results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , we recorded $25.5 million &#32;in FDIC assessments expense. 

Consumer Regulations 

The Bank is subject to many federal consumer protection statutes and regulations, such as the CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (Regulation B), the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (Regulation E), the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z), the National Flood Insurance Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act and various federal and state privacy protection laws. In addition, the CFPB has the authority to conduct examinations for all depository institutions with total assets of $10 billion or more, which includes the Bank. The CFPB&#8217;s mandate is to promulgate consumer regulations and ensure that consumer financial practices at large banks, such as the Bank, comply with consumer financial protection legal requirements. The CFPB&#8217;s authority includes the ability to examine all subsidiaries and affiliates of the Bank as well. Penalties for violating these laws could subject the Bank to lawsuits and could also result in administrative penalties, including, civil monetary penalties, remediation to affected consumers and reimbursements and orders to halt expansion/existing activities. The CFPB has broad authority to institute various enforcement actions, including investigations, civil actions, cease and desist proceedings and the ability to refer criminal findings to the Department of Justice. The Bank and SVB Financial are also subject to federal and state laws prohibiting unfair, deceptive and abusive, corrupt or fraudulent business practices, untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition. 

Examination and enforcement by the state and federal banking agencies, and other such enforcement authorities, for non-compliance with consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations have increased and become more intense. The advent of the CFPB further heightens oversight and review of compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations. Due to these heightened regulatory concerns, including increased enforcement of the CRA by the federal banking agencies, and new powers and authority of the CFPB, the Bank and its affiliates may incur additional compliance costs or be required to expend additional funds for investments in their local community. 

Anti-Money Laundering Regulations 

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (&#8220;USA PATRIOT Act&#8221;) of 2001 and its implementing regulations substantially broadened the scope of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations by requiring insured depository institutions, broker-dealers, and certain other financial institutions to have policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act and its regulations also provide for information sharing, subject to conditions, between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as well as among financial institutions, for counter-terrorism purposes. Federal banking regulators are required, when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications, to take into account the effectiveness of the anti-money laundering activities of the applicants. Material deficiencies in anti-money laundering compliance, and compliance with related requirements such as the U.S. economic and trade sanctions regimes, can result in public enforcement actions by the bank regulatory agencies and other government agencies, including the imposition of civil money penalties and supervisory restrictions on growth and expansion. Such enforcement actions could also have serious reputational consequences for SVB Financial and the Bank. &#32; 

Regulation of Certain Subsidiaries 

SVB Securities is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and a member of FINRA, and accordingly, is subject to regulation by both agencies. SVB Securities is also a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. As a broker-dealer, SVB Securities must comply with a variety of regulations associated with its business lines, including (i) rules that govern the registration and examination of SVB Securities and its employees, (ii) substantive requirements and prohibitions concerning its relationships with its customers and counterparties, (iii) anti-fraud provisions and (iv) requirements to develop and maintain internal compliance and supervisory programs. SVB Securities also must comply with the financial responsibility rules governing broker-dealers, including Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which is designed to measure the general financial condition and liquidity of a broker-dealer and seek to ensure its financial stability in light of its activities. Under this rule, SVB Securities is required to maintain minimum net capital calculated in accordance with a specified formula in order to help meet its continuing commitments to customers and others. Under certain circumstances, this rule could limit the ability of the Bank to withdraw capital from SVB Securities or require a capital infusion to support growth in the business or new activities. SVB Asset Management and SVB Wealth Advisory are registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and are subject to its rules and regulations. In addition, following completion of various studies on investment advisers and broker&#8722;dealers required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC has, among other things, recommended to Congress that it consider various means to enhance the SEC&#8217;s examination authority over investment advisers, which may have an impact on SVB Asset Management and SVB Wealth Advisory that we cannot currently assess. The regulatory environment for broker-dealers and investment advisers is constantly evolving as the regulators adopt new rules and interpretations. 

International Regulation 

Our international-based subsidiaries and global activities, including our banking branch in the United Kingdom and our joint venture bank in China are subject to the respective laws and regulations of those countries and the regions in which they operate. This includes laws and regulations promulgated by, but not limited to, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority in the United Kingdom, the China Banking Regulatory Commission and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Moreover, promulgation by standard-setting bodies that are charged with the development of international regulatory frameworks, such as the Basel Committee, can affect the Bank and SVB Financial globally as national regulators implement the frameworks in local jurisdictions.
