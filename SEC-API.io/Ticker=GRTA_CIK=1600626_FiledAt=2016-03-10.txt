 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

Griffin Capital Essential Asset REIT II, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), was formed on November 20, 2013 under the Maryland General Corporation Law and intends to qualify as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for the year ended December 31, 2015 and each year thereafter. We were organized primarily with the purpose of acquiring single tenant net lease properties that are considered essential to the occupying tenant, and expect to use a substantial amount of the net proceeds from our initial public offering to invest in these properties. We are a recently formed company and are subject to the general risks associated with a start-up enterprise, including the risk of business failure. We have no employees and are externally advised and managed by an affiliate, Griffin Capital Essential Asset Advisor II, LLC, our Advisor. Our year end is December 31. 

Our registration statement was declared effective on July 31, 2014, pursuant to which we registered $2,200,000,000 in shares of Class A common stock and Class T common stock in our initial public offering (&#8220;Offering&#8221;), consisting of $2,000,000,000 in shares to be offered to the public in the primary public offering (&#8220;Primary Offering&#8221;) and $200,000,000 in shares for sale pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan (&#8220;DRP&#8221;). On December 5, 2014, we ceased offering Class T common stock, having sold no shares of Class T common stock at such date. On October 30, 2015, we ceased offering Class A common stock in our Offering, having sold approximately $ 240.8 million &#32;in shares of Class A common stock, and reallocated the remaining shares, such that, effective November 2, 2015, we are offering up to approximately $1,800,000,000 in shares of Class T common stock in the Primary Offering. We are offering such Class T shares at a price of $10.00 per share in our Primary Offering and a price of $9.50 per share pursuant to our DRP. (See Note 5, &#32;Equity , of the notes to the audited financial statements as of December 31, 2015.) 

As of December 31, 2015 , we issued 24,202,509 &#32;and 3,823,139 &#32;shares of our Class A and Class T common stock, respectively, for gross proceeds of approximately $ 240.8 million &#32;and $ 38.2 million , respectively, excluding shares of our common stock issued pursuant to the DRP and stock distributions. As of December 31, 2015, 475,520 &#32;and 46,336 &#32;shares of Class A common stock had been issued pursuant to the DRP and stock distributions, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 , 7,451 &#32;and 1,215 &#32;shares of Class T common stock had been issued pursuant to the DRP and stock distributions, respectively. 

Investment Objectives 

Overview 

If we sell the maximum amount in our Offering with a combination of Class A and Class T common stock, we estimate that approximately 95.2% of our gross offering proceeds will be available for investment. The remaining 4.8% will be used to pay sales commissions and dealer manager fees. We expect our acquisition fees and actual acquisition expenses to constitute approximately 4.2% of our gross offering proceeds, which will allow us to invest approximately 91.0% in real estate investments. Such net offering proceeds will be used to primarily invest in single tenant business essential properties in accordance with our investment objectives. We may also use net offering proceeds to pay down debt or make distributions if our cash flows from operations are insufficient. Our investment objectives and policies may be amended or changed at any time by our board of directors. Although we have no plans at this time to change any of our investment objectives, our board of directors may change any and all such investment objectives, including our focus on single tenant business essential properties, if they believe such changes are in the best interests of our stockholders. In addition, we may invest in real estate properties other than single tenant business essential properties if our board deems such investments to be in the best interests of our stockholders. We cannot assure our stockholders that our policies or investment objectives will be attained or that the value of our common stock will not decrease. 

Primary Investment Objectives 

Our primary investment objectives are to: 

&#8226; 

invest in income-producing real property in a manner that allows us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes; 

&#8226; 

provide regular cash distributions to our stockholders; 

&#8226; 

preserve and protect our stockholders' invested capital; and 

&#8226; 

achieve appreciation in the value of our properties over the long term. 

We cannot assure our stockholders that we will attain these primary investment objectives. 

Exchange Listing and Other Liquidity Events 

Our board will determine when, and if, to apply to have our shares of common stock listed for trading on a national securities exchange, subject to satisfying then-existing applicable listing requirements. Subject to then-existing market conditions and the sole discretion of our board of directors, immediately after completion of the Offering we will consider the following potential liquidity events: 

&#8226; 

list our shares on a national securities exchange; 

&#8226; 

merge, reorganize or otherwise transfer our company or its assets to another entity with listed securities; 

&#8226; 

commence the sale of all of our properties and liquidate our company; or 

&#8226; 

otherwise create a liquidity event for our stockholders. 

However, we cannot assure our stockholders that we will immediately achieve one or more of the above-described liquidity events following the completion of the Offering. If we determine that market conditions are not favorable for one of the above-described liquidity events, our board of directors has the sole discretion to continue operations after completion of the Offering, including engaging in a follow-on offering, if it deems such continuation to be in the best interests of our stockholders. Even if we do accomplish one or more of these liquidity events, we cannot guarantee that a public market will develop for the securities listed or that such securities will trade at a price higher than what you paid for your shares in the Offering. At the time it becomes necessary for our board of directors to determine which liquidity event, if any, is in the best interests of us and our stockholders, we expect that the board will take all relevant factors at that time into consideration when making a liquidity event decision. We expect that the board will consider various factors including, but not limited to, costs and expenses related to each possible liquidity event and the potential subordinated distributions payable to our Advisor. 

Investment Strategy 

We seek to acquire a portfolio consisting primarily of single tenant business essential properties throughout the United States diversified by corporate credit, physical geography, product type and lease duration. Although we have no current intention to do so, we may also invest a portion of the net proceeds in single tenant business essential properties outside the United States. We acquire assets consistent with our single tenant acquisition philosophy by focusing primarily on properties: 

&#8226; 

essential to the business operations of the tenant; 

&#8226; 

located in primary, secondary and certain select tertiary markets; 

&#8226; 

leased to tenants with stable and/or improving credit quality; and 

&#8226; 

subject to long-term leases with defined rental rate increases or with short-term leases with high-probability renewal prospects and potential for increasing rent. 

Our sponsor has been acquiring single tenant business essential properties for two decades. Our sponsor&#8217;s positive acquisition and ownership experience with single tenant business essential properties of the type we intend to acquire stems from the following: 

&#8226; 

the credit quality of the lease payment is determinable and equivalent to the senior unsecured credit characteristics of the tenant; 

&#8226; 

the essential nature of the asset to the tenant&#8217;s business provides greater default protection relative to the tenant&#8217;s balance sheet debt; 

&#8226; 

the percentage recovery in the event of a tenant default is empirically greater than an unsecured lender; and 

&#8226; 

long-term leases provide a consistent and predictable income stream across market cycles while short-term leases offer income appreciation upon renewal and reset. 

We will seek to provide investors the following benefits: 

&#8226; 

a cohesive management team experienced in all aspects of real estate investment with a track record of acquiring primarily single tenant business essential assets; 

&#8226; 

stable cash flow backed by a portfolio of single tenant business essential real estate assets; 

&#8226; 

minimal exposure to operating and maintenance expense increases as we attempt to structure or acquire leases where the tenant assumes responsibility for these costs; 

&#8226; 

contractual lease rate increases enabling potential distribution growth and a potential hedge against inflation; 

&#8226; 

insulation from short-term economic cycles resulting from the long-term nature of underlying leases; 

&#8226; 

enhanced stability resulting from diversified credit characteristics of corporate credits; and 

&#8226; 

portfolio stability promoted through geographic and product type investment diversification. 

We cannot assure our stockholders that any of the properties we acquire will result in the benefits discussed above. 

General Acquisition and Investment Policies 

We seek to make investments that satisfy the primary investment objective of providing regular cash distributions to our stockholders. However, because a significant factor in the valuation of income-producing real property is its potential for future appreciation, we anticipate that some properties we acquire may have the potential both for growth in value and for providing regular cash distributions to our stockholders. 

Our Advisor has substantial discretion with respect to the selection of specific properties. However, each acquisition will be approved by our board of directors. In selecting a potential property for acquisition, we and our Advisor consider a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; 

tenant creditworthiness; 

&#8226; 

whether a property is essential to the business operations of the tenant; 

&#8226; 

lease terms, including length of lease term, scope of landlord responsibilities, presence and frequency of contractual rental increases, renewal option provisions, exclusive and permitted use provisions, co-tenancy requirements and termination options; 

&#8226; 

projected demand in the area; 

&#8226; 

a property&#8217;s geographic location and type; 

&#8226; 

proposed purchase price, terms and conditions; 

&#8226; 

tenant's and property's historical financial performance; 

&#8226; 

projected net cash flow yield and internal rates of return; 

&#8226; 

a property&#8217;s physical location, visibility, curb appeal and access; 

&#8226; 

construction quality and condition; 

&#8226; 

potential for capital appreciation; 

&#8226; 

demographics of the area, neighborhood growth patterns, economic conditions, and local market conditions; 

&#8226; 

potential capital and tenant improvements and reserves required to maintain the property; 

&#8226; 

prospects for liquidity through sale, financing or refinancing of the property; 

&#8226; 

the potential for the construction of new properties in the area; 

&#8226; 

treatment under applicable federal, state and local tax and other laws and regulations; 

&#8226; 

evaluation of title and obtaining of satisfactory title insurance; and 

&#8226; 

evaluation of any reasonable ascertainable risks such as environmental contamination. 

There is no limitation on the number, size or type of properties that we may acquire or on the percentage of net offering proceeds that may be invested in any particular property type or single property. The number and mix of properties will depend upon real estate market conditions and other circumstances existing at the time of acquisition and the amount of proceeds raised in the Offering. In determining whether to purchase a particular property, we may obtain an option on such property. The amount paid for an option, if any, is normally surrendered if the property is not purchased and may or may not be credited against the purchase price if the property is ultimately purchased. 

Description of Leases 

We, in most instances, have acquired single tenant properties with existing net leases. When spaces in a property become vacant, existing leases expire, or we acquire properties under development or requiring substantial refurbishment or renovation, we anticipate entering into &#8220;net&#8221; leases. &#8220;Net&#8221; leases means leases that typically require tenants to pay all or a majority of the operating expenses, including real estate taxes, special assessments and sales and use taxes, utilities, insurance, common area maintenance charges, property services and building repairs related to the property, in addition to the lease payments. Under most commercial leases, tenants are obligated to pay a predetermined annual base rent. Some of the leases also will contain provisions that increase the amount of base rent payable at points during the lease term and/or that require the tenant to pay rent based upon a percentage of the tenant&#8217;s revenues. Percentage rent can be calculated based upon a number of factors. There are various forms of net leases, typically classified as triple-net or absolute triple-net. Triple-net leases typically require the tenant to pay all costs associated with a property in addition to the base rent and percentage rent, if any. However, often times in triple-net leases certain of the capital expenditure costs are not paid for by the tenants (such as roof and structure costs). Absolute triple-net leases are those that require tenants to pay for all the costs in a triple-net lease as well as all the capital costs associated with a property. 

To the extent we acquire multi-tenant properties, we have, and expect to have, a variety of lease arrangements with the tenants of these properties. Since each lease is an individually negotiated contract between two or more parties, each lease will have different obligations of both the landlord and tenant and we cannot predict at this time the exact terms of any future leases into which we will enter. We weigh many factors when negotiating specific lease terms, including, but not limited to, the rental rate, creditworthiness of the tenant, location of the property and type of property. Many large national tenants have standard lease forms that generally do not vary from property to property. We will have limited ability to revise the terms of leases with those tenants. Some of these limited negotiable terms include lease duration and special provisions on the recovery of operating expenses. In certain instances, we may be responsible for normal operating expenses up to a certain amount, which may reduce the amount of operating cash flow available for future investments. 

Typically, our tenants will have lease terms of five to 15 years at the time of the property acquisition. We may acquire properties under which the lease term has partially expired. We also may acquire properties with shorter lease terms if the property is located in a desirable location, is difficult to replace, or has other significant favorable real estate attributes. 

Our Borrowing Strategy and Policies 

We may incur our indebtedness in the form of bank borrowings, purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties and publicly-or privately-placed debt instruments or financing from institutional investors or other lenders. We may obtain a credit facility or separate loans for each acquisition. Our indebtedness may be unsecured or may be secured by mortgages or other interests in our properties, and by guarantees or pledges of membership interests. We may use borrowing proceeds to finance acquisitions of new properties, to pay for capital improvements, repairs or buildouts, to refinance existing indebtedness, to pay distributions, to fund redemptions of our shares or to provide working capital. To the extent we borrow on a short-term basis, we may refinance such short-term debt into long-term, amortizing mortgages once a critical mass of properties has been acquired and to the extent such debt is available at terms that are favorable to the then in-place debt. 

There is no limitation on the amount we can borrow for the purchase of any property. Our aggregate borrowings, secured and unsecured, must be reasonable in relation to our net assets and must be reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly. We anticipate that we will utilize approximately between 40% and 50% leverage in connection with our acquisition strategy, although at certain times during this offering, our leverage levels may be temporarily higher as we acquire properties in advance of funds being raised in this offering. However, our charter limits our borrowing to 300% of our net assets (equivalent to 75% of the cost of our assets) unless any excess borrowing is approved by a majority of our independent directors and is disclosed to our stockholders in our next quarterly report, along with the justification for such excess. As of December 31, 2015, our leverage ratio (which we define as our debt as a percentage of the net book value of our real estate) was 56.5%. 

We may borrow amounts from our Advisor or its affiliates only if such loan is approved by a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction, as fair, competitive, commercially reasonable and no less favorable to us than comparable loans between unaffiliated parties under the circumstances. 

Except as set forth in our charter regarding debt limits, we may re-evaluate and change our debt strategy and policies in the future without a stockholder vote. Factors that we could consider when re-evaluating or changing our debt strategy and policies include then-current economic and market conditions, the relative cost of debt and equity capital, the size of our portfolio, any acquisition opportunities, the ability of our properties to generate sufficient cash flow to cover debt service requirements and other similar factors. Further, we may increase or decrease our ratio of debt to equity in connection with any change of our borrowing policies. 

Acquisition Structure 

Although we are not limited as to the form our investments may take, our investments in real estate will generally constitute acquiring fee title or interests in joint ventures or similar entities that own and operate real estate. We may also invest in real estate in which the asset is subject to a long term ground lease. 

We will make acquisitions of our real estate investments directly through Griffin Capital Essential Asset Operating Partnership II, L.P., our operating partnership, or indirectly through limited liability companies or limited partnerships, or through investments in joint ventures, partnerships, co-tenancies or other co-ownership arrangements with other owners of properties, affiliates of our Advisor or other persons. 

Real Property Investments 

Our Advisor will be continually evaluating various potential property investments and engaging in discussions and negotiations with sellers, developers and potential tenants regarding the purchase and development of properties for us and other programs sponsored by our sponsor. At such time while the Offering is being conducted, if we believe that a reasonable probability exists that we will acquire a specific property, our prospectus will be supplemented to disclose the negotiations and pending acquisition of such property. We expect that this will normally occur upon the signing of a purchase agreement for the acquisition of a specific property, but may occur before or after such signing or upon the satisfaction or expiration of major contingencies in any such purchase agreement, depending on the particular circumstances surrounding each potential investment. A supplement to our prospectus will also describe any improvements proposed to be constructed thereon and other information that we consider appropriate for an understanding of the transaction. Further data will be made available after any pending acquisition is consummated, also by means of a supplement to our prospectus, if appropriate. YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THE DISCLOSURE OF ANY PROPOSED ACQUISITION CANNOT BE RELIED UPON AS AN ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL ULTIMATELY CONSUMMATE SUCH ACQUISITION OR THAT THE INFORMATION PROVIDED CONCERNING THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION WILL NOT CHANGE BETWEEN THE DATE OF THE SUPPLEMENT AND ANY ACTUAL PURCHASE. 

Insurance on Properties 

Certain leases require each tenant to procure, at its own expense, commercial general liability insurance, as well as property insurance covering the building for the full replacement value and naming the ownership entity and the lender, if applicable, as the additional insured on the policy. As a precautionary measure, we may obtain, to the extent available, contingent liability and property insurance and flood insurance, as well as loss of rents insurance that covers one or more years of annual rent in the event of a rental loss. In other instances, we directly procure commercial liability and property insurance covering the buildings for full replacement value. The cost of directly placed commercial liability and property insurance is recovered from the tenant as the lease permits. In addition, we maintain a pollution insurance policy for all of our properties to insure against the risk of environmental contaminants; however, the coverage and amounts of our environmental and flood insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover our entire risk. 

Tenants will be required to provide proof of insurance by furnishing a certificate of insurance to our Advisor on an annual basis. The insurance certificates will be tracked and reviewed for compliance by our property manager. 

Competition 

As we purchase properties for our portfolio, we are in competition with other potential buyers for the same properties, and may have to pay more to purchase the property than if there were no other potential acquirers or we may have to locate another property that meets our investment criteria. Although we intend to acquire properties subject to existing leases, the leasing of real estate is highly competitive in the current market, and we may experience competition for tenants from owners and managers of competing projects. As a result, we may have to provide free rent, incur charges for tenant improvements, or offer other inducements, or we might not be able to timely lease the space, all of which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. At the time we elect to dispose of our properties, we will also be in competition with sellers of similar properties to locate suitable purchasers for its properties. 

Conditions to Closing Acquisitions 

We intend to obtain at least a Phase I environmental assessment and history for each property we acquire. In addition, we will generally condition our obligation to close the purchase of any investment on the delivery and verification of certain documents from the seller or other independent professionals, including, but not limited to, where appropriate: 

&#8226; 

property surveys and site audits; 

&#8226; 

appraisal reports; 

&#8226; 

building plans and specifications, if available; 

&#8226; 

soil reports, seismic studies, flood zone studies, if available; 

&#8226; 

licenses, permits, maps and governmental approvals; 

&#8226; 

tenant estoppel certificates; 

&#8226; 

tenant financial statements and information, as permitted; 

&#8226; 

historical financial statements and tax statement summaries of the properties; 

&#8226; 

proof of marketable title, subject to such liens and encumbrances as are acceptable to us; and 

&#8226; 

liability and title insurance policies. 

Joint Venture Investments 

We may acquire properties in joint ventures, some of which may be entered into with affiliates of our Advisor. We may also enter into joint ventures, general partnerships, co-tenancies and other participations, such as Delaware Statutory Trusts (DSTs) with real estate developers, owners and others for the purpose of owning and leasing real properties. Among other reasons, we may want to acquire properties through a joint venture with third parties or affiliates in order to diversify our portfolio of properties in terms of geographic region or property type. Joint ventures may also allow us to acquire an interest in a property without requiring that we fund the entire purchase price. In addition, certain properties may be available to us only through joint ventures. In determining whether to recommend a particular joint venture, our Advisor will evaluate the real property which such joint venture owns or is being formed to own under the same criteria that the Advisor uses to evaluate other real estate investments. 

We may enter into joint ventures with affiliates of our Advisor for the acquisition of properties, but only provided that: 

&#8226; 

a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction, approve the transaction as being fair and reasonable to us; and 

&#8226; 

the investment by us and such affiliate are on substantially the same terms and conditions. 

To the extent possible and if approved by our board of directors, including a majority of our independent directors, we will attempt to obtain a right of first refusal or option to buy the property held by the joint venture and allow such venture partners to exchange their interest for our operating partnership&#8217;s units or to sell their interest to us in its entirety. In the event that the venture partner were to elect to sell property held in any such joint venture, however, we may not have sufficient funds to exercise our right of first refusal to buy the venture partner&#8217;s interest in the property held by the joint venture. Entering into joint ventures with affiliates of our Advisor will result in certain conflicts of interest. 

Construction and Development Activities 

From time to time, we may construct and develop real estate assets or render services in connection with these activities. We may be able to reduce overall purchase costs by constructing and developing a property versus purchasing a completed property. Developing and constructing properties would, however, expose us to risks such as cost overruns, carrying costs of projects under construction or development, completion guarantees, availability and costs of materials and labor, weather conditions and government regulation. To comply with the applicable requirements under federal income tax law, we intend to limit our construction and development activities to performing oversight and review functions, including reviewing the construction design proposals, negotiating and contracting for feasibility studies and supervising compliance with local, state or federal laws and regulations, negotiating contracts, overseeing construction, and obtaining financing. In addition, we may use taxable REIT subsidiaries or certain independent contractors to carry out these oversight and review functions. We will retain independent contractors to perform the actual construction work. 

Government Regulations 

Our business will be subject to many laws and governmental regulations. Changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and courts, occur frequently. 

We and any operating subsidiaries that we may form may be subject to state and local tax in states and localities in which they or we do business or own property. The tax treatment of us, our operating partnership, any operating subsidiaries we may form and the holders of our shares in local jurisdictions may differ from our federal income tax treatment. 

Americans with Disabilities Act 

Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or ADA, all public accommodations and commercial facilities are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. These requirements became effective in 1992. Complying with the ADA requirements could require us to remove access barriers. Failing to comply could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or an award of damages to private litigants. Although we intend to acquire properties that substantially comply with these requirements, we may incur additional costs to comply with the ADA. In addition, a number of additional federal, state and local laws may require us to modify any properties we purchase, or may restrict further renovations thereof, with respect to access by disabled persons. Additional legislation could impose financial obligations or restrictions with respect to access by disabled persons. Although we believe that these costs will not have a material adverse effect on us, if required changes involve a greater amount of expenditures than we currently anticipate, our ability to make expected distributions could be adversely affected. 

Environmental Matters 

Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances. These laws often impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator was responsible for, or even knew of, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of investigating, removing or remediating these substances may be substantial, and the presence of these substances may adversely affect our ability to rent properties or sell the property or to borrow using the property as collateral and may expose us to liability resulting from any release of or exposure to these substances. If we arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances at another location, we may be liable for the costs of removing or remediating these substances at the disposal or treatment facility, whether or not the facility is owned or operated by us. We may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from a site that we own or operate. Certain environmental laws also impose liability in connection with the handling of or exposure to asbestos-containing materials, pursuant to which third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with asbestos-containing materials and other hazardous or toxic substances. We maintain a pollution insurance policy for all of our properties to insure against the potential liability of remediation and exposure risk. 

Other Regulations 

The properties we acquire likely will be subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as zoning and state and local fire and life safety requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of fines by governmental authorities or awards of damages to private litigants. We intend to acquire properties that are in material compliance with all such regulatory requirements. However, we cannot assure you that these requirements will not be changed or that new requirements will not be imposed which would require significant unanticipated expenditures by us and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Disposition Policies 

We generally intend to hold each property we acquire for an extended period. However, we may sell a property at any time if, in our judgment, the sale of the property is in the best interests of our stockholders. 

The determination of whether a particular property should be sold or otherwise disposed of will generally be made after consideration of relevant factors, including prevailing economic conditions, other investment opportunities and considerations specific to the condition, value and financial performance of the property. In connection with our sales of properties, we may lend the purchaser all or a portion of the purchase price. In these instances, our taxable income may exceed the cash received in the sale. 

We may sell assets to third parties or to affiliates of our Advisor. Our nominating and corporate governance committee of our board of directors, which is comprised solely of independent directors, must review and approve all transactions between us and our Advisor and its affiliates. 

Investment Limitations in Our Charter 

Our charter places numerous limitations on us with respect to the manner in which we may invest our funds, most of which are those typically required by various provisions of the Statement of Policy Regarding Real Estate Investment Trusts published by the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA REIT Guidelines). Pursuant to the NASAA REIT Guidelines, we will not: 

&#8226; 

Invest in equity securities unless a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction approve such investment as being fair, competitive and commercially reasonable. 

&#8226; 

Invest in commodities or commodity futures contracts, except for futures contracts when used solely for the purpose of hedging in connection with our ordinary business of investing in real estate assets and mortgages. 

&#8226; 

Invest in real estate contracts of sale, otherwise known as land sale contracts, unless the contract is in recordable form and is appropriately recorded in the chain of title. 

&#8226; 

Make or invest in mortgage loans unless an appraisal is obtained concerning the underlying property, except for those mortgage loans insured or guaranteed by a government or government agency. In cases where our independent directors determine, and in all cases in which the transaction is with any of our directors or our Advisor and its affiliates, we will obtain an appraisal from an independent appraiser. We will maintain such appraisal in our records for at least five years and it will be available to our stockholders for inspection and duplication. We will also obtain a mortgagee&#8217;s or owner&#8217;s title insurance policy as to the priority of the mortgage or condition of the title. 

&#8226; 

Make or invest in mortgage loans, including construction loans, on any one property if the aggregate amount of all mortgage loans on such property would exceed an amount equal to 85% of the appraised value of such property, as determined by an appraisal unless substantial justification exists for exceeding such limit because of the presence of other loan underwriting criteria. 

&#8226; 

Make or invest in mortgage loans that are subordinate to any mortgage or equity interest of any of our directors, our Advisor or their respective affiliates. 

&#8226; 

Make investments in unimproved property or indebtedness secured by a deed of trust or mortgage loans on unimproved property in excess of 10% of our total assets. 

&#8226; 

Issue equity securities on a deferred payment basis or other similar arrangement. 

&#8226; 

Issue debt securities in the absence of adequate cash flow to cover debt service. 

&#8226; 

Issue equity securities that are assessable after we have received the consideration for which our board of directors authorized their issuance. 

&#8226; 

Issue &#8220;redeemable securities&#8221; redeemable solely at the option of the holder, which restriction has no effect on our ability to implement our share redemption program. 

&#8226; 

Grant warrants or options to purchase shares to our Advisor or its affiliates or to officers or directors affiliated with our Advisor except on the same terms as options or warrants that are sold to the general public. Further, the amount of the options or warrants cannot exceed an amount equal to 10% of outstanding shares on the date of grant of the warrants and options. 

&#8226; 

Lend money to our directors, or to our Advisor or its affiliates, except for certain mortgage loans described above. 

Changes in Investment Policies and Limitations 

Our charter requires that our independent directors review our investment policies at least annually to determine that the policies we are following are in the best interests of our stockholders. Each determination and the basis therefor is required to be set forth in the applicable meeting minutes. The methods of implementing our investment policies may also vary as new investment techniques are developed. The methods of implementing our investment objectives and policies, except as otherwise provided in our charter, may be altered by a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, without the approval of our stockholders. The determination by our board of directors that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to be qualified as a REIT shall require the concurrence of two-thirds of the board of directors. Investment policies and limitations specifically set forth in our charter, however, may only be amended by a vote of the stockholders holding a majority of our outstanding shares. 

Investments in Mortgages 

While we intend to emphasize on equity real estate investments and, hence, operate as what is generally referred to as an &#8220;equity REIT,&#8221; as opposed to a &#8220;mortgage REIT,&#8221; we may invest in first or second mortgage loans, mezzanine loans secured by an interest in the entity owning the real estate or other similar real estate loans consistent with our REIT status so long as our charter allows. We may make such loans to developers in connection with construction and redevelopment of real estate properties. Such mortgages may or may not be insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration, the Veterans Benefits Administration or another third party. We may also invest in participating or convertible mortgages if our directors conclude that we and our stockholders may benefit from the cash flow or any appreciation in the value of the subject property. Such mortgages are similar to equity participation. 

Affiliate Transaction Policy 

Our board of directors has established a nominating and corporate governance committee, which will review and approve all matters the board believes may involve a conflict of interest. This committee is composed solely of independent directors. This committee of our board of directors will approve all transactions between us and our Advisor and its affiliates. We will not acquire any properties in which our sponsor, or its affiliates, owns an economic interest. 

Investment Company Act and Certain Other Policies 

We intend to operate in such a manner that we will not be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act). Our Advisor will continually review our investment activity to attempt to ensure that we do not come within the application of the 1940 Act. Among other things, our Advisor will attempt to monitor the proportion of our portfolio that is placed in various investments so that we do not come within the definition of an &#8220;investment company&#8221; under the 1940 Act. If at any time the character of our investments could cause us to be deemed as an investment company for purposes of the 1940 Act, we will take all necessary actions to attempt to ensure that we are not deemed to be an &#8220;investment company.&#8221; In addition, we do not intend to underwrite securities of other issuers or actively trade in loans or other investments. 

Subject to the restrictions we must follow in order to qualify to be taxed as a REIT, we may make investments other than as previously described in this report, although we do not currently intend to do so. We have authority to purchase or 

otherwise reacquire our shares of common stock or any of our other securities. We have no present intention of repurchasing any of our shares of common stock except pursuant to our share redemption program, and we would only take such action in conformity with applicable federal and state laws and the requirements for qualifying as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). 

Employees 

We have no employees. The employees of our Advisor provide management, acquisition, advisory and certain administrative services for us. 

Industry Segments
