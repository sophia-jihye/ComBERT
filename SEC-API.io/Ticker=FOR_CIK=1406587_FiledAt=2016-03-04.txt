Business 

Overview 

Forestar Group Inc. is a residential and mixed-use real estate development company. We own directly or through ventures interests in 58 residential and mixed-use projects comprised of 7,000 acres of real estate located in 11 states and 15 &#32;markets. We also own 590,000 net acres of oil and gas fee mineral interests located in Texas, Louisiana, Georgia and Alabama. In addition, we own interests in various other assets that have been identified as non-core that the company will exit opportunistically over time. Our non-core assets include our investment in oil and gas working interests, 89,000 acres of timberland and undeveloped land and commercial and income producing properties, which consists of one hotel, seven multifamily properties and two multifamily sites. In 2015 , we had revenues of $262 million &#32;and net loss of $213 million . Unless the context otherwise requires, references to &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and &#8220;Forestar&#8221; mean Forestar Group Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Unless otherwise indicated, information is presented as of December 31, 2015 , and references to acreage owned include approximate acres owned by us and ventures regardless of our ownership interest in a venture.

&#8226; 

Providing additional information. 

Business Segments 

We manage our operations through three business segments: 

&#8226; 

Real estate, 

&#8226; 

Oil and gas, and 

&#8226; 

Other natural resources. 

Our real estate segment provided approximately 77% percent of our 2015 &#32;consolidated revenues. We are focused on maximizing real estate value through the entitlement and development of strategically located residential and mixed-use communities. We secure entitlements by delivering thoughtful plans and balanced solutions that meet the needs of communities where we operate. Residential development activities target lot sales to local, regional and national homebuilders who build quality products and have strong and effective marketing and sales programs. The lots we develop in the majority of our communities are for mid-priced homes, predominantly in the first and second move up categories. We invest in projects principally in regions across the southern half of the United States that possess key demographic and growth characteristics that we believe make them attractive for long-term real estate investment. A majority of our active real estate projects are developed on land we or our ventures acquired in the open market. We also develop and own directly or through ventures, multifamily communities as income producing properties, principally in our target markets. On January 28, 2016, we announced that multifamily is a non-core business. As a result, we plan to opportunistically exit our multifamily portfolio and no longer allocate capital to new communities in this business. 

Our oil and gas segment provided 20% percent of our 2015 &#32;consolidated revenues. We promote the exploration, development and production of oil and gas on our owned and leasehold mineral interests. These interests include 590,000 core owned mineral acres and 228,000 &#32;net mineral acres leased from others, which represent oil and gas working interests and have been identified as non-core. 

Our other natural resources segment provided 3% percent of our 2015 &#32;consolidated revenues. We sell wood fiber from our land, primarily in Georgia, and lease land for recreational uses. We have 89,000 acres of non-core timberland and undeveloped land we own directly or through ventures. In addition, we have water interests in 1.5 million acres, including a 45 percent nonparticipating royalty interest in groundwater produced or withdrawn for commercial purposes or sold from 1.4 million acres in Texas, Louisiana, Georgia and Alabama, and 20,000 acres of groundwater leases in central Texas. 

Our real estate origins date back to the 1955 incorporation of Lumbermen&#8217;s Investment Corporation, which in 2006 changed its name to Forestar (USA) Real Estate Group Inc. We have a decades long legacy of residential and commercial real estate development operations, primarily in Texas. Our oil and gas origins date back to the mid-1940s when we started leasing 

our oil and gas mineral interests to third-party exploration and production companies. In 2007, Temple-Inland distributed all of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock to its stockholders, which we will refer to as the &#8220;spin-off&#8221;. 

Our results of operations, including information regarding our business segments, are discussed in Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

2015 Significant Highlights (including ventures): 

Real Estate 

&#8226; 

Sold 1,472 developed residential lots; average gross profit of approximately $34,400 per lot 

&#8226; 

Sold 13,862 acres of undeveloped land for almost $2,300 per acre 

&#8226; 

Sold 63 commercial acres for approximately $248,300 per acre 

&#8226; 

Sold 1,062 residential tract acres for almost $10,600 per acre 

&#8226;

Oil and Gas 

&#8226; 

Incurred non-cash impairment charges of approximately $164.8 million related to unproved leasehold interests and proved properties principally due to the significant decline in oil prices and likelihood these non-core assets will be sold 

&#8226; 

Sold approximately 109,000 net leasehold mineral acres and 39 gross (7 net) producing wells for $17.8 million, primarily in Nebraska, Texas and North Dakota 

Other Natural Resources 

&#8226; 

Sold nearly 227,000 tons of fiber for $13.50 per ton 

Real Estate 

In our real estate segment, we conduct project planning and management activities related to the acquisition, entitlement, development and sale of real estate, primarily residential and mixed-use communities, which we refer to as community development. We own and manage our projects either directly or through ventures, which we use to achieve a variety of business objectives, including more effective capital deployment, risk management, and leveraging a partner&#8217;s local market contacts and expertise. Our development projects are principally located in the major markets of Texas. 

We have three &#32;real estate projects representing 4,400 acres currently in the entitlement process, which includes obtaining zoning and access to water, sewer and roads. Additional entitlements, such as flexible land use provisions, annexation, and the creation of local financing districts generate additional value for our business and may provide us the right to reimbursement of major infrastructure costs. We use return criteria, which include return on cost, internal rate of return, and cash multiples, when determining whether to invest initially or make additional investment in a project. When investment in development meets our return criteria, we will initiate the development process with subsequent sale of lots to home builders or for commercial tracts, internal development, sale to or venture with third parties. 

We have 58 &#32;entitled, developed or under development projects in 11 &#32;states and 15 &#32;markets encompassing 7,000 acres planned for residential and commercial uses. We may sell land at any point when additional time required for entitlement or investment in development will not meet our return criteria. &#32; I n 2015 , we sold approximately 14,000 acres of undeveloped land at an average price of almost $2,300 per acre. 

At year-end 2015, we have discontinued entitlement efforts on eight projects located in Georgia as we determined it is unlikely these will be developed and classified the acreage as higher and better use timberland. In addition, we have classified land associated with 12 projects as entitled undeveloped land as we determined it is unlikely these projects will be developed, resulting in a decrease of approximately 4,000 planned lots from our projects lot inventory.

&#160;_____________________ 

(a) &#160; 

A project is deemed to be in the entitlement process when customary steps necessary for the preparation of an application for governmental land-use approvals, such as conducting pre-application meetings or similar discussions with governmental officials, have commenced, or an application has been filed. Projects listed may have significant steps remaining, and there is no assurance that entitlements ultimately will be received. 

(b) &#160; 

Project acres, which are the total for the project regardless of our ownership interest, are approximate. The actual number of acres entitled may vary.

(a) &#160; 

Higher and better use timberland represents eight projects previously in the entitlement process. We have discontinued entitlement efforts as we determined it is unlikely these projects will be developed. 

(b) &#160; 

Entitled undeveloped land represents 12 projects and nearly 4,000 planned future lots previously included with our projects in the development process. We determined it is unlikely these projects will be developed. 

Products 

The majority of our projects are single-family residential and mixed-use communities. In some cases, commercial land uses within a project enhance the desirability of the community by providing convenient locations for resident support services. 

We develop lots for single-family homes and develop multifamily properties on our commercial tracts or other developed sites we may purchase. We sell residential lots primarily to local, regional and national home builders. We have 7,000 acres, principally in the major markets of Texas, comprised of land planned for about 13,900 residential lots. We generally focus our lot sales on the first and second move-up primary housing categories. First and second move-up segments are homes priced above entry-level products yet below the high-end and custom home segments. We also actively market and sell undeveloped land through our retail sales program. 

Commercial tracts are developed internally or ventured with commercial developers that specialize in the construction and operation of income producing properties, such as apartments, retail centers, or office buildings. We also sell land designated for commercial use to regional and local commercial developers. We have about 1,100 acres of entitled land designated for commercial use. 

Cibolo Canyons is a significant mixed-use project in the San Antonio market area. Cibolo Canyons includes 2,100 acres planned to include 1,769 &#32;residential lots, of which 997 &#32;have been sold as of year-end 2015 &#32;at an average price of $73,000 &#32;per lot. The residential component includes not only traditional single-family homes but also an active adult section, and is planned to include condominiums. The remaining 56 acres of commercial component is designated principally for multifamily and retail uses. Located at Cibolo Canyons is the JW Marriott &#174; &#32;San Antonio Hill Country Resort &#38; Spa (Resort), a 1,002 room 

destination resort and two PGA Tour &#174; &#32;Tournament Players Club &#174; &#32;(TPC) golf courses designed by Pete Dye and Greg Norman. We have the right to receive from the Cibolo Canyons Special Improvement District (CCSID) nine percent of hotel occupancy revenues and 1.5 percent of other resort sales revenues collected as taxes by CCSID through 2034 and reimbursement of certain infrastructure costs related to the mixed-use development. 

In 2014, we received $50,550,000 from CCSID principally related to its issuance of $48,900,000 Hotel Occupancy Tax (HOT) and Sales and Use Tax Revenue Bonds, resulting in recovery of our full Resort investment. These bonds are obligations solely of CCSID and are payable from HOT and sales and use taxes levied by CCSID. To facilitate the issuance of the bonds, we provided a $6,846,000 letter of credit to the bond trustee as security for certain debt service fund obligations in the event CCSID tax collections are not sufficient to support payment of the bonds in accordance with their terms. The letter of credit must be maintained until the earlier of redemption of the bonds or scheduled bond maturity in 2034. We also entered into an agreement with the owner of the Resort to assign its senior rights to us in exchange for consideration provided by us, including a surety bond to be drawn if CCSID tax collections are not sufficient to support ad valorem tax rebates payable. The surety bond decreases as CCSID makes annual ad valorem tax rebate payments, which obligation is scheduled to be retired in full by 2020.

Approximately 64 percent &#32;of our net investment in real estate is in the major markets of Texas. 

Markets 

Sales of new U.S. single-family homes rose to a seven-year high in December 2015, on a seasonally adjusted basis, but remain well below historical levels. Inventories of new homes are near historically low levels in many areas. In addition, declining finished lot inventories and limited supply of economically developable raw land has increased demand for our developed lots. However, national and global economic weakness and uncertainty, and a restrictive mortgage lending environment continue to threaten a robust recovery in the housing market, despite low interest rates. Multifamily market conditions continue to be strong, with many markets experiencing healthy occupancy levels and positive rent growth. This improvement has been driven primarily by limited housing inventory, reduced single-family mortgage credit availability, and the increased propensity to rent among the 18 to 34 year old demographic of the U.S. population. 

&#160; Competition 

We face significant competition for the acquisition, entitlement, development and sale of real estate in our markets. Our major competitors include other landowners who market and sell undeveloped land and numerous national, regional and local developers. In addition, our projects compete with other development projects offering similar amenities, products and/or locations. Competition also exists for investment opportunities, financing, available land, raw materials and labor, with entities that may possess greater financial, marketing and other resources than us. The presence of competition may increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell. These competitive market pressures sometimes make it difficult to acquire, entitle, develop or sell land at prices that meet our return criteria. Some of our real estate competitors are well established and financially strong, may have greater financial resources than we do, or may be larger than us and/or have lower cost of capital and operating costs than we have and expect to have. 

The land acquisition and development business is highly fragmented, and we are unaware of any meaningful concentration of market share by any one competitor. Enterprises of varying sizes, from individuals or small companies to large corporations, actively engage in the real estate development business. Many competitors are local, privately-owned companies. We have a few regional competitors and virtually no national competitors other than national home builders that, depending on business cycles and market conditions, may enter or exit the real estate development business in some locations to develop lots on which they construct and sell homes. During periods when access to capital is restricted, participants with weaker financial conditions tend to be less active. 

Oil and Gas 

Our oil and gas segment is focused on maximizing the value from our owned oil and gas mineral interests through promoting exploration, development and production activities by increasing acreage leased, lease rates, and royalty interests. 

We typically lease our owned mineral interests to third parties for exploration and production of oil and gas. When we lease our mineral interests, we may negotiate a lease bonus payment and retain a royalty interest. 

In addition, we are focused on exiting our non-core working interest oil and gas assets, principally in the Bakken/Three Forks of North Dakota and Lansing Kansas City formation of Nebraska and Kansas. We only intend to allocate capital going forward to these non-core assets to preserve value and optionality for the ultimate sale as we evaluate exiting these assets. 

Owned Mineral Interests 

We own mineral interests beneath 590,000 &#32;net acres located in the United States, principally in Texas, Louisiana, Georgia and Alabama. Our revenue from our owned mineral interests is primarily from oil and gas royalty interests, lease bonus payments and delay rentals received and other related activities. We engage in leasing certain portions of these mineral interests to third parties for the exploration and production of oil and gas. 

At year-end 2015 , of our 590,000 &#32;net acres of owned mineral interests, 535,000 &#32;net acres are available for lease. We have about 55,000 &#32;net acres leased for oil and gas exploration activities, of which about 42,000 &#32;net acres are held by production from over 534 &#32;gross oil and gas wells that are operated by others, in which we have royalty interest. In addition, we have working interest ownership in 31 of these wells.

(a) 

Includes ventures. 

(b) 

Includes leases in primary lease term or for which a delayed rental payment has been received. In the ordinary course of business, leases covering a significant portion of leased net mineral acres may expire from time to time in a single reporting period. 

(c) 

Acres being held by production are producing oil or gas in paying quantities. 

(d) 

Texas, Louisiana, California and Indiana net acres are calculated as the gross number of surface acres multiplied by our percentage ownership of the mineral interest. Alabama and Georgia net acres are calculated as the gross number of surface acres multiplied by our estimated percentage ownership of the mineral interest based on county sampling.

(a) 

Includes ventures. These owned mineral acre interests contain numerous oil and gas producing formations consisting of conventional, unconventional, and tight sand reservoirs. Of these reservoirs, we have mineral interests in and around production trends in the Wilcox, Frio, Cockfield, James Lime, Pettet, Travis Peak, Cotton Valley, Austin Chalk, Haynesville Shale, Barnett Shale and Bossier formations. 

(b) 

A significant portion of our Louisiana net mineral acres were severed from the surface estate shortly before our 2007 spin-off. Under Louisiana law, a mineral servitude that is not producing minerals or which has not been the subject of good-faith drilling operations will cease to burden the property upon the tenth anniversary of the date of its creation. Approximately 40,000 acres of our Louisiana owned net mineral acres may revert to the surface owner in 2017 unless drilling operations are commenced prior to the tenth anniversary of severance from the surface. 

We engage in leasing certain portions of our owned mineral interests to third parties for the exploration and production of oil and gas. Leasing mineral acres for exploration and production can create significant value because we may negotiate a lease bonus payment and retain a royalty interest in all revenues generated by the lessee from oil and gas production. The significant terms of these arrangements include granting the exploration company the rights to oil or gas it may find and requiring that drilling be commenced within a specified period. In return, we may receive an initial lease payment (bonus), subsequent payments if drilling has not started within the specified period (delay rentals), and a percentage interest in the value of any oil or gas produced (royalties). If no oil or gas is produced during the required period, all rights are returned to us. Historically, our capital requirements for our owned mineral acres have been minimal. 

Our royalty revenues are contractually defined and based on a percentage of production and are received in cash. Our royalty revenues fluctuate based on changes in the market prices for oil and gas, the decline in production in existing wells, and other factors affecting the third-party oil and gas exploration and production companies that operate wells on our minerals including the cost of development and production. 

Most leases are for a three to five year term although a portion or all of a lease may be extended by the lessee as long as actual production is occurring. Financial terms vary based on a number of market factors including the location of the mineral interest, the number of acres subject to the agreement, proximity to transportation facilities such as pipelines, depth of formations to be drilled and risk. 

Mineral Interests Leased 

As of year-end 2015 , our leasehold interests include 228,000 &#32;net mineral acres leased from others, principally located in Nebraska and Kansas primarily targeting the Lansing &#8211; Kansas City formation and in North Dakota primarily targeting the Bakken and Three Forks formations. We have 43,000 &#32;net acres held by production and 369 &#32;gross oil and gas wells with working interest ownership, of which 126 &#32;are operated by us. These assets have been identified as non-core and we plan to exit these assets over time and we only intend to allocate capital going forward only to preserve value and optionality of the ultimate sale as we evaluate exiting these assets.

We have 82,000 gross and 57,000 net undeveloped acres scheduled to expire in 2016. 

Nebraska and Kansas 

We have 163,000 net mineral acres primarily located on or near the Central Kansas Uplift formations located in the western Kansas counties of Graham, Lane, Thomas and Rawlins and in the southwest portion of Nebraska in the counties of Dundy, Red Willow and Hitchcock. At year-end 2015 , we own working interests in 135 gross producing wells with an average working interest of 51 percent. These assets were sold for $21.0 million in first quarter 2016. 

Oklahoma 

We have 31,000 net mineral acres located in the Anadarko Basin. At year-end 2015 , we own working interests in 76 gross producing wells with an average working interest of 39 percent. In first quarter 2016, we sold 16,700 net acres and 40 gross (8 net) wells in Oklahoma for $2.1 million. 

North Dakota 

We have 9,000 net acres in or near the core of the Bakken and Three Forks formations. Most of the acreage is located on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, south and west of the Parshall Field. We own working interests in 137 gross producing oil wells with an average working interest of 8 percent. Where a well has been drilled on a spacing unit, in many cases we expect additional development wells to be drilled on those spacing units in the future. 

Most leases are for a three to five year term although a portion or all of a lease may be extended as long as production is occurring. Financial terms vary based on a number of factors including the location of the leasehold interest, the number of acres subject to the agreement, proximity to transportation facilities such as pipelines, depth of formations to be drilled and risk. 

Estimated Proved Reserves 

Our net estimated proved oil and gas reserves, all of which are located in the United States, as of year-end 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;are set forth in the table below. We engaged independent petroleum engineers, Netherland, Sewell &#38; Associates, Inc.(NSAI), to assist us in preparing estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with the definitions and guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

We do not have any estimated reserves of synthetic oil, synthetic gas or products of other non-renewable natural resources that are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil and gas. 

At year-end 2015, we have no barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) of proved undeveloped (PUD) reserves based on our plan to exit non-core oil and gas working interest assets and only allocate capital to preserve value and optionality for the ultimate sale as we evaluate exiting these assets. At year-end 2014, we had 2,703,000 BOE of PUD reserves. The decline in PUD reserves is principally due to (i) downward revisions of 1,694,000 BOE related to the continued decline in oil and gas prices during 2015, (ii) the conversion of 610,000 BOE of PUD reserves to proved developed reserves, and (iii) various asset divestments which included 399,000 BOE of PUD reserves. As a percent of our total proved reserves, PUD reserves were 0% at year-end 2015 and 27% at year-end 2014. 

In 2015, we invested approximately $9,205,000 to convert 610,000 BOE of PUD reserves into proved developed reserves. 

Reserve estimates were based on the economic and operating conditions existing at year-end 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . Oil and gas prices are based on the twelve month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month in the period January through December. For 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , prices used for reserve estimates were $50.28 , $94.99 &#32;and $96.91 &#32;per barrel of West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil and gas prices of $2.59 , $4.35 &#32;and $3.67 &#32;per MMBTU per the Henry Hub spot market. All prices were then adjusted for quality, transportation fees and regional price differentials. Since the determination and valuation of proved reserves is a function of the interpretation of engineering and geologic data and prices for oil and gas and the cost to produce these reserves, the reserves presented should be expected to change as future information becomes available. For an estimate of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves, please read Note 19 &#32; &#8212; Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex, involving decisions and assumptions in evaluating the available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. Accordingly, these estimates are imprecise. Actual future production, oil and gas prices, capital costs, operating costs, revenues, taxes and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves might vary from those estimated. Any variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of proved reserves. In addition, estimates of proved reserves may be adjusted to reflect production history, development, prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. 

The primary internal technical person in charge of overseeing our reserves estimates has a Bachelor of Science in Physics and Mathematics and a Masters of Science in Civil Engineering. He has over 40 years of domestic and international experience in the exploration and production business including 40 years of reserve evaluations. He has been a registered Professional Engineer for over 25 years. 

As part of our internal control over financial reporting, we have a process for reviewing well production data and division of interest percentages prior to submitting well level data to NSAI to assist us in preparing reserve estimates. Our primary 

internal technical person and other members of management review the reserve estimates prepared by NSAI, including the underlying assumptions and estimates upon which they are based, for accuracy and reasonableness. 

Production 

In 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , oil and gas produced was approximately 1,158,500 , 931,100 &#32;and 697,700 &#32;barrels of oil at an average realized price of $40.08 , $80.63 &#32;and $89.40 &#32;per barrel and 2,134.8 , 2,060.2 &#32;and 2,158.5 &#32;MMcf of gas at an average realized price of $2.60 , $4.19 &#32;and $3.46 &#32;per Mcf. Natural gas liquids (NGLs) are aggregated with oil volumes and prices. 

In 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , production lifting costs, which exclude ad valorem and severance taxes, were $12.95, $13.40 and $10.35 per BOE related to 369 , 393 and 497 gross wells.

Excludes 1,200 overriding royalty interest wells. 

At year-end 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we have royalty interests in 534 , 551 &#32;and 547 &#32;gross wells. In addition, at year-end 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we have working interests in 400 , 426 &#32;and 497 &#32;gross wells. Our plugging liabilities are accrued on the balance sheet based on the present value of our estimated future obligation. 

We did not have any wells with production of synthetic oil, synthetic gas or products of other non-renewable natural resources that are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil and gas as of year-end 2015 , 2014 &#32;or 2013 . 

At year-end 2015 , our working interests represent approximately 114,000 gross developed acres and 43,000 &#32;net developed acres leased from others that are held by production. We had approximately 249,000 gross undeveloped acres and 185,000 &#32;net undeveloped acres at year-end 2015 . 

Markets 

Oil and gas revenues are influenced by prices of, and global and domestic supply and demand for, oil and gas. These commodities as determined by both regional and global markets depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including seasonality, the condition of the domestic and global economies, political conditions in other oil and gas producing countries, the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and gas, the proximity and capacity of gas pipelines and other transportation facilities, supply and demand for oil and gas and the effects of federal, state and local regulation. The oil and gas industry also competes with other industries in supplying the energy and fuel requirements of industrial, commercial and individual consumers. Global supply and demand fundamentals for crude oil at year-end 2015 remained out of balance with high global inventories and slower global growth. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices averaged $48.66 per Bbl in 2015, nearly 48% lower than in 2014, and ended 2015 at $37.13 per Bbl. OPEC continues to produce at record high levels, focused on maintaining market share, and the lifting of sanctions against Iran introduces additional supply into the global market. Estimates for global demand growth continue to be tempered and could extend the global supply glut, resulting in an extended period of low crude oil pricing. 

Mineral leasing activity is influenced by changes in commodity prices, the location of our owned mineral interests relative to existing or projected oil and gas reserves, the proximity of successful production efforts to our mineral interests and the evolution of new plays and improvements in drilling and extraction technology. 

Competition 

The oil and gas industry is highly competitive, and we compete with a substantial number of other companies that may have greater resources than us. Many of these companies explore for, produce and market oil and gas, carry on refining operations and market the end products on a worldwide basis. The primary areas in which we face competition are from alternative fuel sources, including coal, heating oil, imported LNG, nuclear and other nonrenewable fuel sources, and renewable fuel sources such as wind, solar, geothermal, hydropower and biomass. Competitive conditions may also be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation considered from time to time by the United States government. It is not possible to predict whether such legislation or regulation may ultimately be adopted or its precise effects upon our future operations. Such laws and regulations may, however, substantially increase the costs of exploring for, developing or producing oil and gas. 

In locations where our owned mineral interests are close to producing wells and proven reserves, we may have multiple parties interested in leasing our minerals. Conversely, where our mineral interests are in or near areas where reserves have not been discovered, we may receive nominal interest in leasing our minerals. Portions of our Texas and Louisiana minerals are in close proximity to producing wells and proven reserves. Interest in leasing our minerals is correlated with the economics of production which are substantially influenced by current oil and gas prices and improvements in drilling and extraction technologies. 

Other Natural Resources 

We sell wood fiber from portions of our land, primarily in Georgia, and lease land for recreational uses. We have 89,000 acres of non-core timberland and undeveloped land we own directly or through ventures. At year-end 2015 , approximately 99 percent of available acres of our land including ventures, primarily in Georgia, are leased for recreational purposes. Most recreational leases are for a one-year term but may be terminated by us on 30 days&#8217; notice to the lessee. These leases do not inhibit our ability to harvest timber. We have water interests in 1.5 million acres which includes a 45 percent nonparticipating royalty interest in groundwater produced or withdrawn for commercial purposes or sold from 1.4 million acres in Texas, Louisiana, Georgia and Alabama, and 20,000 acres of groundwater leases in central Texas. We have not received significant revenues or earnings from these interests. 

Competition 

We face significant competition from other landowners for the sale of wood fiber. Some of these competitors own similar timber assets that are located in the same or nearby markets. However, due to its weight, the cost for transporting wood fiber long distances is significant, resulting in a competitive advantage for timber that is located reasonably close to paper and building products manufacturing facilities. A significant portion of our wood fiber is reasonably close to such facilities so we expect continued demand for our wood fiber. 

Employees 

At year-end 2015, we had 106 employees. None of our employees participate in collective bargaining arrangements. We believe we have a good relationship with our employees. 

Environmental Regulations 

Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances relating to protection of public health and the environment. Changes to laws and regulations may adversely affect our ability to develop real estate, produce oil and gas, harvest and sell timber, or withdraw groundwater, or may require us to investigate and remediate contaminated properties.These laws and regulations may relate to, among other things, water quality, endangered species, protection and restoration of natural resources, timber harvesting practices, production of hydrocarbons and remedial standards for contaminated property and groundwater. Additionally, these laws may impose liability on property owners or operators for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on real property, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of, or the failure to properly remediate, such substances may adversely affect the value of a property, as well as our ability to sell the property or to borrow funds using that property as collateral or the ability to produce oil and gas from that property. Environmental claims generally would not be covered by our insurance programs. 

The particular environmental laws that apply to any given site vary according to the site&#8217;s location, its environmental condition, and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties. Environmental laws and conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance or other costs and can prohibit or severely restrict development activity or mineral production in environmentally sensitive regions or areas, which could negatively affect our results of operations. 

At year-end 2015, we owned 288 acres in several parcels in or near Antioch, California, portions of which were sites of a paper manufacturing operation that are in remediation. The remediation is being conducted voluntarily with oversight by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control, or DTSC. We have received certificates of completion on all but one 80 &#32;acre tract, a portion of which includes subsurface contamination. We increased our reserves for environmental remediation by $689,000 from 2014 to 2015 due to additional testing and remediation requirements by state regulatory agencies. At year-end 2015, our accrued liability to complete remediation activities is $682,000 , which is included in other accrued expenses. 

Oil and gas operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations controlling the generation, use, processing, storage, transportation, disposal and discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations affect our operations and costs as a result of their impact on oil and gas production operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations, the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, the requirement that additional 

pollution controls be installed and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements. 

Compliance with environmental laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business, but has not had, to date, a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition or results of operations. It is not anticipated, based on current laws and regulations, that we will be required in the near future to expend amounts (whether for environmental control equipment, modification of facilities or otherwise) that are material in relation to our total development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations. However, given that such laws and regulations are subject to change, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the ultimate effect on our operations, financial condition and results of operations.
