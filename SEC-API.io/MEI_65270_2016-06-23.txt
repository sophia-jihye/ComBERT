&#160; 

Segments. &#32;Our business is managed and our financial results are reported on a segment basis, with those segments being Automotive, Interface, Power Products and Other. 

&#160; 

The Automotive segment supplies electronic and electro-mechanical devices and related products to automobile original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), either directly or through their tiered suppliers. Our products include integrated center consoles, hidden switches, ergonomic switches, transmission lead frames and sensors, which incorporate magneto-elastic sensing and other technologies, that monitor the operation or status of a component or system. 

&#160; 

The Interface segment provides a variety of copper and fiber-optic interface and interface solutions for the aerospace, appliance, commercial food service, computer, construction, consumer, material handling, medical, military, mining, networking, point-of-sale, storage, and telecommunications markets. Solutions include conductive polymers, connectors, custom cable assemblies, industrial safety radio remote controls, optical and copper transceivers, and solid-state field effect consumer touch panels. Services include the design and installation of fiber optic and copper infrastructure systems, and manufacturing active and passive optical components. 

&#160; 

The Power Products segment manufactures braided flexible cables, current-carrying laminated bus bars and devices, custom power-product assemblies, such as our PowerRail solution, high-current low voltage flexible power cabling systems and powder coated bus bars that are used in various markets and applications, including aerospace, computers, industrial and power conversion, military, telecommunications, and transportation. 

&#160; 

The Other segment includes medical devices, inverters and battery systems and insulated gate bipolar transistor solutions. Our medical devices business includes Dabir Surfaces which is our surface support technology aimed at pressure ulcer prevention. Methode is developing the technology for use by patients who are immobilized or otherwise at risk for pressure ulcers, including patients undergoing long-duration surgical procedures. The Other segment also included independent laboratories that provide services for qualification, testing and certification, and analysis of electronic and optical components. The independent laboratories were sold at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2015.

Our sales activities are directed by sales managers who are supported by field application engineers and other engineering personnel who work with customers to design our products into their systems. Our field application engineers also help us identify emerging markets and new products. Our products are sold through in-house sales staff and through independent manufacturers&#8217; representatives with offices throughout the world. Information about our sales and operations in different geographic regions is summarized in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements. Sales are made primarily to OEMs, either directly or through their tiered suppliers, as well as selling partners and distributors. 

&#160; 

Sources and Availability of Materials . The principal materials that we purchase include application-specific integrated circuits, coil and bar stock, ferrous and copper alloy sheets, glass, light-emitting diode ("LED") displays, plastic molding materials, precious metals, and silicon die castings. All of these items are available from several suppliers and we generally rely on more than one supplier for each item. We normally do not carry inventories of raw materials or finished products in excess of those reasonably required to meet production and shipping schedules. We did not experience any significant price increases in fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, we did experience some lower costs for certain commodities, primarily the cost of copper and resin-based products. 

&#160; 

Patents . The Company has been granted a number of patents in the U.S., Europe and Asia and has additional domestic and international patent applications pending related to our products. The Company's existing patents expire on various dates from 2016 to 2031. The Company seeks patents in order to protect the Company's interest in certain products and technologies, including our TouchSensor, magnetic torque sensing, medical devices and high-power distribution products. We do not believe any single patent is material to our business, nor would the expiration or invalidity of any patent have a material adverse effect on our business or our ability to compete. 

&#160; 

Seasonality . A significant portion of our business is dependent on automotive sales and the vehicle production schedules of our customers. The automotive market is cyclical and depends on general economic conditions, interest rates, fuel prices and consumer spending patterns. 

&#160; 

Material Customers . During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 , shipments to General Motors Corporation (&#8220;GM&#8221;) and Ford Motor Company (&#8220;Ford&#8221;), or their tiered suppliers, represented 49.5% and 11.5%, respectively, of consolidated net sales. Typically, our Ford and GM supply arrangements for each component part include a blanket purchase order and production releases. In general, a blanket purchase order is issued for each Ford and GM part as identified by the customer part number. Each such Ford and GM blanket purchase order accounted for less than 10.0% of our fiscal 2016 consolidated net sales. Each blanket purchase order includes standard terms and conditions, including price. In certain circumstances, we supply Ford or GM the requirements for a particular customer vehicle model for the life of the model, which can vary from three to seven years. Both Ford and GM order parts using production releases approved under the relevant blanket purchase order. The production releases are submitted by the various Ford and GM plants and include information regarding part quantities and delivery specifications. 

Backlog . Our backlog of orders was approximately $137.5 million at April 30, 2016, and $150.0 million at May 2, 2015. We expect that most of the backlog at April 30, 2016 will be shipped within fiscal 2017. 

&#160; 

Competitive Conditions . The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid changes due to technological improvements and developments. We compete with a large number of other manufacturers in each of our product areas; many of these competitors have greater resources and sales. Price, service and product performance are significant elements of competition in the sale of our products. 

&#160; 

Research and Development . We maintain a research and development program involving a number of professional employees who devote a majority of their time to the enhancement of existing products and to the development of new products and processes. Research and development costs primarily relate to product engineering and design and development expenses

and are classified as a component of our costs of goods sold on the Company's income statement. Expenditures for such activities amounted to $27.8 million, $24.5 million and $25.7 million for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters . Compliance with foreign, federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment has not materially affected our capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position. Currently, we do not have any environmental related lawsuits or material administrative proceedings pending against us. Further information as to environmental matters affecting us is presented in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. 

&#160; 

Employees. &#160; At April 30, 2016 &#32;and May 2, 2015 , we had 4,345 and 4,295 employees, respectively. We also from time to time employ part-time employees and hire independent contractors. As of April 30, 2016, our employees from our Malta and Mexico facilities, which account for approximately 65% of our total number of employees, are represented by collective bargaining agreements. We have never experienced a work stoppage and we believe that our employee relations are good.
