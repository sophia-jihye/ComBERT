Company Overview 

&#160; 

We develop, manufacture and sell light emitting diode (LED) chips and LED components. Our products are used primarily for general lighting applications, including street lights and commercial, industrial and residential lighting. Our LED chips may also be used in specialty industrial applications, such as ultraviolet, or UV, curing of polymers, LED light therapy in medical/cosmetic applications, counterfeit detection, LED lighting for horticulture applications, architectural lighting and entertainment lighting. 

&#160; 

Utilizing our patented and proprietary technology, our manufacturing process begins by growing upon the surface of a sapphire wafer, or substrate, several very thin separate semiconductive crystalline layers of gallium nitride, or GaN, a process known as epitaxial growth, on top of which a mirror&#8209;like reflective silver layer is then deposited. After the subsequent addition of a copper alloy layer and finally the removal of the sapphire substrate, we further process this multiple&#8209;layered material to create individual vertical LED chips. 

&#160; 

We package our LED chips into LED components, which we sell to distributors and a customer base that is heavily concentrated in a few select markets, including Taiwan, the United States and China (including Hong Kong). We also sell our &#8220;Enhanced Vertical,&#8221; or EV, LED product series in blue, white, green and UV in selected markets. We sell our LED chips to packagers or to distributors, who in turn sell to packagers. Our lighting products customers are primarily original design manufacturers, or ODMs, of lighting products and the end&#8209;users of lighting devices. We also contract other manufacturers to produce for our sale certain LED products, and for certain aspects of our product fabrication, assembly and packaging processes, based on our design and technology requirements and under our quality control specifications and final inspection process. 

&#160; 

We have developed advanced capabilities and proprietary know&#8209;how in: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

reusing sapphire substrate in subsequent production runs; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

optimizing our epitaxial growth processes to create layers that efficiently convert electrical current into light; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#183; 

employing a copper alloy base manufacturing technology to improve our chip&#8217;s thermal and electrical performance; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

utilizing nanoscale surface engineering to improve usable light extraction; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

developing a LED structure that generally consists of multiple epitaxial layers which are vertically&#8209;stacked on top of a copper alloy base; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

developing low cost Chip Scaled Packaging (CSP) technology. 

&#160; 

These technical capabilities enable us to produce LED chips and LED component products. We entered into a Foundry Services and Licensing Agreement with an ODM partner in December 2015 to assist us with the restructuring of our chips manufacturing operations. We granted our ODM partner a royalty-free, non-transferable, nonexclusive license to use our technology and intellectual property for internal use by the ODM partner&#8217;s employees at its facilities for the purpose of manufacturing, testing and supplying us its products. The ODM partner is working with us to enable it to ODM vertical chips for us using our vertical technology. We believe these capabilities, know-how and partnership should also allow us to reduce our manufacturing costs and our dependence on sapphire, a costly raw material used in the production of sapphire-based LED devices. 

&#160; 

We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on January 4, 2005 and sold our first LED chips in November 2005. We are a holding company for various wholly and majority owned subsidiaries. SemiLEDs Optoelectronics Co., Ltd., or Taiwan SemiLEDs, is our wholly owned operating subsidiary, where a substantial portion of our assets are held and located, where a portion of our research, development, manufacturing and sales activities take place, and where most of our employees are based. Taiwan SemiLEDs owns a 100% equity interest in Taiwan Bandaoti Zhaoming Co., Ltd., formerly known as Silicon Base Development, Inc., which is engaged in the research, development, manufacture, and substantial portion of marketing and sale of LED products. As of August 31, 2016, we also owned a 93% equity interest in Ning Xiang Technology Co., Ltd., or Ning Xiang, a company engaged in the design, manufacture and sale of lighting fixtures and systems. 

&#160; 

We also have interests in unconsolidated joint ventures that we have accounted for as equity method investments and as such have not consolidated for financial reporting purposes. As of August 31, 2016, we owned a 33% interest in SILQ (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. or SILQ, a joint venture established in Malaysia that is currently in the process of being dissolved. 

&#160; 

Recent Developments 

&#160; 

Settlement of Han Litigation. On April 22, 2016, we filed a complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Mr. Xiaoqing Han, the Chairman and CEO of Beijing Xiaoqing Environmental Protection Group for breach of the definitive common stock purchase agreement effective December 18, 2014 (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) for his failure to transfer the full purchase price from China. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, if Mr. Han did not purchase the shares before February 25, 2015, then he is required, upon written request by us, to pay us $3 million in liquidated damages plus the legal fees incurred by us relating to the sale. In October 2016, we executed a settlement agreement with Mr. Han with respect to our complaint against Mr. Han. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, Mr. Han is required to pay us $200 thousand by November 30, 2016, and we agreed to dismiss our claim for any further liquidated damages. 

&#160; 

Transition to Fabless Business Model. The transition toward the fabless business model has taken longer than we anticipated and customer demand for our products has been lower than expected, leading to a dramatic decline in revenues and increased losses. As a result, we incurred significant net loss for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, which included significant impairment charges on our long-lived assets associated with our chips and components manufacturing operation. Although our business and reputation could be seriously harmed if the challenges relating to the delay in the transition toward the fabless business model are not able to be resolved soon, we still believe it is the right model and should help us to lower our cash needs while evaluating other potential business opportunities. 

&#160;

Our Technology 

&#160; 

Our proprietary technology integrates copper alloy in a vertical LED structure. We first grow epitaxial layers on a sapphire wafer. The epitaxial layers are multiple doped GaN layers. At this point in the process, our structure has the following order: (i) sapphire; (ii) n&#8209;doped GaN (N&#8209;GaN); (iii) multi&#8209;quantum well layers (MQWs); and (iv) p&#8209;doped GaN (P&#8209;GaN). Next, we deposit and define (by patterning and etching) multiple metal layers on the P&#8209;GaN layer. These metal layers consist of several different mirror layers and copper alloy layers, which are deposited on top of the mirror layers by electroplating. The copper alloy metal layers, which are collectively called the P&#8209;Contact Metal Layer, create low resistance contact with the P&#8209;GaN layer. 

&#160; 

We then remove the sapphire wafer from the N&#8209;GaN layer through laser radiation, and the sapphire wafer is removed from the production line and recycled. The remaining device structure &#8212; consisting of the P&#8209;Contact Metal Layer on top of the epitaxial layers &#8212; is then ready for further processing. To complete our LED device structure, we then deposit and define additional metal layers on top of the N&#8209;GaN layers to achieve low resistance contact with the N&#8209;GaN layers. These additional metal layers are collectively called the N&#8209;Contact Metal Layer. 

&#160; 

After this process, our final LED chip structure is: (i) copper alloy metal layer; (ii) P&#8209;GaN; (iii) MQWs; (iv) N&#8209;GaN; and (v) N&#8209;contact Metal layer. Our final LED chip structure is diced into individual LED chips and then separated, tested and binned according to customer specifications, such as wavelength (color) and brightness. When a constant electrical current flows from our P&#8209;Contact Metal Layer to our N&#8209;Contact Metal Layer, light is generated in the MQWs and emitted through the surface of the N&#8209;GaN. 

&#160; 

A significant difference in our production process from conventional sapphire&#8209;based LED chip production is our ability to recycle and re&#8209;use the sapphire wafer multiple times. By reusing sapphire wafers, we reduce our dependence on sapphire and our wafer materials cost. In addition, the difference in the thermal expansion properties of the sapphire wafer and the doped GaN layers results in a &#8220;bowed&#8221; wafer due to the high temperatures used in the growth process. When the wafer &#8220;bows&#8221; significantly, the chip yield decreases substantially. Larger wafer sizes exacerbate the &#8220;bowing&#8221; effect. Our ability to remove the sapphire allows us to reduce wafer bowing during the patterning process. 

&#160; 

We believe that most conventional GaN LEDs grown on sapphire wafers are based on a lateral design. However, we believe a superior combination of both light output efficiency and heat removal is realized in a vertical LED chip design with a copper alloy metal structure. Among pure metals at room temperature, copper has the second highest electrical and thermal conductivity, after silver. Heat is generated by passing electrical current through resistive materials. In our vertical LED chips, electrical current flows from the low resistance copper alloy base to the epitaxial layers also with low electrical resistance, thereby resulting in lower heat generation. Furthermore, due to the high thermal conductivity of the copper alloy layer, the heat generated in our device is effectively conducted to the packaging materials, where it can be dissipated through a heat sink. The resulting lower operating temperature helps to maintain LED device performance and reliability. 

&#160; 

Once light is generated in the MQWs of our LED chips, the light is emitted out of the N&#8209;GaN surface. Our chip uses a high reflectivity metal between the copper alloy layer and the P&#8209;GaN surface that acts as a mirror to reflect light more effectively out of the internal structure of the device. In contrast, in conventional sapphire&#8209;based LED devices, leakage can occur when light escapes through the sides of the substrate or is converted to heat due to the higher internal resistance of the device. Furthermore, by optimizing the internal structure and surface of our epitaxial layers through our proprietary nanosurface engineering, a greater portion of light is extracted after generation within the device, whereas conventional sapphire&#8209;based LED devices have a semi&#8209;transparent contact layer (STCL) which absorbs and reduces the amount of light that can be emitted vertically from the chip. We are also developing various packaging technologies, such as component cost reducing Advanced Packaging Technology called CSP, Multi&#8209;Channel Emitters (MCE) and Chip&#8209;On&#8209;Board (COB). 

&#160; 

Our Products 

&#160; 

Our core products are LED components, which are the most important part of our business, as well as LED chips and lighting products. 

&#160; 

&#160;

LED Chips 

&#160; 

We produce a wide variety of blue, white, green and UV LED chips, including our EV LED product series, currently ranging from chip sizes of 380 microns, or &#181;m, by 380&#181;m to 1520&#181;m by 1520&#181;m. We sell our LED chips to packaging customers or to distributors, who in turn sell to packagers. Our LED chips are used primarily for applications in the general lighting market, including street lights and commercial, industrial and residential lighting. Our LED chips may also be used in specialty industrial applications, such as UV curing of polymers, LED light therapy in medical/cosmetic applications, counterfeit detection, LED lighting for horticulture applications, and architectural lighting. In August 2014, we launched our Enhanced Flip Chip, or EF, LED series and newest line of white chip scale packages, the ReadyMount&#8482; Enhanced CSP, or EC series. The EF series launched with the EF&#8209;B40, a blue 40&#8209;mil flip chip that simplifies the packaging and integration process by eliminating wire&#8209;bonding while increasing both lumen&#8209;density and decreasing the lumen&#8209;per&#8209;dollar value proposition while enabling packagers to use standard surface mount assembly techniques. By combining SemiLEDs&#8217; Enhanced Flip chip approach with our innovative ReadyWhite&#8482; phosphor technology, the EC delivers flexibility, reliability and manufacturability in a single 1.4mm &#215; 1.4mm low profile device. Rated for input power of up to 3W, the EC is a fully packaged white emitter SMD component, ready for surface mounting on any board level module or COB application, lowering capital costs and enabling extremely high lumen density configurations. In March 2015, we announced our Phosphor Converted, or PC LED chip series, including PC Red, PC Green, and PC Amber, in a 40mil (1mm &#215; 1mm) chip that combines with our ReadyWhite&#8482; phosphor technology to minimize blue pass through in our product and therefore allow more options for our customers in these color ranges. Revenues from sales of our LED chips represented 8% and 17% of our revenues for the years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

&#160; 

LED Components 

&#160; 

We currently package a portion of our LED chips into LED components for sale to distributors and end&#8209;customers in selected markets. The majority of our LED components use chips that are greater than 860&#956;m by 860&#956;m, focusing on high wattage (&#62;3W) applications. Our packaged products utilize high thermal conductivity aluminum nitride as the substrate and can be categorized into four different groups: UV, MCE, Automotives and Specialty lighting. Besides the standard products, we provide customization service for all market segments. Our UV LED product portfolio ranges from two to 200 electrical watts, and are designed for industrial applications such as printing, coating, curing, and medical/cosmetic uses. The MCE packages target entertainment, architectural, aquarium and horticultural lighting sectors. Variations of four, seven, 12, 16 channel LEDs allow users to control each LEDs separately to produce all colors in the visible light spectrum. We use specialized chip bonding technology to ensure minimal chip&#8209;to&#8209;chip distance in order to deliver optimized color mixing capability in compact packages. Automotive markets are technologically intensive sectors. We provide users with linear and tight light configuration that meets stringent customer demand. In July 2015, we received the Letter of Conformity for TS16949 automotive quality system certification. We intend to seek experienced partners to introduce our product to the new automotive market. We believe that an increase in public awareness and consumer interest as well as potential cost savings will generate a demand for automotive lighting technology. Specialty lighting consists of two products, 2016 series and infrared products. The 2016 series are used in smart phones camera flash modules while infrared products, with options of 30, 60, 90 and 120 degree view angles, are used in surveillance and IP cameras. In August 2015, we launched two UV COB module products: D4525 and D4825. These high density UV modules are suggested to be driven at 120W and 200W, respectively, with efficient thermal management. The modules are designed for various printing, curing, and PCB exposure industrial equipment, providing uncompromised reliability and optical output. Our LED components include different sizes and wattage to accommodate different demands in the LED market. 

&#160; 

To differentiate ourselves from other LED package manufacturers, we are putting more resources towards module and system design. Along with our technical know-how in the chip and package sectors, we are able to further integrate electrical, thermal and mechanical manufacturing resources to provide customers with one-stop system services. Services include design, prototyping, OEM and ODM. Key markets that we set to target at the system end include different types of UV LED industrial printers, aquarium lighting, medical applications, niche imaging light engines, horticultural lighting and high standard commercial lighting. 

&#160; 

Our packaging process includes chip bonding, wire bonding, phosphor coating, encapsulation, scribing, dicing and testing. We may, from time to time, establish packaging operations in selected markets for sale to distributors and 

&#160;

end&#8209;customers in such markets. We also contract with other manufacturers to produce for our LED components based on our design and technology requirements and under our quality control specifications and final inspection process. Revenues from sales of our LED components represented 76% and 65% of our revenues for the years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

&#160; 

Lighting Products 

&#160; 

We design, assemble and sell lighting fixtures and systems for general lighting applications, including commercial, residential and industrial lighting. Our lighting products consist primarily of LED luminaries and LED retrofits. Our lighting product customers are primarily ODMs of lighting products and the end&#8209;users of lighting devices. Revenues from sales of our lighting products represented 14% of our revenues for both the years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

Our manufacturing operations, including those of Ning Xiang, are located in Taiwan. Starting in the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2011 and continuing through the first quarter of our fiscal 2017, we have suffered from the underutilization of our manufacturing capacity, primarily for our LED chips. Consequently, a portion of our manufacturing equipment was idled, resulting in significant excess capacity charges. We also use contract manufacturers to produce certain LED products, and for certain aspects of our product fabrication, assembly and packaging processes, based on our design and technology requirements and under our quality control specifications and final inspection process. We anticipate moving toward a fabless business model in which we would utilize foundry fabs to ODM our chips using our developed technology. As part of the restructuring, we plan to consign or sell our chip manufacturing equipment to our ODM partner or others, which will help us to reduce the idle capacity costs. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials and Components 

&#160; 

We use the following raw materials in our LED chip manufacturing: metal organics, sapphire, copper alloy, gold slugs, sodium gold sulfite, aluminum granules and electrolytic nickel, among others. We use the following assembly materials in the production of our LED component products: gold bond wire, lead frame, ceramic substrate, phosphor, silicon zener&#8209;diode, silicone rubber, eutectic (AuSn) bonding material and silver paste, among others. We also purchase industrial and general chemicals and gases for the manufacture of both our LED chips and LED components. We do not manufacture our lighting products from the raw materials but we assemble our lighting products from individual components, such as LED emitters, electronic components, printed circuit boards, heat&#8209;sink, lenses and other metal and plastic components. 

&#160; 

We purchase raw materials and components from a wide range of suppliers around the world. The raw materials and components we use are readily available. We have two or more suppliers for a majority of the raw materials we use. Historically, we have never experienced any significant delay or shortage in the supply of our raw materials and components. 

&#160; 

Quality Management 

&#160; 

We have implemented quality control measures at each stage of our operations, including obtaining supplier qualifications, inspecting incoming raw materials and random testing during our production process, to ensure consistent product yield and reliability. We test all new processes and new products prior to commercial production. We also inspect all final products prior to delivery to our customers to ensure that production standards are met. If we encounter defects, we conduct an analysis in an effort to identify the cause of the defect and take appropriate corrective and preventative measures. We provide standard product warranties on our products, which generally range from three months to two years. Our manufacturing fabs located in Hsinchu Science Park, Taiwan, are certified in compliance with ISO9001:2008. All these facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the relevant governmental authorities for safety, environmental and other regulatory compliance. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We require all of our employees involved in the manufacturing and engineering process to receive quality control training, according to a certification system depending on the level of skills and knowledge required. The training program is designed to ensure consistent and effective application of our quality control procedures. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

We market and sell our products through both our direct sales force and distributors. We primarily sell our LED components to distributors and end&#8209;customers in selected markets, such as Taiwan, the United States and China. Our packaging customers package our LED chips and sell the packaged product to distributors or end&#8209;customers. Our distributors resell our LED chips either to packagers or to end&#8209;customers. We sell our LED chips to packagers and distributors. Our lighting product customers consist primarily of ODMs of lighting products and the end&#8209;users of lighting devices with the sales made by our and Ning Xiang&#8217;s direct sales force. 

&#160; 

Our direct sales force is primarily based in Taiwan. We assign our sales personnel to different geographic regions so that they can keep abreast of trends in specific markets. We plan to continue expanding our sales coverage in Asia as we grow our business. In addition, we may enter into strategic relationships with companies in Taiwan or other countries that we believe may provide strategic value to us. 

&#160; 

We focus our marketing efforts on brand awareness, product advantages and qualified lead generation. We rely on a variety of marketing strategies, including participation in industry conferences and trade shows, to share our technical message with customers, as well as public relations, industry research and online advertising. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

We package our LED chips into LED components, which we sell to distributors and end&#8209;customers in selected markets. In addition, we sell a portion of our LED chips products to packaging customers and LED chip distributors. Sales to distributors represented 4% and 8% of our revenues for the years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

&#160; 

We have historically derived a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers. For the years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, our top ten customers collectively accounted for 60% and 59%, respectively, of our revenues. Some of our largest customers and what we produce or have produced for them have changed from quarter to quarter primarily as a result of the timing of discrete, large project&#8209;based purchases and broadening customer base, among other things. For the years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, sales to our three largest customers, in the aggregate, accounted for 39% and 37% of our revenues, respectively. For the year ended August 31, 2016, sales to Revlon, Inc. and Illumitex, Inc. accounted for 23% and 11% of our total revenues, respectively. For the year ended August 31, 2015, sales to Revlon, Inc. and Beautyge Mexico, S.A. de C.V. accounted for 21% and 11% of our total revenues, respectively. 

&#160; 

Our revenues are concentrated in a few select markets, including Taiwan, the United States and China (including Hong Kong). Net revenues generated from sales to customers from these countries, in the aggregate, accounted for 79% and 71% of our net revenues for the years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We expect that our revenues will continue to be substantially derived from these countries for the foreseeable future. Given that we are operating in a rapidly changing industry, our sales in specific markets may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Therefore, our financial results will be impacted by general economic and political conditions in these markets. 

&#160; 

Our Joint Ventures and Investments 

&#160; 

We have grown our business in part through strategic alliances and acquisitions, and may from time to time continue to grow our operations by participating in joint ventures, making acquisitions or establishing other strategic alliances with third parties in the LED and LED&#8209;related industries. Although we have only a non-active joint venture, SILQ, which is in the process of being dissolved, we will continue to explore new opportunities for strategic alliances and acquisitions. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Our ability to compete successfully depends upon our ability to protect our proprietary technologies and other confidential information. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, licensees and third parties with whom we have relationships, and trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our intellectual property, including our proprietary technologies and trade secrets. 

&#160; 

As of August 31, 2016, we had 148 patents issued and 5 patents pending with the United States Patent and Trademark Office covering various aspects of our core technologies. As of August 31, 2016, we also had 182 patents issued and 9 patents pending before patent and trademark offices outside the United States. Of these 330 issued patents, 30 expire between the years 2017 and 2021, 134 expire between the years 2022 and 2026, 158 expire between the years 2027 and 2033, and 8 expire after year 2033. Ninety-four of our issued patents are design patents and one of our pending patents is a design patent. The foregoing numbers of issued and pending patents do not include those owned or filed by Ning Xiang. We believe that factors such as the technological and innovative abilities of our personnel, the success of our ongoing product development efforts and our efforts to maintain trade secret protection are more important than patents in maintaining our competitive position. We pursue the registration of certain of our trademarks in the United States, Taiwan and China and have been granted trademarks with respect to &#8220;SemiLEDs&#8221; in the United States and &#8220;MvpLED&#8221; in Taiwan, China and the United States. 

&#160; 

Our industry is characterized by frequent intellectual property litigation involving patents, trade secrets, copyrights, mask designs, among others. From time to time, third parties may allege that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights. Defending against any intellectual property infringement claims would likely result in costly litigation and ultimately may lead to our not being able to manufacture, use or sell products found to be infringing. Furthermore, other third parties may also assert infringement claims against our customers with respect to our products, or our customers&#8217; products that incorporate our technologies or products. Any such legal action or the threat of legal action against us, or our customers, could impair such customers&#8217; continued demand for our products. This could prevent us from growing or even maintaining our revenues, or cause us to incur additional costs and expenses, and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. See &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Our Business &#8212; Intellectual property claims against us or our customers could subject us to significant costs and materially damage our business and reputation.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We focus our research and development efforts on our design methodology and process technology for our LED products. We also focus on improving our production yields and increasing wafer sizes to lower our production costs. Our research and development team works closely with our manufacturing team. For the years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, we invested approximately $2.0 million and $2.4 million, respectively, in research and development activities. We conduct our research and development activities at our manufacturing facilities in Taiwan. Our future research and development strategy will primarily focus on developing new products in collaboration with our ODM partners utilizing our vertical technology and our expertise in the manufacturing of LED components. We expect to be continually engineering new products and systems, as well as enhancements to existing products, to meet the needs of our customers. By leveraging the fabless business model, we expect to be able to minimize our own research and development costs associated with chip products, increase the scale of our business without increasing overhead and diversify our business risk among many sales channels. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We believe that our advanced technology helps us to compete in the innovative, intensely competitive and rapidly changing market of LED design and manufacturing. To succeed, however, we must continue to manufacture products that meet the demanding requirements of high performance at low costs. We do not account for a significant percentage of the total market volume today, and we face significant competition from other more established providers of similar products as well as from new entrants into our markets. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We compete with many LED chip manufacturers and LED packaging manufacturers. With respect to our LED chips and LED components, we primarily compete with Cree, Seoul Viosys Co. Ltd. or SVC, Everlight, LiteOn, LED Engin, Nichia Corporation, or Nichia, Philips (Lumileds), Osram-OS GmbH and Edison Opto Corporation, or Edison. We have a number of competitors that compete directly with us and are much larger than us, including, among others, Cree, Nichia, Philips (Lumileds) and Osram-OS GmbH. Several substantially larger companies, such as Philips (Lumileds) and Osram-OS GmbH, compete against us with a relatively small segment of their overall business. In addition, several large and well&#8209;capitalized semiconductor companies, such as Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., or Samsung, LG Innotek Co., Ltd., or LG Innotek, have entered into the LED chip and UV market. These potential competitors have extensive experience in developing semiconductor chips, which is similar to the manufacturing process for LED chips and LED packaging. We are also aware of a number of well&#8209;funded private companies that are developing competing products. We will also compete with numerous smaller companies entering the market, some of whom may receive significant government incentives and subsidies pursuant to government programs designed to encourage the use of LED lighting and to establish LED&#8209;sector companies. 

&#160; 

Some of our existing and potential competitors possess significant advantages, including longer operating histories, greater financial, technical, managerial, marketing, distribution and other resources, more long&#8209;standing and established relationships with our existing and potential customers, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and greater government incentives and support. 

&#160; 

We believe that the key competitive factors in our markets are: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

consistently producing high&#8209;quality LED chips with high efficacy; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

balancing lumen output generation with providing low lumen cost; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

providing a low total cost of ownership (i.e., cost, efficacy and lifespan) for end&#8209;customers; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

producing UVA LED for niche markets where customers value quality and performance more than cost; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

our sales channels. 

&#160; 

Competition in the markets for LED products is intense, and we expect that competition will continue to increase, thereby creating a highly aggressive pricing environment. Some of our competitors have in the past reduced their average selling prices, and the resulting competitive pricing pressures have caused us to similarly reduce our prices, accelerating the decline in the gross margin of our products. When prices decline, we must also write down the value of our inventory. 

&#160; 

In the lighting market, we face competition from fixtures and bulbs manufactured and marketed by other LED lighting fixture companies and from lighting products incorporating incandescent, fluorescent, halogen, ceramic metal halide or other lighting technology. In addition to lighting companies such as Cree, Philips (Lumileds) and Osram-OS GmbH, which are substantially larger and more established than us, we are also competing with numerous smaller companies that have traditionally been in the lighting industry or recently entered into the LED lighting market. 

&#160; 

Environmental Regulation 

&#160; 

In our research and development and manufacturing processes, we use a variety of hazardous materials and industrial chemicals. In each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations governing the exposure to and storage, handling, emission, discharge and disposal of these materials or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Environmental laws and regulations are complex and subject to constant change, with a tendency to become more stringent over time. Failure to comply with any new or existing laws, whether intentional or inadvertent, could subject us to fines, penalties and other material liabilities to the government or third parties, injunctions requiring the suspension of operations, redemption costs or other remedies, and the need for additional capital, equipment or other process requirements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.
