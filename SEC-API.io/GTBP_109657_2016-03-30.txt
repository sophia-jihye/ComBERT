 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

&#160;

OXIS International, Inc., through its wholly owned subsidiary Oxis Biotech, Inc, is an immuno-oncology company with a robust technology platform consisting of bispecific and trispecific scFv constructs, full-length antibodies, proprietary drug payloads, proprietary antibody-drug linkers, dual-drug payload antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), bispecific targeted ADCs, and NK cell and T-cell antibody directed cell-mediated cytotoxic (ADDCs) agents. 

OXS-1550 

OXS-1550 is a bispecific scFv recombinant fusion protein-drug conjugate composed of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 antibodies and a modified form of diphtheria toxin as its cytotoxic drug payload. CD19 is a membrane glycoprotein present on the surface of all stages of B-lymphocyte development, and is also expressed on most B-cell mature lymphoma cells and leukemia cells. CD22 is a glycoprotein expressed on B-lineage lymphoid precursors, including precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and often is co-expressed with CD19 on mature B-cell malignancies such as lymphoma. 

OXS-1550 targets cancer cells expressing the CD19 receptor or CD22 receptor or both receptors. When OXS-1550 binds to cancer cells, the cancer cells internalize OXS-1550, and are killed due to the action of drug's cytotoxic diphtheria toxin payload. OXS-1550 has demonstrated success in a Phase 1 human clinical trial in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma or leukemia.

p62/SQSTM1 (Sequestosome-1) Inhibitor Drug Development Program 

&#160;

In humans, the p62/SQSTM1 protein is encoded by the SQSTM1 gene. The p62/SQSTM1 protein is a multifunctional protein involved in autophagy, cell signaling, tumorigenesis, and plays an important role at the crossroad between autophagy and cancer. Cell-cell interactions between multiple myeloma cells and bone marrow stromal cells activate signaling pathways that result in enhanced multiple myeloma cell growth, osteoclast formation, and inhibition of osteoblast differentiation. 

&#160;

Multiple myeloma remains an incurable malignancy with systematic morbidity and a median survival of 3-5 years. Multiple myeloma is characterized by aberrant proliferation of terminally differentiated plasma cells and impairment in apoptosis capacity. Due to the interactions between myeloma cells and cells of the bone marrow microenvironment, the osteolytic bone disease associated with myeloma is inextricably linked with tumor progression. High incidence of bone metastasis in multiple myeloma patients is frequently associated with severe bone pain and pathological bone fracture. Activated osteoclast levels and suppressed osteoblast levels are thought to play a role in multiple myeloma associated osteolytic bone disease. 

&#160;

While a diverse spectrum of novel agents has shown therapeutic potential for the treatment of multiple myeloma including bortezomib, lenalidomide and arsenic trioxide, high relapse rates and drug resistance continue to plague these therapies. Thus, novel targets and new therapeutics for the treatment of multiple myeloma are of critical importance for improved patient outcomes. 

&#160;

It has been demonstrated that the ZZ domain of the p62/SQSTM1 protein is responsible for increased multiple myeloma cell growth and associated osteoclast mediated bone disease. Dr. Xiang-Qun Xie and colleagues at ID4 Pharma LLC have developed novel chemical compounds (e.g., OXS-4235) which inhibit osteoclastic bone destruction in multiple myeloma. Oxis Biotech has exclusively licensed rights to OXS-4135 and other compounds for the treatment of multiple myeloma and associated osteolytic bone disease. 

&#160;

Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Drug Development Program OXS-2175 

&#160;

OXS-2175 is a small molecule therapeutic candidate which has shown promise in early-stage preclinical in vitro and in vivo models of triple-negative breast cancer. Oxis Biotech is investigating OXS-2175 formulated as an infusible therapy, and as part of an ADC infusible therapy for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer. 

&#160;

Therapeutic Antibody-Drug Conjugates Drug Development Program 

&#160;

Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a new class of highly potent biopharmaceutical drugs designed as a targeted therapy for the treatment of cancer. By combining the unique targeting capabilities of monoclonal antibodies with the cancer-killing ability of cytotoxic drugs, antibody-drug conjugates allow sensitive discrimination between healthy and diseased tissue. 

&#160;

Markets 

&#160;

Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) 

&#160;

According to the American Cancer Society there were approximately 231,840 new cases of invasive breast cancer last year in the USA and 40,290 deaths from breast cancer during the same period. Women represent 99% of all breast cancer patients. Breast cancer is treated by various combinations of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy. TNBC is a type of breast cancer characterized by breast cancer cells that do not express estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, or large amounts of HER2/neu protein. Approximately 10% - 20% percent of invasive breast cancers are diagnosed as triple-negative breast cancers. TNBC is more likely to affect younger people, African Americans or Hispanics, and those with a BRCA1 gene mutation. 2 TNBC is insensitive to many of the most effective therapies available for the treatment of breast cancer including the HER2-directed therapy Herceptin&#174; (trastuzumab), and endocrine therapies such as tamoxifen or the aromatase inhibitors. The relapse and survival rates of TNBC patients are shorter than for patients with other types of breast cancer.

&#160; 

&#160;

Multiple Myeloma 

&#160;

Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer that forms in white blood cells, and affects about 26,850 people annually in the USA causing about 11,240 deaths per year. Multiple myeloma causes cancer cells to accumulate in the bone marrow, where they crowd out healthy blood cells. Multiple myeloma is also characterized by destructive lytic bone lesions (rounded, punched-out areas of bone), diffuse osteoporosis, bone pain, and the production of abnormal proteins which accumulate in the urine. Anemia is also present in most multiple myeloma patients at the time of diagnosis and during follow-up. Anemia in multiple myeloma is multifactorial, and is secondary to bone marrow replacement by malignant plasma cells, chronic inflammation, relative erythropoietin deficiency, and vitamin deficiency. Plasma cell leukemia, a condition in which plasma cells comprise greater than 20% of peripheral leukocytes, is typically a terminal stage of multiple myeloma and is associated with short survival. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to rapid technological change. Competition from domestic and foreign biotechnology companies, large pharmaceutical companies and other institutions is intense and expected to increase. A number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals in our targeted areas. According to the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Research Association, at the end of 2015 there were 168 drugs in development for the treatment of breast cancer, and there were 135 drugs in development for the treatment of lymphomas (blood cell cancers including multiple myeloma).

Government Regulation 

&#160;

United States 

Our research and development activities and the future manufacturing and marketing of any products we develop are subject to significant regulation by numerous government authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act govern the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, and distribution of our drug candidates and any products we may develop. In addition, this regulatory framework is subject to changes that may adversely affect approval, delay an application or require additional expenditures. 

The steps required before a pharmaceutical compound may be marketed in the United States include: preclinical laboratory and animal testing; submission of an IND to the FDA, which must become effective before clinical trials may commence; conducting adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug; submission of a New Drug Application, or NDA, or Biologics License Application, or BLA, to the FDA; satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP; and FDA approval of the NDA or BLA prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the drug. In addition to obtaining FDA approval for each product, each drug-manufacturing establishment used must be registered with the FDA and be operated in conformity with cGMP. Drug product manufacturing facilities may also be subject to state and local regulatory requirements. 

Preclinical testing includes laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and animal studies to assess the safety and efficacy of the product and its formulation. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, and, unless the FDA objects, the IND becomes effective 30 days following its receipt by the FDA. 

Clinical trials involve administration of the study drug to healthy volunteers and to patients diagnosed with the condition for which the study drug is being tested under the supervision of qualified clinical investigators. Clinical trials are conducted in accordance with protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol is submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Each clinical trial is conducted under the auspices of an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, in the United States, or Ethics Committee, or EC, outside the United States, for each trial site. The IRB or EC considers, among other matters, ethical factors and the safety of human clinical trial subjects. 

Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be repeated. In Phase 1 clinical trials, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients and is tested for adverse effects, dosage tolerance, pharmacokinetics, and clinical pharmacology. Phase 2 clinical trials involve the testing of a limited patient population in order to characterize the actions of the drug in targeted indications, in order to determine drug tolerance and optimal dosage and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. When a compound appears to be effective at a specific dosage and have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 clinical trials, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate and confirm clinical efficacy and safety within an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. The FDA reviews the clinical plans and monitors the results of the trials and may discontinue the trials at any time if significant safety issues arise. Similarly, an IRB or EC may suspend or terminate a trial at a study site that is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB or EC&#8217;s requirements or that has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects. 

The results of preclinical testing and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA for marketing approval in the form of an NDA or BLA. The submission of an NDA or BLA also requires the payment of user fees, but a waiver of the fees may be obtained under specified circumstances. The testing and approval process is likely to require substantial time, effort and resources and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all, or that conditions of any approval, such as warnings, contraindications, or scope of indications will not materially impact the potential market acceptance and profitability of the drug product. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The approval process is affected by a number of factors, including the severity of the disease, the availability of alternative treatments and the risks and benefits of the product demonstrated in clinical trials. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Additional preclinical testing or clinical trials may be requested during the FDA review period and may delay any marketing approval. After FDA approval for the initial indications, further clinical trials may be necessary to gain approval for the use of the product for additional indications. In addition, after approval, certain types of changes to the approved product, such as manufacturing changes, are subject to further FDA review and approval. The FDA mandates that adverse effects be reported to the FDA, and the regulatory agency may also require post-marketing testing to continue monitoring for expected and unexpected adverse effects, which can involve significant expense. Adverse effects observed during the commercial use of a drug product or which arise in the course of post-marketing studies can result in the need for labeling revisions, including additional warnings and contraindications; and if the findings significantly alter the risk/benefit assessment, the potential withdrawal of the drug from the market. 

Among the conditions for FDA approval is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer&#8217;s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to the FDA&#8217;s cGMP requirements. Domestic manufacturing facilities are subject to biannual FDA inspections and foreign manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. If the FDA finds that a company is not operating in compliance with cGMPs, the continued availability of the product can be interrupted until compliance is achieved; and if the deficiencies are not corrected within a reasonable time frame, the drug could be withdrawn from the market. In addition, the FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising and promotion of drugs. Failure to conform to requirements relating to licensing, manufacturing and promoting drug products can result in informal or formal sanctions, including warning letters, injunctions, seizures, civil and criminal penalties, adverse publicity and withdrawal of approval. 

Foreign 

We are also subject to numerous and varying foreign regulatory requirements governing the design and conduct of clinical trials and marketing approval for pharmaceutical products to be marketed outside of the United States. The approval process varies among countries and regions and can involve additional testing; and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. 

The steps to obtain approval to market a pharmaceutical compound in the European Union include: preclinical laboratory and animal testing; conducting adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy; submission of a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA; and the issuance of a product marketing license by the European Commission prior to any commercial sale or shipment of drug. In addition to obtaining a product marketing license for each product, each drug manufacturing establishment must be registered with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, must operate in conformity with European good manufacturing practice and must pass inspections by the European health authorities. 

Upon receiving the MAA, the Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, a division of the EMA, will review the MAA and may respond with a list of questions or objections. Answers to questions posed by the CHMP may require additional tests to be conducted. Responses to the list of questions or objections must be provided to and deemed sufficient by the CHMP within a defined time frame. Ultimately, a representative from each of the European Member States will vote whether to approve the MAA. 

Foreign regulatory approval processes include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval, and approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by the health authorities of any other country. 

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had two employees, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the company. Many of our activities are out-sourced to consultants who provide services to us on a project basis.
