&#160;

In our Occupational and Environmental Health Risk Assessment Center, we apply scientific processes to characterize and estimate health risks from exposures to chemical, physical, and biological agents in the workplace, home, and outdoor environment. Risk assessment is a systematic process for analyzing information on exposure and effects of toxic agents and other environmental hazards to assess the likelihood of adverse effects to health and safety of individuals and populations (i.e., health risks) potentially exposed to such agents. The risk assessment process integrates information regarding whether a particular agent is or is not casually linked to a particular health effect (hazard identification); the relation between the magnitude of exposure and the probability of occurrence of the health effect (dose-response or toxicity assessment); the route, duration and magnitude of exposure (exposure assessment); and the characterization of the nature and magnitude of health risk (risk characterization). Risk assessments are used in a variety of contexts, including evaluating potential impacts of exposure to chemicals and other agents associated with consumer products, occupational settings, or specific contaminated sites, and in developing risk-based criteria to protect workers and the public. The risk assessment process is of necessity highly interdisciplinary to address complex health issues, and draws from diverse fields such as biology, chemistry, ecology, engineering, environmental sciences, industrial hygiene, mathematical modeling, medicine, public health, statistics and toxicology.
