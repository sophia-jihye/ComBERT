 Item 1. Business 

General 

KBR, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, "KBR" or "the Company") is an engineering, construction and services company supporting the global hydrocarbons and international government services market sectors. We offer an extensive portfolio of proprietary technology and consulting services; engineering, construction, procurement and asset maintenance services; and base operational, logistics, life support and asset management services, through our Technology &#38; Consulting, Engineering &#38; Construction and Government Services business segments. Information regarding business segment disclosures included in Note 2 &#32;to our consolidated financial statements and "Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" is incorporated by reference into this Item 1. 

KBR, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on March 21, 2006 prior to an exchange offer transaction that separated us from our former parent, Halliburton Company, which was completed on April 5, 2007. We trace our history and culture to two businesses, The M.W. Kellogg Company ("Kellogg") and Brown &#38; Root, Inc. ("Brown &#38; Root"). Kellogg dates back to a pipe fabrication business that was founded in New York in 1901 and evolved into a technology and service provider for petroleum refining and petrochemicals processing. Brown &#38; Root was founded in Houston, Texas in 1919 and built the world&#8217;s first offshore platform in 1947. Brown &#38; Root was acquired by Halliburton in 1962 and Kellogg was acquired by Halliburton in 1998 through its merger with Dresser Industries. 

Our Business Segments 

In 2014, we reorganized into three core and two non-core business segments as follows: 

Core business segments 

&#8226; 

Technology &#38; Consulting 

&#8226; 

Engineering &#38; Construction 

&#8226; 

Government Services 

Non-core business segments 

&#8226; 

Non-strategic Business 

&#8226; 

Other 

Our business segments are described below. 

Technology &#38; Consulting ("T&#38;C"). Our T&#38;C business segment combines proprietary KBR technologies, knowledge-based services and our three specialty consulting brands, Granherne, Energo and GVA, under a single customer-facing global business. This segment provides licensed technologies and consulting services to the oil and gas value chain, from wellhead to crude refining and specialty chemicals production. In addition to sharing many of the same customers, these brands share the approach of early and continuous customer involvement to deliver an optimal solution to meet the customer&#8217;s objectives through early planning and scope definition, advanced technologies and project lifecycle support. 

Engineering &#38; Construction ("E&#38;C"). Our E&#38;C business segment leverages our operational and technical excellence as a global provider of engineering, procurement, construction ("EPC"), commissioning and maintenance services for oil and gas, refining, petrochemicals and chemicals customers. E&#38;C is managed on a geographic basis in order to facilitate close proximity to our customers and our people, while utilizing a consistent global execution strategy. 

Government Services ("GS"). Our GS business segment focuses on long term service contracts with annuity streams particularly for the governments of the United Kingdom ("U.K."), Australia and United States ("U.S."). 

Non-strategic Business. Our Non-strategic Business segment represents the operations or activities that we intend to exit upon completion of existing contracts. This segment also included businesses we exited upon sale to third parties described in Note 2 &#32;to our consolidated financial statements. 

Other. Our Other business segment includes our corporate expenses and general and administrative expenses that do not individually meet the criteria for group presentation and are not allocated to the business segments above in addition to any future activities that do not individually meet the criteria for segment presentation. 

Our Business Strategy 

We provide our customers with a diverse portfolio of capital project delivery and services across the entire engineering, construction and operations project lifecycle. Our core competencies are front-end development and planning, conceptual design, differentiated technologies, front-end engineering design ("FEED"), engineering, project management, procurement, construction, construction management, logistics, commissioning, operations and maintenance. We deliver these services through the offerings of our three core business segments: 

&#8226;

We market substantially all of our project and service offerings through our business segments. The markets we serve are highly competitive and for the most part require substantial resources and highly-skilled and experienced technical personnel. A large number of companies are competing in the markets served by our business, including U.S.-based companies such as Bechtel Corporation, Fluor Corporation, Jacobs Engineering, AECOM, and international-based companies such as AMEC Foster Wheeler, Chicago Bridge and Iron, Chiyoda Corporation ("Chiyoda"), JGC Corporation ("JGC"), McDermott International, Petrofac, Saipem, Technip, John Wood Group PLC and Worley Parsons. Since the markets for our services are vast and extend across multiple geographic regions, we cannot make a definitive estimate of the total number of our competitors. 

Our operations in some countries may be adversely affected by unsettled political conditions, acts of terrorism, civil unrest, force majeure, war or other armed conflict, expropriation or other governmental actions, inflation and foreign currency exchange controls and fluctuations. We strive to manage or mitigate these risks through a variety of means including contract provisions, contingency planning, insurance schemes, hedging and other risk management activities. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors," "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Discussion about Market Risk" and Note 20 &#32;to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding our exposures to foreign currency fluctuations, risk concentration and financial instruments used to manage our risks. 

Acquisitions, Dispositions and Other Transactions 

Dispositions 

During the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed the sale of our Infrastructure Americas business for $18 million &#32;in net cash proceeds within our Non-strategic Business segment. See Note 2 &#32;to our consolidated financial statements for more information. We also closed on the sale of our U.K. office facility located in Greenford for net cash proceeds of $33 million &#32;within our E&#38;C business segment and a U.S. office facility located in Birmingham, Alabama for net cash proceeds of $6 million &#32;within our Non-strategic Business segment. See Note 7 &#32;to our consolidated financial statements for more information. 

During the second quarter of 2015, we completed the sale of our Building Group subsidiary for $23 million &#32;in net cash proceeds within our Non-strategic Business segment. See Note 2 &#32;to our consolidated financial statements for more information. 

Other Transactions 

During the third quarter of 2015, we executed an agreement with Bernhard Capital Partners ("BCP") to establish the Brown &#38; Root Industrial Services joint venture which is accounted for within our E&#38;C business segment. In connection with the formation of the joint venture, we contributed our Industrial Services Americas business and received cash consideration of $48 million &#32;and a 50% interest in the joint venture. 

Also during the third quarter of 2015, we acquired a minority interest in EPIC Piping LLC ("EPIC"), a pipe fabrication business, within our E&#38;C business segment. We contributed the majority of our Canada pipe fabrication and module assembly business to the partnership, excluding the seven completed loss projects, and $19 million &#32;in cash. 

See Note 10 &#32;to our consolidated financial statements for more information. 

Joint Ventures and Alliances 

We enter into joint ventures and alliances with other industry participants in order to reduce exposure and diversify risk, increase the number of opportunities that can be pursued, capitalize on the strengths of each party and provide greater flexibility in delivering our services based on cost and geographical efficiency. Clients of our E&#38;C business segment frequently require EPC contractors to work in teams given the size and complexity of global projects that may cost billions of dollars to complete. Our significant joint ventures and alliances are described below. All joint venture ownership percentages presented are stated as of December 31, 2015 . 

We are working with JGC and Chiyoda for the design, procurement, fabrication, construction, commissioning and testing of the Ichthys Onshore LNG export facility in Darwin, Australia. The project is being executed using two &#32;joint ventures of which we own a 30% &#32;equity interest in each joint venture. The investments are accounted for within our E&#38;C business segment using the equity method of accounting. 

Additionally, we are working with JGC, Hatch Associates and Clough Projects Australia for the design, procurement, fabrication, construction, commissioning and testing of the Gorgon onshore LNG project located on Barrow Island off the northwest coast of Western Australia. We hold a 30% &#32;interest in the joint venture which is reported within our E&#38;C business segment and consolidated for financial accounting purposes. 

Aspire Defence Holdings Limited ("Aspire Defence") is a joint venture currently owned by KBR and two financial investors to upgrade and provide a range of services to the British Army&#8217;s garrisons at Aldershot and around the Salisbury Plain in the U.K. We own a 45% &#32;interest in Aspire Defence and a 50% &#32;interest in each of the two joint ventures that provide the construction and related support services to Aspire Defence. The investments are accounted for within our GS business segment using the equity method of accounting. 

Mantenimiento Marino de Mexico (&#8220;MMM&#8221;) is a joint venture formed under a Partners Agreement with Grupo R affiliated entities. The Partners Agreement covers five joint venture entities executing Mexican contracts with Petr&#243;leos Mexicanos ("PEMEX"). MMM was set up under Mexican maritime law in order to hold navigation permits to operate in Mexican waters. The scope of the business is to render maintenance, repair and restoration services of offshore oil and gas platforms and provisions of quartering in the territorial waters of Mexico. We own a 50% interest in MMM and in each of the four other joint ventures and account for our investment in these entities within our E&#38;C business segment using the equity method of accounting. 

Brown &#38; Root Industrial Services is a joint venture with BCP and offers maintenance services, turnarounds and small capital expenditure projects, primarily in North America. We own a 50% interest in this joint venture and account for this investment within our E&#38;C business segment using the equity method of accounting. 

Additionally, we have a minority interest in EPIC, in which BCP also holds a controlling interest. We entered into an agreement with EPIC that gives us access to EPIC's pipe fabrication facilities in Louisiana and Texas. We account for our interest in EPIC within our E&#38;C business segment using the equity method of accounting. 

Backlog of Unfulfilled Orders 

Backlog is our estimate of the U.S. dollar amount of revenues we expect to realize in the future as a result of executing awarded contracts. For projects within our unconsolidated joint ventures, we have included our percentage ownership of the joint venture&#8217;s estimated revenues in backlog to provide an indication of future work to be performed. Our backlog was $12.3 billion &#32;and $10.9 billion &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. We estimate that, as of December 31, 2015 , 38% &#32;of our backlog will be recognized as revenues within one year. All backlog is attributable to firm orders at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 . For additional information regarding backlog see our discussion within &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; 

Contracts 

Our contracts are broadly categorized as cost-reimbursable, fixed-price or &#8220;hybrid&#8221; contracts containing both cost-reimbursable and fixed-price scopes of work. Our fixed-price contracts may include cost escalation and other features that allow for increases in price should certain events occur or conditions change. Change orders on fixed-price contracts are routinely approved as work scopes change resulting in adjustments to our fixed price. 

Fixed-price contracts, which include unit-rate contracts (essentially a fixed-price contract with the only variable being units of work to be performed), are for a fixed sum to cover all costs and any profit element for a defined scope of work. Fixed-price contracts entail significant risk to us because they require us to predetermine the work to be performed, the project execution schedule and the costs associated with the work. Although fixed-price contracts involve greater risk than cost-reimbursable contracts, they also are potentially more profitable since the owner/customer pays a premium to transfer project risks to us. 

Cost-reimbursable contracts include contracts where the price is variable based upon our actual costs incurred for time and materials and for reimbursable labor hours. Profit on cost-reimbursable contracts may be a fixed amount, a mark-up applied to costs incurred or a combination of the two. Cost-reimbursable contracts are generally less risky than fixed-price contracts because the owner/customer retains many of the project risks. 

Our GS business segment performs work under cost-reimbursable contracts with the U.K. Ministry of Defence ("MoD"), the U.S. Department of Defense (&#8220;DoD&#8221;) and other governmental agencies that are generally subject to applicable statutes and regulations. If the government concludes costs charged to a contract are not reimbursable under the terms of the contract or applicable procurement regulations, these costs are disallowed or, if already reimbursed, we may be required to refund the reimbursed amounts to the customer. Such conditions may also include interest and other financial penalties. If performance issues arise under any of our government contracts, the government retains the right to pursue remedies, which could include termination under any affected contract. Furthermore, the government has the contractual right to terminate or reduce the amount of work under our contracts at any time. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; for more information. 

Significant Customers 

We provide services to a diverse customer base, including: 

&#8226; 

international oil companies ("IOC"s) and national oil companies ("NOC"s); 

&#8226; 

independent refiners; 

&#8226; 

petrochemical, fertilizer and chemical producers; 

&#8226; 

manufacturers; 

&#8226; 

domestic and foreign governments; and 

&#8226; 

regulated electric utilities. 

A considerable percentage of revenues is generated from transactions with Chevron Corporation ("Chevron") primarily from a major LNG project in Australia, which is nearing completion within our E&#38;C business segment. No other customers represented 10% or more of consolidated revenues in any of the periods presented. The information in the following table has summarized data related to our revenues from Chevron.

Information relating to our customer concentration is described in &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221;. Also, see further explanations in "Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations". 

Raw Materials and Suppliers 

Equipment and materials essential to our business are obtained from a variety of sources throughout the world. The principal equipment and materials we use in our business are subject to availability and price fluctuations due to customer demand, producer capacity and market conditions. We monitor the availability and price of equipment and materials on a regular basis. Our procurement department seeks to leverage our size and buying power to ensure that we have access to key equipment and materials at the best possible prices and delivery schedules. While we do not currently foresee any significant lack of availability of equipment and materials in the near term, the availability of these items may vary significantly from year to year and any prolonged unavailability or significant price increases for equipment and materials necessary to our projects and services could have a material adverse effect on our business. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; for more information. 

Intellectual Property 

We have developed or otherwise have the right to license leading technologies, including technologies held under license from third parties, used for the production of a variety of petrochemicals and chemicals and in the areas of olefins, refining, fertilizers, coal gasification and semi-submersible technology. We also license a variety of technologies for the transformation of raw materials into commodity chemicals such as phenol used in the production of consumer-end products. In addition, we are a licensor of ammonia process technologies used in the conversion of natural gas to ammonia. We believe our technology portfolio and experience in the commercial application of these technologies and related know-how differentiates us, enhances our margins and encourages customers to utilize our broad range of EPC and construction services. 

Our rights to make use of technologies licensed to us are governed by written agreements of varying durations, including some with fixed terms that are subject to renewal based on mutual agreement. Generally, each agreement may be further extended and we have historically been able to renew existing agreements before they expire. We expect these and other similar agreements to be extended so long as it is mutually advantageous to both parties at the time of renewal. However, the majority of our license fees tend to result in a one-time payment per agreement rather than ongoing royalty-type payments. For technologies we own, we protect our rights, know-how and trade secrets through patents and confidentiality agreements. Our expenditures for research and development activities were immaterial in each of the past three fiscal years. 

Seasonality 

Our operations are not generally affected by seasonality. However, weather and natural phenomena can temporarily affect the performance of our services. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 22,000 &#32;employees world-wide, of which approximately 8% &#32;were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Based upon the geographic diversification of our employees, we believe any risk of loss from employee strikes or other collective actions would not be material to the conduct of our operations taken as a whole. 

Health and Safety 

We are subject to numerous health and safety laws and regulations. In the U.S., these laws and regulations include the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state legislation, the Mine Safety and Health Administration laws, and safety requirements of the Departments of State, Defense, Energy and Transportation of the U.S. government. We are also subject to similar requirements in other countries in which we have extensive operations, including the U.K. where we are subject to the various regulations enacted by the Health and Safety Act of 1974. 

These laws and regulations are frequently changing and it is impossible to predict the effect of such laws and regulations on us in the future. We actively seek to maintain a safe, healthy and environmentally friendly work place for all of our employees and those who work with us. However, we provide some of our services in high-risk locations and may incur substantial costs to maintain the safety and security of our personnel in these locations. 

We embarked on a global Zero Harm initiative in order to reinforce health, safety, security and environment as key components of the KBR culture and lifestyle. This initiative incorporates three dynamic components, Zero Harm, 24/7 and courage to care which empowers individuals to take responsibility for their health and safety, as well as that of their colleagues. 

Environmental Regulation 

Information relating to environmental regulations is described in "Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; and in Note 15 &#32;to our consolidated financial statements, and the information discussed therein is incorporated by reference into this Item 1. 

Compliance 

Conducting our business with ethics and integrity is a key priority for KBR. We are subject to numerous compliance-related laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA"), the U.K. Bribery Act, other applicable anti-bribery legislation and laws and regulations regarding trade and exports. We are also governed by our own Code of Business Conduct and other compliance-related corporate policies and procedures that mandate compliance with these laws. Our Code of Business Conduct is a guide for every employee in applying legal and ethical practices to our everyday work. The Code of Business Conduct describes not only our standards of integrity but also some of the specific principles and areas of the law that are most likely to affect our business. We regularly train our employees regarding anti-bribery issues and our Code of Business Conduct.
