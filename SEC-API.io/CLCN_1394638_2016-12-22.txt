BUSINESS. 

Creative Learning Corporation, operating under the trade names of Bricks 4 Kidz&#174; and Sew Fun Studios&#174;, offers educational and enrichment programs to children ages 3 to 13+ through its franchisees. The Company&#146;s business model is to sell franchise territories and collect a one-time franchise fee and subsequent monthly royalty fees from each territory. Through the Company&#146;s franchise business model, which includes a proprietary curriculum and marketing strategy plus a proprietary franchise management tool, the Company provides a wide variety of programs designed to enhance students&#146; problem solving and critical thinking skills. At September 30, 2016, the Company had 710 Bricks 4 Kidz&#174; and Sew Fun Studios&#174; franchises, 28 Bricks 4 Kidz&#174; master franchises, and 20 Bricks 4 Kidz&#174; sub-franchises operating in 38 countries.

Company Background 

The Company was formed in March 2006 under the name B2 Health, Inc. to design, manufacture and sell chiropractic tables and beds. The Company generated only limited revenue and essentially abandoned its business plan in March 2008. In July 2010, the Company&#146;s name was changed to Creative Learning Corporation (&#147;CLC&#148;).

On July 2, 2010 the Company acquired BFK Franchise Company, LLC (&#147;BFK&#148;), a Nevada limited liability company formed in May 2009, under a Stock Exchange Agreement with the members of BFK for 9,000,000 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock. BFK offers a franchise concept known as Bricks 4 Kidz&#174;, a mobile business operated by franchisees within a specific geographic territory offering project-based programs designed to teach principles and methods of engineering to children ages 3-13+. BFK began selling franchises in July 2009.

On September 14, 2012, the Company formed CI Franchise Company LLC (&#147;CI&#148;) as a wholly owned subsidiary for the purpose of offering a second franchise concept known as Challenge Island&#174;, a service business within a defined exclusive territory, pursuant to which franchisees provide unique challenge-based programs designed to foster critical and creative thinking skills, problem solving methodology, and core STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) principles in children between the ages of 6 and 12. CI began selling franchises during the 2013 fiscal year. On December 9, 2015, the Company sold the assets and liabilities of the CI business to a third party. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

On January 26, 2015 the Company formed SF Franchise Company, LLC (&#147;SF&#148;) as a wholly owned subsidiary for the purpose of offering a third franchise concept known as Sew Fun Studios&#174;. Sew Fun Studios&#174; is a mobile business operated by franchisees within a specific geographic territory offering creative project-based activities, classes and programs in fashion and interior design and sewing to children and adults.

On July 22, 2015 and with immediate effect, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors removed Brian Pappas as Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Also on July 22, 2015, the Board took a series of actions to reconstruct the management of the Company. On that day, the Board with immediate effect: (i) elected Charles (Chuck) Grant as Chairman of the Board, (ii) elected two additional new independent directors, JoyAnn Kenny-Charlton, Esq. and Michael Gorin, (iii) named Rod Whiton interim Chief Executive Officer, (iv) named Michelle Cote President, and (v) placed Brian Pappas on paid administrative leave. Mr. Pappas&#146; employment at the Company was subsequently terminated on October 2, 2015. On April 6, 2016, Dan O&#146;Donnell resigned as the Company&#146;s Chief Operating Officer and from the Company&#146;s Board of Directors.

The Company&#146;s new management at the board and executive levels has implemented numerous changes and reforms since late July 2015 as discussed herein: including under Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.

&#160;

BFK 

BFK franchises, which conduct business under the trade name BRICKS 4 KIDZ&#174;, offer programs designed to teach principles and methods of engineering to children between the ages of 3 and 13 using LEGO&#174; plastic bricks and other LEGO&#174; products through classes, field trips, and other organized activities that are designed to enhance and enrich the traditional school curriculum, trigger young children&#146;s lively imaginations and build self-confidence. BFK&#146;s programs foster creativity and provide a unique atmosphere for students to develop problem solving and critical thinking skills by designing and building machines, catapults, pyramids, race cars, buildings and numerous other systems and devices using LEGO&#174; bricks and other LEGO&#174; products. The Company may provide training and corporate franchisee support to all franchisees and recognizes revenue from the sale of its franchises when all initial training, pursuant to the terms of the franchise agreements, is completed.

BFK franchises are mobile models, with activities scheduled in locations such as preschools, elementary and middle schools, camps, birthday parties, community centers and churches.

At September 30, 2016, BFK had 650 operating franchise territories, 28 master franchises, and 20 sub-franchises operating in 43 states, the District of Columbia and 38 foreign countries including Puerto Rico. The following table details franchise activity:

BFK Franchise Program 

BKF sells franchises both domestically and internationally. International sales can be a single franchise or a master franchise, where the master franchisee operates a franchise in the territory, and is also able to develop, sell and manage sub-franchises in the territory under the master franchise agreement. BFK does not offer master franchises in the United States.

Under a franchise agreement, a franchisee pays a one-time, non-refundable franchise fee upon the execution of the franchise agreement. Domestically, there can be variations on the franchise fees depending on the size or territories being purchased, and other factors of the territory. The typical sized, domestic, single territory franchise fee is $25,900. If the franchisee is granted an additional geographic area to increase the size of their territory, then the franchisee must pay an additional fee in the amount of $10,000. If the franchisee is in good standing and is granted a second or additional franchise, then the franchisee must pay a franchise fee in the amount of $18,000 for each additional franchise.

International franchise fees vary and are set relative to the potential of the franchised territories. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, BFK sold five master franchises at an average price of approximately $126,000. In the case of a master franchise, BFK receives a percentage of the franchise fee paid to the master franchisee by any sub-franchisee operating in the master franchisee&#146;s territory. During the 2016 fiscal year, the average international franchise fees were as follows: First Territories: $28,000; Second Territories: $10,000; and Master Agreements: $126,000.

The Company uses a network of franchise advertising and promotion media to contact prospective franchisees. When a potential contact is received, the initial information relating to a buyer is passed to a franchise sales broker to initiate contact with the potential new franchisees. The responsibility of the sales broker is to thoroughly vet the potential franchisee for compatibility with the franchise concept, among other things. As part of the process of vetting potential franchisees, the Company requires all prospective franchisees to complete a Request for Consideration form. Upon completion of the process the sales broker is paid a commission typically ranging from 20% to 30% of the franchise fee. Prior to the change in Company management in July 2015, sales brokers included brokers that were related-parties (friends and relatives of former CEO Brian Pappas) as well as independent brokers. Beginning in or about late July 2015, the Company terminated all related-party brokers and now any brokers that are used must be independent.

The franchisee is granted an exclusive territory and a license to use the &#147;Bricks 4 Kidz&#174;&#148; name, trademarks and course materials in the franchised territory. The franchisee is required to conform to certain standards of business practices and comply with all applicable laws. Each franchise is run as an independent business and, as such, is responsible for its operation, including employment of adequate staff.

In October 2015, the Company revised its form of franchise agreement to address common franchise issues consistent with best practices.

The term of the franchise is for ten years. BFK has the right to terminate any franchisee in the event of the franchisee&#146;s bankruptcy, a default under the franchise agreement, or other events. The franchisee has the right to renew the franchise for an additional ten years if, at the time of renewal, the franchisee is in good standing and pays a renewal fee in the amount of $5,000. The Company was suspended from selling franchises in the United States for a portion of the 2016 fiscal year.

Franchise Disclosure Document 

Under federal law, the Company is required to (a) prepare a franchise disclosure document (&#147;FDD&#148;) including federally mandated information, (b) provide each prospective franchisee with a copy of the FDD, and (c) wait 14 calendar days before entering into a binding agreement with the prospective franchisee or collecting any payment from any prospective franchisee. Federal law does not regulate the franchise relationship or require any filing or registration on the part of a franchisor. The Company is also required to comply with certain state regulations in connection with the offer and sale of franchises, including the requirement of the Company to submit the FDD for registration with a number of states before offering or selling franchises within those states. The list of states requiring registration of the FDD are: California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. In these states, state regulatory agencies review the FDD to confirm compliance with state statutory requirements. These state agencies can deny registration if they determine that the FDD fails to meet state statutory requirements. If a state denies the issuance of an effective registration, a franchisor is prohibited from offering or selling franchises in that state. See &#34;--Government Regulation&#34; below for more information.

&#160;

Royalty and Marketing Fees 

The Company invoices all applicable franchisees a royalty fee on a monthly basis. Every U.S. franchisee, upon signing a franchise agreement, has authorized and provided the required banking information to allow the electronic collection of all fees. Approximately three days after the invoice has been issued to the franchisee, an ACH draft (automatic deduction from the franchisee bank account) for the royalty fee withdrawal is processed through the Company&#146;s banking system.

Based upon the number of franchise territories owned and the length of time the franchisee has been in operations, historically, domestic and international franchisees were required to pay BFK a royalty fee amounting to 7% of gross receipts reported in the Franchise Management Tool (&#147;FMT&#148;). BFK also received a percentage of royalty payments received by master franchisees from their sub-franchisees. Franchisees were billed monthly for their 7% royalty payments, based upon gross receipts, due to the Company. The franchisees were required to pay the Company a minimum royalty fee per each franchise territory they own. Billing of the minimum royalty fee amount to each franchisee took place every 12 weeks and the minimum amount was calculated by comparing the amounts between the regular royalties billed for the prior 12 weeks to the 12 week minimum royalty payment due to the Company, per the franchise agreement. The 12-week minimum royalty payment due to the Company was $1,500 for the first franchise territory owned (equating to a minimum average fee of $500 per month) and $750 for the second franchise territory owned (equating to a minimum average fee of $250 per month). The minimum amount due for the third franchise territory was $1,500 and the fourth franchise territory was $750. After the end of each 12-week period, franchisees are required to pay to the Company the amount, if any, by which the minimum royalty exceeds the sum of the royalties paid over the 12-week period.

Beginning October 1, 2015, the Company adopted a flat-fee approach, eliminating the previous approach based upon revenue collections by the franchisee. The Company made the change to a flat-fee approach for a variety of reasons, including without limitation: to better enable franchisees to manage their cash flow; to enrich relations with our franchisees by being responsive to their needs; to facilitate the Company&#146;s ability to collect minimum fees across the board; and to make the company&#146;s fee structure more attractive to new potential franchisees.

On September 30, 2016, the Company implemented a new royalty fee structure for all new franchise sales. Sales in progress were grandfathered in under the previous royalty structure. The new royalty structure is the greater of 7% of gross sales or $500 per month.

On October 1, 2015, the Company commenced implementation of the following royalty fee structure, which is disclosed in the table below:

$225 USD

October 1, 2017 and for the remainder of the initial term of the Franchise Agreement

$250 USD

&#160;

Each franchisee has been given the option to amend their franchise agreement contract and elect this new royalty fee structure. At August 12, 2016, less than 2% of franchisees have formally rejected the new royalty fee program and 7% of franchisees have not yet communicated their decision regarding the new program. Any franchisees which do not elect the new royalty fee structure will remain subject to the historic royalty structure described above.

BFK administers a marketing fund for domestic and Canadian franchisees for the purpose of building national brand awareness. The marketing fund expenditures are funded with BFK collecting a 2% marketing fee, based upon gross receipts reported in the FMT, from domestic and Canadian franchisees. The respective franchisees are typically invoiced the middle of each month for the prior months receipts. These marketing fee and expenses are accounted for separately and are not reported as revenue or expenses for BFK. The collections of these funds are done using the Company&#146;s ACH program, as agreed to by each franchisee in their Franchise Agreement. The Marketing Fund is segregated into a separate bank account.

BFK Competition 

Although BFK pioneered the LEGO&#174; modeling-based curriculum for after school programs, we believe there are at least two other companies franchising a model similar to that of Bricks 4 Kidz&#174;, Engineering 4 Kids and Snapology. In addition, Play-Well Teknologies offers after-school classes, camps and birthday parties using LEGO&#174; bricks. Vision Education and Media offers after school classes using LEGO&#174; bricks in the New York metropolitan area. In addition, several other small businesses around the country offer after-school classes and vacation camps using LEGO&#174; bricks. These classes and camps are typically held in elementary schools, middle schools and community colleges.

Sew Fun Studios 

The Company is in the process of revising SF&#146;s form of franchise agreement to address common franchise issues consistent with best practices. SF expects to file state-required registrations or amended or renewed registrations during the 1st quarter of fiscal year 2017. Franchises sold under this franchise concept operate businesses offering creative project-based activities, classes and programs in fashion and interior design and sewing to children and adults at locations such as elementary and middle schools, camps, social events, community centers and churches. At September 30, 2016, SF has granted 12 developmental franchises in locations and states that do not require registration and is operating in five states, with one franchisee in Canada, and one in Puerto Rico. When the Company finalizes the disclosure document and it is accepted by the regulatory states, we expect that general sales of franchises will begin in those regulatory states.

Franchising Process 

Initial contact between a potential franchisee and the Company may result from a potential franchisee contacting the Company, either by phone or electronically. Potential franchisees may also be introduced to the Company by brokers and/or other parties, and the Company may pay commissions and consulting fees to the brokers. The Company has discontinued its previous practice of introducing franchisee candidates to third party financing sources to cover franchising expenses, as well as, paying commissions and consulting fees to the Company&#146;s directors, officers and employees and their family members. See Item 11, &#147;Executive Compensation &#151; Summary Compensation Table&#148; and Item 13, &#147;Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.&#148;

After initial contact, one of the Company&#146;s franchise consultants interviews each prospective franchisee (the &#147;candidate&#148;) to determine whether the candidate may make a successful franchisee. If the franchise consultant determines that the candidate may make a successful franchisee, the candidate submits a request for consideration (&#147;RFC&#148;). The Company reviews the RFC and if the RFC is approved, the franchise consultant continues the vetting process, which focuses on financial and other factors.

Upon receipt of the RFC, the candidate is emailed a copy of the Company&#146;s franchise disclosure document. The franchise consultant reviews the franchise disclosure document with the candidate and answers any questions concerning the franchise and the franchise agreement. The Company does not provide projections of a franchise&#146;s financial model or performance to prospective franchisees.

&#160;

Assuming the candidate has cleared the initial vetting process and remains interested in operating one of the Company&#146;s franchises, the candidate is invited to attend a &#147;discovery day&#148; held at the Company&#146;s headquarters, or in some instances at another location, during which representatives of the Company and the candidate meet face to face. If the Company decides that the candidate meets its objectives for the franchise, the required disclosure waiting period has expired and the candidate wants to move forward and become a franchisee, the parties execute a franchise agreement.

The Company will sell a franchise for a particular territory only when the Company believes that there is a reasonable chance for a franchise to succeed in that territory. If a franchisee is not successful, the Company may terminate the franchise agreement by providing notice to the franchisee or repurchasing the franchise from the franchisee. Until the Company provides a notice of termination or repurchases the franchise, the Company considers the franchise to be active. During fiscal years 2015 and 2014, the termination rate for active franchises was approximately three percent and two percent, respectively.

Government Regulation 

The offer and sale of franchises is regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (the &#147;FTC&#148;) and some state governments.

In 1979, the Federal Trade Commission promulgated what became known as the FTC Franchise Rule. The FTC Franchise Rule requires that the franchisor provide a franchise disclosure document (&#147;FDD&#148;) to each prospective franchisee prior to execution of a binding franchise agreement or payment of money by the prospective franchisee. The FTC Franchise Rule does not regulate the franchise relationship or require any filing or registration on the part of a franchisor.

However, the FTC Franchise Rule does not preempt state law and, as a result, states are not prohibited from imposing additional requirements on franchisors. For example, the following states require franchisors to register with the state prior to the offer and sale of franchises in the state, and to provide all prospective franchisees with a registered FDD prior to the offer and sale of a franchise in the state: California, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin (the &#147;Franchise Registration States&#148;). The registration process is not uniform in each Franchise Registration State. Most Franchise Registration States require the franchisor to submit an application, which includes a FDD, in order to register to sell franchises within that state. Many, but not all, of the state regulatory agencies in the Franchise Registration States review the franchisor&#146;s registration application, the FDD, the proposed franchise agreement and any other agreements franchisees must sign, the financial condition of the franchisor, and other material information provided by the franchisor in its application. These state agencies have the authority to deny a franchisor&#146;s application for registration and prohibit the franchisor from offering or selling franchises in the state.

In addition, there are numerous states that have laws that regulate the relationship between a franchisor and a franchisee after the sale of the franchise.

Under the FTC Franchise Rule, the FTC has the authority to seek civil penalties against a franchisor for violations of the FTC Franchise Rule. Each of the Franchise Registration States has similar authority to seek penalties for violations of their state franchise registration and disclosure laws. Violations may include offering or selling an unregistered franchise, failing to timely provide the disclosure document to a prospective franchisee or making misrepresentations in the FDDs. Additionally, officers of the franchisor may have personal liability if they had knowledge of or participated in the violations.

There is no direct, private right of action for a violation of the FTC Franchise Rule. However, most of the Franchise Registration States provide for a private right of action for a violation of the state&#146;s franchise registration and disclosure law. Remedies available under these laws typically include damages, rescission of the franchise agreement and attorneys&#146; fees.

&#160;

As of January 29, 2016, the Company had temporarily suspended domestic franchise offers and sales of Bricks 4 Kidz&#174; and Sew Fun Studios&#174; franchises in compliance with FTC Franchise Rule, Section 436.7(a) due to delay in completion of the Company&#146;s FY2015 consolidated audited financial statements. In turn, this delayed completion of the Company&#146;s 2016 FDDs for the Bricks 4 Kidz&#174; and Sew Fun Studios&#174; franchise offerings. The Company restarted selling efforts of Bricks 4 Kidz in September of 2016 and expects that offer and sales efforts will resume for Sew Fun Studios&#174; in December 2016 in approximately 70% of the states in which Sew Fun Studios&#174; currently sells franchises immediately upon completion of the FDD, and in the rest of the states upon either filing or approval of the renewal applications, based upon the applicable rules of each such state. In a number of these states, the Company did not have active franchise offer and sales efforts even before the temporary suspension. This temporary suspension of domestic franchise offer and sales did not affect the Company&#146;s international franchise offer and sales activity or its royalty fee collections from existing franchisees.

Recent Developments 

On December 9, 2016, Brian Pappas, through his controlled company Fran Ventures, LLC, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a preliminary consent statement on Schedule 14A asking the shareholders of the Company to remove the current members of the Board of Directors and to replace them with three individuals proposed by Mr. Pappas. As a result, shareholders may have received, or may receive in the future, consent solicitation materials from Fran Ventures and/or Mr. Pappas seeking their written consent to remove the current Board members and elect the three individuals proposed by Mr. Pappas.

On December 16, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors had determined that the consent solicitation commenced by Mr. Pappas and FranVentures is not in the best interests of all of the Company&#146;s stockholders. The Company intends to file with the SEC a preliminary consent revocation statement in connection with the consent solicitation being conducted by Mr. Pappas and FranVentures, which will explain in more detail the Board&#146;s reasons for opposing Mr. Pappas&#146; attempt to gain control of the Company.

General 

The Company&#146;s offices, consisting of approximately 4,500 square feet, are located in an office/condo complex at 701 Market, Suite 113, St. Augustine, FL 32095. The Company owns three of the office condominiums and rent one additional unit.

At September 30, 2016 the Company had 9 employees on a full time basis.
