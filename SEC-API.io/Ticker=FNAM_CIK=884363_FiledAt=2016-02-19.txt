 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Evolutionary Genomics, Inc. &#160; (the &#34;registrant&#34; or &#34;Company&#34;) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Minnesota in November 1990 under the name Fonahome Corporation. On March 24, 2009, the Company reincorporated in the state of Nevada and merged with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Fona, Inc., adopting the surviving company&#146;s name, Fona, Inc. The Company was originally formed to develop and market an interactive information and advertising service.

From December 1999 through October 2015, the Company had no significant business operations. On March 3, 2009, the Company held a shareholder meeting approving the Stock Purchase Agreement and an Agreement and Plan of Merger effectively changing the name of the Company to Fona Inc., a Nevada corporation (&#147;Re-incorporation Merger&#148;) and simultaneously adopting the capital structure of Fona Inc., which includes total authorized capital stock of 800,000,000 shares, of which 780,000,000 are common stock and 20,000,000 are blank check preferred stock. The preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series with such designations, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated in the resolutions adopted by the Corporation&#146;s Board providing for the issuance of such preferred stock or series thereof. On March 24, 2009, the Articles of Merger of Fonahome Corporation, a Minnesota Corporation, into Fona, Inc., a Nevada Corporation, were filed with the Nevada Secretary of State.

On June 6, 2014, Evolutionary Genomics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;EG&#148;), EG I, LLC (&#147;EG I&#148;) and Fona, Inc., a Nevada corporation (&#147;Fona&#148;), Fona Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;Sub&#148;) and Fona Merger Sub, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (&#147;Sub LLC&#148;), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger as amended by the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 2, 2015 (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;), pursuant to which, on October 19, 2015 Sub merged with EG and Sub LLC merged with EG I, with each EG and EG I surviving as wholly owned subsidiaries of Fona. On October 19, 2015, Fona changed its name to Evolutionary Genomics, Inc.

GENERAL BUSINESS PLAN 

On August 14, 2000, the Company was issued patent number 6274319, titled &#147;Methods to identify evolutionarily significant changes in polynucleotide and polypeptide sequences in domestic plants and animals&#148;. On June 1, 2004, the Company was issued patent number 6743580, titled &#147;Methods for producing transgenic plants containing evolutionarily significant polynucleotides&#148;. These patents are for the core Adapted Traits Platform that we use for the discovery of genes in humans, animals and commercial crops. The Company has applied the Adapted Traits Platform in research projects including identifying genes believed to be responsible for increases in yield in corn, increases in yield in rice, salt tolerance and sugar content in tomatoes and pest/disease resistance in soybeans and multiple other crops. 

EG Technology &#150; The Adapted Traits Platform (&#147;ATP&#146;) 

Genomics research generates vast amounts of sequence data for thousands of genes. Some companies use this sequence data to try to predict the function of each gene and its potential to impact key traits. Others try to match the thousands of random deoxyribonucleic acid (&#147;DNA&#148;) changes between individuals with differences in traits. Evolutionary Genomics&#146; approach is to first narrow the search to genes that have undergone adaptive evolution (positively selected genes) in an organism that has an adapted trait of potential commercial value. To identify genes with impact on commercially desirable traits, Evolutionary Genomics screens first for positively selected genes. Evolutionary Genomics then focuses functional genomics efforts on demonstrating the effects of these genes on the desired traits.

Evolutionary Genomics uses the Adapted Traits Platform to perform high throughput molecular evolution analysis to identify positively selected genes based on Ka/Ks analysis (as defined below). Ka/Ks analysis was developed to document the role of positive selection on known protein coding genes. Molecular-level adaptive evolution is indicated when comparisons of homologous protein coding sequences from closely related species show that the number of amino acid differences fixed due to selection exceeds what can be expected by neutral evolution. Molecular-level positive selection can be detected in protein-coding genes by pairwise comparisons of the ratios of non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions per non-synonymous site (Ka) to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks). The algorithm, by comparing substitutions per site, takes into account, in rigorous fashion, the effect of bias and degeneracy in the genetic code, and also compensates for the effects of multiple hits at the same site. Ka/Ks ratios significantly greater than unity strongly suggest that positive selection has fixed greater numbers of amino acid replacements than can be expected as a result of chance alone. 

Dr. Walter Messier, a Company founder and our Chief Technology Officer, published a seminal paper in the field: Messier and Stewart (1997) &#147;Episodic adaptive evolution of primate lysozymes&#148; Nature 385:151-154. The work described in this publication demonstrated that a known lysozyme gene that had been recruited for a new function to aid in digestion of leaves as a food source in certain monkeys had the kind of adaptive genetic changes indicating that the lysozyme gene had evolved more rapidly than the neutral substitution rate, indicating Darwinian positive selection. Many groups have used such methods to document Darwinian positive selection in other proteins. It was Dr. Messier&#146;s insight that genes controlling a trait of interest could be identified by using molecular evolution analysis as a screen, comparing genes in a species with a trait to genes of a closely related species lacking the trait. The adapted genes found in such a screen could then be validated to determine their role in the presence or absence of the trait of interest. 

Agricultural Industry 

In the past century, agriculture has been characterized by enhanced productivity, the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, selective breeding, mechanization, water contamination, and farm subsidies. Proponents of organic farming such as Sir Albert Howard argued in the early 20th century that the overuse of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers damages the long-term fertility of the soil. While this feeling lay dormant for decades, as environmental awareness has increased in the 21st century there has been a movement towards sustainable agriculture by some farmers, consumers, and policymakers.

Advances in genetic research and modification of crop species has led to increased yield, drought tolerance and disease/pest resistance. These advances have also led to an increased concentration within the providers of seed to the industry. The top seed companies control much of the implementation of new seed varieties through patents and licensing agreements. Genetic traits providers, like Evolutionary Genomics, identify and develop genes that impact traits of interest to the industry and market those genes to these seed companies.

&#160;

Business Model 

Evolutionary Genomics&#146; primary source of revenue to date has been contract services revenue for research performed by Evolutionary Genomics on behalf of other commercial entities and grant income received from governmental agencies, industry associations and grant making foundations for research performed. Ownership of the intellectual property developed can vary from Evolutionary Genomics retaining all intellectual property rights to retaining none of the developed intellectual property for the crop that is the subject of the project. In addition to the revenue resulting from contract services and grants, Evolutionary Genomics has entered into licensing agreements for the commercial use of intellectual property that we have developed. Licensing revenue can be lump sum payments, milestone payments upon achievement of defined goals and/or percentages of revenue for products sold by licensee. These payments are often many years after completion of gene identification project as licensees engage in significant additional testing including field trials prior to integration into licensee commercial germplasm lines. There can be no guarantee that these licensing agreements will result in any additional revenue for Evolutionary Genomics as further development of licensed intellectual property is mostly controlled by the licensee. 

The rice yield gene project that Evolutionary Genomics performed under contract with RiceTec, Inc. was contract research work that resulted in a licensing agreement. On September 2, 2004, EG entered into a Research and License Agreement with RiceTec, Inc., a Delaware corporation having its principal place of business in Alvin, TX for the purpose of researching and identifying adapted genes, including adapted rice genes associated with commercially useful phenotypic characteristics such as enhanced yield. On July 26, 2006, the Company entered into a Commercial License Agreement in the Field of Rice granting RiceTec, Inc. an exclusive, royalty free license for the use of intellectual property developed under the research agreement in North America, Central America and South America and Evolutionary Genomics received a lump sum payment. Evolutionary Genomics is also entitled to future royalties for the use of the intellectual property in the rest of the world if RiceTec, Inc. markets germplasm including genes that Evolutionary Genomics has provided. Evolutionary Genomics also entered into a Commercial License Agreement outside the field of rice on July 26, 2006 with RiceTec, Inc. granting Evolutionary Genomics an exclusive world-wide, royalty-free license to the intellectual property in any field other than rice. RiceTec, Inc. is performing field trials on the genes identified in the research project and the license agreement has not, to date, resulted in licensing revenue for Evolutionary Genomics beyond the initial lump sum payment. No future revenues are expected to result from this research and EG does not consider these to be material contracts of the Company.

Evolutionary Genomics&#146; soybean pest resistance project is an illustration of the evolution of a project from concept through marketing to seed companies. The project has yielded five genes for pest resistance in soybeans with partial validation complete and full validation results expected in 2016. Evolutionary Genomics has had discussions with seed companies to commercialize the genes and intends to return to those discussions in the fall of 2016 with validation results. The Company has extended this pest resistance research to other crops including beans, tomatoes, cotton, citrus and coffee.

On August 6, 2015, the Company was awarded an Advanced Industries Accelerator Grant by the State of Colorado in the amount of $250,000 to fund further research in the development of pest resistance genes in soybeans and other crops and sweetness genes in tomatoes. Through December 31, 2015, the Company has recognized $107,934 of revenue from the contract and expects the research to continue into 2017. The Company maintains ownership of all intellectual property developed from the use of grant funds.

During 2013 and 2014 EG performed research on two projects for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. On November 1, 2012 Evolutionary Genomics entered into a Master Services Agreement and Work Order #1 under that agreement with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for the validation of EG 261 orthologs in beans and cowpeas. We expect to continue that validation work through 2016. While the market for beans and cowpeas is considerably smaller than for soybeans, we intend to market any genes that show positive validation results to the seed companies for commercialization. Through December 31, 2015, Evolutionary Genomics has recognized $648,098 of the $762,000 it is entitled to under that work order and expects to finish the project in 2016. On March 29, 2012, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation awarded Evolutionary Genomics a $100,000 grant to fund research into wheat stem rust using the Adapted Traits Platform. 

&#160;

Evolutionary Genomics&#146; Business Strategy 

On April 29, 2014, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued patent 8,710,300 titled EXPRESSION OF DIRIGENT GENE EG261 AND ITS ORTHOLOGS AND PARALOGS ENHANCES PATHOGEN RESISTANCE IN PLANTS. Evolutionary Genomics has also filed international patents on EG261 and engaged in discussions with seed companies regarding further validation of the effectiveness of EG261. Based on information received in those discussions, Evolutionary Genomics has engaged in a whole plant validation trial of EG261, EG19 another soybean pest resistance gene and a synthetic gene with the University of Missouri. Results of this validation trial are expected in the fall of 2016. The Company has also discovered additional candidate genes that may impact pathogen resistance. There can be no assurance that any of these genes will be proven effective in validation testing or lead to licensing agreements or revenue.

In validation studies completed in 2013, the University of Wisconsin-Madison validated the effectiveness of EG261 in their lab. If results from the whole plant validation trial confirm the findings of the University of Wisconsin-Madison for EG261 and the effectiveness of the new genes, the Company will enter negotiations for a long term research collaboration and licensing agreement with seed companies. If these negotiations are successful, this type of agreement will likely have an upfront payment, milestone payments during their testing and a licensing royalty stream once the genes are incorporated into commercial seed lines. The testing phase includes field trials which may proceed for several years prior to generating licensing revenue. There are many risks in this process including some that are outside of Evolutionary Genomics&#146; control and there can be no guarantee that we will ever generate any revenue from these potential agreements. If Evolutionary Genomics receives product royalties from the soybean genes, it is required to pay the United Soybean Board a ten percent royalty stream not to exceed 150% of the grant amount of $262,476.

The Company has identified pest/disease resistance genes in other commercially valuable crops and intends to pursue research to identify and validate those genes. It is Evolutionary Genomics&#146; intention to engage in validation studies with independent labs to validate their resistance effectiveness, patent the genes and market them to the seed industry. This strategy will require Evolutionary Genomics to incur significant research costs prior to any confirmation of commercial viability and there can be no guarantee that the desired results can be achieved or that commercialization can be reached. The Company should finish the project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for the validation of bean and cowpea genes in 2016.

Evolutionary Genomics has identified a gene in tomatoes that appears to impact the plant&#146;s ability to tolerate salt and a gene that appears to control sweetness. Evolutionary Genomics filed a patent application on the use of these genes and engaged the University of Florida to perform validation of these genes. Evolutionary Genomics received results from these tests in 2015 which confirm that these genes do significantly impact sweetness in tomatoes. Despite discussions with seed companies, the Company has not been able to reach any agreement to license these genes and there can be no assurance that we will ever realize any revenue from these genes.

In 2014, the Company began a project to identify genes in cotton that may impact traits of commercial interest. In particular, we intend to focus on pest resistance and fiber length. We have used our Adapted Traits Platform to identify positively selected candidate genes and, during 2016, intend to further research these genes to confirm that they were positively selected. If any of these genes remain promising, we intend to contract with an independent lab to validate the effectiveness of those genes. These studies can be very costly and there can be no assurance that we will be successful with this project.

Evolutionary Genomics intends to vigorously pursue grant funding from governmental agencies, industry associations and grant making foundations but these sources of funding are often subject to limitations in available funds, funding priorities in areas other than the our area of focus, political uncertainties, long approval processes and competition with other research proposals. If such funding is not available, Evolutionary Genomics may incur the costs of these projects with the prospect of revenue uncertain and likely many years in the future. 

Competition 

Evolutionary Genomics&#146; competition is very broad from the largest seed companies like Monsanto Company, Syngenta AG, Bayer Crop Science, Dupont Pioneer and Dow and others to the smallest grower who is successful in breeding new, improved varieties. These same competitors are also Evolutionary Genomics customers as Evolutionary Genomics seeks to license intellectual property for commercialization into their seed lines. Many of these companies are exponentially larger with many more resources at their disposal and there can be no assurance that EG can continue to compete with them or interest them in licensing our intellectual property.
