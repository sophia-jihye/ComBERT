 Item 1. Business 

General 

Saul Centers, Inc. (&#8220;Saul Centers&#8221;) was incorporated under the Maryland General Corporation Law on June 10, 1993. Saul Centers operates as a real estate investment trust (a &#8220;REIT&#8221;) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). The Company is required to annually distribute at least 90 % of its REIT taxable income (excluding net capital gains) to its stockholders and meet certain organizational and other requirements. Saul Centers has made and intends to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to its stockholders. Saul Centers, together with its wholly owned subsidiaries and the limited partnerships of which Saul Centers or one of its subsidiaries is the sole general partner, are referred to collectively as the &#8220;Company.&#8221; B. Francis Saul II serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of Saul Centers. 

The Company&#8217;s principal business activity is the ownership, management and development of income-producing properties. The Company&#8217;s long-term objectives are to increase cash flow from operations and to maximize capital appreciation of its real estate. 

Saul Centers was formed to continue and expand the shopping center business previously owned and conducted by the B. F. Saul Real Estate Investment Trust, the B. F. Saul Company and certain other affiliated entities, each of which is controlled by B. Francis Saul II and his family members (collectively, the "Saul Organization&#8221;). On August 26, 1993, members of the Saul Organization transferred to Saul Holdings Limited Partnership, a newly formed Maryland limited partnership (the &#8220;Operating Partnership&#8221;), and two newly formed subsidiary limited partnerships (the &#8220;Subsidiary Partnerships,&#8221; and collectively with the Operating Partnership, the &#8220;Partnerships&#8221;), shopping center and mixed-use properties, and the management functions related to the transferred properties. Since its formation, the Company has developed and purchased additional properties. 

The following table lists the significant properties acquired, developed and/or disposed of by the Company since January 1, 2013 .

April 2014 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Company&#8217;s properties (the &#8220;Current Portfolio Properties&#8221;) consisted of 50 &#32;shopping center properties (the &#8220;Shopping Centers&#8221;), six &#32;mixed-use properties, one of which was designated as held for sale, which are comprised of office, retail and multi-family residential uses (the &#8220;Mixed-Use Properties&#8221;) and three &#32;(non-operating) development properties. Shopping Centers and Mixed-Use Properties represent reportable business segments for financial reporting purposes. Revenue, net income, total assets and other financial information of each reportable segment are described in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 

Organizational Structure 

The Company conducts its business through the Operating Partnership and/or directly or indirectly owned subsidiaries. The following diagram depicts the Company&#8217;s organizational structure and beneficial ownership of the common and preferred stock of Saul Centers calculated pursuant to Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act as of December 31, 2015 . 

&#160; 

(1) 

The Saul Organization&#8217;s ownership percentage in Saul Centers reported above does not include units of limited partnership interest of the Operating Partnership held by the Saul Organization. In general, most units are convertible into shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock on a one-for-one basis. However, not all of the units may be convertible into the Company&#8217;s common stock because (i) the articles of incorporation limit beneficial and constructive ownership (defined by reference to various Code provisions) to 39.9% in value of the Company&#8217;s issued and outstanding common and preferred equity securities, which comprise the ownership limit and (ii) the convertibility of some of the outstanding units is subject to approval of the Company&#8217;s stockholders. 

Management of the Current Portfolio Properties 

The Operating Partnership manages the Current Portfolio Properties and will manage any subsequently acquired or developed properties. The management of the properties includes performing property management, leasing, design, renovation, development and accounting duties for each property. The Operating Partnership provides each property with a fully integrated property management capability, with approximately 61 &#32;full-time equivalent employees at its headquarters office and 36 &#32;employees at its properties and with an extensive and mature network of relationships with tenants and potential tenants as well as with members of the brokerage and property 

owners&#8217; communities. The Company currently does not, and does not intend to, retain third party managers or provide management services to third parties. 

The Company augments its property management capabilities by sharing with the Saul Organization certain ancillary functions, at cost, such as information technology and payroll services, benefits administration and in-house legal services. The Company also shares insurance administration expenses on a pro rata basis with the Saul Organization. Management believes that these arrangements result in lower costs than could be obtained by contracting with third parties. These arrangements permit the Company to capture greater economies of scale in purchasing from third party vendors than would otherwise be available to the Company alone and to capture internal economies of scale by avoiding payments representing profits with respect to functions provided internally. The terms of all sharing arrangements with the Saul Organization, including payments related thereto, are specified in a written agreement and are reviewed annually by the Audit Committee of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors. 

The Company subleases its corporate headquarters space from the Saul Organization at the Company&#8217;s share of the cost. A discussion of the lease terms are provided in Note 7, Long Term Lease Obligations, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Principal Offices 

The principal offices of the Company are located at 7501 Wisconsin Avenue, Suite 1500, Bethesda, Maryland 20814-6522, and the Company&#8217;s telephone number is (301) 986-6200. The Company&#8217;s internet web address is www.saulcenters.com . Information contained on the Company&#8217;s website is not part of this report. The Company makes available free of charge on its website its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;). Alternatively, you may access these reports at the SEC&#8217;s website: www.sec.gov. 

Policies with Respect to Certain Activities 

The following is a discussion of the Company&#8217;s operating strategy and certain of its investment, financing and other policies. These strategies and policies have been determined by the Board of Directors and, in general, may be amended or revised from time to time by the Board of Directors without a vote of the Company&#8217;s stockholders. 

Operating Strategies 

The Company&#8217;s primary operating strategy is to focus on its community and neighborhood shopping center business and to operate its properties to achieve both cash flow growth and capital appreciation. Community and neighborhood shopping centers typically provide reliable cash flow and steady long-term growth potential. Management actively manages its property portfolio by engaging in strategic leasing activities, tenant selection, lease negotiation and shopping center expansion and reconfiguration. The Company seeks to optimize tenant mix by selecting tenants for its shopping centers that provide a broad spectrum of goods and services, consistent with the role of community and neighborhood shopping centers as the source for day-to-day necessities. Management believes that such a synergistic tenanting approach results in increased cash flow from existing tenants by providing the Shopping Centers with consistent traffic and a desirable mix of shoppers, resulting in increased sales and, therefore, increased cash flows. 

Management believes there is potential for long term growth in cash flow as existing leases for space in the Shopping Centers expire and are renewed, or newly available or vacant space is leased. The Company intends to renegotiate leases where possible and seek new tenants for available space in order to optimize the mix of uses to improve foot traffic through the Shopping Centers. As leases expire, management expects to revise rental rates, lease terms and conditions, relocate existing tenants, reconfigure tenant spaces and introduce new tenants with the goals of increasing occupancy, improving overall retail sales, and ultimately increasing cash flow as economic conditions improve. In those circumstances in which leases are not otherwise expiring, management selectively attempts to increase cash flow through a variety of means, or in connection with renovations or relocations, recapturing leases 

with below market rents and re-leasing at market rates, as well as replacing financially troubled tenants. When possible, management also will seek to include scheduled increases in base rent, as well as percentage rental provisions, in its leases. 

The Company will also seek growth opportunities in its Washington, D.C. metropolitan area mixed-use portfolio, primarily through development and redevelopment, as evidenced by the commencement in 2013 of the redevelopment of Park Van Ness (formerly Van Ness Square). Management also intends to negotiate lease renewals or to re-lease available space in the Mixed-Use Properties, while considering the strategic balance of optimizing short-term cash flow and long-term asset value. 

It is management&#8217;s intention to hold properties for long-term investment and to place strong emphasis on regular maintenance, periodic renovation and capital improvement. Management believes that characteristics such as cleanliness, lighting and security are particularly important in community and neighborhood shopping centers, which are frequently visited by shoppers during hours outside of the normal work-day. Management believes that the Shopping Centers and Mixed-Use Properties generally are attractive and well maintained. The Shopping Centers and Mixed-Use Properties will undergo expansion, renovation, reconfiguration and modernization from time to time when management believes that such action is warranted by opportunities or changes in the competitive environment of a property. The Company will continue its practice of expanding existing properties by undertaking new construction on outparcels suitable for development as free standing retail or office facilities. 

Investment in Real Estate or Interests in Real Estate 

The Company&#8217;s redevelopment and renovation objective is to selectively and opportunistically redevelop and renovate its properties, by replacing below-market-rent leases with strong, traffic-generating anchor stores such as supermarkets and drug stores, as well as other desirable local, regional and national tenants. The Company&#8217;s strategy remains focused on continuing the operating performance and internal growth of its existing Shopping Centers, while enhancing this growth with selective acquisitions, redevelopments and renovations. 

In 2014, in separate transactions, the Company purchased three properties, with approximately 57,400 square feet of retail space, for an aggregate $25.2 million. The three properties are adjacent to an existing property on the east side of Rockville Pike near the Twinbrook Metro station. Combined, the four properties total 10.3 &#32;acres and are zoned for up to 1.2 million &#32;square feet of rentable mixed-use space. The Company is actively engaged in a plan for redevelopment but has not committed to any timetable for commencement of construction. 

The Company owns properties on the east and west sides of Rockville Pike near the White Flint Metro station which combined total 7.6 &#32;acres which are zoned for a development potential of up to 1.6 million &#32;square feet of mixed-use space. The Company is actively engaged in a plan for redevelopment but has not committed to any timetable for commencement of construction. 

In 2014, in separate transactions, the Company purchased two adjacent properties, with approximately 18,900 square feet of retail space, on North Glebe Road in Arlington, Virginia, for an aggregate $42.8 million. In September 2015, the Company purchased an additional property on North Glebe Road, which is adjacent to the two properties acquired in 2014, for $ 4.0 million . Combined, the properties total 2.5 &#32;acres and are zoned for up to 550,000 &#32;square feet of rentable mixed-use space. The Company is actively engaged in a plan for redevelopment but has not committed to any timetable for commencement of construction. 

In light of the limited amount of quality properties for sale and the escalated pricing of properties that the Company has been presented with or has inquired about over the past year, management believes acquisition opportunities for investment in existing and new Shopping Center and Mixed-Use Properties in the near future is uncertain. Because of the Company&#8217;s conservative capital structure, including its cash and capacity under its revolving credit facility, management believes that the Company is positioned to take advantage of additional investment opportunities as attractive properties are located and market conditions improve. (See &#8220;Item 1. Business - Capital Policies&#8221;). It is management&#8217;s view that several of the sub-markets in which the Company operates have, or are expected to have in the future, attractive supply/demand characteristics. The Company will continue to evaluate acquisition, development and redevelopment as integral parts of its overall business plan. 

In evaluating a particular redevelopment, renovation, acquisition, or development, management will consider a variety of factors, including (i) the location and accessibility of the property; (ii) the geographic area (with an emphasis on the Washington, D.C./Baltimore metropolitan area and the southeastern region of the United States) and demographic characteristics of the community, as well as the local real estate market, including potential for growth and potential regulatory impediments to development; (iii) the size of the property; (iv) the purchase price; (v) the non-financial terms of the proposed acquisition; (vi) the availability of funds or other consideration for the proposed acquisition and the cost thereof; (vii) the &#8220;fit&#8221; of the property with the Company&#8217;s existing portfolio; (viii) the potential for, and current extent of, any environmental problems; (ix) the current and historical occupancy rates of the property or any comparable or competing properties in the same market; (x) the quality of construction and design and the current physical condition of the property; (xi) the financial and other characteristics of existing tenants and the terms of existing leases; and (xii) the potential for capital appreciation. 

During 2013, the Company completed negotiation of lease termination agreements with the tenants of Van Ness Square. Costs incurred related to those termination arrangements were amortized to expense using the straight-line method over the remaining terms of the leases, are included in &#8220;Predevelopment Expenses&#8221; in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and totaled $3.3 million &#32;in 2013. The Company is in the process of developing a primarily residential project with street-level retail. In connection with the demolition of the existing structure, approximately $580,000 &#32;and $503,000 &#32;of predevelopment expenses were recognized in 2013 and 2014, respectively. 

Although it is management&#8217;s present intention to concentrate future acquisition and development activities on community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixed-use properties in the Washington, D.C./Baltimore metropolitan area and the southeastern region of the United States, the Company may, in the future, also acquire other types of real estate in other areas of the country as opportunities present themselves. While the Company may diversify in terms of property locations, size and market, it does not set any limit on the amount or percentage of assets that may be invested in any one property or any one geographic area. 

The Company intends to engage in such future investment or development activities in a manner that is consistent with the maintenance of its status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and that will not make the Company become regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Equity investments in acquired properties may be subject to existing mortgage financings and other indebtedness or to new indebtedness which may be incurred in connection with acquiring or refinancing these investments. 

Investments in Real Estate Mortgages 

While the Company&#8217;s current portfolio and business objectives emphasize equity investments in commercial and neighborhood shopping centers and mixed-use properties, the Company may, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, invest in mortgages, participating or convertible mortgages, deeds of trust and other types of real estate interests consistent with its qualification as a REIT. The Company does not presently invest, nor does it intend to invest, in real estate mortgages. 

Investments in Securities of or Interests in Persons Engaged in Real Estate Activities and Other Issues 

Subject to the requirements to maintain REIT qualification, the Company may invest in securities of other REITs, other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers, including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities. The Company does not presently invest, nor does it intend to invest, in any securities of other REITs. 

Dispositions 

In April 2014, the Company sold for $7.5 million &#32;the 70,040 &#32;square foot Giant Center located in Milford Mill, Maryland and recognized a $6.1 million &#32;gain. 

The Company may elect to dispose of other properties if, based upon management&#8217;s periodic review of the Company&#8217;s portfolio, the Board of Directors determines that such action would be in the best interest of the Company&#8217;s stockholders. 

Capital Policies 

The Company has established a debt capitalization policy relative to asset value, which is computed by reference to the aggregate annualized cash flow from the properties in the Company&#8217;s portfolio rather than relative to book value. The Company has used a measure tied to cash flow because it believes that the book value of its portfolio properties, which is the depreciated historical cost of the properties, does not accurately reflect the Company&#8217;s ability to incur indebtedness. Asset value, however, is somewhat more variable than book value, and may not at all times reflect the fair market value of the underlying properties. As a general policy, the Company intends to maintain a ratio of its total debt to total asset value of 50% or less and to actively manage the Company&#8217;s leverage and debt expense on an ongoing basis in order to maintain prudent coverage of fixed charges. Given the Company&#8217;s current debt level, it is management&#8217;s belief that the ratio of the Company&#8217;s debt to total asset value is below 50% as of December 31, 2015 . 

The organizational documents of the Company do not limit the absolute amount or percentage of indebtedness that it may incur. The Board of Directors may, from time to time, reevaluate the Company&#8217;s debt capitalization policy in light of current economic conditions, relative costs of capital, market values of the Company property portfolio, opportunities for acquisition, development or expansion, and such other factors as the Board of Directors then deems relevant. The Board of Directors may modify the Company&#8217;s debt capitalization policy based on such a reevaluation without shareholder approval and consequently, may increase or decrease the Company&#8217;s debt to total asset ratio above or below 50% or may waive the policy for certain periods of time, subject to maintaining compliance with financial covenants within existing debt agreements. The Company selectively continues to refinance or renegotiate the terms of its outstanding debt in order to achieve longer maturities, and obtain generally more favorable loan terms, whenever management determines the financing environment is favorable. 

The Company intends to finance future acquisitions and developments and to make debt repayments by utilizing the sources of capital then deemed to be most advantageous. Such sources may include undistributed operating cash flow, secured or unsecured bank and institutional borrowings, proceeds from the Company&#8217;s Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, proceeds from the sale of properties and private and public offerings of debt or equity securities. Borrowings may be at the Operating Partnership or Subsidiary Partnerships&#8217; level and securities offerings may include (subject to certain limitations) the issuance of Operating Partnership interests convertible into common stock or other equity securities. 

Other Policies 

The Company has the authority to offer equity or debt securities in exchange for property and to repurchase or otherwise acquire its common stock or other securities in the open market or otherwise, and may engage in such activities in the future. The Company expects, but is not obligated, to issue common stock to holders of units of the Operating Partnership upon exercise of their redemption rights. The Company has not engaged in trading, underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers other than the Operating Partnership and does not intend to do so. The Company has not made any loans to third parties, although the Company may in the future make loans to third parties. In addition, the Company has policies relating to related party transactions discussed in &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Competition 

As an owner of, or investor in, community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixed-use properties, the Company is subject to competition from an indeterminate number of companies in connection with the acquisition, development, ownership and leasing of similar properties. These investors include investors with access to significant capital, such as domestic and foreign corporations and financial institutions, publicly traded and privately held REITs, private institutional investment funds, investment banking firms, life insurance companies and pension funds. 

Competition may reduce properties available for acquisition or development or increase prices for raw land or developed properties of the type in which the Company invests. The Company faces competition in providing leases to prospective tenants and in re-letting space to current tenants upon expiration of their respective 

leases. If tenants decide not to renew or extend their leases upon expiration, the Company may not be able to re-let the space. Even if the tenants do renew or the Company can re-let the space, the terms of renewal or re-letting, including the cost of required renovations, may be less favorable than current lease terms or than expectations for the space. This risk may be magnified if the properties owned by our competitors have lower occupancy rates than the Company&#8217;s properties. As a result, these competitors may be willing to make space available at lower prices than the space in the Current Portfolio Properties. 

Management believes that success in the competition for ownership and leasing property is dependent in part upon the geographic location of the property, the tenant mix, the performance of property managers, the amount of new construction in the area and the maintenance and appearance of the property. Additional competitive factors impacting the Company&#8217;s properties include the ease of access to the properties, the adequacy of related facilities such as parking, and the demographic characteristics in the markets in which the properties compete. Overall economic circumstances and trends and new properties in the vicinity of each of the Current Portfolio Properties are also competitive factors. 

Finally, retailers at our Shopping Centers face increasing competition from outlet stores, discount shopping clubs and other forms of marketing goods, such as direct mail, internet marketing and telemarketing. This competition may reduce percentage rents payable to us and may contribute to lease defaults or insolvency of tenants. 

Environmental Matters 

The Current Portfolio Properties are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental and pollution controls. The impact upon the Company from the application of such laws and regulations either prospectively or retrospectively is not expected to have a materially adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s property operations. As a matter of policy, the Company requires an environmental study be performed with respect to a property that may be subject to possible environmental hazards prior to its acquisition to ascertain that there are no material environmental hazards associated with such property. 

Employees 

As of March 1, 2016, the Company had approximately 61 &#32;full-time equivalent employees at its headquarters office, including seven &#32;leasing officers, and 36 &#32;employees at its properties. None of the Company&#8217;s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Management believes that its relationship with employees is good. 

Recent Developments 

During the most recent downturn in the national real estate market, which began in 2008, the effects on the office and retail markets in the metropolitan Washington, D.C. area initially were less severe than in many other areas of the country. Even though economic conditions in the local economies, where the majority of the Company&#8217;s properties are located, have improved over recent years, issues facing the Federal government relating to spending cuts and budget policies have resulted in continued elevated vacancy rates in many sub-markets, thus pressuring rental rate growth. While overall consumer confidence appears to have improved, retailers continue to be cautious about new store openings. However, the Company&#8217;s overall leasing percentage, on a comparative same property basis, which excludes the impact of properties not in operation for the entirety of the comparable periods, continues to improve and increased to 94.7% &#32;at December 31, 2015 , from 94.4% &#32;at December 31, 2014 . 

The Company's tenants were further impacted by winter weather, as heavy snowfall in the Mid-Atlantic states during the first quarter of 2016 and 2014 hindered the ability of customers to shop. The cost of removing snow from the Company's properties during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2014, was approximately $2.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, approximately 60% of which is recoverable from tenants. 

On November 12, 2014 , Saul Centers sold, in an underwritten public offering, 1.6 million &#32;depositary shares, each representing 1/100 th of a share of 6.875% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock , providing net cash proceeds of approximately $39.3 million . The depositary shares, which represent a new issuance of additional depositary shares that were first issued on February 12, 2013, may be redeemed at the Company&#8217;s option, 

in whole or in part, at the $25.00 &#32;liquidation preference, plus accumulated dividends to but not including the redemption date, on or after February 12, 2018 . The depositary shares pay an annual dividend of $1.71875 &#32;per share, equivalent to 6.875% &#32;of the $25.00 &#32;liquidation preference. The Series C preferred stock has no stated maturity, is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and is not convertible into any other securities of the Company except in connection with certain changes in control or delisting events. Investors in the depositary shares generally have no voting rights, but will have limited voting rights if the Company fails to pay dividends for six or more quarters (whether or not declared or consecutive) and in certain other events. The proceeds from the offering were used to redeem all outstanding shares of the Company&#8217;s 8% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and related depositary shares. 

The Company had access to debt and preferred equity at attractive terms and pricing during 2013 , 2014 &#32;and 2015 . The Company maintains a ratio of total debt to total asset value of under 50%, which allows it to obtain additional secured borrowings if necessary. And, as of December 31, 2015 , amortizing fixed-rate mortgage debt with staggered maturities from 2018 &#32;to 2034 , represented approximately 95.1% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s notes payable, thus minimizing refinancing risk. The Company had one fixed-rate debt maturity scheduled for 2015, which was refinanced on March 3, 2015 . The floating-rate debt of the Company is comprised of a $14.8 million &#32;loan secured by Metro Pike Center and $28.0 million &#32;outstanding under the Company's revolving credit facility. 

In January 2016, the Company terminated a 16,500 square foot lease at 11503 Rockville Pike and received a $3.0 million lease termination fee which will be recognized as revenue in the first quarter. The space was previously occupied by an office supply store that had vacated in mid 2014 and the lease was scheduled to expire in 2019. The termination fee revenue will be partially offset by the loss of approximately $1.0 million in rental revenue over the remainder of 2016. The Company is in preliminary negotiation with a replacement tenant. While the Company continues to plan for a mixed-use development at this site and its neighboring Metro Pike Center, the initial phases of this development are expected to be on the west side of Rockville Pike at Metro Pike Center. The Company has not committed to any timetable for commencement of construction. 

Acquisition and Development Activity 

A significant contributor to the Company&#8217;s recent growth in its Shopping Center portfolio has been its land acquisitions and subsequent development, redevelopment of existing centers and operating property acquisition activities. Redevelopment activities reposition the Company&#8217;s centers to be competitive in the current retailing environment. These redevelopments typically include an update of the facade, site improvements and reconfiguring tenant spaces to accommodate tenant size requirements and merchandising evolution. During the period January 1, 2013 &#32;through December 31, 2015 , the Company acquired eight &#32;real estate assets. Below is a discussion of significant activities. 

2015 &#32;/ 2014 &#32;/ 2013 &#32;Acquisitions, Developments and Redevelopments 

1500, 1580, 1582, 1584 Rockville Pike 

In 2014, in separate transactions, the Company purchased three properties, with approximately 57,400 square feet of retail space for an aggregate $25.2 million. The three properties are adjacent to an existing property on the east side of Rockville Pike near the Twinbrook Metro station. Combined, the four properties total 10.3 &#32;acres and are zoned for up to 1.2 million &#32;square feet of rentable mixed-use space. The Company is actively engaged in a plan for redevelopment but has not committed to any timetable for commencement of construction. 

726, 730, 750 North Glebe Road 

In 2014, in separate transactions, the Company purchased two adjacent properties, with approximately 18,900 square feet of retail space, on North Glebe Road in Arlington, Virginia, for an aggregate $42.8 million. In September 2015, the Company purchased an additional property on North Glebe Road, which is adjacent to the two properties acquired in 2014, for $ 4.0 million . Combined, the properties total 2.5 &#32;acres and are zoned for up to 550,000 &#32;square feet of rentable mixed-use space. The Company is actively engaged in a plan for redevelopment but has not committed to any timetable for commencement of construction. 

Park Van Ness (formerly Van Ness Square) 

During 2013, the Company completed negotiation of lease termination agreements with the tenants of Van Ness Square and the building became vacant in April 2013. Costs incurred related to those termination arrangements were amortized to expense using the straight-line method over the remaining terms of the leases and are included in &#8220;Predevelopment Expenses&#8221; in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Lease termination costs and demolition costs totaled approximately $3.9 million &#32;in 2013 &#32;and $0.5 million &#32;in 2014 . The Company is developing a 271-unit residential project with approximately 9,000 square feet of street-level retail, below street-level structured parking and amenities including a community room, landscaped courtyards, a fitness room and a rooftop pool and deck. Construction is expected to be substantially completed early in the second quarter of 2016. The structure comprises 11 levels, five of which are below street level. Interior finishes are nearing completion and site work is being finalized. The street level retail space is 100% leased to a grocery/gourmet food market and an upscale Italian restaurant. The total cost of the project, excluding predevelopment expense and land (which the Company has owned), is expected to be approximately $93.0 million , a portion of which is being financed with a $71.6 million &#32;construction-to-permanent loan. Costs incurred through December 31, 2015 , total approximately $77.2 million , of which $45.2 million &#32;has been financed by the loan.
