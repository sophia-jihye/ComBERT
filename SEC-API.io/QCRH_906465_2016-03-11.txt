Business

&#160; 

General. QCR Holdings, Inc. is a multi-bank holding company headquartered in Moline, Illinois, that was formed in February 1993 under the laws of the state of Delaware. The Company serves the Quad Cities, Cedar Rapids, Waterloo/Cedar Falls and Rockford communities through the following three wholly-owned banking subsidiaries, which provide full-service commercial and consumer banking and trust and asset management services: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

QCBT, which is based in Bettendorf, Iowa, and commenced operations in 1994; 

&#160; &#9679; 

CRBT, which is based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and commenced operations in 2001; and 

&#160; &#9679; 

RB&#38;T, which is based in Rockford, Illinois, and commenced operations in 2005. 

&#160; 

On May 13, 2013, the Company acquired Community National and its banking subsidiary, CNB. Community National and CNB commenced operations in 1997 and historically provided full-service commercial and consumer banking, and trust and asset management services, to Cedar Falls, Mason City, and Waterloo, Iowa and Austin, Minnesota. At acquisition, CNB had a total of eight branch facilities with four in the Waterloo/Cedar Falls area where CNB was headquartered, two in Mason City, and two in Austin. On October 4, 2013, the Company finalized the sale of the two branches in Mason City. On October 11, 2013, the Company finalized the sale of the two branches in Austin. On October 26, 2013, CNB merged with and into CRBT. CNB&#8217;s merged branch offices operate as a division of CRBT under the name &#8220;Community Bank &#38; Trust.&#8221; In December 2013, one of the branch facilities in Cedar Falls was closed due to lack of sufficient customer activity. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the acquisition of Community National and sales of certain CNB branches. 

&#160; 

The Company also engages in direct financing lease contracts through m2, a wholly-owned subsidiary of QCBT based in Brookfield, Wisconsin. QCBT previously owned 80% of m2. In August 2012, QCBT entered into an amendment to the operating agreement of m2 and purchased the remaining 20% noncontrolling interest. See Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the acquisition. 

&#160; 

Subsidiary Banks. QCBT was capitalized on October 13, 1993, and commenced operations on January 7, 1994. QCBT is an Iowa-chartered commercial bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System with depository accounts insured by the FDIC to the maximum amount permitted by law. QCBT provides full service commercial, correspondent, and consumer banking and trust and asset management services in the Quad Cities and adjacent communities through its five offices that are located in Bettendorf and Davenport, Iowa and in Moline, Illinois. QCBT, on a consolidated basis with m2, had total segment assets of $1.34 billion and $1.32 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

&#160; 

CRBT is an Iowa-chartered commercial bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System with depository accounts insured by the FDIC to the maximum amount permitted by law. The Company commenced operations in Cedar Rapids in June 2001, operating a branch of QCBT. The Cedar Rapids branch operation then began functioning under the CRBT charter in September 2001. As previously discussed, the merged branches of CNB operate as a division of CRBT under the name &#8220;Community Bank &#38; Trust.&#8221; CRBT provides full-service commercial and consumer banking and trust and asset management services to Cedar Rapids and Waterloo/Cedar Falls, Iowa and adjacent communities through its five facilities. The headquarters for CRBT is located in downtown Cedar Rapids with one other branch located in northern Cedar Rapids, two branches located in Waterloo and one branch located in Cedar Falls.

&#160; 

QCR Holdings Statutory Trust IV was dissolved in 2016 after the Company purchased the related security at auction, as noted in Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

Other Ownership Interests. In addition to its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Company owns a 20% equity position in Nobel Real Estate Investors, LLC. In June 2005, CRBT entered into a joint venture as a 50% owner of Cedar Rapids Mortgage Company, LLC, which provided residential real estate mortgage lending services. During the first quarter of 2013, CRBT and the partner mutually terminated the joint venture. CRBT continues to provide residential real estate mortgage lending services through its consumer banking division. In December 2014, QCBT entered into a joint venture as a 20% owner of Ruhl Mortgage, to provide residential real estate mortgage lending services and products to QCBT clients. 

&#160; 

Business. The Company&#8217;s principal business consists of attracting deposits and investing those deposits in loans/leases and securities. The deposits of the subsidiary banks are insured to the maximum amount allowable by the FDIC. The Company&#8217;s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on its loans/leases and securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. The Company&#8217;s operating results are affected by economic and competitive conditions, particularly changes in interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities, as described more fully in this Form 10-K. Its operating results also can be affected by trust fees, investment advisory and management fees, deposit service charge fees, gains on the sale of residential real estate and government guaranteed loans, earnings from BOLI and other noninterest income. Operating expenses include employee compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment expense, professional and data processing fees, advertising and marketing expenses, bank service charges, FDIC and other insurance, loan/lease expenses and other administrative expenses. 

&#160; 

The Company and its subsidiaries collectively employed 406 and 409 FTEs at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

&#160; 

The Federal Reserve is the primary federal regulator of the Company and its subsidiaries. In addition, QCBT and CRBT are regulated by the Iowa Superintendent and RB&#38;T is regulated by the IDFPR. The FDIC, as administrator of the Deposit Insurance Fund, also has regulatory authority over the subsidiary banks. See Appendix A for more information on the federal and state statutes and regulations that are applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Lending/Leasing. The Company and its subsidiaries provide a broad range of commercial and retail lending/leasing and investment services to corporations, partnerships, individuals, and government agencies. The subsidiary banks actively market their services to qualified lending and deposit clients. Officers actively solicit the business of new clients entering their market areas as well as long-standing members of the local business community. The Company has an established lending/leasing policy which includes a number of underwriting factors to be considered in making a loan/lease, including, but not limited to, location, loan-to-value ratio, cash flow, collateral and the credit history of the borrower. 

&#160; 

In accordance with Iowa regulation, the legal lending limit to one borrower for QCBT and CRBT, calculated as 15% of aggregate capital, was $19.7 million and $15.8 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2015. In accordance with Illinois regulation, the legal lending limit to one borrower for RB&#38;T, calculated as 25% of aggregate capital, totaled $9.6 million as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

The Company recognizes the need to prevent excessive concentrations of credit exposure to any one borrower or group of related borrowers. As such, the Company has established an in-house lending limit, which is lower than each subsidiary bank&#8217;s legal lending limit, in an effort to manage individual borrower exposure levels. 

&#160; 

The in-house lending limit is the maximum amount of credit each subsidiary bank will extend to a single borrowing entity or group of related entities. Under the in-house limit, total credit exposure to a single borrowing entity or group of related entities will not exceed the following, subject to certain exceptions: 

&#160; 

QCBT:

&#160;

$

10.0 million

CRBT:

&#160;

$

7.5 million

RB&#38;T:

&#160;

$

3.7 million

&#160;

On a consolidated basis, the in-house lending limit is $15.0 million, which is the maximum amount of credit that all affiliated banks, when combined, will extend to a single borrowing entity or group of related entities, subject to certain exceptions. 

&#160; 

In addition, m2&#8217;s in-house lending limit is $1.0 million to a single leasing entity or group of related entities. 

&#160; 

As part of the loan monitoring activity at the three subsidiary banks, credit administration personnel interact closely with senior bank management. For example, the internal loan committee of each subsidiary bank meets weekly. The Company has a separate in-house loan review function to analyze credits of the subsidiary banks. To complement the in-house loan review, an independent third-party performs external loan reviews. Historically, management has attempted to identify problem loans at an early stage and to aggressively seek a resolution of those situations. 

&#160; 

The Company recognizes that a diversified loan/lease portfolio contributes to reducing risk in the overall loan/lease portfolio. The specific loan/lease portfolio mix is subject to change based on loan/lease demand, the business environment and various economic factors. The Company actively monitors concentrations within the loan/lease portfolio to ensure appropriate diversification and concentration risk is maintained. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Specifically, each subsidiary bank&#8217;s total loans as a percentage of average assets may not exceed 85%. In addition, following are established policy limits and the actual allocations for the three subsidiary banks as of December 31, 2015 for the loan portfolio on a per loan type basis, reflected as a percentage of the subsidiary bank&#8217;s average gross loans:

Proper pricing of loans is necessary to provide adequate return to the Company&#8217;s stockholders. Loan pricing, as established by the subsidiary banks&#8217; internal loan committees, includes consideration for the cost of funds, loan maturity and risk, origination and maintenance costs, appropriate stockholder return, competitive factors, and the economic environment. The portfolio contains a mix of loans with fixed and floating interest rates. Management attempts to maximize the use of interest rate floors on its variable rate loan portfolio. Refer to Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for more discussion on the Company&#8217;s management of interest rate risk.

&#160;

&#160; 

C&#38;I Lending 

&#160; 

As noted above, the subsidiary banks are active C&#38;I lenders. The current areas of emphasis include loans to small and mid-sized businesses with a wide range of operations such as wholesalers, manufacturers, building contractors, business services companies, other banks, and retailers. The banks provide a wide range of business loans, including lines of credit for working capital and operational purposes, and term loans for the acquisition of facilities, equipment and other purposes. Since 2010, the subsidiary banks have been active in participating in lending programs offered by the SBA and USDA. Under these programs, the government entities will generally provide a guarantee of repayment ranging from 50% to 85% of the principal amount of the qualifying loan. 

&#160; 

Loan approval is generally based on the following factors: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Ability and stability of current management of the borrower; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Stable earnings with positive financial trends; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Sufficient cash flow to support debt repayment; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Earnings projections based on reasonable assumptions; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Financial strength of the industry and business; and 

&#160; &#9679; 

Value and marketability of collateral. 

&#160; 

For C&#38;I loans, the Company assigns internal risk ratings which are largely dependent upon the aforementioned approval factors. The risk rating is reviewed annually or on an as needed basis depending on the specific circumstances of the loan. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information, including the internal risk rating scale. 

&#160; 

As part of the underwriting process, management reviews current borrower financial statements. When appropriate, certain C&#38;I loans may contain covenants requiring maintenance of financial performance ratios such as, but not limited to: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Minimum debt service coverage ratio; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Minimum current ratio; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Maximum debt to tangible net worth ratio; and/or 

&#160; &#9679; 

Minimum tangible net worth. 

&#160; 

Establishment of these financial performance ratios depends on a number of factors, including risk rating and the specific industry. 

&#160; 

Collateral for these loans generally includes accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, and real estate. The Company&#8217;s lending policy specifies approved collateral types and corresponding maximum advance percentages. The value of collateral pledged on loans must exceed the loan amount by a margin sufficient to absorb potential erosion of its value in the event of foreclosure and cover the loan amount plus costs incurred to convert it to cash. Approved non-real estate collateral types and corresponding maximum advance percentages for each are listed below. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 75% of orderly liquidation appraised value Fixed Assets (New) 

80% of cost

0% 

&#160; &#160; 

Generally, if the above collateral is part of a cross-collateralization with other approved assets, then the maximum advance percentage may be higher. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s lending policy specifies maximum term limits for C&#38;I loans. For term loans, the maximum term is generally seven years. Generally, term loans range from three to five years. For lines of credit, the maximum term is typically 365 days. 

&#160; 

In addition, the subsidiary banks often take personal guarantees or cosignors to help assure repayment. Loans may be made on an unsecured basis if warranted by the overall financial condition of the borrower. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

CRE Lending 

&#160; 

The subsidiary banks also make CRE loans. CRE loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to C&#38;I loans, in addition to those standards and processes specific to real estate loans. Collateral for these loans generally includes the underlying real estate and improvements, and may include additional assets of the borrower. The Company&#8217;s lending policy specifies maximum loan-to-value limits based on the category of CRE (commercial real estate loans on improved property, raw land, land development, and commercial construction). These limits are the same limits as, or in some situations, more conservative than, those established by regulatory authorities. Following is a listing of these limits as well as some of the other guidelines included in the Company&#8217;s lending policy for the major categories of CRE loans: 

&#160; 

&#160;

CRE Loan Types 

&#160; Maximum Advance Rate ** 

&#160; Maximum 

Term 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; CRE Loans on Improved Property * 

&#160; 80% 

&#160; 7 years 

Raw Land 

&#160; Lesser of 90% of project cost, or 65% of "as is" appraised value 

&#160; 12 months 

Land Development 

&#160; Lesser of 90% of project cost, or 75% of appraised value 

&#160; 24 months 

Commercial Construction Loans 

&#160; Lesser of 90% of project cost, or 80% of appraised value 

&#160; 365 days 

&#160; 

* Generally, the debt service coverage ratio must be a minimum of 1.25x for non-owner occupied loans and 1.15x for owner-occupied loans. For loans greater than $500 thousand, the subsidiary banks sensitize this ratio for deteriorated economic conditions, major changes in interest rates, and/or significant increases in vacancy rates. 

** These maximum rates are consistent with, or in some situations, more conservative than, those established by regulatory authorities. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s lending policy also includes guidelines for real estate appraisals and evaluations, including minimum appraisal and evaluation standards based on certain transactions. In addition, the subsidiary banks often take personal guarantees to help assure repayment. 

&#160; 

In addition, management tracks the level of owner-occupied CRE loans versus non-owner occupied CRE loans. Owner-occupied CRE loans are generally considered to have less risk. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, approximately 35% and 37%, respectively, of the CRE loan portfolio was owner-occupied. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s lending policy limits non-owner occupied CRE lending to 300% of total risk-based capital, and limits construction, land development, and other land loans to 100% of total risk-based capital. Exceeding these limits warrants the use of heightened risk management practices in accordance with regulatory guidelines. As of December 31, 2015, all three subsidiary banks were in compliance with these limits. 

&#160; 

Following is a listing of the significant industries within the Company&#8217;s CRE loan portfolio as of December 31, 2015 and 2014:

&#160; 

Direct Financing Leasing 

&#160; 

m2 leases machinery and equipment to C&#38;I customers under direct financing leases. All lease requests are subject to the credit requirements and criteria as set forth in the lending/leasing policy. In all cases, a formal independent credit analysis of the lessee is performed. 

&#160; 

The following private and public sector business assets are generally acceptable to consider for lease funding: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Computer systems; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Photocopy systems; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Fire trucks; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Specialized road maintenance equipment; 

&#160; &#9679;

Trucks and trailers; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Equipment classified as plant or office equipment; and 

&#160; &#9679; 

Marine boat lifts. 

&#160; 

m2 will generally refrain from funding leases of the following type: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Leases collateralized by non-marketable items; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Leases collateralized by consumer items, such as vehicles, household goods, recreational vehicles, boats, etc.; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Leases collateralized by used equipment, unless its remaining useful life can be readily determined; and 

&#160; &#9679; 

Leases with a repayment schedule exceeding seven years. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Residential Real Estate Lending 

&#160; 

Generally, the subsidiary banks&#8217; residential real estate loans conform to the underwriting requirements of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to allow the subsidiary banks to resell loans in the secondary market. The subsidiary banks structure most loans that will not conform to those underwriting requirements as adjustable rate mortgages that adjust in one to five years, and then retain these loans in their portfolios. Servicing rights are not presently retained on the loans sold in the secondary market. The Company&#8217;s lending policy establishes minimum appraisal and other credit guidelines. 

&#160; 

The following table presents the originations and sales of residential real estate loans for the Company. Included in originations is activity related to the refinancing of previously held in-house mortgages.

Installment and Other Consumer Lending 

&#160; 

The consumer lending department of each subsidiary bank provides many types of consumer loans, including home improvement, home equity, motor vehicle, signature loans and small personal credit lines. The Company&#8217;s lending policy addresses specific credit guidelines by consumer loan type. In particular, for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit, the minimum credit bureau score is 680. For both home equity loans and lines of credit, the maximum advance rate is 90% of value with a minimum credit bureau score of 720, and the maximum advance rate is 80% of value with a credit bureau score of 680 to 719. The maximum term on home equity loans is 10 years and maximum amortization is 15 years. The maximum term on home equity lines of credit is five years. 

&#160; 

In some instances for all loans/leases, it may be appropriate to originate or purchase loans/leases that are exceptions to the guidelines and limits established within the Company&#8217;s lending policy described above. In general, exceptions to the lending policy do not significantly deviate from the guidelines and limits established within the lending policy and, if there are exceptions, they are generally noted as such and specifically identified in loan/lease approval documents. 

&#160; 

Competition. The Company currently operates in the highly competitive Quad Cities, Cedar Rapids, Waterloo/Cedar Falls, and Rockford markets. Competitors include not only other commercial banks, credit unions, thrift institutions, and mutual funds, but also insurance companies, finance companies, brokerage firms, investment banking companies, and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies. Many of these competitors are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as the Company. Many of these unregulated competitors compete across geographic boundaries and provide customers increasing access to meaningful alternatives to banking services. The Company competes in markets with a number of much larger financial institutions with substantially greater resources and larger lending limits. 

&#160; 

Appendices. The commercial banking business is a highly regulated business. See Appendix A for a summary of the federal and state statutes and regulations that are applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries. Supervision, regulation and examination of banks and bank holding companies by bank regulatory agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors rather than stockholders of bank holding companies and banks.
