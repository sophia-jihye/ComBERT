BUSINESS 

General 

KB Home is one of the largest and most recognized homebuilding companies in the U.S. and has been building homes for nearly 60 years. We construct and sell a variety of new homes designed primarily for first-time, move-up and active adult homebuyers, including attached and detached single-family residential homes, townhomes and condominiums. We offer homes in development communities, at urban in-fill locations and as part of mixed-use projects. Our homebuilding operations represent most of our business, accounting for 99.6% of our total revenues in 2015 . Our financial services operations, which accounted for .4% of our total revenues in 2015 , offer certain insurance products to our homebuyers and title services in certain markets. Since July 2014, our financial services operations have also provided mortgage banking services, including residential consumer mortgage loan (&#8220;mortgage loan&#8221;) originations, to our homebuyers indirectly through Home Community Mortgage, LLC (&#8220;HCM&#8221;). HCM is an unconsolidated joint venture we formed with Nationstar Mortgage LLC (&#8220;Nationstar&#8221;). 

Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; used in this report refer to KB Home, a Delaware corporation, and its predecessors and subsidiaries. Also as used in this report, &#8220;home&#8221; is a single-family residence, whether it is a single-family home or other type of residential property; &#8220;community&#8221; is a single development in which new homes are constructed as part of an integrated plan; and &#8220;community count&#8221; is the number of communities we have open for sales with at least five homes/lots left to sell. 

The following charts present homes delivered and homebuilding revenues for the years ended November 30, 2013, 2014 and 2015:

Additional financial and operational information related to our homebuilding reporting segments, including revenues, pretax income (losses), inventories and assets, is provided below in the &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 

and Results of Operations&#8221; section and in Note 2. Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. 

Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. The above table does not include homes delivered or revenues from unconsolidated joint ventures in which we participate. These unconsolidated joint ventures acquire and develop land in various markets where our homebuilding operations are located and, in some cases, build and deliver homes on the land developed. 

Strategy 

Since 1997, we have followed the principles of an operational business model that we call KBnxt. KBnxt provides the core framework under which we have established the primary strategic goals for our homebuilding business. We believe the principles of KBnxt set us apart from other high-production homebuilders and provide the foundation for our long-term growth. 

KBnxt . With KBnxt, we seek to generate improved operating efficiencies and return on investment through a disciplined, fact-based and process-driven approach to homebuilding that is founded on a constant and systematic assessment of consumer preferences and market opportunities. The key principles of KBnxt include the following: 

&#8226; 

gaining a detailed understanding of consumer location and home design and interior/exterior design option preferences through regular surveys and research. In this report and elsewhere, we refer to our home designs and design options as our &#8220;products;&#8221; 

&#8226; 

managing our working capital and reducing our operating risks by primarily acquiring developed and entitled land at reasonable prices in identified preferred markets and submarkets that meet our investment return standards and market positioning (or &#8220;marketing&#8221;) strategy; 

&#8226; 

using our knowledge of consumer preferences to design, offer, construct and deliver products that meet the needs and interests of the largest demographic of homebuyers in our served markets. Historically, this demographic has been comprised of first-time and move-up homebuyers; 

&#8226; 

in general, commencing construction of a home only after we have a signed purchase contract with a buyer and have obtained preliminary credit approval or other evidence of the buyer&#8217;s financial ability to purchase the home; 

&#8226; 

building a backlog of orders to maintain an even flow production of homes, and minimizing the cycle time from the start of construction to the delivery of homes to buyers; and 

&#8226; 

offering customers a distinctive homebuying experience designed to offer the best combination of value and choice through affordable sales prices plus the opportunity to customize their homes as they desire by selecting a lot location within a community, various house elevations and floor plans, and numerous interior and exterior design options and upgrades available at our design studios. As part of this process, in-house teams of sales representatives, design consultants and other personnel work with each buyer to create a home that meets the buyer&#8217;s needs and budget. 

We consider KBnxt to be integral to our success in the homebuilding industry. However, there may be market-driven circumstances where we believe it is necessary or appropriate to temporarily deviate from certain KBnxt principles. These deviations may include starting construction on a small number of homes in a community before corresponding purchase contracts are signed with buyers to more quickly meet customer delivery expectations and generate revenues; or acquiring undeveloped or unentitled land that otherwise fits within our marketing strategy and meets our investment return standards. In addition, other circumstances could arise in the future that may lead us to make specific short-term shifts from our KBnxt principles. 

Strategic and Operational Focus . Guided by our KBnxt principles, we have since 2012 implemented an aggressive land acquisition and development investment strategy targeted at positioning more of our communities in attractive, land-constrained locations featuring higher-income homebuyers. We have also refined our product offerings to meet these buyers&#8217; preferences both for larger homes with the option for more lot and product premiums and the choice of design options and upgrades to include with the construction of their homes. Over the last three years, we have invested approximately $3.57 billion &#32;in land and land development and substantially expanded our operating platform and community count. To further accelerate our growth, we have prioritized enhancing the profitability of each home delivered and generating higher revenues, as well as improving our asset efficiency and return on invested capital. Through this integrated strategic framework and its corresponding initiatives, we have produced significant improvement in our financial results and have been profitable for each of the last three fiscal years. We believe we can sustain our progress in 2016 by continuing to advance our top strategic priorities, which are discussed further in this report, subject to conditions in the overall economy and the housing, capital, credit and financial markets. 

Promotional Marketing Strategy . Our promotional marketing efforts are centered on differentiating the KB Home brand from resale homes and from new homes sold by other homebuilders. These efforts increasingly involve interactive Internet-based applications, social media outlets and other evolving communication technologies. 

Our design studios are a key component of our distinct homebuying experience and help increase the revenues we generate from home sales. These showrooms, which are generally centrally located within our served markets and utilize electronic displays and virtual design tools, allow our homebuyers to customize their home by selecting from a wide variety of design options and upgrades that are available at no cost or for purchase as part of the original construction of their home. The coordinated efforts of our sales representatives and design studio consultants are intended to generate higher customer satisfaction and lead to enhanced customer retention and referrals. 

Customer Service. &#32; Our on-site construction supervisors perform regular pre-closing quality checks and our sales representatives maintain regular contact with our homebuyers during the home construction process in an effort to ensure our homes meet our standards and our homebuyers&#8217; expectations. We also have employees who are responsible for responding to homebuyers&#8217; post-closing needs, including warranty claims. Information about our limited warranty program is provided in Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report. 

Operational Structure. We operate our homebuilding business through divisions with experienced management teams who have in-depth local knowledge of their particular served markets, which helps us acquire land in preferred locations; develop communities with products that meet local demand; and understand local regulatory environments. Our division management teams exercise considerable autonomy in identifying land acquisition opportunities; developing land and communities; implementing product, marketing and sales strategies; and controlling costs. To help maintain consistent execution within our organization, our division management teams and other employees are continuously trained on KBnxt principles and are evaluated, in part, based on their achievement of relevant operational objectives. 

Our corporate management and support personnel develop and oversee the implementation of our overall operational policies and internal control standards, and perform various centralized functions, including treasury and cash management; land acquisition approval; accounting and financial reporting; internal audit and compliance activities; and investor and media relations. 

Community Development and Land Inventory Management 

Developable land for the production of homes is a core resource for our business. Based on our current strategic plans, we seek to own or control land sufficient to meet our forecasted production goals for the next three to five years. In 2016, we intend to continue to selectively acquire or control additional land that meets our investment return and marketing standards. However, we may decide to sell certain land interests as part of our capital allocation and marketing strategy, or to monetize land previously held for future development, or for other reasons. 

Our community development process generally consists of four phases: land acquisition, land development into finished lots for a community (if necessary), home construction and delivery of completed homes to buyers. Historically, our community development process has ranged from six to 24 months in our West Coast homebuilding reporting segment, with a somewhat shorter duration in our other homebuilding reporting segments. Our community development process varies based on, among other things, the extent and speed of required government approvals and utility service activations, the overall size of a particular community, the scope of necessary site preparation activities, the type of product(s) that will be offered, weather conditions, time of year, promotional marketing results, the availability of construction resources, consumer demand, local and general economic and housing market conditions, and other factors. 

Although they vary significantly in size and complexity, our communities typically consist of 30 to 250 lots ranging in size from 1,900 to 11,500 square feet. In our communities, we typically offer three to 15 home design choices. We also generally build one to three model homes at each community so that prospective buyers can preview various products available. Depending on the community, we may offer premium lots containing more square footage, better views and/or location benefits. Some of our communities consist of multiple-story structures that encompass several attached condominium-style units. 

Land Acquisition and Land Development. We continuously evaluate land acquisition opportunities against our investment return and marketing standards, balancing competing needs for financial strength, liquidity and land inventory for future growth. When we acquire land, we generally focus on parcels with lots that are fully entitled for residential construction and are either physically developed to start home construction (referred to as &#8220;finished lots&#8221;) or partially finished. However, depending on market conditions and available opportunities, we may acquire undeveloped and/or unentitled land. We may also invest in land that requires us to repurpose and re-entitle the property for residential use, such as in-fill developments. We expect that the overall balance of undeveloped, unentitled, entitled, partially finished and finished lots in our inventory will vary over time, and in 

implementing our strategic growth initiatives, we may acquire a greater proportion of undeveloped or unentitled land in the future if and as the availability of reasonably-priced land with finished or partially finished lots diminishes. 

We target geographic areas for potential land acquisitions and community development based on the results of periodic surveys of both new and resale homebuyers in particular markets, prevailing local economic conditions, the supply and type of homes available for sale, and other research activities. Local, in-house specialists analyze specific geographic areas to identify desirable land acquisition targets or to evaluate whether to dispose of an existing land interest. We also use studies performed by third-party specialists. 

We generally structure our land acquisition and land development activities to minimize, or to defer the timing of, expenditures in order to reduce both the market risks associated with holding land and our working capital and financial commitments, including interest and other carrying costs. We typically use contracts that in exchange for a small initial option or earnest money deposit payment give us an option or similar right to acquire land at a future date, usually at a pre-determined price and pending our satisfaction with the feasibility of developing and selling homes on the land and/or an underlying land seller&#8217;s completion of certain obligations, such as securing entitlements, developing infrastructure or finishing lots. We refer to land subject to such option or similar contractual rights as being &#8220;controlled.&#8221; Our decision to exercise a particular land option or similar right is based on the results of our due diligence and continued market viability analysis after entering into such a contract. Information related to our land option contracts and other similar contracts is provided in Note 7. Inventory Impairments and Land Option Contract Abandonments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.

The following charts present the percentage of inventory lots we owned or controlled under land option contracts or other similar contracts by homebuilding reporting segment and the percentage of total lots we owned and controlled under option as of November 30, 2015: 

Home Construction and Deliveries. Following the acquisition of land and, if necessary, the development of the land into finished lots, we typically begin constructing model homes and marketing homes for sale. We have developed and refined a standardized set of value-engineered home designs to enhance our construction efficiency. To minimize the costs and risks of unsold homes in production, we generally begin construction of a home only after we have a signed purchase contract with a buyer and we have obtained preliminary credit approval or other evidence of the buyer&#8217;s financial ability to purchase the home. However, cancellations of home purchase contracts prior to the delivery of the underlying homes, the construction of attached products with some unsold units, or specific strategic considerations will result in our having unsold completed or partially-completed homes in our inventory. 

We act as the general contractor for the majority of our communities, and engage outside general contractors in all other instances. We, or the outside general contractors we engage, contract with a variety of independent subcontractors, who are typically locally-based, to perform all land development and home construction work through their own employees or subcontractors. We do not self-perform any land development or home construction work. These independent subcontractors also supply some of the building materials required for such production activities. Our contracts with these independent subcontractors require that they comply with all laws applicable to their work, including wage and safety laws, meet performance standards, and follow local building codes and permits. 

Raw Materials . Outside of land, the principal raw materials used in our production process are concrete and forest products. Other primary materials used in home construction include drywall and plumbing and electrical items. We source all of our building materials from third parties. We attempt to enhance the efficiency of our operations by using, where practical, standardized materials that are commercially available on competitive terms from a variety of outside sources. In addition, we have national and regional purchasing programs for certain building materials, appliances, fixtures and other items that allow us to benefit from large-quantity purchase discounts and, where available, participate in outside manufacturer or supplier rebate programs. When possible, we arrange for bulk purchases of these products at favorable prices from such manufacturers and suppliers. Although our purchasing strategies have helped us in negotiating favorable prices for raw materials, in recent years we have encountered higher prices for lumber, drywall and concrete. 

Backlog 

Our &#8220;backlog&#8221; consists of homes that are under a purchase contract but have not yet been delivered to a buyer. Ending backlog represents the number of homes in backlog from the previous period plus the number of net orders (new orders for homes less cancellations) generated during the current period minus the number of homes delivered during the current period. Our backlog at any given time will be affected by cancellations, homes delivered and our community count. Our cancellation rates and the factors affecting our cancellation rates are further discussed below in both the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; sections in this report. The number of homes we deliver has historically increased from the first to the fourth quarter in any year. Substantially all of our homes in backlog at November 30, 2015 are expected to be delivered during the year ended November 30, 2016. 

Our backlog at November 30, 2015 &#32;increased 36% &#32;to 3,966 &#32;homes from 2,909 &#32;homes at November 30, 2014 , largely due to a year-over-year increase in our net orders in 2015. Our backlog at November 30, 2015 &#32;represented potential future housing revenues of approximately $1.28 billion , a 40% &#32;increase from approximately $914.0 million &#32;at November 30, 2014 , reflecting the larger number of homes in our backlog and a higher average selling price of those homes. 

The following charts present our ending backlog (number of homes and value) by homebuilding reporting segment as of November 30, 2014 &#32;and 2015 : 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had approximately 1,680 and 1,590 full-time employees, respectively. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. 

Competition, Seasonality, Delivery Mix and Other Factors 

Competition. &#32;&#32;The homebuilding industry and housing market are highly competitive with respect to selling homes; contracting for construction services, such as carpentry, roofing, electrical and plumbing; and acquiring attractive developable land, though the intensity of competition can vary and fluctuate between and within individual markets and submarkets. We compete for homebuyers, construction resources and desirable land against numerous homebuilders, ranging from regional and national firms to small local enterprises. As to homebuyers, we primarily compete with other homebuilders on the basis of selling price, community location and amenities, availability of financing options, home designs, reputation, home construction cycle time, and the design options and upgrades that can be included in a home. In some cases, this competition occurs within larger residential development projects containing separate sections designed, planned and developed by other homebuilders. We also compete for homebuyers against housing alternatives to new homes, including resale homes, apartments, single-family rentals and other rental housing. In markets experiencing heavy construction activity, there can be severe craft and skilled trade shortages that limit independent subcontractors&#8217; ability to supply construction services to us, which in turn tends to drive up our costs and/or extend our production schedules. Elevated construction activity has also contributed to measurable increases in the cost of certain building materials, such as lumber, drywall and concrete. Since 2013, we also have seen higher prices for desirable land amid heightened competition with homebuilders and other developers and investors, particularly in the land-constrained areas we are strategically targeting. We expect these upward cost trends to continue in 2016 if and as housing market activity grows and there is greater competition for these resources. 

Seasonality. Our performance is affected by seasonal demand trends for housing. Traditionally, there has been more consumer demand for home purchases and we tend to generate more net orders in the spring and early summer months (corresponding to most of our second quarter and part of our third quarter) than at other times of the year. With our distinct homebuying approach and typical home construction cycle times, this &#8220;selling season&#8221; demand results in our delivering more homes and generating 

higher revenues from late summer through the fall months (corresponding to part of our third quarter and all of our fourth quarter). On a relative basis, the winter and early spring months within our first quarter and part of our second quarter usually produce the fewest net orders, homes delivered and revenues, and the sequential difference from our fourth quarter to our first quarter can be significant. 

Delivery Mix and Other Factors. In addition to the overall volume of homes we sell and deliver, our results in a given period are significantly affected by the geographic mix of markets and submarkets in which we operate; the number and characteristics of the communities we have open for sales in those markets and submarkets; and the products we sell from those communities during the period. While there are some similarities, there are differences within and between our served markets in terms of the quantity, size and nature of the communities we operate and the products we offer to consumers. These differences reflect, among other things, local homebuyer preferences; household demographics (e.g., large families or working professionals; income levels); geographic context (e.g., urban or suburban; availability of reasonably priced finished lots; development constraints; residential density); and the shifts that can occur in these factors over time. These structural factors in each of our served markets will affect the costs we incur and the time it takes to locate, acquire rights to and develop land, open communities for sales, and market and build homes; the size of our homes; our selling prices (including the contribution from homebuyers&#8217; purchases of design options and upgrades); the pace at which we sell and deliver homes and close out communities; and our housing gross profits and housing gross profit margins. Therefore, our results in any given period will fluctuate compared to other periods based on the proportion of homes delivered from areas with higher or lower selling prices and on the corresponding land and overhead costs incurred to generate those deliveries, as well as from our overall community count. 

Financing 

Our operations have historically been funded by internally generated cash flows, public equity and debt issuances, land option contracts and other similar contracts and land seller financing, and performance bonds and letters of credit. We also have the ability to borrow funds under our unsecured revolving credit facility with various banks (&#8220;Credit Facility&#8221;). Depending on market conditions and available opportunities, we may obtain project financing, or secure external financing with community or other inventory assets that we own or control. By &#8220;project financing,&#8221; we mean loans that are specifically obtained for, or secured by, particular communities or other inventory assets. We may also arrange or engage in bank loan, project debt or other financial transactions and/or expand the capacity of the Credit Facility or our cash-collateralized letter of credit facilities with various financial institutions (the &#8220;LOC Facilities&#8221;) or enter into additional such facilities. 

Environmental Compliance Matters and Sustainability 

As part of our due diligence process for land acquisitions, we often use third-party environmental consultants to investigate potential environmental risks, and we require disclosures, representations and warranties from land sellers regarding environmental risks. Despite these efforts, there can be no assurance that we will avoid material liabilities relating to the existence or removal of toxic wastes, site restoration, monitoring or other environmental matters affecting properties currently or previously owned or controlled by us. No estimate of any potential liabilities can be made although we may, from time to time, acquire property that requires us to incur environmental clean-up costs after conducting appropriate due diligence, including, but not limited to, using detailed investigations performed by environmental consultants. In such instances, we take steps prior to our acquisition of the land to gain reasonable assurance as to the precise scope of work required and the costs associated with removal, site restoration and/or monitoring. To the extent contamination or other environmental issues have occurred in the past, we will attempt to recover restoration costs from third parties, such as the generators of hazardous waste, land sellers or others in the prior chain of title and/or their insurers. Based on these practices, we anticipate that it is unlikely that environmental clean-up costs will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We have not been notified by any governmental agency of any claim that any of the properties owned or formerly owned by us are identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (or similar state or local agency) as being a &#8220;Superfund&#8221; (or similar state or local) clean-up site requiring remediation, which could have a material effect on our future consolidated financial statements. Costs associated with the use of environmental consultants are not material to our consolidated financial statements. 

We have made a dedicated effort to further differentiate ourselves from other homebuilders and resale homes through our ongoing commitment to become a leading national company in environmental sustainability. We continually seek out and utilize innovative technologies and systems to further improve the energy and water efficiency of our homes, as well as engage in campaigns and other educational efforts, sometimes together with other companies, organizations and groups, to increase consumer awareness of the importance and impact of sustainability in selecting a home and the products within a home. Under our commitment to sustainability, we, among other things: 

&#8226; 

build energy- and water-efficient new homes; 

&#8226; 

developed an Energy Performance Guide&#174;, or EPG&#174;, that informs our homebuyers of the relative energy efficiency and the related estimated monthly energy costs of each of our homes as designed, compared to typical new and existing homes; and 

&#8226; 

created and are adding more net-zero energy and zero freshwater design options, under a program called Double ZeroHouse&#8482; 3.0, that are available in select markets. 

More information about our sustainability commitment can be found in our annual sustainability reports, which we have published on our website since 2008. We intend to continue to research, evaluate and utilize new or improved products and construction and business practices consistent with our commitment and believe our sustainability initiatives can help put us in a better position, compared to resale homes and homebuilders with less-developed programs, to comply with evolving local, state and federal rules and regulations intended to protect natural resources and to address climate change and similar environmental concerns.
