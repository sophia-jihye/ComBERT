BUSINESS 

Overview 

We are a medical device company primarily focused on the design, development and commercialization of continuous glucose monitoring (&#8220;CGM&#8221;) systems for ambulatory use by people with diabetes and by healthcare providers in the hospital for the treatment of people with and without diabetes. Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms "we," "us," "our," the "company," or "DexCom" refer to DexCom, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 

Products 

Ambulatory Product Line: SEVEN &#174; &#32;PLUS, DexCom G4 &#174; , DexCom G4 &#174; &#32;PLATINUM, DexCom Share TM System and DexCom G5 &#174; &#32;Mobile 

We received approval from the Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") &#32;and commercialized our first product in 2006. In 2009 we received approval and began commercializing our third generation system, the DexCom SEVEN PLUS. We no longer market or provide support for the DexCom SEVEN PLUS system. On June 14, 2012, we received Conformit&#233; Europ&#233;enne Marking (&#8220;CE Mark&#8221;) &#32;approval for our fourth generation continuous glucose monitoring system, the DexCom G4 system, enabling commercialization of the DexCom G4 system in the European Union, Australia, New Zealand and the countries in Asia and Latin America that recognize the CE Mark . On October 5, 2012, we received approval from the FDA &#32;for the DexCom G4 PLATINUM, which is designed for up to seven days of continuous use by adults with diabetes, and we began commercializing this product in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2012. On February 14, 2013, we received CE Mark &#32;approval for a pediatric indication for our DexCom G4 system, enabling us to market and sell this system to persons two years old and older who have diabetes (hereinafter referred to as the "Pediatric Indication") , and we initiated a limited commercial launch in the second quarter of 2013. In connection with our receipt of CE Mark &#32;approval for the Pediatric Indication , we changed the name of the DexCom G4 system to the DexCom G4 PLATINUM system. On February 3, 2014, we received approval from the FDA &#32;for a Pediatric Indication &#32;for the DexCom G4 PLATINUM system in the United States. On June 3, 2014, we received approval from the FDA &#32;for an expanded indication for the DexCom G4 PLATINUM for professional use. This expanded indication allows healthcare professionals to purchase the DexCom G4 PLATINUM system for use with multiple patients. Healthcare professionals can use the insights gained from a DexCom G4 PLATINUM professional session to adjust therapy and to educate and motivate patients to modify their behavior after viewing the effects that specific foods, exercise, stress, and medications have on their glucose levels. On January 23, 2015, we received approval from the FDA for the DexCom G4 PLATINUM with Share, which is designed for up to seven days of continuous use, and we began commercializing this product in the United States in the first quarter of 2015. The DexCom G4 PLATINUM with Share remote monitoring system uses a secure wireless connection between a patient's receiver and an app on the patient's iPhone &#174; , iPod touch &#174; , or iPad &#174; &#32;mobile digital device to transmit glucose information to apps on the mobile devices of up to five designated recipients, or "followers," who can remotely monitor a patient's glucose information and receive alert notifications anywhere they have an Internet or cellular connection. Unless the context requires otherwise, the term "G4 PLATINUM" shall refer to the DexCom G4 and DexCom G4 PLATINUM systems (and all associated indications of use for such systems including without limitation, associated DexCom Share System functionalities) that are commercialized by us in and outside of the United States. 

As compared to the SEVEN PLUS, the G4 PLATINUM offers: 

&#8226; 

an improved sensor wire design that allows more scalable manufacturing, 

&#8226; 

a smaller, sleeker receiver that is capable of displaying data in color, 

&#8226; 

a new transmitter design that offers improved communication range with the receiver which allows for improved data capture, 

&#8226; 

additional user interface and algorithm enhancements that are intended to make the user experience more customizable and to make its glucose monitoring function more accurate especially in the hypoglycemic range, 

the ability to market and sell to an expanded customer population due to the approval by the FDA &#32;of, and our obtaining a CE Mark &#32;for, a Pediatric Indication . 

&#8226; 

DexCom Share remote monitoring capabilities. 

DexCom SHARE TM &#160; 

On October 17, 2014, we received approval from the FDA &#32;for the DexCom SHARE remote monitoring system. DexCom SHARE enables users of our G4 PLATINUM System to have their sensor glucose information remotely monitored by their family or friends. To use DexCom SHARE, the G4 PLATINUM user docks their G4 PLATINUM Receiver in the DexCom SHARE Cradle and their sensor glucose information is wirelessly transmitted to, and viewed by, such patient&#8217;s friends or family through the DexCom SHARE mobile application. DexCom SHARE provides secondary notifications to individuals designated by a G4 PLATINUM System user and does not replace real time continuous glucose monitoring or standard home blood glucose monitoring. 

On January 23, 2015, the FDA &#32;approved a version of the G4 PLATINUM Receiver that includes the DexCom Share System. The G4 PLATINUM Receiver with Share remote monitoring system uses a secure wireless connection via Bluetooth Low Energy between a patient's receiver and a mobile application on the patient's iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad mobile digital device to transmit glucose information to mobile applications on the mobile devices of up to five designated recipients, or "followers," without the need to use the DexCom SHARE Cradle component. The mobile applications that comprise the DexCom Share System were classified by the FDA as Class II, exempt, due to the fact that these mobile applications were secondary displays of the associated G4 PLATINUM Receiver. With the mobile applications classified as Class II, exempt, DexCom must comply with certain general and special controls required by the FDA but does not need prior FDA approval to commercialize changes to the DexCom Share System. We began commercialization of the G4 PLATINUM with Share in the first quarter of 2015 and discontinued the DexCom SHARE Cradle. Effective April 24, 2015, our DexCom Share System also supports the Apple Watch TM , allowing the Apple Watch to utilize DexCom Share System functionality. Effective June 2, 2015, the mobile application for the Share System followers became available for Android devices. 

DexCom G5 Mobile 

On August 19, 2015, we received approval from the FDA &#32;for the DexCom G5 Mobile Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (the "G5 Mobile"). The G5 Mobile is designed to allow our transmitter to run the algorithm that has historically operated on the receiver, and to communicate directly to a patient's iPhone, iPod touch, or iPad mobile digital device to utilize DexCom Share System functionality. The G5 Mobile transmitter has a labeled useful life of three months. 

We previously received CE Mark approval for, and in September, 2015, we launched the G5 Mobile in certain countries in Europe. In the countries and regions outside of the United States that recognize the CE Mark, the G5 Mobile does not require confirmatory finger sticks when making treatment decisions, although a minimum of two finger sticks a day remain necessary for calibration of the G5 Mobile. 

Data from the G5 Mobile can be integrated with DexCom CLARITY TM , our next generation cloud-based reporting software, for personalized, easy-to-understand analysis of trends that may improve diabetes management. 

Except with respect to the foregoing, the G5 Mobile is equivalent to the G4 PLATINUM System in technical and regulatory respects. 

In-Hospital Product Line: GlucoClear &#174; &#160; 

To address the in-hospital critical care patient population, on November 10, 2008 we entered into a &#8220;Manufacturing and Supply Agreement,&#8221; a &#8220;Quality Agreement,&#8221; and a &#8220;Collaboration Agreement,&#8221; with Edwards Lifesciences LLC (&#8220;Edwards&#8221;) &#32;to develop jointly and market a specific glucose monitoring product platform for the in-hospital critical care market. On October 30, 2009, the first generation blood-based in-vivo automated glucose monitoring system, which was branded the GlucoClear, received CE Mark &#32;approval for use by healthcare providers in the hospital. In January 2013, Edwards &#32;received CE Mark &#32;approval for the second generation system. In 2014, Edwards &#32;announced that it was likely to cease the commercialization of the GlucoClear system. On September 3, 2015, we and Edwards &#32;entered into a Restatement of License, Termination of Collaboration &#38; Release Agreement (the &#8220;Restated Agreement&#8221;), terminating each of the &#8220;Manufacturing and Supply Agreement&#8221; and &#8220;Quality Agreement,&#8221; and amending in part the &#8220;Collaboration Agreement.&#8221; Pursuant to the Restated Agreement, DexCom and Edwards agreed to a mutual release of claims, including any activities related to further development obligations or milestone payments. In addition, the Restated Agreement provides Edwards with a fully paid-up, royalty-free license to use certain of DexCom&#8217;s intellectual property solely in the field of blood-based glucose monitoring within the hospital environment. Under the Restated Agreement, DexCom reserves the right to market and sell its interstitial continuous glucose monitoring technology in all settings, including within the hospital market. No payments are required by either party in connection with the Restated Agreement. 

SweetSpot 

Through our acquisition of SweetSpot in 2012, we have a software platform that enables our customers to aggregate and analyze data from certain diabetes devices and to share it with their healthcare providers. In November 2011, SweetSpot received 510(k) clearance from the FDA &#32;to market to clinics its initial cloud-based data management service, which helps healthcare providers and patients see, understand and use blood glucose meter data to diagnose and manage diabetes. SweetSpot has also developed a data transfer service that is registered with the FDA &#32;as a Medical Device Data System . This data transfer service allows researchers to control the transfer of data from certain diabetes devices to research tools and databases according to their own research workflows. SweetSpot&#8217;s software provides an advanced cloud-based platform for uploading, processing and delivering health data and transforms raw output from certain medical devices into useful information for healthcare providers, individuals and researchers. 

Sensor Augmented Insulin Pumps 

We are leveraging our technology platform to enhance the capabilities of our current products and to develop additional continuous glucose monitoring products. In 2008 and 2015, we entered into development agreements with Animas Corporation (&#8220;Animas&#8221;) , a subsidiary of Johnson &#38; Johnson, and in 2012 and 2015 we entered into development agreements with Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. (&#8220;Tandem&#8221;) . The purpose of each of these development relationships is to integrate our technology into the insulin pump product offerings of the respective partner, enabling the partner's insulin pump to receive glucose readings from our transmitter and display this information on the pump's screen. The Animas &#32;insulin pump product augmented with our sensor technology has been branded the Vibe&#174;, and received CE Mark &#32;approval in May 2011, which allows Animas &#32;to market the Vibe in the countries that recognize CE Mark &#32;approvals. In December 2014, Animas &#32;received FDA &#32;approval for the VIBE system in the United States and began commercializing this product in 2015. In July 2014, Tandem &#32;filed their submission for FDA &#32;approval of their CGM-enabled insulin pump in the United States. In September 2015 Tandem &#32;announced it had received FDA &#32;approval of its t:slim G4&#8482; Insulin Pump, a touch-screen pump that is integrated with our G4 PLATINUM system and is indicated for use by people 12 years of age or older who use insulin. Tandem began commercializing this product in September 2015. 

Future Products 

We plan to develop future generations of technologies focused on improved performance and convenience and that will enable intelligent insulin administration. Over the longer term, we plan to develop networked platforms with open architecture, connectivity and transmitters capable of communicating with other devices and software systems. Our product development timelines are highly dependent on our ability to achieve clinical endpoints and regulatory and legal requirements and to overcome technology challenges, and our product development timelines may be delayed due to extended regulatory approval timelines, scheduling issues with patients and investigators, requests from institutional review boards, sensor performance and manufacturing supply constraints, among other factors. In addition, support of these clinical trials requires significant resources from employees involved in the production of our products, including research and development, manufacturing, quality assurance, and clinical and regulatory personnel. Even if our development and clinical trial efforts are successful, the FDA &#32;may not approve our products, and even if approved, we may not achieve acceptance in the marketplace by physicians and people with diabetes. 

On August 10, 2015, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement (the &#8220;Verily Collaboration Agreement&#8221;) with Google Life Sciences LLC, now named Verily Life Sciences (&#8220;Verily&#8221;). Pursuant to the Verily Collaboration Agreement, we and Verily have agreed to jointly develop a series of next-generation continuous glucose monitoring products. The Verily Collaboration Agreement provides us with an exclusive license to use certain intellectual property of Verily related to the development, manufacture and commercialization of the products contemplated under the Verily Collaboration Agreement. The Verily Collaboration Agreement provides for the establishment of a joint steering committee, joint development committee and joint commercialization committee to oversee and coordinate the parties&#8217; activities under the collaboration. We and Verily have agreed to make committee decisions by consensus. 

Background 

From inception to 2006, we devoted substantially all of our resources to start-up activities, raising capital and research and development, including product design, testing, manufacturing and clinical trials. Since 2006, we have devoted considerable resources to the commercialization of our ambulatory continuous glucose monitoring systems, including the G4 PLATINUM and G5 Mobile, as well as the continued research and clinical development of our technology platform. 

The International Diabetes Federation (&#8220;IDF&#8221;) &#32;estimates that in 2015, 415 million people around the world had diabetes, and the Centers for Disease Control (&#8220;CDC&#8221;) &#32;estimates that in 2012, diabetes affected 29.1 million people in the United States, of which 8.1 million were undiagnosed. IDF &#32;estimates that by 2040, the worldwide incidence of people suffering from diabetes will reach 642 million. According to the CDC 's National Vital Statistics Reports for 2010, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death by disease in the United States. According to the Congressional Diabetes Caucus, diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, adult-onset blindness, lower-limb amputations, and significant cause of heart disease and stroke, high blood pressure and nerve damage. According to the IDF , there were an estimated 5 million deaths attributable to diabetes globally in 2015 between the ages of 20 and 79 years. The American Diabetes Association (&#8220;ADA&#8221;) &#32;Fast Facts, revised in July 2014, states that diabetes is the primary cause of death for more than 69,000 Americans each year, and contributes to the death of more than 234,000 Americans annually. According to an article published in The New England Journal of Medicine &#32;in November 2014, excess mortality for people with diabetes with ages of less than 30 years is largely explained by acute complications of diabetes. 

According to the CDC &#32;2011 National Diabetes Fact Sheet, in the United States, another individual is diagnosed with diabetes every 17 seconds. As reported by the Congressional Diabetes Caucus website, 1.9 million people will be diagnosed with diabetes this year, approximately 5,082 people per day. In 2012 alone there were about 1.7 million people 20 years or older diagnosed. In addition to those newly diagnosed, the Congressional Diabetes Caucus website reports that every 24 hours there are: 238 amputations in people with diabetes, 120 people who enter end-stage kidney disease programs, and 48 people who go blind. 

According to the ADA , one in every five healthcare dollars was spent on treating diabetes in 2012, and the direct medical costs and indirect expenditures attributable to diabetes in the United States were an estimated $245 billion, an increase of $71 billion, or approximately 41%, since 2007. Of the $245 billion in overall expenses, the ADA &#32;estimated that approximately $176 billion were direct costs associated with diabetes care, chronic complications and excess general medical costs, and $69 billion were indirect medical costs. The ADA &#32;also found that average medical expenditures among people with diagnosed diabetes were 2.3 times higher than for people without diabetes in 2012. According to the IDF , expenditures attributable to diabetes were an estimated $673 to $1,197 billion globally in 2015. The IDF &#32;estimates that expenditures attributable to diabetes will grow to a range of $802 to $1,452 billion globally by 2040. 

We believe continuous glucose monitoring has the potential to enable more people with diabetes to achieve and sustain tight glycemic control. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial &#32;demonstrated that improving blood glucose control lowers the risk of developing diabetes-related complications by up to 50%. The study also demonstrated that people with Type 1 diabetes achieved sustained benefits with intensive management. Yet, according to an article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association &#32;in 2004, less than 50% of diabetes patients were meeting ADA &#32;standards for glucose control (A1c), and only 37% of people with diabetes were achieving their glycemic targets. According to an article published in The New England Journal of Medicine &#32;in November 2014, in two national registries, only 13% to 15% of people with diabetes met treatment guidelines for good glycemic control, and more than 20% had very poor glycemic control. The CDC &#32;estimated that as of 2006, 63.4% of all adults with diabetes were monitoring their blood glucose levels on a daily basis, and that 86.7% of insulin-requiring patients with diabetes monitored daily. 

Various clinical studies also demonstrate the benefits of continuous glucose monitoring and that continuous glucose monitoring is equally effective in patients who administer insulin through multiple daily injections or through use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pumps. Results of a Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (&#8220;JDRF&#8221;) &#32;study published in the New England Journal of Medicine &#32;in 2008, and the extension phase of the study, published in Diabetes Care &#32;in 2009, demonstrated that continuous glucose monitoring improved A1c levels and reduced incidence of hypoglycemia for patients over the age of 25 and for all patients of all ages who utilized continuous glucose monitoring regularly. 

Our initial target market in the United States consists of the estimated 30% of people with Type 1 diabetes who utilize insulin pump therapy and the estimated 50% of people with Type 1 diabetes who utilize multiple daily insulin injections. Our broader target market in the United States consists of our initial target market plus an estimated 20% of people with Type 1 diabetes using conventional insulin therapy and the estimated 27% of people with Type 2 diabetes who require insulin. Although our initial focus was within the United States, we have expanded our operations to include Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and portions of Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Latin America and Africa. 

Commercial Operations 

We have built a direct sales organization in the United States to call on endocrinologists, physicians and diabetes educators who can educate and influence patient adoption of continuous glucose monitoring. The approval by the FDA &#32;of a Pediatric Indication &#32;for our G4 PLATINUM system in February 2014 and the approval of a Pediatric Indication associated with our G5 Mobile System in August 2015, allows our sales organization to call on pediatric endocrinologists and pediatricians who can educate and influence adoption of continuous glucose monitoring by parents who have children aged two years or older with diabetes. We believe that focusing efforts on these participants is important given the instrumental role they each play in the decision-making process for diabetes therapy. To complement our direct sales efforts, we have entered into United States and international distribution arrangements that allow distributors to sell our products. We believe our direct, highly specialized and focused sales organization and our domestic and international distribution agreements are sufficient for us to support our sales efforts for at least the next twelve months. 

Product revenues are generated from the sale of durable continuous glucose monitoring systems (receivers and transmitters) and disposable sensors through a direct sales force in the United States as well as through distribution arrangements in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and in portions of Europe, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. The sensor is inserted by the user and is intended to be used continuously for up to seven days, after which it may be replaced with a new disposable sensor. Our transmitter is reusable until it reaches the end of its battery life. Our receiver is reusable. As we establish an installed base of customers using our products, we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenues through recurring sales of our disposable sensors. 

Market Opportunity 

Diabetes 

Diabetes is a chronic, life-threatening disease for which there is no known cure. The disease is caused by the body&#8217;s inability to produce or effectively utilize the hormone insulin. This inability prevents the body from adequately regulating blood glucose levels. Glucose, the primary source of energy for cells, must be maintained at certain concentrations in the blood in order to permit optimal cell function and health. Normally, the pancreas provides control of blood glucose levels by secreting the hormone insulin to decrease blood glucose levels when concentrations are too high. In people with diabetes, the body does not produce sufficient levels of insulin, or fails to utilize insulin effectively, causing blood glucose levels to rise above normal. This condition is called hyperglycemia and often results in chronic long-term complications such as heart disease, limb amputations, loss of kidney function and blindness. When blood glucose levels are high, people with diabetes often administer insulin in an effort to decrease blood glucose levels. Unfortunately, insulin administration can drive blood glucose levels below the normal range, resulting in hypoglycemia. In cases of severe hypoglycemia, people with diabetes risk acute complications, such as loss of consciousness or death. Due to the drastic nature of acute complications associated with hypoglycemia, many people with diabetes are reluctant to reduce blood glucose levels. Consequently, these individuals often remain in a hyperglycemic state, increasing their odds of developing long-term chronic complications. 

Diabetes is typically classified into two major groups: Type 1 and Type 2. According to the ADA &#32;and JDRF , respectively, as of 2012 there were an estimated 1.3 million people with Type 1 diabetes in the United States. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder that usually develops during childhood and is characterized by an absence of insulin, resulting from destruction of the insulin producing cells of the pancreas. Individuals with Type 1 diabetes must rely on frequent insulin injections in order to regulate and maintain blood glucose levels. According to the ADA, in 2012 there were approximately 29.1 million people with diabetes in the United States, of which approximately 27.8 million people have Type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder which results when the body is unable to produce sufficient amounts of insulin or becomes insulin resistant. Depending on the severity of Type 2 diabetes, individuals may require diet and nutrition management, exercise, oral medications or insulin injections to regulate blood glucose levels. We estimate that approximately 4.7 million Type 2 patients must use insulin to manage their diabetes. 

There are various subgroups of people with diabetes, including in-hospital patients, who present significant management challenges. According to the ADA , diabetes related hospitalizations totaled 43.1 million days in 2012, an increase of 18.8 million days from 2007. Additionally, studies show that many hospital patients without diabetes suffer episodes of hyperglycemia. According to a Diabetes Care &#32;article, as of 1998, as many as 1.5 million hospitalized patients had significant hyperglycemia without a history of diabetes. A November 2001 article in the New England Journal of Medicine &#32;summarized a study of over 1,500 hospitalized patients, of which only 13% had diabetes, which concluded that intensive insulin therapy to maintain blood glucose levels within a target range reduced mortality among critically ill patients in the surgical intensive care unit and improved patient outcomes. According to the CDC, as of 2009 there were 5.5 million hospital discharges with diabetes as a listed diagnosis and 688,000 hospital discharges with diabetes listed as the primary diagnosis. More than 40% of all health care expenditures attributed to diabetes come from higher rates of hospital admission and longer average lengths of stay per admission, constituting the single largest contributor to the medical cost of diabetes. Of the projected $475 billion in national expenditures for hospital inpatient care, approximately $124 billion is incurred by people who have diabetes, of which $76 billion is directly attributed to their diabetes. 

According to JDRF , 40,000 people are diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes each year in the United States and between the years 2001-2009 there was a 21% increase in the prevalence of Type 1 diabetes in people under the age of 20. In addition, according to the National Diabetes Statistics Report in 2009 there were an estimated 18,436 people younger than the age of 20 years old diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in the United States. Type 2 diabetes is occurring with increasing frequency in young people, with the increase in prevalence related to an increase in obesity amongst children. According to the CDC , as of 2012, approximately 17% of children and adolescents aged 2-19 years, or 12.7 million children, in the United States were obese. Childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the past 30 years. 

Importance of Glucose Monitoring 

Blood glucose levels can be affected by many factors, including the carbohydrate and fat content of meals, exercise, stress, illness or impending illness, hormonal releases, variability in insulin absorption and changes in the effects of insulin in the body. Given the many factors that affect blood glucose levels, maintaining glucose within a normal range is difficult, resulting in frequent and unpredictable excursions above or below normal blood glucose levels. People with diabetes manage their blood glucose levels by administering insulin or ingesting carbohydrates throughout the day in order to maintain blood glucose within normal ranges. People with diabetes frequently overcorrect and fluctuate between hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic states, often multiple times during the same day. As a result, many people with diabetes are routinely outside the normal blood glucose range. People with diabetes are often unaware that their glucose levels are either too high or too low, and their inability to completely control blood glucose levels and the associated serious complications can be frustrating and, at times, overwhelming. 

In an attempt to maintain blood glucose levels within the normal range, people with diabetes must first measure their blood glucose levels. Often after measuring their blood glucose levels, people with diabetes make therapeutic adjustments. As adjustments are made, additional blood glucose measurements may be necessary to gauge the individual&#8217;s response to the adjustments. More frequent testing of blood glucose levels provides people with diabetes with information that can be used to better understand and manage their diabetes. The ADA &#32;recommends that most people with Type 1 diabetes test their blood glucose levels at least three or more times per day, and that significantly more frequent testing may be required to reach A1c targets safely without hypoglycemia. 

Clinical outcomes data support the notion that an important component of effective diabetes management is frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels. The landmark 1993 DCCT &#32;consisting of patients with Type 1 diabetes, and the 1998 UK Prospective Diabetes Study, consisting of patients with Type 2 diabetes, demonstrated that people with diabetes who intensely managed blood glucose levels delayed the onset and slowed the progression of diabetes-related complications. In the DCCT , a major component of intensive management was monitoring blood glucose levels at least four times per day using conventional single-point blood glucose meters. The DCCT &#32;demonstrated that intensive management reduced the risk of complications by 76% for eye disease, 60% for nerve disease and 50% for kidney disease. However, the DCCT &#32;also found that intensive management led to a three-fold increase in the frequency of hypoglycemic events. In the December 2005 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine , the authors of a peer-reviewed study concluded that intensive diabetes therapy has long-term beneficial effects on the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with Type 1 diabetes. The study showed that intensive diabetes therapy reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease by 42% and the risk of non-fatal heart attack, stroke or death from cardiovascular disease by 57%. 

Limitations of Existing Glucose Monitoring Products 

Single-point finger stick devices are the most prevalent devices for glucose monitoring. These devices require taking a blood sample with a finger stick, placing a drop of blood on a test strip and inserting the strip into a glucose meter that yields a single point in time blood glucose measurement. We believe that these devices suffer from several limitations, including: 

&#8226; 

Limited Information. &#32;Even if people with diabetes test several times each day, each measurement represents a single blood glucose value at a single point in time. Given the many factors that can affect blood glucose levels, excursions above and below the normal range often occur between these discrete measurement points in time. Because people with diabetes only have single-point data, they do not gain sufficient information to indicate the direction or rate of change in their blood glucose levels. Without the ability to determine whether their blood glucose level is rising, falling or holding constant, and the rate at which their blood glucose level is changing, the individual&#8217;s ability to effectively manage and maintain blood glucose levels within normal ranges is severely limited. Further, people with diabetes cannot test themselves during sleep, when the risk of hypoglycemia is significantly increased. In addition, existing technology generally limits individuals&#8217; ability to store their glucose data in servers or systems independent of the blood glucose meter. 

The following graph shows the limited information provided by four single-point measurements during a single day using a traditional single-point finger stick device, compared to the data provided by our continuous sensor. The data presented in the graph is from a clinical trial we completed in 2003 with a continuous glucose monitoring system, where the patient was blinded to the continuous glucose data. The continuous data indicates that, even with four finger sticks in one day, the patient&#8217;s blood glucose levels were above the target range of 80-140 milligrams per deciliter (&#8220;mg/dl&#8221;) for a period of 13.5 hours. 

Single Day Continuous Data 

&#8226; 

Inconvenience. &#32;The process of measuring blood glucose levels with single-point finger stick devices can cause significant disruption in the daily activities of people with diabetes and their families. People with diabetes using single-point finger stick devices must stop whatever they are doing several times per day, self-inflict a painful prick and draw blood to measure blood glucose levels. To do so, people with diabetes must always carry a fully supplied kit that may include a spring-loaded needle, or lancet, disposable test strips, cleansing wipes, and the meter, and then safely dispose of the used supplies. This process is inconvenient and may cause uneasiness in social situations. 

&#8226; 

Difficulty of Use. &#32;To obtain a sample with single-point finger stick devices, people with diabetes generally prick one of their fingertips or, occasionally, a forearm with a lancet. They then squeeze the area to produce the blood sample and another prick may be required if a sufficient volume of blood is not obtained the first time. The blood sample is then placed on a disposable test strip that is inserted into a blood glucose meter. This task can be difficult for individuals with decreased tactile sensation and visual acuity, which are common complications of diabetes. 

&#8226; 

Pain. &#32;Although the fingertips are rich in blood flow and provide a good site to obtain a blood sample, they are also densely populated with highly sensitive nerve endings. This makes the lancing and subsequent manipulation of the finger to draw blood painful. The pain and discomfort are compounded by the fact that fingers offer limited surface area, so tests are often performed on areas that are sore from prior tests. People with diabetes may also suffer pain when the finger prick site is disturbed during regular activities. 

We believe a market opportunity exists for a glucose monitoring system that provides continuous glucose information, including trends, and that is convenient and easy to use. Several companies have attempted to address the limitations of single-point finger stick devices by developing continuous glucose monitoring systems. 

The DexCom Solution 

Our G4 PLATINUM and G5 Mobile systems offer the following advantages to people with diabetes: 

&#8226; 

Improved Outcomes. &#32;Data published in a peer-reviewed article based on our approval support trial for our first system demonstrated that patients using the system showed statistically significant improvements in maintaining their glucose levels within the target range when compared to patients relying solely on single-point finger stick measurements. Additional peer-review published data has demonstrated that patients with access to seven days of continuous glucose data statistically improved glucose control by further increasing their time spent with glucose levels in the target range, thereby reducing time spent in both hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic ranges. Peer-review published data from our repeated use trial demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in hemoglobin A1c levels, a measure of the average amount of glucose in the blood over the prior three months, in patients using our system compared to patients relying solely on single-point finger stick measurements. Finally, results of a major multicenter clinical trial funded by the JDRF &#32;demonstrated that patients with Type 1 diabetes who used continuous glucose monitoring devices to help manage their disease experienced significant improvements in glucose control. 

&#8226; 

Access to Real-Time Values, Trend Information and Alerts. &#32;At the push of a button, people with diabetes can view their current glucose value, along with a graphical display of one-, three-, six-, twelve- or twenty-four-hour trend information on our receiver. Without continuous monitoring, the individual is often unaware if his or her glucose is rising, declining or remaining constant. Access to continuous real-time glucose measurements provides people with diabetes information that may aid in attaining better glucose control. Additionally, our G4 PLATINUM and G5 Mobile systems alert people with diabetes when their glucose levels approach inappropriately high or low levels so that they may intervene. 

&#8226; 

Intuitive User Interface. &#32;We have developed a user interface that we believe is intuitive and easy to use. The G4 PLATINUM and G5 Mobile receiver&#8217;s compact designs includes user-friendly buttons, an easy-to-read color display, simple navigation tools, audible alerts and graphical display of trend information. 

&#8226; 

Convenience and Comfort. &#32;Our G4 PLATINUM and G5 Mobile systems provide people with diabetes with the benefits of continuous monitoring, without having to perform finger stick tests for every measurement. Additionally, the disposable sensor electrode that is inserted under the skin is a very thin wire, minimizing potential discomfort associated with inserting or wearing the disposable sensor. The external portion of the sensor, including the transmitter, is small, has a low profile and is designed to be easily worn under clothing. The wireless receiver is the size of a small digital music player and can be carried discreetly in a pocket or purse. We believe that convenience is an important factor in achieving widespread adoption of a continuous glucose monitoring system. 

&#8226; 

Connectivity to Others. Our Share remote monitoring systems enable users of our G4 PLATINUM and G5 Mobile systems to have their sensor glucose information remotely monitored by their family or friends by wirelessly transmitting data through an app on the patient&#8217;s smart phone. Up to five designated recipients, or &#8220;followers,&#8221; can remotely monitor a patient&#8217;s glucose information and receive secondary alert notifications from almost anywhere via each follower's smart phone. 

While we believe the G4 PLATINUM and G5 Mobile systems offer these advantages, people with diabetes may not perceive the benefits of continuous glucose monitoring and may be unwilling to change their current treatment regimens. Furthermore, we do not expect that our G4 PLATINUM or G5 Mobile systems will appeal to all types of people with diabetes. The G4 PLATINUM and G5 Mobile systems prompts a person with diabetes to insert a disposable sensor electrode under their skin at least every seven days, although we are aware of reports from the field that some individuals have been able to use sensors for periods longer than seven days. People with diabetes could find this process to be uncomfortable or inconvenient, and may be unwilling to insert a disposable sensor in their body, especially if their current diabetes management involves no more than two finger sticks per day. Additionally, the G4 PLATINUM and G5 Mobile systems (and our predecessor products) are not approved as a replacement device for single-point finger stick devices in the United States, must be calibrated initially using measurements from two single-point finger stick tests, and thereafter at least every 12 hours using single-point finger stick tests, and may be more costly to use. 

Our Strategy 

Our objective is to become the leading provider of continuous glucose monitoring systems and related products to enable people with diabetes to more effectively and conveniently manage their disease. We also developed and commercialized with Animas &#32;and Tandem &#32;products that integrate our continuous glucose monitoring technologies into the insulin pump delivery systems of the respective partners. In addition, we continue to pursue other development partnerships with additional insulin pump companies and other insulin delivery systems. To achieve these objectives, we are pursuing the following business strategies: 

&#8226; 

Establish our technology platform as the leading approach to continuous glucose monitoring and leverage our development expertise to rapidly bring products to market. &#32;We have developed proprietary core technology and expertise that provides a broad platform for the development of innovative products for continuous glucose monitoring. In addition to our early products, in October 2012, we received approval from the FDA &#32;for our fourth generation system, the DexCom G4 PLATINUM, and we began commercializing this product in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2012. In January 2015, we received approval from the FDA for the DexCom G4 PLATINUM with Share, and we began commercializing this product in the United States in the first quarter of 2015. In August 2015, we received approval from the FDA &#32;for the G5 Mobile, and we began commercializing this product in the United States and in certain countries in Europe in the third quarter of 2015. We plan to continue to invest in the development of our technology platform and to obtain additional FDA &#32;approvals for our continuous glucose monitoring systems for both the ambulatory and in-hospital markets as well as for insulin pump delivery systems and closed loop artificial insulin deliver systems that are integrated with our sensors. We expect to continue to provide performance improvements, expanded indications and introduce new products to establish and maintain a leadership position in the market. In the future, we may develop our technology to support applications beyond glucose sensing. 

&#8226; 

Drive the adoption of our ambulatory products through a direct sales and marketing effort. &#32;We have a small direct field sales force to call on endocrinologists, physicians and diabetes educators who can educate and influence patient adoption of continuous glucose monitoring. In addition, the FDA &#8217;s approval of a Pediatric Indication &#32;for the G4 PLATINUM and G5 Mobile systems allow our direct field sales force to call on pediatric endocrinologists and pediatricians who can educate and influence parents to adopt continuous glucose monitoring for their children aged two years or older with diabetes. We believe that focusing efforts on these participants is important given the instrumental role they each play in the decision-making process for diabetes therapy. To complement our sales efforts, we have entered into distribution arrangements that allow distributors to sell our G4 PLATINUM and G5 Mobile systems. We currently sell our G4 PLATINUM and G5 Mobile systems only in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and in portions of Europe, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, but plan to expand our sales elsewhere in the future. 

&#8226; 

Drive additional adoption through technology integration partnerships. &#32;We have development agreements with Animas and Tandem &#32;that have and will develop products that integrate our ambulatory product technology into their pumps, enabling the partner&#8217;s insulin pump to receive glucose readings from our transmitter and display this information on the pump&#8217;s screen. We believe people with diabetes who have adopted continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion are individuals who more aggressively manage their diabetes and may be more inclined to utilize our continuous glucose monitoring systems. 

&#8226; 

Seek broad coverage policies and reimbursement for our products. &#32;Our approved products are not reimbursed by virtue of a national coverage decision by Medicare. As of February 23, 2016 , the seven largest private third-party payors, in terms of the number of covered lives, have issued coverage policies for the category of continuous glucose monitoring devices. Many of these coverage policies, however, are restrictive in nature and require the policy holder to comply with extensive documentation and other requirements to demonstrate medical necessity under the policy. We have negotiated contracted rates with all seven of those third-party payors for the purchase of our products by their members. We currently employ in-house reimbursement expertise to assist people with diabetes in obtaining reimbursement from private third-party healthcare payors. We also maintain a field-based reimbursement team charged with calling on third-party private payors to obtain coverage decisions and both durable medical equipment contracts and pharmacy benefit contracts. 

&#8226; 

Drive increased utilization and adoption of our products through a cloud-based data repository platform. &#32;We are developing a software platform that enables people with diabetes to aggregate and analyze data from numerous diabetes devices and share the data with their healthcare providers. We believe that by producing reports detailing metrics such as the individual&#8217;s glycemic variability that may be shared with physicians and caregivers will lead to better health outcomes, and we expect that as more people with diabetes adopt our system, that utilization of our sensors will increase. The initial step to this platform was the launch, in September 2015, of CLARITY TM , our cloud-based reporting software for personalized, easy-to-understand analysis of trends that may improve diabetes management for users of our G5 Mobile systems. 

&#8226; 

Expand the use of our products to other patient care settings and patient demographics. &#32;The FDA &#32;has approved Pediatric Indications for the G4 PLATINUM and G5 Mobile systems, enabling us to market and sell that system in the United States to persons two years old and older who have diabetes. We believe our sensor technology may also be beneficial to women who develop gestational diabetes during their pregnancy and we intend to seek approval for a pregnancy indication in the future. We believe there is an unmet medical need for continuous glucose monitoring in the hospital setting. According to the ADA , diabetes related hospitalizations totaled 43.1 million days in 2012, an increase of 18.8 million days from 2007. In addition, studies show that many hospital patients without diabetes suffer episodes of hyperglycemia. As of 1998, as many as 1.5 million hospitalized patients in the United States had significant hyperglycemia without a history of diabetes. A study of over 1,500 hospitalized patients, of which only 13% had a history of diabetes, concluded that intensive insulin therapy to maintain blood glucose levels reduced mortality among critically ill patients in the surgical intensive care unit and improved patient outcomes. To address this patient population, we entered into an exclusive agreement with Edwards &#32;to develop jointly and market a specific product platform for the in-hospital critical care glucose monitoring market. This collaboration was substantially modified in 2015, as discussed later in this report. 

&#8226; 

Provide a high level of customer support, service and education. &#32;We support our sales and marketing efforts with a customer service program that includes customer training and support. We provide direct technical support by telephone 24 hours a day in the United States and Canada to customers, endocrinologists, physicians and diabetes educators to promote safe and successful use of our products. 

&#8226; 

Pursue the highest safety and quality levels for our products. &#32;We have established an organization that is highly focused on product quality and customer safety. We have developed in-house engineering, quality assurance, clinical and regulatory expertise, and data analysis capabilities. Additionally, we seek to continue to establish credible and open relationships with regulatory bodies, physician opinion leaders and scientific experts. These capabilities and relationships will assist us in designing products that we believe will meet or exceed expectations for reliable, safe performance. 

Our Technology Platform 

The development of a continuous glucose monitor requires successful coordination and execution of a wide variety of technology disciplines, including biomaterials, membrane systems, electrochemistry, low power microelectronics, telemetry, software, algorithms, implant tools and sealed protective housings. We have developed in-house expertise in each of these disciplines. We believe we have a broad technology platform that will support the development of multiple products for glucose monitoring. 

Sensor Technology 

The key enabling technologies for our sensors include biomaterials, membrane systems, electrochemistry and low power microelectronics. Our membrane technology consists of multiple polymer layers configured to selectively allow the appropriate mix of glucose and oxygen to travel through the membrane and react with a glucose specific enzyme to create an extremely low level electrical signal, measured in pico-amperes. This electrical signal is then translated into glucose values. We believe that the capability to measure very low levels of an electrical signal and to accurately translate those measurements into glucose values is also a unique and distinguishing feature of our technology. We have also developed technology to allow sensitive electronics to be packaged in a small, fully contained, lightweight sealed unit that minimizes inconvenience and discomfort for the user. 

Receiver and Transmitter Technology 

Our ambulatory glucose monitoring systems use radiofrequency telemetry to wirelessly transmit information from the transmitter, which sits in a pod atop the sensor, to our receiver. We have developed the technology for reliable transmission and reception and have consistently demonstrated a high rate of successful transmissions from sensor to receiver in our clinical trials. Our receiver then processes and displays real-time and trended glucose values, and provides alerts. We have used our extensive database of continuous glucose data from our clinical trials to create software and algorithms for the display of data to customers. 

Other Technology Applications 

Additionally, we have gained our technology expertise by learning to design implants that can withstand the rigors of functioning within the human body for extended periods of time. In addition to the foreign body response, we have overcome other problems related to operating within the human body, such as device sealing, miniaturization, durability and sensor geometry. We believe that, over time, the expertise gained in overcoming these problems may support the development of additional products beyond glucose monitoring. 

Products in Development 

We are leveraging our technology platform to enhance the capabilities of our current products (including obtaining expanded indications of use) and to develop additional continuous glucose monitoring products. We plan to develop future generations of technologies focused on improved performance and convenience and that will enable intelligent insulin administration. Over the longer term, we plan to develop networked platforms with open architecture, connectivity and transmitters capable of communicating with other devices. We intend to seek a pregnancy indication for women who develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy in the future. 

In 2012 and 2015, we entered into development agreements with Tandem . The purpose of this relationship is to integrate our technology into the insulin pump product offerings of Tandem , enabling their insulin pumps to receive glucose readings from our transmitter and display this information on the pump&#8217;s screen. 

Continuous Glucose Monitoring Disposable Sensor &#38; Reusable Transmitter 

Our sensor includes a tiny wire-like electrode coated with our sensing membrane system. This disposable sensor comes packaged with an integrated insertion device and is contained in a small plastic housing platform, or pod. The base of the pod has adhesive that attaches it to the skin. The sensor is intended to be easily and reliably inserted by the user by exposing the adhesive, placing the pod against the surface of the skin of the abdomen and pushing down on the insertion device. The insertion device first extends a narrow gauge needle containing the sensor into the subcutaneous tissue and then retracts the needle, leaving behind the sensor in the tissue and the pod adhered to the skin. The user then disposes of the insertion device and snaps the reusable transmitter to the pod. After a stabilization period of a few hours, the user is required to calibrate the receiver with two measurements from a single-point finger stick device and the disposable sensor begins wirelessly transmitting the continuous glucose data at specific intervals to the handheld receiver. Users are prompted by the receiver to calibrate the system twice per day with finger stick measurements throughout the seven day usage period to ensure reliable operation, which calibration may be accomplished by using any FDA &#32;approved blood glucose meter. Currently, the G4 PLATINUM and G5 Mobile systems are indicated for use as adjunctive devices to complement, not replace, information obtained from standard home blood glucose monitoring devices, although in the future we may seek replacement claim labeling from the FDA &#32;for the use of future generation sensors as the sole basis for making therapeutic adjustments. 

The disposable sensor contained in the G4 PLATINUM and G5 Mobile systems are intended to function for up to seven days after which it may be replaced. After seven days, the user simply removes the pod and attached sensor from the skin and discards them while retaining the reusable transmitter. A new sensor and pod can then be inserted and used with the same receiver and transmitter for a subsequent seven day period. We are aware of reports from the field, however, that customers have been able to use sensors for periods longer than seven days. 

Handheld Receiver 

Our small handheld receiver is carried by the user and wirelessly receives continuous glucose values from the sensor. Proprietary algorithms and software, developed from our extensive database of continuous glucose data from clinical trials, are programmed into the receiver to process the glucose data from the sensor and display it on a user-friendly graphical user interface. With a push of a button, the user can access their current glucose value and one-, three-, six-, twelve- and twenty-four-hour trended data. Additionally, when glucose values are inappropriately high or low, the receiver provides an audible alert or vibrates. The receiver is a self-contained, durable unit with a rechargeable battery. 

Sales and Marketing 

We have built a direct sales organization to call on endocrinologists, physicians and diabetes educators who can educate and influence patient adoption of continuous glucose monitoring. We believe that focusing efforts on these participants is important given the instrumental role they each play in the decision-making process for diabetes therapy. We employ approximately 107 &#32;direct sales personnel and continue to add to our sales and marketing organization as necessary to support the commercialization of our products. We believe that referrals by physicians and diabetes educators, together with self-referrals by customers, have driven and will continue to drive adoption of our G4 PLATINUM and G5 Mobile systems. We directly market our products in the United States primarily to endocrinologists, physicians and diabetes educators. The approval by the FDA &#32;of Pediatric Indications for our G4 PLATINUM and G5 Mobile systems also allows our direct sales personnel to call on pediatric endocrinologists and pediatricians who can educate and influence adoption of continuous glucose monitoring by parents who have children aged two years or older with diabetes. Although the number of diabetes patients is significant, the number of physicians and educators influencing these patients is relatively small. As of 2008, there were an estimated 4,000 clinical endocrinologists in the United States. As a result, we believe our direct, highly specialized and focused sales organization is sufficient for us to support our sales efforts for the foreseeable future. 

We use a variety of marketing tools to drive adoption, ensure continued usage and establish brand loyalty for our continuous glucose monitoring systems by: 

&#8226; 

creating awareness of the benefits of continuous glucose monitoring and the advantages of our technology with endocrinologists, physicians, diabetes educators and people with diabetes; 

&#8226; 

providing strong and simple educational and training programs to healthcare providers and people with diabetes to ensure easy, safe and effective use of our systems; and 

&#8226; 

maintaining a readily accessible telephone and web-based technical and customer support infrastructure, which includes clinicians, diabetes educators and reimbursement specialists, to help referring physicians, diabetes educators and people with diabetes as necessary. 

Our sales organization competes with the experienced and well-funded marketing and sales operations of our competitors. We have relatively limited experience developing and managing a direct sales organization and we may be unsuccessful in our attempt to manage and expand the sales force. Developing a direct sales organization is a difficult, expensive and time consuming process. To be successful we must: 

&#8226; 

recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales personnel; 

&#8226; 

effectively train our sales personnel in the benefits of our products; 

&#8226; 

establish and maintain successful sales, marketing, training and education programs that encourage endocrinologists, physicians and diabetes educators to recommend our products to their patients; and 

&#8226; 

manage geographically disbursed operations. 

Competition 

The market for blood glucose monitoring devices is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions. Four companies, Roche Diabetes Care, a division of Roche Diagnostics; LifeScan, Inc., a division of Johnson &#38; Johnson; the Diabetes Care division of Abbott Laboratories; and Panasonic Healthcare Holdings&#8217; Ascensia Diabetes Care (formerly Bayer Diabetes Care), currently account for substantially all of the worldwide sales of self-monitored glucose testing systems. These competitors&#8217; products use a meter and disposable test strips to test blood obtained by pricking the finger or, in some cases, the forearm. In addition, other companies are developing or marketing implantable, minimally invasive, or non-invasive glucose testing devices and technologies that could compete with our devices. There are also a number of academic and other institutions involved in various phases of our industry&#8217;s technology development. 

Several companies have attempted to address the limitations of single-point finger stick devices by developing continuous glucose monitoring systems. To date, in addition to DexCom, we are aware that two other companies, Medtronic, Inc. ("Medtronic") &#32;and Abbott Diabetes Care, Inc. ("Abbott") , have received approval from the FDA &#32;to market, and actively market, continuous glucose monitors. Abbott &#32;has discontinued selling its Freestyle Navigator glucose monitoring system in the United States; however, Abbott &#32;filed a clinical study for home use of the Navigator II system in the United States and in October 2012 they initiated a limited launch of the Navigator II system in Europe. We believe that Abbott &#32;is also conducting clinical studies on a new glucose monitoring platform and has commercialized this new system in Europe. Except for our SEVEN, SEVEN PLUS, G4 PLATINUM, and G5 Mobile systems, we believe that none of the products that have received FDA &#32;approval are labeled for more than six days of use. We also believe that none of the FDA &#32;approved products are labeled for use as a replacement for single-point finger stick devices. 

A number of companies, including Roche, are developing next generation real-time continuous glucose monitoring or sensing devices and technologies as well as several other companies that are developing implantable, minimally invasive, or non-invasive continuous glucose monitoring products to measure the patient&#8217;s glucose level. The majority of the non-invasive technologies do not pierce the skin, but instead typically analyze signatures reflected back from energy that has been directed into the patient&#8217;s skin, tissue or bodily fluids. 

Many of our competitors are either publicly traded or are divisions of publicly traded companies, and they enjoy several competitive advantages over us. See Risk Factors - &#8220; We operate in a highly competitive market and face competition from large, well-established medical device manufacturers with significant resources, and, as a result, we may not be able to compete effectively.&#8221; 

As a result, we may be unable to compete effectively against these companies or their products. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include: 

&#8226; 

safe, reliable and high quality performance of products; 

&#8226; 

cost of products and eligibility for reimbursement; 

&#8226; 

comfort and ease of use; 

&#8226; 

effective sales, marketing and distribution; 

&#8226; 

brand awareness and strong acceptance by healthcare professionals and people with diabetes; 

&#8226; 

customer service and support and comprehensive education for people with diabetes and diabetes care providers; 

&#8226; 

speed of product innovation and time to market; 

&#8226; 

regulatory expertise; and 

&#8226; 

technological leadership and superiority. 

Manufacturing 

We currently manufacture our products at our headquarters in San Diego, California. At December 31, 2015 , these facilities had more than 8,000 &#32;square feet of laboratory space and approximately 18,000 &#32;square feet of controlled environment rooms. There are technical challenges to increasing manufacturing capacity, including FDA &#32;qualification of new manufacturing facilities, equipment design and automation, material procurement, problems with production yields, and quality control and assurance. We have focused significant effort on continual improvement programs in our manufacturing operations intended to improve quality, yields and throughput. We have made progress in manufacturing to enable us to supply adequate amounts of product to support our commercialization efforts, however we cannot guarantee that supply will not be constrained going forward. Additionally, the production of our continuous glucose monitoring systems must occur in a highly controlled and clean environment to minimize particles and other yield- and quality-limiting contaminants. Developing commercial-scale manufacturing facilities has and will continue to require the investment of substantial additional funds and the hiring and retaining of additional management, quality assurance, quality control and technical personnel who have the necessary 

manufacturing experience. Manufacturing is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties described in detail in &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; below. 

We manufacture our G4 PLATINUM and G5 Mobile systems with certain components supplied by outside vendors and other components that we manufacture internally. Key components that we manufacture internally include our wire-based sensors for the G4 PLATINUM and G5 Mobile systems. The remaining components and assemblies are purchased from outside vendors. We then assemble, test, package and ship the finished G4 PLATINUM and G5 Mobile systems, which include a reusable transmitter, a receiver, disposable sensors and our mobile applications including functionality related to the DexCom Share System. 

We purchase certain components and materials from single sources due to quality considerations, costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements. Currently, those single sources are OnCore Manufacturing Services, which manufactures and supplies circuit boards for our receiver and transmitter; ON Semiconductor Corp, which produces the application specific integrated circuits used in our transmitters; DSM PTG, Inc., which manufactures certain polymers used to synthesize our polymeric membranes for our sensors; and The Tech Group, which produces injection molded components. In some cases, agreements with these and other suppliers can be terminated by either party upon short notice. We may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers for our single-source components, especially after our products are commercialized, in part because of the FDA &#32;approval process and because of the custom nature of the parts we designed. Any supply interruption from our vendors or failure to obtain alternate vendors for any of the components would limit our ability to manufacture our systems, and could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Third-Party Reimbursement 

As a medical device company, reimbursement from Medicare and private third-party healthcare payors is an important element of our success. Although the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (&#8220;CMS&#8221;) &#32;released 2008 Alpha-Numeric Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (&#8220;HCPCS&#8221;) &#32;codes applicable to each of the three components of our continuous glucose monitoring systems, to date, our approved products are not reimbursed by virtue of a national coverage decision by Medicare. It is not known when, if ever, Medicare will adopt a national coverage decision with respect to continuous glucose monitoring devices. Until any such coverage decision is adopted by Medicare, reimbursement of our products will generally be limited to those customers covered by third-party payors that have adopted coverage policies for continuous glucose monitoring devices that include our products. As of February 23, 2016 , the seven largest private third-party payors, in terms of the number of covered lives, have issued coverage policies for the category of continuous glucose monitoring devices. In addition, we have negotiated contracted rates with all seven of those third-party payors for the purchase of our G4 PLATINUM and G5 Mobile systems by their members. Many of these coverage policies reimburse for our products under durable medical equipment benefits, are restrictive in nature and require the patient to comply with extensive documentation and other requirements to demonstrate medical necessity under the policy. In addition, customers who are insured by payors that do not offer coverage for our devices will have to bear the financial cost of the products. We currently employ in-house reimbursement expertise to assist customers in obtaining reimbursement from private third-party payors. We also maintain a field-based reimbursement team charged with calling on third-party private payors to obtain coverage decisions and contracts. We have had formal meetings and have increased our efforts to create and liberalize coverage policies with third-party payors, including obtaining reimbursement for our products under pharmacy benefits, and expect to continue to do so in fiscal 2016. However, unless government and other third-party payors provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products, people with diabetes may not use them on a widespread basis. 

Medicare, Medicaid, health maintenance organizations and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new medical devices, and, as a result, their coverage policies may be restrictive, or they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our products. In order to obtain reimbursement arrangements, we may have to agree to a net sales price lower than the net sales price we might charge in other sales channels. Our revenue may be limited by the continuing efforts of government and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare through various increasingly sophisticated means, such as requiring prospective reimbursement and second opinions, purchasing in groups, or redesigning benefits. Furthermore, we are unable to predict what effect the current or any future healthcare reform will have on our business, or the effect these matters will have on our customers. Our dependence on the commercial success of the G4 PLATINUM and G5 Mobile systems makes us particularly susceptible to any cost containment or reduction efforts. Accordingly, unless government and other third-party payors provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for the G4 PLATINUM and G5 Mobile systems, people without coverage who have diabetes may not use our products. 

In some foreign markets, pricing and profitability of medical devices are subject to government control. In the United States, we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals for similar controls. Also, the trends toward managed healthcare in the United States and proposed legislation intended to reduce the cost of government insurance programs could 

significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products and may result in lower prices for our products or the exclusion of our products from reimbursement programs. 

Intellectual Property 

Protection of our intellectual property is a strategic priority for our business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright and other intellectual property laws, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary rights. As of February 2016, we had obtained 284 issued U.S. patents, and had 276 additional U.S. patent applications pending. We believe it will take up to five years, and possibly longer, for these pending U.S. patent applications to result in issued patents. As of February 2016, we have 15 international applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, 31 granted European patents, 49 European patent applications pending, 9 granted Japanese patents, 11 Japanese patent applications pending, 30 registered U.S. trademarks, 19 pending U.S. trademark applications, 12 registered European trademarks, 8 pending European trademark application, and 2 registered Japanese trademarks. We also have 19 registered trademarks and 20 pending applications in a number of countries in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. In addition, we have Madrid Protocol Trademark registrations in 17 countries and 23 pending applications in each of a number of countries in Asia, Latin America, Europe and the Middle East. Our patents begin expiring in 2017. 

Together, our patents and patent applications seek to protect aspects of our core membrane and sensor technologies, and our product concepts for continuous glucose monitoring. We believe that our patent position provides us with sufficient rights to protect our current and proposed commercial products. However, our patent applications may not result in issued patents, and any patents that have been issued or might be issued may not protect our intellectual property rights. Furthermore, our patents may not be upheld. Any patents issued to us may be challenged by third parties as being invalid or unenforceable, or third parties may independently develop similar or competing technology that avoids our patents. The steps we have taken may not prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. We also face risks associated with intellectual property infringement. See Risk Factors, &#8220; We are subject to claims of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others, which could prohibit us from shipping affected products, require us to obtain licenses from third parties or to develop non-infringing alternatives, and subject us to substantial monetary damages and injunctive relief. We may also be subject to other claims or suits.&#8221; and &#8220; Our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property could allow our competitors and others to produce products based on our technology, which could substantially impair our ability to compete .&#8221; 

We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property by generally requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also forbid them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us. We also generally require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials. We cannot guaranty that employees and third parties will abide by the confidentiality or assignment terms of these agreements. Despite measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties might copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. 

Government Regulation 

Our products are medical devices subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA &#32;and regulatory bodies in other countries. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (&#8220;FDCA&#8221;) &#32;and the FDA &#8217;s implementing regulations govern product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, pre-market clearance or approval, establishment registration and product listing, product manufacturing, product labeling, product storage, advertising and promotion, product sales, distribution, recalls and field actions, servicing and post-market clinical surveillance. 

FDA &#32;Regulation 

Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the United States will require either prior 510(k) clearance or prior approval from the FDA &#32;through the premarket approval, or PMA &#32;process. Our G4 PLATINUM and G5 Mobile systems are classified by the FDA &#32;as PMA &#32;medical devices. The FDA &#32;classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in Class I or II. Class I devices are subject to general controls such as labeling, pre-market notification, and adherence to the FDA &#8217;s Quality System Regulation (&#8220;QSR&#8221;) . Class II devices are subject to special controls such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, FDA &#32;guidelines, or particularized labeling, as well as general controls. Some Class I and Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the pre-market notification (i.e., 510(k) clearance) requirement, and/or the requirement of compliance with substantially all of FDA &#8217;s manufacturing requirements, known as the QSR . As an example, the mobile applications that comprise the DexCom Share System were classified by the FDA as Class II, exempt, due to the fact that these mobile applications were secondary displays of the associated G4 PLATINUM or G5 Mobile Receiver. With the mobile applications classified as Class II exempt, DexCom must comply with certain general and special controls required by the FDA but does not need prior FDA approval to commercialize changes to the mobile applications. Some devices are placed in Class III, which requires approval of a PMA &#32;application, if they are deemed by the FDA &#32;to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or certain implantable devices, or to be &#8220;not substantially equivalent&#8221; either to a previously 510(k) cleared device or to a &#8220;preamendment&#8221; Class III device in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which PMA &#32;applications have not been required. 

Our G4 PLATINUM and G5 Mobile Systems (excluding associated DexCom Share System functionalities and mobile applications) have been classified as devices requiring PMA &#32;approval. A PMA &#32;application must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, pre-clinical, clinical, manufacturing and labeling data, to demonstrate to the FDA &#8217;s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device. A PMA &#32;application also must include a complete description of the device and its components, a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture the device, and proposed labeling. After a PMA -application is submitted and found to be sufficiently complete, the FDA &#32;begins an in-depth review of the submitted information. During this review period, the FDA &#32;may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA &#32;may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA . In addition, the FDA &#32;generally will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to evaluate compliance with QSR , which requires manufacturers to implement and follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. In July 2012, the FDA &#32;completed an inspection of our facilities, and did not identify any observations or require any other types of corrective action. During a routine FDA &#32;post-approval facility inspection ending on November 7, 2013, the FDA &#32;made several observations regarding DexCom MDR &#32;procedures and complaint reportability determinations. DexCom responded to the observations on November 26, 2013. On March 14, 2014, we received the 2014 Warning Letter from the FDA related to administrative deficiencies in filing MDRs. On April 2, 2014, we responded to the 2014 Warning Letter. On April 16, 2015, the FDA initiated an on-site inspection intended to both close out the 2014 Warning Letter and conduct our normal biennial quality system inspection. The FDA completed its inspection with no observations. On May 21, 2015, the FDA issued a letter closing the 2014 Warning Letter. 

FDA &#32;review of a PMA &#32;application generally takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. The FDA &#32;can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA &#32;application for many reasons, including: 

&#8226; 

our systems may not be safe or effective to the FDA &#8217;s satisfaction; 

&#8226; 

the data from our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support approval; 

&#8226; 

the manufacturing process or facilities we use may not meet applicable requirements; and 

&#8226; 

changes in FDA &#32;approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data. 

If an FDA &#32;evaluation of a PMA &#32;application or manufacturing facilities is favorable, the FDA &#32;will either issue an approval letter, or approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions which must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA . When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA , the agency will issue a PMA &#32;approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of a device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA &#8217;s evaluation of a PMA &#32;application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA &#32;will deny approval of the PMA &#32;or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA &#32;may also determine that additional trials are necessary, in which case the PMA &#32;approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA . The PMA &#32;process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which FDA &#32;approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA &#32;for marketing. 

New PMA &#32;applications or PMA &#32;supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that is approved through the PMA &#32;process. PMA &#32;supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA &#32;application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA &#32;application and may or may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. 

Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA &#32;application and are sometimes required for a 510(k) clearance. These trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption (&#8220;IDE&#8221;) &#32;to the FDA . The IDE &#32;application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE &#32;application must be approved in advance by the FDA &#32;for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for abbreviated IDE &#32;requirements. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE &#32;application is approved by the FDA &#32;and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. The FDA &#8217;s approval of an IDE &#32;allows clinical testing to go forward, but does not bind the FDA &#32;to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product&#8217;s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria. All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA &#8217;s IDE &#32;regulations, which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Clinical trials must further comply with the FDA &#8217;s regulations for institutional review board approval and for informed consent and other human subject protections. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA . The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA &#32;to grant approval or clearance of a product. The commencement or completion of any of our clinical trials may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA &#32;application, for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; 

the FDA &#32;or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or place a clinical trial on hold; 

&#8226; 

patients do not enroll in clinical trials at the rate we expect; 

&#8226; 

patients do not comply with trial protocols; 

&#8226; 

patient follow-up is not at the rate we expect; 

&#8226; 

patients experience adverse side effects; 

&#8226; 

patients die during a clinical trial, even though their death may not be related to our products; 

&#8226; 

institutional review boards and third-party clinical investigators may delay or reject our trial protocol; 

&#8226; 

third-party clinical investigators decline to participate in a trial or do not perform a trial on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, good clinical practices or other FDA &#32;requirements; 

&#8226; 

DexCom or third-party organizations do not perform data collection, monitoring and analysis in a timely or accurate manner or consistent with the clinical trial protocol or investigational or statistical plans; 

&#8226; 

third-party clinical investigators have significant financial interests related to DexCom or the study that the FDA &#32;deems to make the study results unreliable, or DexCom or investigators fail to disclose such interests; 

&#8226; 

regulatory inspections of our clinical trials or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials; 

&#8226; 

changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions applicable to our trial protocols; 

&#8226; 

the interim or final results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or efficacy; and 

&#8226; 

the FDA &#32;concludes that our trial design is inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy. 

In November 2011, SweetSpot received 510(k) clearance from the FDA &#32;to market to clinics a data management service, which helps healthcare providers and patients see, understand and use blood glucose meter data to diagnose and manage diabetes. SweetSpot&#8217;s data transfer service is registered with the FDA &#32;as a MDDS &#32;and allows researchers to control the transfer of data from certain diabetes devices to research tools and databases according to their own research workflows. Additional functions of, or intended uses for, the SweetSpot software platform will require us to obtain either 510(k) clearance or PMA &#32;approval from the FDA . To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that the software system is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a pre-amendment device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA &#32;has not yet called for the submission of a PMA &#32;application. The FDA &#8217;s 510(k) clearance pathway generally takes from three to twelve months from the date the application is completed, but can take significantly longer. After a medical device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a significant change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance. 

After a device is approved and placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: 

&#8226; 

establishment registration and device listing; 

&#8226; 

QSR , which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, storage, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures; 

&#8226; 

labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or off-label uses or indications and impose other restrictions on labeling, advertising and promotion; 

&#8226; 

medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA &#32;if a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; 

&#8226; 

voluntary and mandatory device recalls to address problems when a device is defective and/or could be a risk to health; and 

&#8226; 

corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA &#32;field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA &#32;that may present a risk to health. 

Also, the FDA &#32;may require us to conduct post-market surveillance studies or order us to establish and maintain a system for tracking our products through the chain of distribution to the patient level. The FDA &#32;and the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Health Services enforce regulatory requirements by conducting periodic, unannounced inspections and market surveillance. Inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. 

Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including those applicable to the conduct of our clinical trials, can result in enforcement action by the FDA , which may lead to any of the following sanctions: 

&#8226; 

warning letters or untitled letters that require corrective action; 

&#8226; 

fines and civil penalties; 

&#8226; 

unanticipated expenditures; 

&#8226; 

delays in approving or refusal to approve our future continuous glucose monitoring systems or other products; 

&#8226; 

FDA &#32;refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export our products for sale in other countries; 

&#8226; 

suspension or withdrawal of FDA &#32;approval; 

&#8226; 

product recall or seizure; 

&#8226; 

interruption of production; 

&#8226; 

operating restrictions; 

&#8226; 

injunctions; and 

&#8226; 

criminal prosecution. 

We and our contract manufacturers, specification developers, and some suppliers of components or device accessories, are also required to manufacture our products in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (&#8220;GMP&#8221;) &#32;requirements set forth in the QSR . The QSR &#32;requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components or services, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing, and record keeping. The FDA &#32;evaluates compliance with the QSR &#32;through periodic unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. If the FDA &#32;believes we or any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers are not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down our manufacturing operations, require recall of our products, refuse to approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations, or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees. Any such action by the FDA &#32;would have a material adverse effect on our business. We may be unable to comply with all applicable FDA &#32;regulations. 

Customer Notification 

On February 23, 2016, we issued a customer notification regarding an issue with the audible alarms and alerts associated with our receivers (Dexcom G4 PLATINUM and Dexcom G5 Mobile). The issue with the audible alarms and alerts was identified as a result of our continuous review of complaints received from our customers. A failure of the audible alarms and alerts may cause our customers to not detect a severe hypoglycemic (low glucose) or hyperglycemic (high glucose) event. We are working to implement a solution for the audible alarms and alerts issue identified in the customer notification. The FDA &#32;is aware of this notification and a copy of this notification is available on the DexCom website at http://www.dexcom.com/notification. In the customer notification we have recommended that customers test the alarms and alerts on their receiver(s) every few days to make sure that the alarms and alerts are functioning properly. 

Fraud and Abuse Laws and Other Compliance Requirements 

The healthcare industry is subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. 

Anti-kickback Laws. &#32;The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging of a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. The definition of &#8220;remuneration&#8221; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including such items as gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, waiver of payments, and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") &#32;has issued regulations, commonly known as safe harbors, that set forth certain provisions which, if fully met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the HHS &#32;Office of Inspector General. 

The penalties for violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include imprisonment for up to five years, fines of up to $25,000 per violation and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many states have adopted prohibitions similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 

Federal False Claims Act. &#32;The federal False Claims Act prohibits the knowing filing of a false claim or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it must pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim. Suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as &#8220;qui tam&#8221; actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals (known as &#8220;relators&#8221; or, more commonly, as &#8220;whistleblowers&#8221;) may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. In addition, certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a false claim action, pay fines or be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action. 

HIPAA. &#32;The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, or HIPAA &#32;created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment. 

FCPA. Additionally, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (&#8220;FCPA&#8221;) &#32;prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA &#32;would include interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other U.S. and foreign laws, rules and/or regulations. 

Sunshine Act. Pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that was signed into law in March 2010, the federal government enacted the Physician Payment Sunshine Act (the &#8220;Sunshine Act&#8221;). Beginning in 2013 and 2014, we are required to track and publicly report, respectively, gifts and payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals. Many of these requirements are new and uncertain, and failure to comply could result in a range of fines, penalties and/or other sanctions. &#32; 

International Regulation 

International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval in a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA &#32;approval, and the requirements may differ. There is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the European Union, United States, Canada and various other industrialized countries. 

The primary regulatory body in Europe is that of the European Union, which includes most of the major countries in Europe. Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices. The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout Europe. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third party assessment by a &#8220;Notified Body.&#8221; This third-party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer&#8217;s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer&#8217;s product. An assessment by a Notified Body of one country within the European Union is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the European Union. Outside of the European Union, regulatory approval needs to be sought on a country-by-country basis in order for us to market our products. 

Environmental Regulation 

Our research and development and clinical processes involve the handling of potentially harmful biological materials as well as hazardous materials. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous and biological materials and we incur expenses relating to compliance with these laws and regulations. If violations of environmental, health and safety laws occur, we could be held liable for damages, penalties and costs of remedial actions. These expenses or this liability could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition. We may violate environmental, health and safety laws in the future as a result of human error, equipment failure or other causes. Environmental laws could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations. We are subject to potentially conflicting and changing regulatory agendas of political, business and environmental groups. Changes to or restrictions on permitting requirements or processes, hazardous or biological material storage or handling might require an unplanned capital investment or relocation. Failure to comply with new or existing laws or regulations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Advisory Boards and Consultants 

We have relied upon the advice of experts in the development and commercialization of our products. Since 2005, we have used experts in various disciplines on a consulting basis as needed to solve problems or accelerate development pathways. We may continue to engage advisors from the academic, consultancy, governmental or other areas to assist us as necessary. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 1,212 &#32;full-time employees and 297 &#32;contract and temporary employees. Approximately 271 &#32;full-time employees are engaged in research and development, clinical, regulatory and quality assurance, 343 &#32;in manufacturing and 598 &#32;in selling, general and administrative functions. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced any employment-related work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good.
