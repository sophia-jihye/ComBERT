 ITEM 1. BUSINESS

&#160; 

Village Bank and Trust Financial Corp. (&#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated in January 2003 and was organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia as a bank holding company. The Company has three active wholly owned subsidiaries: Village Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;), Southern Community Financial Capital Trust I, and Village Financial Statutory Trust II. The Bank has one active wholly owned subsidiary: Village Bank Mortgage Corporation (&#8220;the mortgage company&#8221;), a full service mortgage banking company. The Company is the holding company of and successor to the Bank. Effective April 30, 2004, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of the Bank in a statutory share exchange transaction. Unless the context suggest otherwise, the terms &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer collectively to the Company, the Bank, and the Mortgage Company.

&#160;

The Bank is the primary operating business of the Company. The Bank offers a wide range of banking and related financial services, including checking, savings, certificates of deposit and other depository services, and commercial, real estate and consumer loans, primarily in the Richmond, Virginia metropolitan area. The Bank was organized in 1999 as a Virginia chartered bank to engage in a general banking business to serve the communities in and around Richmond, Virginia. Deposits with the Bank are insured to the maximum amount provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;). The Bank offers a comprehensive range of financial services and products and specializes in providing customized financial services to small and medium sized businesses, professionals, and individuals. The Bank provides its customers with personal customized service utilizing the latest technology and delivery channels.

&#160;

Bank revenues are derived from interest and fees received in connection with loans, deposits, and mortgage services. Administrative and operating expenses are the major expenses, followed by interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Revenues from the mortgage company consist primarily of gains from the sale of loans and loan origination fees and its major expenses consist of personnel, occupancy, data processing, and other operating expenses. In 2015, revenue (after intercompany eliminations) generated by the Bank totaled $18.6 million and the mortgage company generated $7.3 million in revenue.

&#160;

Business Strategy 

&#160;

We are implementing strategies that we believe, overtime, will help us achieve our goal of delivering long term total shareholder returns that rank in the top quartile of a nationwide peer group. To achieve this goal, we believe that we will need to become a top performer in return on equity, produce sustainable earnings growth, achieve best quartile earnings volatility in our industry and deliver best quartile asset quality in the worst part of the economic cycle. Our current business strategies include the following:

&#160;

&#183; Grow our general commercial and consumer banking businesses . Our strategy is to offer commercial and retail customers all of the basic products and services they need while maintaining the quick response and personal service of a community bank. During the past two years, we have made significant investments in our people and products. In commercial banking, we expanded our commercial banking team, enhanced our Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) lending capabilities, and installed a more intensive sales process. In consumer banking, we upgraded all automated teller machines (&#8220;ATMs&#8221;), installed mobile deposit capture, switched debit card providers to increase exchange fees, enhanced our rewards program, expanded our customer care team staff and hours, fully implemented our overdraft protection program and installed a more efficient and competitive consumer lending process and updated loan products. &#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Reposition our real estate lending to emphasize both construction and commercial mortgage lending on income producing properties while being selective and targeted in our land acquisition and development and single family construction lending . Real estate lending will continue to be an important part of our business strategy, but we intend to be diligent in managing overall portfolio concentrations and focus on real estate sectors that will perform better during difficult times. &#160;

&#183; Grow low cost core deposits by emphasizing relationship banking in every division. In turn, this will lower funding costs, enhance return on assets and return on equity and help us develop long term, mutually important relationships with our clients . We have enhanced our deposit products, realigned our treasury services and small business banking, and established performance expectations and incentives for commercial bankers to grow deposits. We will also focus on deposit-rich business and consumer market segments. During the past two years, we have significantly enhanced our product and service offerings for businesses and consumers and this has yielded 24% growth in business checking, savings and money market deposit products since year end 2013 and 13% growth total checking, savings and money market deposits during that time. Our goal is to have these low cost relationship deposit categories account for 70% of our funding and to have noninterest bearing demand deposits account for 25% of our funding by year end 2019. &#160;

&#183; Drive fee income growth by growing mortgage banking and enhancing fee generating services, both of which will improve return on assets and return on equity . We have been installing and updating business and consumer banking products and services that generate fee income. For each of the past two years, we have achieved double digit fee income on banking services. Mortgage revenues increased 31% in 2015 producing pretax earnings in excess of $1 million . &#160;

&#183; Streamline and rationalize our processes and organization to improve productivity and efficiency . Operational efficiency and excellence are critical to becoming a high return on equity bank. We embrace the need to continuously improve how we get business done and to be nimble and versatile. &#160;

&#183; Achieve excellence in all risk management and credit processes . We strive to achieve best quartile performance on credit quality metrics in the worst part of the business cycle and sustainable earnings growth over time. Risk taking is a fundamental part of banking. Top performing banks are very good at identifying, evaluating, measuring, tracking, managing, mitigating and getting paid for the risks the organization takes. We are committed to building and sustaining the culture, talent, tools, policies, processes, resources and discipline needed to be a top performer in our risk management and credit processes. &#160; 

&#183; Achieve full compliance with Regulatory Agreements to reduce related costs and enhance our flexibility as we grow the business . We earned release from the formal agreement with the FDIC and Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions during 2015. We are working hard to eliminate the informal memorandum of understanding with those authorities and the written agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond during 2016. &#160;

We strongly believe that there is a continuing need for community based banks like Village and that a well-run community based bank can generate attractive returns for shareholders over the long term.

Market Area 

&#160;

The Company, the Bank, and the mortgage company are headquartered in Chesterfield County and primarily serve the Central Virginia region and the Richmond Metropolitan Statistical Area (the &#8220;Richmond MSA&#8221;. At the end of 2014, the Richmond MSA was the nation&#8217;s 44 th largest metro area. At the end of 2015, its population was 1,263,617 representing approximately 15% of the total population in the Commonwealth of Virginia with a median age of 38.1 years.

&#160;

The unemployment rate for Richmond MSA was 4.1% in December 2015 compared to 4.2% for the Commonwealth of Virginia and 5.0% for the nation. At December 31, 2014 the unemployment rate for Richmond MSA 4.7%, 4.8% for the Commonwealth of Virginia and 5.6% for the nation.

&#160;

Banking Services 

&#160;

We currently conduct business from eleven full-service branch banking offices, one offsite ATM and two mortgage loan production offices in Central Virginia in the counties of Chesterfield, Hanover, Henrico and Powhatan. We also have a mortgage loan production office in Manassas, Virginia.

&#160;

Deposit Services . Deposits are a major source of our funding. The Bank offers a full range of deposit services that are typically available in most banks and other financial institutions including checking accounts, savings accounts and other time deposits of various types, ranging from daily money market accounts to longer term certificates of deposit and Individual Retirement Accounts. These deposit accounts are offered at rates competitive with other institutions in our market area. We service our deposit clients in our full-service branches, at drive-up windows, at our ATMs, through our customer care team and through technology such as online banking, mobile banking applications and remote deposit capture for business clients. We have not applied for permission to establish a trust department and offer trust services. The Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System. Deposits are insured under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to the limits provided thereunder.

&#160;

Lending Services . We offer a full range of short-to-medium term commercial and personal loans. We also provide a wide range of real estate finance services. Our primary focus is on making loans in the Central Virginia market where we have branch banking offices. We also originate mortgage loans for sale in our Northern Virginia mortgage loan production office. We will periodically offer residential construction-to-permanent financing to clients of the mortgage production office in Northern Virginia.

&#160;

&#183; Commercial Business Lending . We make secured and unsecured loans to small- and medium-sized businesses for purposes such as funding working capital needs (including inventory and receivables), business expansion (including acquisition of real estate and improvements) and purchase of equipment and machinery. We also make loans under Small Business Administration and state sponsored business loan programs. In our underwriting, we evaluate the earnings and cash flows of the business, guarantor support and both the need for and the protection offered by the collateral for the loan. &#160;

&#183; Commercial Real Estate Acquisition, Development, Construction and Mortgage Lending . We make loans to our clients for the purposes of acquiring, developing, constructing and owning commercial real estate. These properties may be owner-occupied or may be held for investment purposes and repaid from rental income or from the sale of the property. &#160;

&#183; Consumer Lending . Consumer loans include secured and unsecured loans for financing automobiles, home improvements, education and personal investments. We also originate fixed and variable rate mortgage loans and real estate construction and acquisition loans. Residential loans originated by our mortgage company are usually sold in the secondary mortgage market. &#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Loan Participations . We sell loan participations in the ordinary course of business when a loan originated by us exceeds our legal lending limit or we otherwise deem it prudent to share the risk with another lending institution. Additionally, we purchase loan participations from other banks, usually without recourse against that bank. We underwrite purchased loan participations in accordance with normal underwriting practices. &#160;

&#183; Loan Purchases. We purchase Federal Rehabilitated Student Loan portfolios when approved by the Board of Directors. These loans are guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education (&#8220;DOE&#8221;) which covers approximately 98% of the principal and interest. These loans are serviced by a third party servicer that specializes in handling these types of loans. &#160;

We also purchase the guaranteed portion of United State Department of Agriculture Loans (&#8220;USDA&#8221;) which are guaranteed by the USDA for 100% of the principal and interest. The originating institution holds the unguaranteed portion of the loan and services the loan. These loans are typically purchased at a premium. In the event of a loan default or early prepayment the Bank may need to write off any unamortized premium.

&#160;

Lending Limit. As of December 31, 2015, our legal lending limit for loans to one borrower was approximately $6,404,000. However, we generally limit credit to any one individual or entity to a maximum of $4,000,000.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We encounter strong competition from other local commercial banks, credit unions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market mutual funds and other financial institutions. A number of these competitors are well-established. Competition for loans is keen, and pricing is important. Most of our competitors have substantially greater resources and higher lending limits than ours and offer certain services, such as extensive and established branch networks and trust services, which we do not provide at the present time. Deposit competition also is strong, and we may have to pay higher interest rates to attract deposits. Nationwide banking institutions and their branches have increased competition in our markets, and federal legislation adopted in 1999 allows non-banking companies, such as insurance and investment firms, to establish or acquire banks. We believe that the Company can capitalize on recent merger activity to attract customers from the acquired institutions.

&#160;

At June 30, 2015, the latest date such information is available from the FDIC, the Bank&#8217;s deposit market share in Chesterfield County was 5.29%, 4.41% in Hanover County, 7.39% in Powhatan County, 0.41% in the Richmond MSA and 0.09% in Henrico County.

&#160;

Regulation

&#160;

We are subject to extensive regulation by certain federal and state agencies and receive periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities. As a consequence, our business is affected by state and federal legislation and regulations.

&#160;

General. The discussion below is only a summary of the principal laws and regulations that comprise the regulatory framework applicable to us. The descriptions of these laws and regulations, as well as descriptions of laws and regulations contained elsewhere herein, do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations. In recent years, regulatory compliance by financial institutions such as ours has placed a significant burden on us both in costs and employee time commitment.

&#160; 

Bank Holding Company. The Company is a bank holding company under the federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and is subject to supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;) and Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions (the &#8220;BFI&#8221;). As a bank holding company, the Company is required to furnish to the Federal Reserve annual and quarterly reports of its operations and such additional information as the Federal Reserve may require. The Federal Reserve, FDIC and BFI also may conduct examinations of the Company and/or the Bank.

&#160;

Bank Regulation. As a Virginia-chartered bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the BFI and the FDIC. Federal and state law also specify the activities in which the Bank may engage, the investments it may make and the aggregate amount of loans that may be granted to one borrower. Various consumer and compliance laws and regulations also affect the Bank&#8217;s operations. Earnings are affected by general economic conditions, management policies and the legislative and governmental actions of various regulatory authorities, including those referred to above. The BFI and the FDIC conduct regular examinations, reviewing such matters as the overall safety and soundness of the institution, the adequacy of loan loss reserves, quality of loans and investments, management practices, compliance with laws, and other aspects of the Bank&#8217;s operations. In addition to these regular examinations, the Bank must furnish the FDIC and BFI with periodic reports containing a full and accurate statement of its affairs. Supervision, regulation and examination of banks by these agencies are intended primarily for the protection of depositors rather than shareholders.

&#160;

Agreements with Regulators. In February 2012, the Bank entered into a Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of a Consent Order with the FDIC and the BFI (the &#8220;Supervisory Authorities&#8221;), and the Supervisory Authorities issued the related Consent Order effective February 3, 2012. In June 2012, the Company entered into a written agreement (&#8220;Written Agreement&#8221;) with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (&#8220;Reserve Bank&#8221;). A description of the terms and conditions of these Agreements is provided in Note 12. Commitments and contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements .

&#160;

On December 22, 2015, the Bank received notification from the FDIC and the BFI that the Consent Order was terminated effective December 14, 2015. The Consent Order was terminated as a result of the steps the Company and the Bank took to, among other things, improve asset quality, increase capital, augment management and board oversight, and increase earnings. The Written Agreement with the Reserve Bank continues in effect.

&#160;

In place of the Consent Order, the Bank&#8217;s Board of Directors has made certain written assurances to the FDIC and Virginia BFI in the form of a Memorandum of Understanding (&#8220;MOU&#8221;) that became effective November 17, 2015. The MOU contains provisions concerning asset quality, earnings, regulatory violations, minimum capital levels, asset growth, restrictions on paying dividends and a requirement to furnish progress reports to the FDIC and Virginia BFI. The MOU is considered an informal regulatory action.

&#160;

The following description summarizes some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) was signed into law, incorporating numerous financial institution regulatory reforms. Certain of these reforms are yet to be implemented through regulations to be adopted by various federal banking and securities regulatory agencies. The following discussion describes the material elements of the regulatory framework that currently apply. The Dodd-Frank Act implements far-reaching reforms of major elements of the financial landscape, particularly for larger financial institutions. Many of its provisions do not directly impact community-based institutions like the Bank. For instance, provisions that regulate derivative transactions and limit derivatives trading activity of federally-insured institutions, enhance supervision of &#8220;systemically significant&#8221; institutions, impose new regulatory authority over hedge funds, limit proprietary trading by banks, and phase-out the eligibility of trust preferred securities for Tier 1 capital are among the provisions that do not directly impact the Bank either because of exemptions for institutions below a certain asset size or because of the nature of the Bank&#8217;s operations. Provisions that do impact the Bank include the following:

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; FDIC Assessments . The Dodd-Frank Act changes the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity. In addition, it increases the minimum size of the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) and eliminates its ceiling, with the burden of the increase in the minimum size on institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. &#183; Deposit Insurance. The Dodd-Frank Act makes permanent the $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance at all insured depository institutions. &#183; Interest on Demand Deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act provides that depository institutions may pay interest on demand deposits, including business transaction and other accounts. &#183; Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Dodd-Frank Act centralizes responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, responsible for implementing federal consumer protection laws, although banks below $10 billion in assets will continue to be examined and supervised for compliance with these laws by their federal bank regulator. &#183; Mortgage Lending. Additional requirements are imposed on mortgage lending, including minimum underwriting standards, prohibitions on certain yield-spread compensation to mortgage originators, special consumer protections for mortgage loans that do not meet certain provision qualifications, prohibitions and limitations on certain mortgage terms and various mandated disclosures to mortgage borrowers. &#183; Holding Company Capital Levels. Bank regulators are required to establish minimum capital levels for holding companies that are at least as stringent as those currently applicable to banks. In addition, all trust preferred securities issued after May 19, 2010 will be counted as Tier 2 capital, but the Company&#8217;s currently outstanding trust preferred securities will continue to qualify as Tier 1 capital. &#183; De Novo Interstate Branching. National and state banks are permitted to establish de novo interstate branches outside of their home state, and bank holding companies and banks must be well-capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state. &#183; Transactions with Affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act enhances the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates under Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including an expansion of the definition of &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained. &#183; Transactions with Insiders. Insider transaction limitations are expanded through the strengthening of loan restrictions to insiders and the expansion of the types of transactions subject to the various limits, including derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending or borrowing transactions. Restrictions are also placed on certain asset sales to and from an insider to an institution, including requirements that such sales be on market terms and, in certain circumstances, approved by the institution&#8217;s board of directors. &#183; Corporate Governance. The Dodd-Frank Act includes corporate governance revisions that apply to all public companies, not just financial institutions, including with regard to executive compensation and proxy access to shareholders. &#160;

The Company is continually evaluating the effects of the Dodd-Frank Act, together with implementing the regulations that have been proposed and adopted. The ultimate effects of the Dodd-Frank Act and the resulting rulemaking cannot be predicted at this time, but it has increased the Company&#8217;s operating and compliance costs in the short-term, and it could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operation and financial condition.

&#160; 

Insurance of Accounts, Assessments and Regulation by the FDIC. Our deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the limits set forth under applicable law, currently $250,000. We are subject to the deposit insurance assessments of the DIF. The amount of the assessment is a function of the institution&#8217;s risk category, of which there are four, and its assessment base. An institution&#8217;s risk category is determined according to its supervisory ratings and capital levels and is used to determine the institution&#8217;s assessment rate. The assessment base is an institution&#8217;s average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The FDIC is authorized to prohibit any DIF-insured institution from engaging in any activity that the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the respective insurance fund. Also, the FDIC may initiate enforcement actions against banks, after first giving the institution&#8217;s primary regulatory authority an opportunity to take such action. The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any depository institution if it determines, after a hearing, that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed in writing by the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible capital. If deposit insurance is terminated, the deposits at the institution at the time of termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period from six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC. We are aware of no existing circumstances that could result in termination of our deposit insurance.

&#160;

Payment of Dividends. The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and its other subsidiaries. Virtually all of the Company&#8217;s cash revenues will result from dividends paid to it by the Bank, which is subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends that it can pay. Under Virginia law, a bank may not declare a dividend in excess of its accumulated retained earnings without BFI approval. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank did not have any accumulated retained earnings. In addition, the Bank may not declare or pay any dividend if, after making the dividend, the Bank would be &#34;undercapitalized,&#34; as defined in FDIC regulations.

&#160;

The FDIC and the state have the general authority to limit the dividends paid by insured banks if the payment is deemed an unsafe and unsound practice. Both the FDIC and the state have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a bank's capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsound and unsafe banking practice.

&#160;

In addition, the Company is subject to certain regulatory requirements to maintain capital at or above regulatory minimums. These regulatory requirements regarding capital affect our dividend policies. Regulators have indicated that holding companies should generally pay dividends only if the organization's net income available to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends, and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization's capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. In addition, the Federal Reserve has issued guidelines that bank holding companies should inform and consult with the Federal Reserve in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period (e.g., quarter) for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the organization&#8217;s capital structure.

&#160;

The Company is subject to a Written Agreement with the Reserve Bank pursuant to which the Company is required to obtain the prior written approval of the Reserve Bank to declare or pay any dividends on its common stock or preferred stock, take dividends or any other form of payment representing a reduction in capital from the Bank or make any payments on its trust preferred securities.

&#160;

The Bank was subject to a Consent Order with the FDIC and the BFI that also required the Bank to obtain prior written regulatory approval to declare or pay any dividends, pay bonuses or make any other form of payment outside the ordinary course of business resulting in a reduction of capital. Under the MOU, the Bank remains subject to this requirement.

&#160;

Capital Adequacy. Both the Company and the Bank are required to comply with the capital adequacy standards established by the Federal Reserve, in the case of the Company, and the FDIC, in the case of the Bank. In June 2012, the federal bank regulatory agencies jointly issued proposed rules to revise the risk-based and leverage capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to be consistent with the agreements reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in &#8220;Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems&#8221; (&#8220;Basel III&#8221;) and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The proposed rules applied to all depository institutions, top-tier bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $500 million or more, and top-tier savings and loan holding companies (&#8220;banking organizations&#8221;). On July 2, 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies approved certain revisions to the proposed rules and finalized new capital requirements for banking organizations.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Among other things, the final rules establish a revised definition of regulatory capital, a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (&#8220;CET1&#8221;), a higher minimum Tier 1 capital requirement, and a supplementary leverage ratio that incorporates a broader set of exposures in the denominator. The final rules also establish limits on a banking organization&#8217;s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a specified amount of CET1 capital in addition to the necessary amount to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.

&#160;

Effective January 1, 2015, the final rules require the Company and the Bank to comply with the following new minimum capital ratios: (i) a new ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%; (ii) a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.0% (iii) a ratio of total (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%; and (iv) a leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures (computed as the average for each quarter of the month-end ratios for the quarter). These are the initial capital requirements, which will be phased in over a four-year period that began on January 1, 2015. When fully phased in, Basel III will require the Company and the Bank to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% &#34;capital conservation buffer&#34; (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7% upon full implementation), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation), (iii) a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation) and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%.

&#160;

Basel III will also provide for a &#34;countercyclical capital buffer,&#34; generally designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress and to be imposed when national regulators determine that excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk. The buffer would be a CET1 add-on to the capital conservation buffer in the range of 0% to 2.5% when fully implemented (potentially resulting in total buffers of between 2.5% and 5%).

&#160;

The Basel III capital framework is also expected to provide for a number of new deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 are to be phased-in over a three-year period which began on January 1, 2016.

&#160;

Additionally, the bank regulatory agencies&#8217; final rules revised the &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (the &#8220;FDIC Act&#8221;) by (i) introducing a CET1 capital ratio requirement at each level (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum ratio for well-capitalized status being 8.0%; and (iii) eliminating the provision that provides that a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 may have a 3.0% Tier 1 leverage ratio and still be well-capitalized. These new thresholds were effective for the Bank as of January 1, 2015. The minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (10.0%) and minimum leverage ratio (5.0%) for well-capitalized status were unchanged by the final rules. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank met the new minimum ratios to be classified as a well capitalized financial institution.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Federal banking regulators are required to take various mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to banks in the three &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; categories. The severity of the action depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the banking regulator must appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized. The federal banking agencies have specified by regulation the relevant capital level for each category. An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking agency. A bank holding company must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution meets its capital restoration plan, subject to various limitations. The controlling holding company&#8217;s obligation to fund a capital restoration plan is limited to the lesser of 5% of an undercapitalized subsidiary&#8217;s assets or the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business, except under an accepted capital restoration plan or with FDIC approval. The regulations also establish procedures for downgrading an institution and a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital.

&#160;

In February 2012, the Bank entered into the Consent Order with the Supervisory Authorities that provided that, within 90 days from the date of the order and during the life of the order, the Bank must have a leverage capital ratio equal to or greater than 8% of its total assets, and total risk-based capital equal to or greater than 11% of the Bank&#8217;s total risk-weighted assets. The MOU that replaced the Consent Order in November 2015 provides that the Bank must maintain a leverage capital ratio of at least 8% and a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 12%. At December 31, 2015, the Bank&#8217;s Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 12.85%, its total risk-based capital ratio was 14.02% and its leverage ratio was 9.33%. More information concerning our regulatory ratios at December 31, 2015 is included in Note 13 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

&#160;

Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates. Both the Company and the Bank are subject to the provisions of Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. Section 23A places limits on the amount of:

&#160;

&#183; A bank&#8217;s loans or extensions of credit, including purchases of assets subject to an agreement to repurchase, to affiliates; &#183; A bank&#8217;s investment in affiliates; &#183; Assets a bank may purchase from affiliates, except for real and personal property exempted by the Federal Reserve; &#183; The amount of loans or extensions of credit to third parties collateralized by the securities or debt obligations of affiliates; &#183; Transactions involving the borrowing or lending of securities and any derivative transaction that results in credit exposure to an affiliate; and &#183; A bank&#8217;s guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit issued on behalf of an affiliate. &#160;

The total amount of the above transactions is limited in amount, as to any one affiliate, to 10% of a bank&#8217;s capital and surplus and, as to all affiliates combined, to 20% of a bank&#8217;s capital and surplus. In addition to the limitation on the amount of these transactions, each of the above transactions must also meet specified collateral requirements. The Bank must also comply with other provisions designed to avoid acquiring low-quality assets from its affiliates.

&#160;

The Company and the Bank are also subject to the provisions of Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act which, among other things, prohibits an institution from engaging in the above transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the institution or its subsidiaries, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies.

&#160;

On September 30, 2010, the Company sold its headquarters building at the Watkins Centre to the Bank. This transaction allowed us to repay the outstanding mortgage loan on the building resulting in a reduction of our interest expense and improvement in earnings on a consolidated basis. The Federal Reserve Bank has determined that the sale of the headquarters building from the Company to the Bank was not permitted under Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act as the amount of the transaction exceeded 10% of the Bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus. As a result, the Federal Reserve Bank has directed the Company to take corrective action. The Company has taken and continues to take active steps to correct this violation including offering the building for sale. While the Company has not been successful in these efforts and continues to update the Federal Reserve Bank on such efforts, it is currently in negotiations with a serious buyer.

&#160;

The Bank is also subject to restrictions on extensions of credit to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders and their related interests. These extensions of credit (1) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties, and (2) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act also provides that an insured depository institution may not purchase an asset from, or sell an asset to a bank insider (or their related interests) unless (1) the transaction is conducted on market terms between the parties, and (2) if the proposed transaction represents more than 10% of the capital stock and surplus of the insured institution, it has been approved in advance by a majority of the institution&#8217;s non-interested directors.

&#160;

Support of Subsidiary Institutions . Under the Dodd-Frank Act, and previously under Federal Reserve policy, we are required to act as a source of financial strength for our bank subsidiary, Village Bank, and to commit resources to support the Bank. This support can be required at times when it would not be in the best interest of our shareholders or creditors to provide it. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, any commitment by us to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the Bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. On December 31, 2012, the Company made a capital contribution of $1,500,000 to the Bank to improve its capital ratios. In addition, on December 4, 2013, the Company raised $1,684,075 through the sale of 67,907 shares of its common stock to its board of directors and executive management team at a price of $24.80 per share in a private placement. The total amount raised was contributed to the Bank as additional capital.

&#160;

On March 27, 2015, the Company completed a rights offering to shareholders (the &#8220;Rights Offering&#8221;) and concurrent standby offering to Kenneth R. Lehman (the &#8220;Standby Offering&#8221;), in which the Company issued an aggregate of 1,051,866 shares of common stock (the total number of shares offered) at $13.87 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $14,589,381 (including the value of the Company&#8217;s preferred stock exchanged by Mr. Lehman for shares of common stock of $4,618,813). In connection with the Rights Offering, 283,293 shares were issued to shareholders upon exercise of their basic subscription rights and 191,773 shares were issued to shareholders upon exercise of their oversubscription privileges (approximately 36.9% of the total number of shares requested pursuant to oversubscription privileges). In connection with the Standby Offering, Mr. Lehman purchased an aggregate of 576,800 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock, 333,007 of which were issued in exchange for 9,023 shares of the Company&#8217;s preferred stock and 243,793 of which were purchased for cash. Also, as part of the Standby Offering, Mr. Lehman forgave $2,215,009 in accrued and unpaid dividends on the preferred stock. The Company made a capital contribution of $5,000,000 to the Bank from the cash proceeds of this offering.

&#160; 

Incentive Compensation Policies and Restrictions . In July 2010, the federal banking agencies issued guidance that applies to all banking organizations supervised by the agencies (thereby including both the Company and the Bank). Pursuant to the guidance, to be consistent with safety and soundness principles, a banking organization&#8217;s incentive compensation arrangements should: (1) provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward; (2) be compatible with effective controls and risk management; and (3) be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the banking organization&#8217;s board of directors. Monitoring methods and processes used by a banking organization should be commensurate with the size and complexity of the organization and its use of incentive compensation. At December 31, 2015, we had not been made aware of any instances of non-compliance with this guidance.

Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. In response to unprecedented market turmoil during the third quarter of 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (&#8220;EESA&#8221;) was enacted on October 3, 2008. EESA authorized the U.S. Treasury to provide up to $700 billion to support the financial services industry. Pursuant to the EESA, the U.S. Treasury was initially authorized to use $350 billion for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (&#8220;TARP&#8221;), of which the U.S. Treasury allocated $250 billion to the TARP Capital Purchase Program (the &#8220;TARP Program&#8221;).

&#160;

On May 1, 2009, the Company issued preferred stock and a warrant to purchase its common stock to the U.S. Treasury pursuant to the TARP Program. The amount of capital raised in that transaction was $14.7 million. Pursuant to the terms of the preferred stock, dividends may not be paid on common stock unless dividends have been paid on the preferred stock. The preferred stock does not have voting rights other than the right to vote as a class on the issuance of any preferred stock ranking senior, any change in its terms or any merger, exchange or similar transaction that would adversely affect its rights. Holders of the preferred stock also have the right to elect two directors if dividends have not been paid for six periods.

&#160;

The Company has deferred nineteen (19) dividend payments as of December 31, 2015, but holders of the preferred stock have never nominated directors to the board. The Company received notification on February 26, 2016 from the Reserve Bank approving the payment of all accrued and deferred interest payments on trust preferred securities as of March 15, 2016 bringing the Company current as of that date.

&#160;

In November 2013, the Company&#8217;s preferred stock was sold by the U.S. Treasury as part of its efforts to manage and recover its investments under the TARP Program. While the sale of the preferred stock to new owners did not result in any proceeds to the Company (nor did it change the Company&#8217;s capital position or accounting for these securities including accrual of dividends), it did eliminate certain restrictions put in place by the U.S. Treasury on TARP recipients.

&#160;

USA Patriot Act. The USA Patriot Act became effective on October 26, 2001 and provides for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering. Among other provisions, the USA Patriot Act permits financial institutions, upon providing notice to the United States Treasury, to share information with one another in order to better identify and report to the federal government activities that may involve money laundering or terrorists&#8217; activities. The USA Patriot Act is considered a significant banking law in terms of information disclosure regarding certain customer transactions. Certain provisions of the USA Patriot Act impose the obligation to establish anti-money laundering programs, including the development of a customer identification program, and the screening of all customers against any government lists of known or suspected terrorists. Although it does create a reporting obligation and compliance costs, the USA Patriot Act has not materially affected the Bank&#8217;s products, services or other business activities.

&#160; 

Reporting Terrorist Activities. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;), which is a division of the Department of the Treasury, is responsible for helping to insure that United States entities do not engage in transactions with &#8220;enemies&#8221; of the United States, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC has sent, and will send, our banking regulatory agencies lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts. If the Bank finds a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, it must freeze such account, file a suspicious activity report and notify the FBI. The Bank has appointed an OFAC compliance officer to oversee the inspection of its accounts and the filing of any notifications. The Bank actively checks high-risk OFAC areas such as new accounts, wire transfers and customer files. The Bank performs these checks utilizing software, which is updated each time a modification is made to the lists provided by OFAC and other agencies of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons.

&#160;

Other Safety and Soundness Regulations. There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on depository institutions by federal law and regulatory policy that are designed to reduce potential loss exposure to the depositors of such depository institutions and to the FDIC insurance funds in the event the depository institution becomes in danger of default or is in default. The Federal banking agencies also have broad powers under current Federal law to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems of insured depository institutions. The extent of these powers depends upon whether the institution in question is well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized, as defined by the law. Federal regulatory authorities also have broad enforcement powers over us, including the power to impose fines and other civil and criminal penalties, and to appoint a receiver in order to conserve the assets of any such institution for the benefit of depositors and other creditors. At December 31, 2015, Village Bank met the ratio requirements to be classified as a well capitalized financial institution.

&#160;

Loans-to-One Borrower. Under applicable laws and regulations the amount of loans and extensions of credit which may be extended by a bank to any one borrower, including related entities, generally may not exceed 15% of the sum of the capital, surplus, and loan loss reserve of the institution.

&#160;

Community Reinvestment. The requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) are applicable to the Company. The CRA imposes on financial institutions an affirmative and ongoing obligation to meet the credit needs of their local communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions. A financial institution&#8217;s efforts in meeting community credit needs currently are evaluated as part of the examination process pursuant to 12 assessment factors. These factors also are considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility.

&#160;

Volcker Rule . On December 10, 2013, five U.S. financial regulators, including the FDIC, adopted final rules implementing the Volcker Rule. The final rules prohibit banking entities from (1) engaging in short-term proprietary trading for their own accounts, and (2) having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds. The Volcker Rule is intended to provide greater clarity with respect to both the extent of those primary prohibitions and of the related exemptions and exclusions. The final rules were effective April 1, 2014, but the conformance period has been extended from its statutory end date of July 21, 2014 until July 21, 2016. We believe that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s financial condition or results of operations.

&#160;

Cybersecurity. In March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution&#8217;s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution&#8217;s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If the Company fails to observe the regulatory guidance, it could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. To date, we have not experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, but our systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat and it is possible that we could experience a significant event in the future. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers.
