 Item 1. Business 

Company Overview 

Synopsys, Inc. provides software, intellectual property, and services used by designers across the entire silicon to software spectrum, from engineers creating advanced semiconductors to software developers seeking to ensure the quality and security of their applications. We are a global leader in supplying the electronic design automation (EDA) software that engineers use to design and test integrated circuits (ICs), also known as chips. We also offer intellectual property (IP) products, which are pre-designed circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than design those circuits themselves. We provide software and hardware used to develop the electronic systems that incorporate chips and the software that runs on them. To complement these offerings, which are sold primarily to semiconductor and electronics companies, we provide technical services and support to help our customers develop advanced chips and electronic systems. We are also a leading provider of software tools that developers use to improve the quality and security of software code in a wide variety of industries, including electronics, financial services, energy, industrials, and automotive.

Background 

Recent years have seen a remarkable proliferation of consumer and wireless electronic products, particularly mobile devices. The growth of the Internet and cloud computing has provided people with new ways to create, store and share information. At the same time, the increasing use of electronics in cars, buildings, appliances and other consumer products is creating a connected landscape of &#8220;smart&#8221; devices. Many thousands of software applications (&#8220;apps&#8221;) have been developed to expand the potential of these connected devices. 

These developments have been fueled by innovation in the semiconductor and software industries. It is common for a single chip to combine many components (processor, communications, memory, custom logic, input/output) and embedded software into a single system-on-chip (SoC), necessitating highly complex chip designs. The most complex chips today contain more than a billion transistors. Transistors are the basic building blocks for ICs, each of which may have features that are less than 1/1,000th the diameter of a human hair. At such small dimensions, the wavelength of light itself can become an obstacle to production, proving too big to create such dense features and requiring creative and complicated new approaches from designers. Designers have turned to new manufacturing techniques to solve these problems, such as multiple-patterning lithography and FinFET transistors, which in turn have introduced new challenges to design and production. 

The popularity of mobile devices and other electronic products has increased demand for chips and systems with greater functionality and performance, reduced size, and lower power consumption. Our customers are the designers of these products and are facing intense pressure to deliver innovative products in shorter timeframes and at lower prices. In other words, innovation in chip and system design often hinges on providing products &#8220;better,&#8221; &#8220;sooner,&#8221; and &#8220;cheaper&#8221; than competitors. The designs of these chips and systems are extremely complex and necessitate state-of-the-art design solutions. 

A similar dynamic is at work in the software industry, where the pace of innovation often requires developers-also our customers-to deliver high-quality software, which can include millions of lines of code, in increasingly frequent 

release cycles. Bugs, defects, and security vulnerabilities in code can be difficult to detect and expensive to fix. But at a time when software is prevalent in many industries across a growing array of smart devices, it is crucial to have high-quality, secure code to ensure consumers&#8217; privacy and safety. 

Our Role-The Silicon to Software &#8482; &#32;Partner 

Synopsys' products and services enable innovators across a variety of markets-from mobile electronics and finance to medical, industrial, and automotive-to develop smart and secure products and applications. Across all industries, our customers face tremendous pressure to build differentiated chips and develop robust code more quickly and cost-effectively than ever before. With the increasing amount of embedded software in today&#8217;s devices, quality and security are top concerns. Synopsys technologies and services are designed to help our customers - both hardware designers and software developers - speed time to market, achieve the highest quality of results, mitigate risk, and maximize profitability. Our offerings span from silicon to software . 

The task of the chip and system designer is to determine how best to design, locate, and connect the building blocks of chips, and to verify that the resulting design behaves as intended and can be manufactured efficiently and cost-effectively. This task is a complex, multi-step process that is both expensive and time-consuming. We offer a wide range of products that help designers at different steps in the overall design process, both for the design of individual ICs (or chips) and for the design of larger systems. Our products can increase designer productivity and efficiency by automating tasks, keeping track of large amounts of design data, adding intelligence to the design process, facilitating reuse of past designs and reducing errors. Our IP products offer proven, high-quality pre-configured circuits that are ready-to-use in a chip design, saving customers time and enabling them to direct resources to features that differentiate their products. Our global service and support engineers also provide expert technical support and design assistance to our customers. 

The task of the software developer is to write code that not only accomplishes the developer's goal as efficiently as possible, but also runs securely and is free of errors. We offer products that can help developers write higher quality, more secure code by analyzing their code for quality defects and security vulnerabilities, adding intelligence and automation to the software testing process, and helping to eliminate quality and security defects in a systematic manner. To the extent that developers make use of third-party components in their code, our products can help developers better manage its composition and security. Our products enable software developers to catch flaws earlier in the development cycle, when they are less costly to fix.

We offer regularly scheduled public and private courses in a variety of locations worldwide, as well as online training (live or on-demand) through our Virtual Classrooms. 

Product Warranties 

We generally warrant our products to be free from defects in media and to substantially conform to material specifications for a period of 90 days for our software products and for up to 6 months for our hardware products. In many cases, we also provide our customers with limited indemnification with respect to claims that their use of our software products infringes on United States patents, copyrights, trademarks or trade secrets. We have not experienced material warranty or indemnity claims to date. 

Support for Industry Standards 

We actively create and support standards that help our EDA and IP customers increase productivity, facilitate efficient design flows, improve interoperability of tools from different vendors, and ensure connectivity, functionality and interoperability of IP building blocks. Standards in the electronic design industry can be established by formal accredited organizations, industry consortia, company licensing made available to all, de facto usage, or through open source licensing. 

Synopsys&#8217; EDA products support more than 35 standards, including the most commonly used hardware description languages: SystemVerilog, Verilog, VHDL, and SystemC &#174; &#32;language. Our products utilize numerous industry-standard data formats, application programming interfaces (APIs), and databases for the exchange of design data among our tools, other EDA vendors&#8217; products, and applications that customers develop internally. We also comply with a wide range of industry standards within our IP product family to ensure usability and interconnectivity. 

Our Software Integrity products support several existing and emerging industry standards for software coding and security such as the Motor Industry Software Reliability Association (MISRA) coding standards for the automotive industry. In addition, our products support multiple major programming languages-including Objective C, JavaScript, and security vulnerability coverage for C#-and are compatible with numerous common industry language compilers, development environments, and data and file formats. 

Sales, Distribution and Backlog 

Our EDA and IP customers are primarily semiconductor and electronics systems companies. The customers for our Software Integrity products include many of these companies as well as companies from a wider array of industries including electronics, financial services, energy, industrials, and automotive. We market our products and services principally through direct sales in the United States and principal foreign markets. We typically distribute our software products and documentation to customers electronically, but provide physical media (e.g., DVD-ROMs) when requested by the customer. 

We maintain sales and support centers throughout the United States. Outside the United States, we maintain sales, support, or service offices in Canada, multiple countries in Europe, Israel and multiple countries in Asia including Japan, China, Korea, and Taiwan. Our international headquarters are located in Dublin, Ireland. Our offices are further described under Part I, Item 2, Properties . 

In fiscal 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , an aggregate of 50% , 49% &#32;and 50% , respectively, of Synopsys&#8217; total revenue was derived from sales outside of the United States. Geographic revenue, which is based on where individual "seats" or licenses to our products are located, is shown below as a percentage of total revenue for the last three fiscal years. 

Additional information relating to domestic and foreign operations, including revenue and long-lived assets by geographic area, is contained in Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#32;in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . Risks related to our foreign operations are described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors . 

Our backlog was approximately $3.5 billion &#32;on October 31, 2016 , a slight decrease from backlog of $3.6 billion &#32;on October 31, 2015 , resulting primarily from the timing of large multi-year contract renewals. Backlog represents committed orders that are expected to be recognized as revenue over the following three years. We currently expect that $1.6 billion &#32;of our backlog will be recognized after fiscal 2017 . Backlog may not be a reliable predictor of our future sales as business conditions may change and technologies may evolve, and customers may seek to renegotiate their arrangements or may default on their payment obligations. For this and other reasons, we may not be able to recognize expected revenue from backlog when anticipated. 

Revenue attributable to each of our four product categories is shown below as a percentage of total revenue for the last three fiscal years. 

*Our IP, Systems and Software Integrity category was referred to as IP and Software Solutions in fiscal 2014. 

Aggregate revenue derived from Intel Corporation and its subsidiaries through multiple agreements accounted for 15.9% , 12.8% &#32;and 10.5% &#32;of our total revenue in fiscal 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue during such periods. 

Product Sales and Licensing Agreements 

We typically license our software to customers under non-exclusive license agreements that transfer title to the media only and restrict use of our software to specified purposes within specified geographical areas. The majority of our licenses are network licenses that allow a number of individual users to access the software on a defined network, including, in some cases, regional or global networks. License fees depend on the type of license, product mix and number of copies of each product licensed. 

Generally, we provide our customers the right to &#8220;re-mix&#8221; a portion of the software they initially licensed for other specified Synopsys products. For example, a customer may use our front-end design products for a portion of the license term and then exchange such products for back-end place-and-route software for the remainder of the term in order to complete the customer&#8217;s IC design. This practice helps ensure the customer&#8217;s access to the complete design flow needed to design their product. Offering remix rights to customers gives us an advantage over competitors who offer a narrower range of products because customers can obtain more of their design flow from a single vendor. At the same time-because in such cases the customer need not obtain a new license and pay an additional license fee for the use of the additional products-the use of these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual products separately without re-mix rights. 

We currently offer our software products under various license types: renewable TSLs, term licenses and perpetual licenses. For a full discussion of these licenses, see Part II, Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates &#32;and Results of Operations&#8212;Revenue Background . 

We typically license our DesignWare IP products under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific applications. Fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design basis plus, in some cases, royalties. Royalty arrangements are not material to our total revenue. 

Our hardware products, which principally consist of our prototyping and emulation systems, are either sold or leased to our customers. Hardware revenue is not material to our total revenue. 

Finally, our Global Technical Services team typically provides design consulting services to our customers under consulting agreements with statements of work specific to each project. 

Research and Development 

Our future performance depends in large part on our ability to further enhance and extend our design and verification platforms and to expand our IP, System-Level, Software Integrity, and Manufacturing product offerings. Research and development of existing and new products is primarily conducted within each product group. We also use targeted acquisitions to augment our own research and development efforts. 

Our research and development expenses were $856.7 million , $776.2 million &#32;and $718.8 million &#32;in fiscal 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. Our capitalized software development costs were approximately $4.1 million , $3.7 million &#32;and $3.6 million &#32;in fiscal 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

Competition 

The EDA industry is highly competitive. We compete against other EDA vendors and against our customers&#8217; own design tools and internal design capabilities. In general, we compete principally on technology leadership, product quality and features (including ease-of-use), license terms, price and payment terms, post-contract customer support, and interoperability with our own and other vendors&#8217; products. We also deliver a significant amount of engineering and design consulting for our products. No single factor drives an EDA customer&#8217;s buying decision, and we compete on all fronts to capture a higher portion of our customers&#8217; budgets. Our competitors include EDA vendors that offer varying ranges of products and services, such as Cadence Design Systems, Inc. and Mentor Graphics Corporation. We also compete with other EDA vendors, including new entrants to the marketplace, that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the IC design process, as well as with customers&#8217; internally developed design tools and capabilities. 

In the area of IP products, we compete against numerous other IP providers, including Cadence Design Systems, Inc., and our customers' internally developed IP. We generally compete on the basis of product quality and features, ease of integration with customer designs, compatibility with design tools, license terms, price and payment terms, and customer support. 

In the area of Software Integrity products, the market is still developing. We compete with numerous tool providers, some of which focus on specific aspects of software security or quality analysis, as well as with frequent new entrants, which include start-up companies and more established software companies. 

Proprietary Rights 

Synopsys primarily relies upon a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws and license and non-disclosure agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights. We have a diversified portfolio of more than 2,600 United States and foreign patents issued, and we will continue to pursue additional patents in the future. Our issued patents have expiration dates through 2035. Our patents primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. Our source code is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished copyrighted work. However, third parties may develop similar technology independently. In addition, effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries. While protecting our proprietary technology is important to our success, our business as a whole is not significantly dependent upon any single patent, copyright, trademark, or license. 

In many cases, under our customer agreements and other license agreements, we offer to indemnify our customers if the licensed products infringe on a third party&#8217;s intellectual property rights. As a result, we may from time to time need to defend claims that our customers&#8217; use of our products infringes on these third-party rights. 

We license software and other intellectual property from third parties, including, in several instances, for inclusion in our products. Risks related to our use of third-party technology are described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors .
