 ITEM 1: BUSINESS 

Washington REIT Overview 

Washington Real Estate Investment Trust (&#8220;Washington REIT&#8221;) is a self-administered equity real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;) successor to a trust organized in 1960. Our business consists of the ownership and operation of income-producing real property in the greater Washington metro region. We own a diversified portfolio of office buildings, multifamily buildings and retail centers. 

&#160; 

Our current strategy is to recycle legacy assets that lack the income growth potential we seek and to invest in high-quality assets with compelling value-add returns through redevelopment opportunities in our existing portfolio and acquisitions that meet our investment criteria. We focus on properties inside the Washington metro region&#8217;s Beltway, near major transportation nodes and in areas with strong employment drivers and superior growth demographics. We will seek to continue to upgrade our portfolio as opportunities arise, funding acquisitions with a combination of cash, equity, debt and proceeds from property sales. 

While we have historically focused most of our investments in the greater Washington metro region, in order to maximize acquisition opportunities we also may consider opportunities to replicate our Washington-focused approach in other geographic markets which meet the criteria described above. 

All of our officers and employees live and work in or near the greater Washington metro region. 

Our Regional Economy and Real Estate Markets 

The Washington metro region experienced strong job growth during 2015 with 68,500 net job additions, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Of this job growth, 38% was related to professional and business services compared to 15% in 2014. The private sector has been the primary source of the job growth, while employment related to the federal government has stabilized after several years of decline. Current estimates by Delta Associates / Transwestern Commercial Services (&#8220;Delta&#8221;), a national full service real estate firm that provides market research and evaluation services for commercial property, indicate that the region's unemployment rate was 4.3% as of October 2015, down from 4.7% in the prior year and lower than the national average of 5.0%. Delta expects the Washington metro region's strong job growth to continue in 2016, with expansion driven by the private sector. 

The Washington metro region's strong job growth generally resulted in modest improvements in the real estate market performance for each of our segments. Market statistics and information for the Washington metro region from Delta are set forth below:

(1) Net absorption is defined as the change in occupied, standing inventory from one year to the next. 

The small increase in direct vacancy rates is primarily due to new deliveries of office buildings and the direct vacancy rate in our region is well below the national average of 16.5%. Delta projects gradual improvement in office vacancy and effective rents during 2016 due to stronger demand for office space.

The multifamily real estate market remained steady during 2015 despite the large influx of new supply. Class A and B apartment deliveries are projected by Delta to increase to approximately 14,000 units in 2016. Delta expects strong demand to lead to higher rental rates in 2016 despite the new deliveries.

The retail real estate market in the Washington metro region continues to show steady, but modest, improvement. Delta projects continued improvement in 2016 due to low unemployment. 

Our Portfolio 

As of December 31, 2015 , we owned a diversified portfolio of 54 &#32;properties, totaling approximately 7.2 million &#32;square feet of commercial space and 3,258 &#32;residential units, and land held for development. These 54 &#32;properties consist of 25 &#32;office properties, 13 multifamily properties and 16 &#32;retail centers. The percentage of total real estate rental revenue by segment for the three years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , and the percent leased as of December 31, 2015 , were as follows:

On a combined basis, our commercial portfolio (i.e., our office and retail properties) was 93% &#32;leased at December 31, 2015 , 91% &#32;leased at December 31, 2014 &#32;and 92% &#32;leased at December 31, 2013 . 

Total real estate rental revenue from continuing operations for the each of the three years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;was $306.4 million , $288.6 million &#32;and $263.0 million , respectively. During the three years ended December 31, 2015 , we acquired two office properties, three multifamily properties (including a parcel for development) and one retail property, and substantially completed major construction activities at one multifamily development project and one office redevelopment project. During that same period, we sold our entire medical office segment, three office properties, two multifamily properties, one retail property, interests in land held for development and a parcel of land at a retail property.

According to Delta, the professional/business services and government sectors constituted over one third of payroll jobs in the Washington metro area at the end of 2015. Due to our geographic concentration in the Washington metro area, a significant amount of our tenants have historically been concentrated in the professional/business services and government sectors, although the exact amount will vary from time to time. As a result of this concentration, we are susceptible to business trends (both positive and negative) that affect the outlook for these sectors. In particular, a significant reduction in federal government spending could seriously impact these sectors. 

No single tenant accounted for more than 5% of real estate rental revenue in 2015 , 2014 &#32;or 2013 . All federal government tenants in the aggregate accounted for less than 1% of our 2015 &#32;real estate rental revenue. Federal government tenants include the Department of Defense, Social Security Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation and Office of Personnel Management. 

Our ten largest tenants, in terms of real estate rental revenue for 2015 , are as follows: 

1. 

World Bank 

2. 

Advisory Board Company 

3. 

Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. 

4. 

Squire Patton Boggs (USA) LLP 

5. 

Engility Corporation 

6. 

Hughes Hubbard &#38; Reed LLP 

7. 

Epstein, Becker &#38; Green, P.C. 

8. 

Morgan Stanley, Smith Barney 

9. 

General Services Administration 

10. 

SunTrust Bank 

We enter into arrangements from time to time by which various service providers conduct day-to-day property management and/or leasing activities at our properties. Bozzuto Management Company ("Bozzuto") began conducting property management and leasing services at our multifamily properties in the third quarter of 2014. Bozzuto provides such services under individual property management agreements for each property, each of which is separately terminable by us or Bozzuto. The fees charged by Bozzuto under each agreement are approximately 3% of revenues at the property. 

We expect to continue investing in additional income-producing properties through acquisitions, development and redevelopment. We invest in properties in which we believe we will be able to improve the operating results and increase the value of the property. Our properties typically compete for tenants with other properties throughout the respective areas in which they are located on the basis of location, quality and rental rates. 

We make capital improvements to our properties on an ongoing basis for the purpose of maintaining and increasing their value and income. Major improvements and/or renovations to the properties during the three years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;are discussed in Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, under the heading &#8220;Capital Improvements and Development Costs.&#8221; 

Further description of the property groups is contained in Item 2, Properties, Note 13, Segment Information and in Schedule III. Reference is also made to Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

On February 22, 2016, we had 174 employees including 99 persons engaged in property management functions and 75 persons engaged in corporate, financial, leasing, asset management and other functions. 

REIT Tax Status 

We believe that we qualify as a REIT under Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code and intend to continue to qualify as such. To maintain our status as a REIT, we are among other things required to distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains), to our shareholders on an annual basis. When selling a property, we generally have the option of (a) reinvesting the sales proceeds of property sold, in a way that allows us to defer recognition of some or all taxable gain realized on the sale, (b) distributing gains to the shareholders with no tax to us or (c) treating net long-term capital gains as having been distributed to our shareholders, paying the tax on the gain deemed distributed and allocating the tax paid as a credit to our shareholders. 

Generally, and subject to our ongoing qualification as a REIT, no provisions for income taxes are necessary except for taxes on undistributed taxable income and taxes on the income generated by our taxable REIT subsidiaries (&#8220;TRSs&#8221;). Our TRSs are subject to corporate federal, state and local income tax on their taxable income at regular statutory rates (see note 1 &#32;to the consolidated financial statements for further disclosure).
