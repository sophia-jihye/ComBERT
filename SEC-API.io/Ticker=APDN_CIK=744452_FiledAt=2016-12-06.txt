 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. &#160;

Overview 

&#160;

Using biotechnology as a forensic foundation, we create unique security solutions addressing the challenges of modern commerce. Whether for supply chain security, brand protection or law enforcement applications, it is our goal to help establish secure flourishing environments that foster quality, integrity and success. With secure taggants, high-resolution DNA authentication, and comprehensive reporting, our plant-based or other DNA technologies are designed to deliver what we believe to be the greatest levels of security, deterrence and legal recourse strength. We are also engaged in the large-scale production of specific DNA sequences using the polymerase chain reaction (&#34;PCR&#34;).

&#160;

SigNature &#174; DNA, the core of our technology platform, is nature&#8217;s ultimate means of authentication and supply chain security. Founded on plant-based DNA, our precision-engineered marks have not and, we believe, cannot be broken. The conventional process used to sequence (&#8220;decode&#8221;) native DNA is not possible with the engineered mark. Additional layers of protection and complexity are added to the mark in a proprietary manner. SigNature DNA can resist wash off, even in aggressive industrial treatment baths. SigNature DNA has proven highly resistant to UV radiation, heat, cold, vibration, abrasion and other extreme environments and conditions. We work closely with our customers to develop a solution that will be optimized to their specifications to deliver maximum impact. Our products and technology are protected by a robust portfolio of patents and trademarks.

Using our products and technology, manufacturers, brands, and other stakeholders can ensure authenticity and protect against diversion throughout a product&#8217;s journey from manufacturer to use.

&#160;

Corporate History 

&#160;

We are a Delaware corporation, which was initially organized in 1983 under the laws of the State of Florida as Datalink Systems, Inc. In 1998, we reincorporated in the State of Nevada, and in 2002, we changed our name to our current name, Applied DNA Sciences, Inc. In December 2008, we reincorporated from Nevada to the State of Delaware.

&#160;

Our corporate headquarters are at the Long Island High Technology Incubator at Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, New York, where we established laboratories for the manufacture of DNA markers and product prototypes, and DNA authentication. The address of our corporate headquarters is 50 Health Sciences Drive, Stony Brook, New York 11790, and our telephone number is (631) 240-8800. We maintain a website at www.adnas.com where general information about us is available. The information on, or that may be accessed through, our website is not incorporated by reference into and should not be considered a part of this report.

Industry Background 

&#160; 

Supply chain security 

&#160;

Supply chains are the systems used by companies to obtain products and services for resale, their own consumption or as a component in a product or service that they then resell. Supply chains often include the sourcing of raw materials, their processing in various stages to create products, and transportation and logistics to move goods both within the supply chain process and to the final consumer. Many different companies may be part of a supply chain, and often the owner of the supply chain has limited ability to oversee and supervise all components of its supply chain. Supply chain security refers to efforts to enhance the security of the supply chain. It combines traditional practices of supply chain management with the security requirements driven by threats such as terrorism, piracy and theft. We focus on one particular part of supply chain security, the substitution of specified inputs with something else, often a cheaper, inferior input. For example, a company might specify that sheets be made of high quality pima cotton but the company that wove the material for the sheets substituted cheaper and inferior upland cotton. We call a supply chain with such security problems a leaky supply chain. Leaky supply chains create significant and growing problems to companies in a wide range of industries as well as governments and individuals worldwide. Large retailers assemble sprawling networks of suppliers in developing countries to produce their goods at cheaper cost, underscoring the difficulties of policing a global supply chain. This is a global problem that only appears to be increasing. Leaky supply chains allow materials to become diluted, diverted or counterfeited, devaluing corporate reputations, potentially causing health and safety concerns, and hindering investment, and may cost hundreds of thousands of people their livelihood every year. In addition, a company with a leaky supply chain has essentially been cheated, since they paid a premium price for an inferior substitution.

&#160;

As more and more companies begin to address the problem of supply chain security, we expect that different systems will compete to be the leading standards by which products can be tracked across world markets. To insure only genuine products are entering the marketplace requires cutting edge technology. Historically, leaky supply chains and other types of fraud have been combated by embedding various authentication systems and rare and easily distinguishable materials into products, such as radio frequency identification (&#8220;RFID&#8221;) devices and holograms in packaging, integrated circuit chips and magnetic strips in automatic teller machine cards, banknote threads on currency, elemental taggants in explosives, and radioactivity and rare molecules in crude oil. We believe these techniques are effective but have generally been reverse-engineered and replicated which limit their usefulness as forensic methods for authentication of the sources of products and other items.

&#160;

Brand Protection 

&#160;

Establishing a strong brand is pivotal to business success, as it is how a company is perceived by the customer. We believe that protecting that brand is as important. Counterfeiting affects brands across the globe and effective brand protection strategy has become imperative for companies. Many customers do not even realize that they have a counterfeit product, attributing the poor quality to the brand thus tarnishing its name. A recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report (April 18, 2016) reiterates a number of trends that have been evident for more than a decade &#8211; virtually all brands are being counterfeited, and counterfeit and pirated products are originating from virtually all economies on all continents. Counterfeiters are improving their logistics networks, manipulating transit routes, exploiting governance gaps and taking advantage of the huge growth in online shopping, thereby underlining the need for secure supply chains to protect brands. Consumer safety and satisfaction, brand reputation and revenues can be adversely impacted by counterfeiting. Our SigNature DNA markers can be applied to many products, affording quick and definitive identification of authentic products, and aiding in brand protection efforts.

&#160; 

Law Enforcement Applications 

&#160;

Burglaries, car theft, cash-in-transit robberies&#8230; these are worldwide problems begging for a solution. The United States leads the world in the occurrence of home burglaries, with a burglary occurring about every 18 seconds in the U.S. (The SafeWise Report - September 13, 2016). Interpol reported that for the year ending December 31, 2015, they had received 7.4 million records of reported stolen motor vehicles from 126 different countries (Interpol &#8212; Database Statistics). According to the FBI, a motor vehicle was stolen in the United States every 46 seconds in 2014 and the value of the stolen motor vehicles was more than $4.5 billion. According to Plastics Today, automotive aftermarket parts are a huge business for counterfeiters, resulting in $9 billion annually in vehicle recalls. (Plastics Today, &#8220;Material taggants provide protection from counterfeiting of plastic products&#8221; (September 21, 2015)). These crimes have wide-ranging impacts, affecting law enforcement agencies, insurance companies, legislative bodies, and justice departments.

&#160;

Asset identification, management, protection and authentication solutions that deliver value to the customer are critical components of any successful theft deterrent program. In addition to tagging assets with a unique mark to prevent theft and facilitate return of stolen goods, it is imperative that would-be thieves know that the items are marked and that law enforcement is trained to properly identify recovered property. Forensic marking of home assets uses technology to code valuables at risk of theft to identify burglars, linking them directly with a crime scene. Over the years, authorities have found it difficult to obtain convictions of thieves in possession of suspected stolen property unless the true owner can be identified.

&#160; 

Products and Services 

&#160;

SigNature &#174; DNA, SigNature &#174; T DNA, fiberTyping &#174; , DNAnet &#174; , digitalDNA &#174; , SigNify&#8482; and Beacon&#8482; comprise our principal technology platform. The large-scale production of specific DNA sequences is used in the diagnostics and reagent industries.

&#160;

Signature DNA Markers 

&#160; 

SigNature DNA. SigNature DNA is our patented platform ingredient, at the core of all our security solutions. It provides forensic power and protection for a wide array of applications. Highly secure, robust and durable, SigNature DNA markers are an ingredient that can be used to fortify brand protection efforts; strengthen supply chain security; and mark, track and convict criminals. Custom DNA sequences can be embedded into a wide range of host carriers including ink, varnish, thread, laminates and metal coatings. SigNature DNA markers are resistant to heat, cold, vibration, abrasion, organic solvents, chemicals, UV radiation and other extreme environmental conditions, and so can be identified for numerous years after being embedded directly, or into media applied or attached to the item to be marked. Each individual marker is recorded and stored in a secure database so that we can later detect it using a simple spot test, or the marks can be forensically analyzed to obtain definitive proof of the presence or absence of a specific type of SigNature DNA marker (e.g., one designed to mark a particular product). Our in-lab forensic testing for authenticity results in an expert witness Certificate of DNA Authentication (CODA). Because DNA is one of the most dense information carriers known, only minute quantities of SigNature DNA are necessary for successful analysis and authentication. As a result, SigNature DNA can fold seamlessly into production and logistics workflows.

&#160;

SigNature DNA has been subjected to rigorous testing by the Idaho National Laboratory, a U.S. National Laboratory, by CALCE (the Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering), the largest electronic products and systems research center focused on electronics reliability, and by verified procedures in our laboratories. The forensic marker has passed all tests across a broad spectrum of materials and has met key military stability standards. SigNature DNA has passed a strenuous &#8220;red-team&#8221; vetting on behalf of the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency.

&#160;

Hundreds of millions of SigNature DNA markers now exist on items ranging from consumer product packaging to microcircuits; to our knowledge, none has ever been copied.

&#160;

SigNature T DNA and fiberTyping 

&#160; 

SigNature T. SigNature T DNA is a unique patent-pending tagging and authentication system specifically designed for textiles and apparel. Specially engineered to adhere tenaciously to any kind of textile substrate, including natural and synthetic fibers, SigNature T DNA markers are resistant to standard textile production conditions, and cannot be copied. The result: an enduring forensic identity marker that remains present from the fiber stage through to the finished product.

&#160;

This technology allows for better quality control and assurance at any point in the supply chain. Signature T DNA markers are used for brand protection efforts and raw material, source compliance programs. For example, cotton fibers can be tagged at source, verified as &#8220;American grown&#8221; and then traced through every step of the supply chain. 

&#160;

Our patented genotyping platform, known as &#8220;fiberTyping&#174;&#8221;, described below, complements tagging with SigNature T plant-based DNA. fiberTyping is employed to identify the genus and species of the fibers before or after they are tagged with SigNature T DNA. fiberTyping cannot be used to track a specific cotton batch through the supply chain, a function which can only be accomplished by our Signature T DNA system.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

fiberTyping. fiberTyping is not a marker, but a test of native cotton fiber, which gives a clear result that determines whether the intended cotton DNA is present in your fiber, yarn or fabric. Samples from the primary material are sent to our forensic labs for DNA analysis and authentication. Cotton classification and the authentication of cotton geographic origin are issues of global significance, important to brand owners and to governments that must regulate the international cotton trade. The use of DNA to identify the cotton fiber content of finished textiles is a significant opportunity for license holders to control their brand and for governments to improve their ability to enforce compliance with trade agreements between nations.

&#160;

In addition to the global cotton trade, the potential markets for genotyping include biotherapeutics, nutraceuticals, natural foods, wines and fermented alcohols and other natural textiles.

&#160;

We believe that our DNA extraction protocol and methodologies are more effective than existing forensic systems. We believe that the combination of our SigNatureT DNA and fiberTyping solutions cover the forensic authentication market for textiles and secure systems and protocols developed may be applicable to multiple industry verticals, and can mark and authenticate products at every stage of their life cycle, from beginning to end.

&#160;

DNAnet 

&#160; 

DNAnet. Recognizing that DNA-based evidence is the cornerstone of modern-era law enforcement, we have developed what we believe to be the ultimate crime fighting tools &#8211; currently being used in home asset and vehicle marking. DNAnet, a DNA marker can be used to definitively link evidence and offenders to specific crime scenes and help return stolen or lost property to its rightful owner. As the crime is investigated, the fluorescing DNA marker can assist police in linking the offender and stolen items to a specific crime scene, creating a greater ability to identify and convict.

&#160;

Beacon 

&#160; 

Beacon. Beacon&#174; locked optical markers deliver secure real-time inspection capabilities. A unique encrypted mechanism (patent-pending) creates a protected, covert screening tool that can be easily adapted to packaging, security labels and high&#8211;value assets through inks, varnishes and coatings. When Beacon locked optical markers are combined with SigNature DNA markers, a strong and flexible end-to-end security solution is created where authenticity and provenance can be determined with confidence.

&#160; 

SigNify 

&#160;

Developing a secure method for real-time, in-field screening of DNA-marked items has long been a priority for us. We believe that standard fluorophores, up-converting phosphors, holograms and other more-traditional screening tools provide little to no defense against counterfeiting. We believe that secure in-field inspection, backed with forensic-level DNA authentication is the key to maintaining a well-defended supply chain or asset management program.

&#160; 

SigNify. The SigNify&#8482; IF portable DNA reader provides definitive real-time authentication of SigNature DNA in the field&#8211; DNA becomes a true, front-line solution for supply chain integrity.

&#160; 

Information Technology Systems 

&#160; 

digitalDNA. digitalDNA is a software platform that enables customers to manage the security of company-marked goods from point of marking to point of authentication or validation to end of life. The base platform is configurable to customer requirements which differ by vertical market, company business process and IT environment. Basic functions offered include DNA inventory management, program training and communications, a database of marked items information, associated documents and images, chain of custody and location tracking, sample authentication processing and CODA downloads, and other administrative functions. Architected for either cloud or local operation, the system supports mobile data capture using bar codes or other technologies. Of special note is the power of embedding our proprietary DNA into tag ink or substrate as the forensic backstop for tags which can be easily copied. The system is architected as the controller and repository for other validation and authentication devices such as our SigNify DNA Readers, Multi-Mode Reader (prototype), DNA Transfer Systems, and other third party devices and is designed to share data with third party applications through standard interfaces.

&#160; 

DNA Transfer Systems. Our DNA Transfer Systems are developed for DNA marking applications which are high volume with a need for monitoring and control. They are computer-based, fully automated, offer remote internet access for real-time monitoring and can be configured for application-specific alerts and reporting online. They are used to mark cotton at all seven U.S. cotton gins in the 2016 season.

&#160;

&#160;

Large-scale production of specific DNA sequences using PCR. 

&#160;

Large-scale production of specific DNA sequences using PCR. Our Triathlon&#8482; PCR systems allow for the large-scale production of specific DNA sequences. The systems are self-contained and modular, can work together in mass production or can be used individually throughout the world, offering the advantage of delivering DNA locally and securely. These DNA sequences are being used by customers as a diagnostic and reagent and provide us the opportunity to cross-sell our DNA-based supply chain security solutions. A new capacity for us will be the ability to manufacture longer DNA sequences valuable in gene therapy, DNA vaccines and diagnostics. These types of DNA are distinct from our DNA security markers and represent a potential new entry into medical markets, where we believe there are opportunities for our broader platform.

&#160; 

Our Strategy 

&#160;

The core technologies of our business allow us to use plant-based, or other DNA sequences to mark objects in a unique manner that we believe cannot be replicated, and then identify these objects by detecting the absence or presence of the DNA. Our disruptive platform offers broad commercial relevance across many industry verticals. Our underlying strategy is to become a solutions provider in supply chains of process industries in which contracts are larger and of longer duration, where the benefits to customers and consumers are more significant, and where our forensic security offers a unique and protected value. Consumers, governments and companies are demanding details about the systems and sources that deliver their goods. They worry about quality, safety, ethics, and the environmental impact. Farsighted organizations are directly addressing new threats and opportunities presented by this question: Where do these goods come from? These are the questions and concerns we are beginning to address for a growing number of companies. We supply key building blocks for creating secure supply chains, which in turn can help ensure integrity in supply, honest claims, and ethical and sustainable sourcing.

&#160;

Our products and services are offered in the United States, Europe and Asia. At the present time, we are focusing our efforts on textile and apparel, microcircuits and other electronics, cash and valuables-in-transit, consumer asset marking, printing and packaging businesses and diagnostics and reagents. In the future, we plan to expand our focus to include pharmaceuticals, additional consumer products, food and beverage and agrochemicals. To date, the substantial portion of our revenues has been generated from sales of our SigNature DNA and SigNature T DNA, our principal supply chain security and product authentication solutions. We expect to continue to grow revenues from sales of our SigNature DNA, SigNature T DNA, DNAnet, digitalDNA, Beacon, and SigNify offerings, which all have various applications in supply chain security and product authentication, and we expect to continue to work with companies and governments to secure supply chains and restore confidence to products and product labeling throughout the world. In addition, we expect to grow revenues from the large-scale production of specific DNA sequences using our Triathlon&#8482; PCR system which have multiple applications including as a diagnostic and reagent and for gene therapy, DNA vaccines and diagnostics.

&#160;

Target Potential High-Volume Markets 

&#160; 

We will continue to focus our efforts on target vertical markets that are characterized by a high level of vulnerability to leaky supply chains, product diversion and a lack of security. We also intend to expand into additional related high volume markets.

&#160;

Pursue Strategic Acquisitions and Alliances 

&#160; 

We intend to pursue strategic acquisitions of companies and technologies that strengthen and complement our core technologies, improve our competitive positioning, allow us to penetrate new markets, and grow our customer base. We also intend to work in collaboration with potential strategic partners in order to continue to market and sell new product lines derived from, but not limited to, DNA technology.

&#160;

Present Markets: 

&#160; 

Textiles and Apparel 

&#160;

Cotton identity and the authentication of cotton geographic origin are issues of global significance, important to brand owners for quality assurance and compliance, and to governments that must regulate international cotton trade, enforcement of textile labeling, and protect consumers. We believe that our SigNature T DNA, fiberTyping and digitalDNA solutions could have significant potential applications for the enforcement of cotton trade quotas in the U.S. and across the globe, and for legislated quality improvement within the industry. We believe that our products and technology can also be helpful in assuring quality, traceability and economic investment of cotton and other textiles. We believe that similar issues face other natural fibers like wool, cashmere and leather, as well as man-made fiber, recycled polyester, viscose and other synthetic products and we have begun to introduce our textile solutions to these markets as well.

&#160; 

Our Market Response 

&#160;

Our SigNature T DNA supply chain program for DNA tagging and authentication of cotton fibers is currently in use by our customers. We are now tagging product in the United States to assure integrity of textile supply chains. Our SigNature T DNA commercial program involves the creation of unique SigNature T DNA molecular tags that can be used to tag a customer&#8217;s cotton fiber at the ginning stage. Installed in October 2016, our fully automated, secure DNA Transfer Systems allow for traceability and monitoring of all DNA-tagged cotton at multiple gins in Arkansas, Texas and California. DNA Transfer Systems allow for expansion of tagging at other gins to support increased demand for tagging in future years.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Once tagged, the cotton fiber, may be authenticated for textile identity from grower to ginner to spinner to manufacturer to distributor to retailer. At each step of the process, its textile identity will be tested to link the original cotton fiber to finished product, preserving the authenticity of the product and the integrity of the supply chain. SigNature T DNA tags are being used to mark premium Pima cotton fiber, known as PimaCott&#8482; and are also beginning to be used to mark Upland cotton, under the HomeGrown&#174; trademark. As the cotton ginning in the U.S. takes place sometime between September and December each year, it is possible that revenues from this business will be seasonal.

&#160;

In March 2014, we announced that we had entered into a mutual license agreement with Divatex Home Fashion, Inc. (&#8220;Divatex&#8221; now known as &#8220;Himatsingka America&#8221;), a leading supplier of home textiles, to commercialize what we believe to be the world&#8217;s first supply-chain-DNA-verified cotton product. Divatex is responsible for marketing, while we license our patented SigNature T DNA technology for application to ensure the veracity of the product. See also the information under the caption &#8220;&#8212;Distribution of our Products and Commercial Agreements&#8212;Himatsingka.&#8221; In June 2015, we announced that we had signed a memorandum of understanding with LD Commodities Cotton LLC, one of the world&#8217;s largest cotton merchandisers, to provide secure logistic supply chain support for the tagging and authentication of cotton fibers with SigNature T DNA derived from botanical genomes. SigNature T DNA concentrate has been shipped to mark over 190 million pounds of cotton to date.

&#160;

In January 2016, we signed a cooperative research and development agreement (&#8220;CRADA&#8221;) with USDA (&#8220;United States Department of Agriculture&#8221;) to collaborate on the development of assays for cultivars from specific geographic regions of the world. It is important to be able to differentiate cotton based on country of origin to help avoid &#8220;Conflict Cotton&#8221;, cotton grown using child labor or other undesirable practices. We believe this will assist the cotton industry in protecting the quality and traceability of the products and help protect their economic investments. 

&#160;

Microcircuits and other electronics 

&#160; 

The vast majority of counterfeits discovered in military equipment are semiconductors, the stamp-sized silicon wafers that act as the &#8220;brains&#8221; of nearly every type of modern electronic system. According to an article in DefenseOne (Counterfeits Can Kill U.S. Troops. So Why Isn&#8217;t Congress and DoD Doing More to Stop it? &#8212; August 8, 2013), the U.S. military is an important consumer of these tiny products; a single F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jet is controlled by more than 2,500 semiconductors.

&#160;

One of the reasons counterfeit microcircuits are a major concern in weapons procurement is because the chips, which control targeting accuracy and other critical parameters, can wreak havoc if they do not perform to specifications. They can also be a means of sabotaging weapon systems if covertly supplied by a hostile government through seemingly legitimate companies. 

&#160;

In a January 2013 report on a four-year study conducted between 2005 and 2008, the U.S. Department of Commerce revealed that 39% of 387 companies encountered counterfeit electronic components, microcircuits, or circuit boards. Some industry statistics even suggest that counterfeit parts account for 10% of all electronic equipment sold. In fact, counterfeiters are becoming far more adept at passing off bogus parts by leveraging the same sophisticated technologies that chip manufacturers use to produce authentic ones. (Embedded Intel Solutions &#8212; Counterfeit Parts are on the Rise).

&#160;

The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is the nation&#8217;s combat support agent for logistics. DLA obtains and supplies almost 100% of the consumable items for America&#8217;s Warfighters. The Agency manages over 5.1 million parts, supports more than 2,500 weapon systems, and accounts for nearly 85% of the spare parts for our military forces. DLA&#8217;s reach extends far beyond DoD. The Agency supports Foreign Military Sales (FMS) to more than 100 nations. DLA provides significant support to worldwide humanitarian relief, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and other federal, state, and local customers.

&#160;

The problem is not limited to the defense industry. Consumer and industrial businesses are losing approximately $250 billion each year because of counterfeit components. The automotive industry is also losing $3 billion in sales and the semiconductor business is taking a $75 billion hit due to counterfeit parts (National Technical Systems. &#8220;The Global Impact of Counterfeit Electronic Components&#8221; (August 2015)).

&#160; 

Our Market Response 

&#160;

On November 15, 2012, DLA began to require that defense contractors provide certain items that have been marked with DNA produced by us or our authorized licensees. This requirement has been in place for items falling within Federal Supply Class (FSC) 5962, Electronic Microcircuits, which have been determined to be at high risk for counterfeiting.

&#160;

Beginning on December 15, 2014, DLA&#8217;s Electronic Product Test Center (&#8220;PTC&#8221;) in Columbus, Ohio began DNA marking all FSC 5962 microcircuits. This change created a centralized, streamlined DNA marking process within DLA. On November 13, 2014, we were awarded a contract by DLA to provide DLA with SigNature DNA marks and related equipment, services and training and that contract was extended for one year through November 12, 2016. A follow-on one-year contract (plus one exercise year) to ensure there is no lapse in support of the current DNA program at DLA&#8217;s PTC was signed on October 14, 2016.

&#160;

The current program is more streamlined, with scaled-up processes, which has reduced certain costs by providing economies of scale, and benefits of marking technology geared to higher-volume operations. It is governed by a single direct contract with DLA. 

&#160;

In addition, in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, two contracts were completed: one for the Missile Defense Agency - Small Business Innovative Research (&#8220;SBIR&#8221;) &#8211; and one for the Office of the Secretary of Defense &#8211; Rapid Innovation Fund (&#8220;RIF&#8221;). The SBIR allowed for continuation of the effort focused on microcircuits and scale-up of the business model to support volume at the point of manufacture. The RIF expanded upon our DNA authentication program for FSC 5962 to identify authentic products and deter counterfeits from infiltrating DoD supply chains, by establishing a single authentication platform for the following six FSGs (as prioritized by DLA):

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

FSG 59 &#8211; Electrical and Electronic Equipment Components

&#160;

FSG 31 &#8211; Bearings

&#160;

FSG 25 &#8211; Vehicular Equipment Components

&#160;

FSG 29 &#8211; Engine Accessories

&#160;

FSG 47 &#8211; Pipe, Tubing, Hose, and Fittings

&#160;

FSG 53 &#8211; Hardware and Abrasives

&#160;

Together these contracts have strengthened our core capabilities to offer supply chain risk management solutions across an expanded range of critical components used in defense, industrial and consumer markets.

&#160;

Cash and Valuables-in-Transit 

&#160;

Cash-in-transit businesses transport and store cash and ATM cassettes. In the U.K. alone, there is an estimated &#163;500 billion being transported each year (approximately $755 billion as of December 2015) or &#163;1.4 billion per day (approximately $2.2 billion) (British Security Industry Association: &#8220;Combating Cash Delivery Crime&#8221;). The nature of this business makes cash-in-transit an attractive target for criminals and as a result the industry invests in excess of &#163;100 million (approximately $151.1 million) per year in security equipment and devices. Almost 25% of attacks in 2013 in the U.K. resulted in some kind of injury and the proportion of attacks where firearms were used has risen 4% from 2012 to 2013 (Professional Security Magazine Online, &#8220;Cash in Transit Attack Stats&#8221; (May 15, 2014)) making it more important than ever to be able to link the criminals to the crime. Since 2009, the number of CViT (Cash and Valuables in Transit) convictions attributed to the use of SigNature DNA in cash boxes has risen to 105, with prison sentences of almost 500 years. SigNature DNA forensic markers are helping the UK Police to identify stolen cash and to link the evidence directly to the perpetrators. According to the FBI, in 2015, more than $30 million was stolen and over 50 people were killed or injured in over 4,000 robberies of financial institutions across the nation (Bank Crime Statistics 2015 - FBI).

&#160; 

Our Market Response 

&#160;

We incorporate our SigNature DNA markers in cash degradation inks that are used in the cash-in-transit industry in countries throughout Europe. This solvent-based ink marks bank notes if the cash box is compromised and has the ability to penetrate the bank notes rapidly and permanently. We believe our SigNature DNA markers are more resilient and detectable than other competing technologies.

&#160;

In August 2015, we signed a five-year exclusivity agreement with Patronus Systems Ltd, a company based in West Sussex, U.K. Under the terms of the agreement, we will supply our SigNature&#174; DNA for use with Patronus Systems&#8217; new bonding agent for the cash handling industry. Patronus Systems will be adding SigNature DNA to every single ATM cassette / cash container to ensure recovered monies can be returned to owners and that law enforcement agencies have the forensic evidence to help them convict criminals.

&#160;

To date, the use of SigNature DNA in the cash handling industry has allowed our products to facilitate the convictions of more than 100 criminals in the U.K. involved in cash-in-transit crime with aggregate prison sentences of almost 500 years. SigNature DNA has been used since 2008 in Europe within the ink and / or smoke systems of Intelligent Bank Note Neutralisation Systems (&#8220;IBNS&#8221;), more commonly known as cash boxes and ATM cassettes. Unique, plant-based SigNature DNA markers are incorporated into each IBNS during manufacture.

&#160; 

Consumer Asset Marking 

&#160;

Car crime is a huge and profitable business, costing billions of dollars per year and representing approximately one third of all reported crime. It is estimated that approximately 70 percent of stolen cars are broken up and sold for spare parts, while the rest are given a false identity and sold, with many of those being exported to the Middle and Far East.

&#160;

Everyone has assets they want to look after - from household goods such as TVs, jewelry and antiques to office equipment including computers and laptops. There are a wide variety of valuable items that need to be uniquely identified and protected from theft. Forensic marking of home assets uses technology to code valuables at risk of theft to mark burglars, linking them directly with a crime scene.

&#160;

Over the years, authorities have found it difficult to obtain convictions of thieves in possession of suspected stolen property unless the true owner can be identified. If marked items are stolen and later found, police can link them directly with the crime scene, not only allowing the property to be returned to its owner, but also increasing the chance of convicting the thieves.

Our Market Response 

&#160;

We believe that DNAnet enhances law enforcement effectiveness by providing forensic quality evidence. The DNAnet Home Asset Marking program provides a simple and cost-effective way for residents to deter crime and protect their property, a way for law enforcement to identify the rightful owners of lost or stolen property, and a way to tell criminals&#8230;stay away because you will get caught! Consumers can purchase a marking kit and apply a DNAnet mark to multiple items of property. In the event of theft, police or personnel with ultraviolet light equipment can reveal the DNAnet mark, which thus permits the stolen property to be returned to the owner and serves as valuable evidence to increase the likelihood that perpetrators will be convicted.

&#160;

Our DNA marker is being used to protect two European automotive manufacturers against the theft of automotive parts imported into at least one E.U. country. New cars are marked with a unique code applied at point of delivery to the customer and customer details are registered on a secure database. The DNA marker provides absolute identification for the vehicle. The markers are covert and difficult to remove. If found, vehicles and their component parts are traceable back to their owner and location, from anywhere on the globe. If the car is stolen and recovered, police will be able to link the criminal to the crime, and will know exactly where to return the vehicle. Highly visible warning stickers are displayed on the windshield of the car, deterring theft in the first place. Since 85% of stolen cars are taken after theft of car keys, other kinds of crime, such as home burglaries, potentially also would be deterred. To date, over 10,000 high-end German-made cars have been marked with DNAnet.

&#160;

We are also working with the Swedish National Police and insurers, providing DNAnet property marking kits as part of a major initiative to reduce crime in targeted Swedish neighborhoods.

&#160;

Since program launch of the DNA Asset Security program in the U.S. in April, 2015, there are over 100 communities in 5 states participating in the DNA Asset Security program. This means that the police departments have been trained and equipped to identify marks on recovered property and have communicated their involvement to their community members. Since the implementation of this program, kit sales have been promoted by both the municipalities, local law enforcement agencies and the company to steadily increase the number of marked valuables in each of these communities. Some of these communities are also participating in signage programs alerting would be criminals that they are now entering DNA protected areas. We estimate that between US and International asset security efforts there have been over 30,000 individual DNAnet asset security kits purchased and distributed and there is now an estimated 1 million pieces of property worldwide marked with DNA from us. Recent property recoveries and associated criminal apprehensions and prosecutions in Sweden provide irrefutable evidence that the system, technology and process is indeed effective. 

&#160;

In addition to private individuals and households and municipalities and law enforcement agencies, we believe that a market opportunity may exist for our home asset marking and similar solutions using DNAnet with respect to small and medium-sized businesses, larger enterprises, home owner associations and insurance groups. 

&#160;

Printing and Packaging 

&#160;

The scourge of counterfeiting in packaging has greatly intensified in recent years. Counterfeiting has spiked, causing detrimental health concerns for consumers, safety concerns for law enforcement agencies, and financial concerns for businesses worldwide. As a result, the global anti-counterfeit packaging market is estimated to reach approximately $128.6 billion by the year 2019, according to MarketsandMarkets.

&#160;

Billions of dollars per year are at stake for companies as they seek ways to ensure that the products sold with their logos and branding are authorized and authentic. The proliferation of counterfeiting requires brand owners and their converter/printer partners to work together to create a multi-layered protection plan so that their packaging and labels protect their brands and deter those trying to profit at their (and their reputation&#8217;s) expense.

&#160;

Counterfeiters have become so good at their unlawful activity that spotting the difference between legitimate and counterfeit products can be daunting. They have many ways to subvert legitimate brands. They may take an out-of-date &#8212; but legitimate &#8212; product and sell it in packaging and labels that have been faked. Sometimes, everything &#8212; including the packaging, labels and product itself &#8212; is counterfeit. Criminals might also use legitimate packaging with knock-off products.

&#160; 

Our Market Response 

&#160;

Our integrated platform of forensic DNA taggants and optical and digital technologies offers a high level of security and flexibility in a cost-effective and easy-to-use format to suit the requirements and budget of most companies. They can be added to the varnish, ink or toner in labels and packaging to act as a trace without impacting the quality of the substrate. Our SigNify&#8482; reader or forensic laboratory process is required to detect DNA and verify that a label is authentic. Proprietary optical and digital technologies complement SigNature DNA with more rapid screening capability. 

&#160;

We certify our print and packaging resellers to assure end-users of quality, reliability and security in the use of our products. Our technology is currently being used on packaging of food products by Nissha. Nissha uses our DNA-based ink with its inkjet printing systems to help secure the fresh fish supply chain for the &#332;ita Fisheries Co-operative. The &#332;ita fish label is automatically linked to a central database that enables the food supplier, andretailer as well as the end consumer to verify the original product information at the point of sale. Products from Creative Labels have been used on industrial commodity packaging. A pilot with fruit labels has just been completed demonstrating forensic DNA labeling with optical features screened with our Multi-Mode Reader.

Diagnostics and Reagents 

&#160;

DNA-based diagnostics is an emerging application area in the in-vitro diagnostics industry. DNA&#8211;protein adducts are popular across the medical diagnostics industry, where these molecules aid in the determination of the incidence of a suspected disease caused by an organism or pathogen. Based on the amount of target DNA present, probes can be used either directly to detect target DNA, facilitate the performance of targeting proteins or indirectly to target DNA through amplification that creates a number of copies of a specific nucleotide. Increased automation of diagnostic tests, discovery of new diagnostic markets, rising investments in pharmaceutical and pharmacogenomics research, and advancements in DNA array technologies are major growth facilitators for the DNA probes-based diagnostic products market. 

&#160;

The report by Allied Market Research titled, &#34;DNA diagnostics Market (products, applications, techniques, end users and Geography) Global Size, Industry Analysis, Trends, Opportunities, Growth and Forecast, 2013 - 2020,&#34; indicates that the global DNA diagnostics market would reach $19 billion by 2020 registering a compound annual growth rate (&#8220;CAGR&#8221;) of 9.8% from 2014 to 2020. The potential to provide accurate diagnosis and cost effectiveness over alternative diagnostic techniques are factors that supplement the growth of the DNA diagnostics market. Recent figures suggest that globally, approximately 32.5 million people are living with cancer (as of 2012) with 14.5 million people in the US living with cancer (as of 2014) and 36.7 million with HIV/AIDS (as of 2015) (International Agency for Research on Cancer, Cancer Fact Sheets, All Cancers (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer), Estimated Incidence, Mortality and Prevalence Worldwide in 2012; World Health Organization, Global Health Observatory (GHO) Data, Cancer Facts and Figures 2016,amFAR).These numbers, we believe are set to increase consistently; however, advanced automated DNA diagnostics technologies such as next generation sequencing could play a crucial role in diagnosing and curbing these diseases.(Allied Market Research, &#8220;DNA Diagnostics Market is Expected to Reach $19 Billion by 2020&#8221; (August 28, 2014) )

DNA also plays a role in therapeutics such as gene therapy and DNA-based vaccines. Following our acquisition of substantially all the assets of Vandalia Research, Inc. in September 2015, we are able to produce specific, high-quality DNA sequences with the PCR production system known as Triathlon, which is well suited to meet these pharmaceutic and diagnostic needs. Cell-based DNA production methods are often complicated by impurities. In contrast, our PCR-based production method offers a high degree of purity and efficiency.

Future Markets: 

&#160; 

Agrochemicals 

&#160;

The agrochemical industry is faced with an increased prevalence of illegal trade, counterfeiting and brand piracy. From the adulteration and counterfeiting of leading herbicides, pesticides and fertilizers with inferior materials, to the substitution of genetically modified seeds with low yield alternatives, crops are at risk more than ever. These issues threaten company reputations, supply systems, export markets and government tax revenues.

&#160;

In Europe, Africa and other areas of the world, use of counterfeit and illegally traded pesticides is increasing. Untested and unregulated products may threaten the health of farmers and consumers and pose risks to the natural environment. Counterfeit pesticides threaten the integrity of those industries that depend on the benefits of pesticide use.

&#160;

Fighting counterfeit pesticides is a complex task. We believe that enforcement of regulations governing pesticide use is inadequate and has led in recent years to an increase in use of illegal, counterfeit pesticides.

&#160;

European Crop Protection Association statistics show that nearly 10% of the pesticides used in Europe are counterfeit and that their trafficking provides criminal organizations with an annual revenue of up to EUR 6 billion. According to a report by the European police cooperation body Europol, illegal products account for up to one quarter of all the crop protection products used in some Member States.

&#160;

According to research by International Growth Center (2015), the vast majority of fertilizer samples from the Uganda study were substandard. Additionally, very few of the allegedly improved seeds showed success in producing large crops. In short, the agricultural inputs sold at retail level in Uganda are often &#8216;fake&#8217; or of very poor quality. In the case of fertilizer, according to estimations by the Vietnam Fertilizer Association (2016), the country&#8217;s economy loses US$2 billion every year as a result of fake products. According to local market surveillance bodies, fake fertilizer manufacturers use many different techniques to cheat customers, including the use of formulas that differ from what is printed on the package and imitating established market brands.

Our Market Response 

&#160;

We have previously collaborated with a multinational company to SigNature DNA mark, protect and authenticate an agri-based product, and have completed a pilot program to authenticate the SigNature DNA marker in the product itself, as well as verify the SigNature DNA-marked product after it is applied onto crops in the field. The value to the customer for this application is to ensure the quality and authenticity of the product, to minimize the risk of liability that might occur if the product is not used in compliance with the license agreement that is linked to the product, and ultimately, to ensure that the integrity of the customer&#8217;s supply chain is preserved. We have activity with other multinational companies to develop DNA authentication programs for other fertilizers, herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and pesticides, although there can be no assurance that these activities will lead to full commercialization.

&#160; 

Pharmaceuticals 

&#160;

Mitigating supplier risk, compliance in global trade, diversion of medicines and counterfeits are global issues that affect all countries. These illegal activities continue to threaten the health and welfare of the citizens who receive fake or substandard product, as well as threaten the revenues and reputation of pharmaceutical companies.

&#160;

These activities also undermine the efforts of the government to ensure the availability of affordable drugs to its citizens, thus enabling the proliferation of disease, which can lead to development of drug resistant pathogens.

&#160;

The pharmaceutical industry also faces major problems relative to counterfeit, diluted, or falsely labeled drugs that make their way through healthcare systems worldwide, posing a health threat to patients and a financial threat to drug makers and distributors. Counterfeit prescription pharmaceuticals are a growing trend, widely recognized as a public health risk and a serious concern to public health officials, private companies, and consumers. The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy estimates that counterfeit drugs account for 1&#8211;2% of all drugs sold in the United States. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the annual worldwide &#8220;take&#8221; from counterfeit drugs to be &#163;13 billion (approximately $19.6 billion as of December 2015), a figure that is expected to double by the end of this decade. In some countries, counterfeit prescription drugs comprise as much as 70% of the drug supply and have been responsible for thousands of deaths in some of the world&#8217;s most impoverished nations, according to the WHO. The global pharmaceuticals and food anti-counterfeiting market is expected to reach $160 billion by 2020. (Radiant Insights, &#8220;Global Pharmaceuticals and Food Anti-Counterfeiting Market Is Expected to Reach USD 160.32 Billion by 2020&#8221; (September 28, 2015))

&#160;

In 2012, the WHO reported that in over 50% of cases, medicines purchased over the Internet from illegal sites that conceal their physical address have been found to be counterfeit (WHO: Medicines: Spurious/falsely-labelled/falsified/counterfeit (SFFC) medicines Fact Sheet June 2012). According to the WHO, counterfeiting can apply to both branded and generic products and counterfeit pharmaceuticals may include products with the correct ingredients but fake packaging, with the wrong ingredients, without active ingredients or with insufficient active ingredients.

&#160;

Based on this growing threat, many countries have started to address vulnerabilities in the supply chain by enacting legislation which, among other things, requires a comprehensive system, most often referred to as serialization or in the United States as Drug Supply Chain Security. 

&#160;

Nearly 40 percent of the drugs Americans take are made elsewhere, and about 80 percent of manufacturing sites of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) used in drugs manufactured in the United States are located outside our borders&#8212;in more than 150 countries, many with less sophisticated manufacturing and regulatory systems than our own. In addition to the sheer volume of imports and foreign facilities, there has been an increase in the variety of sources, shippers, methods of transportation, and supply chain complexity of products. Combined, these factors create great challenges to FDA and industry in ensuring that all drugs and drug components are high quality and travel safely throughout their complex supply chains. These factors also provide opportunities for criminals to adulterate drugs for economic or other malevolent reasons making it more important than ever that supply chains be secured around the world. (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, &#8220;Counterfeit Drugs: Fighting Illegal Supply Chains&#8221; (February 27, 2014))

&#160;

Drug supply chain security and serialization requirements affect all aspects of the pharmaceutical supply chain, starting with the manufacturer down through the packager, wholesaler, distributor and final dispensing entity. The laws provide an &#8216;audit trail&#8217; (or documented evidence) to help to identify and catch counterfeiting and diversion. Serialization requires manufacturers, or in some virtual supply chains third-party packagers, to establish and apply to the smallest saleable unit package or immediate container a &#8220;unique identification number.&#8221; In some cases, drug makers are spending as much as 8 to 10 percent of a medicine pack&#8217;s total production cost on solutions to protect it from duplication and counterfeiting, according to company executives (Business Standard (August 20, 2012)). 

&#160;

Our Market Response 

&#160;

In October 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;FDA&#8221;) published a Final Guidance document on the use of so called &#8220;Physico-Chemical Identifiers&#8221; (PCIDs). Accordingly, we believe that SigNature DNA is able to be used in drugs at levels of approximately 1 part per trillion (1 in 10 12 ); this level of SigNature DNA is less than 1/100,000th the level of DNA considered permissible as a contaminant in oral doses. Any PCID that satisfies the general principals established in the FDA Guidance is highly likely to be acceptable for any FDA regulated product, except for those subject to an FDA-approved New Drug Application. The FDA Guidance stipulates that a PCID should be pharmacologically inactive and present no risk of adverse reaction. The PCID cannot affect the efficacy of the drug. In addition, 11 categories of information about the PCID must be satisfactorily addressed. We believe SigNature DNA fulfilled all of these requirements, and is applicable to food and cosmetics.

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our unique DNA identifier mark-embedded in the ink of a unique serialized barcode can provide a layered security foundation for a customer solution in this market. Strengthening the bar codes to be utilized in the serialization process can be a potent approach to protecting the patient and bringing greater confidence to the brand of the pharmaceutical company.

&#160; 

Personal Care 

&#160;

Never has it been so important to know where cosmetic materials come from. In the fast-moving $197 plus billion global cosmetic industry, sustainable claims for materials has now moved on to origin of materials claims. Brands no longer want just good quality grape juice. They want quality juice from French Champagne grapes. The next trend entering the market will be Proof of Origin as regulators and consumer groups challenge brands asking for evidence.

&#160;

Personal Care is fashion led and fast to market. The industry prides itself in being an early adopter and adapter of the very latest technologies. For example, skin care brands took Botox, stem cell technology and peptide chemistry, out of medical laboratories and into the market place, by adapting their functions for the industry's own needs. Personal care brands are ravenous for the next high tech idea they can champion.

&#160;

Sustainability is a strong underlying theme driving personal care (Forum for The Future, 2015). For the past 10 years, multinationals have been embracing corporate social responsibility (CSR), endeavouring to become greener and reduce their negative impact on the planet. L'Or&#233;al, through its brand, The Body Shop, leads the way with Community Trade, where the people harvesting and processing ingredients benefit from sales, in return for their story . L'Or&#233;al has pledged to double the number of community traded materials from 19 to 40 communities by 2020 (Guardian, 2016). The trend of marketing products based on the source of their ingredients has gained greater market weight than the product's efficacy and now, the origin of materials has become the main reason for buying many personal care products. Personal care brands know millennials are twice as likely to purchase from a brand because of its genuine sustainability credentials (Morgan Stanley, 2015).

&#160;

At the In Cosmetics Formulation Summit on Protection in London in 2016, Jason Matthews (International Regulatory Affairs &#38; Scientific Director at The Body Shop) stressed how important it is for all brands to know, not just the source of materials but every step in their supply chains. He talked about slavery, pointing out that companies found to be using materials involving slavery are breaking the law in the UK and USA. He showed heart wrenching examples of inhumane practice such as the fire in 2012 at Ali Enterprises in India where barred windows and locked fire exits caused the death of 250 workers and the disaster in Bangladesh in 2013 when the poorly constructed Rana Plaza building collapsed killing over 1,137 workers. These workers were making clothing for U.S., Canadian and European clothing labels and retailers. He used these examples to emphasise to personal care brands, how they cannot afford to be associated with such disasters.

&#160;

Cosmetic brands rely on internal and external ethical auditing, often with certification, to manage their supply chains. The number of certification bodies is growing. It is no longer enough to talk about a company's good practice without supplying proof . Multinationals, their brands and their material suppliers therefore strive for ISO certification and most are also using materials certified by the expanding number of NGO auditing groups. Raw material suppliers and personal care manufacturers boast ISO 9001 quality management standards and many are obtaining ISO 26000, which provides guidance on how businesses and organizations can operate in a socially responsible way. Many brands demand that their products are made with palm oil from responsible sources, i.e. those with Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification and have their sustainable finished products certified by organisations such as Cradle to Cradle&#8482;. The personal care industry is not complacent and companies know improvements are needed. They are aware through scandals such as the recent discovery that beef in the UK foods was in fact horse meat, that even the best audited paper trail is vulnerable to abuse (Guardian, 2013).

&#160;

Also at the In Cosmetics Formulation Summit on Protection in London in 2016, Prof Monique Simmonds, Deputy director of Kew showed evidence of adulteration in botanical materials destined for health supplements and for personal care. Some of the materials they had removed from the supply chain were toxic and could have been lethal. Adulteration and counterfeit cosmetics continues to grow. Counterfeit make-up products containing over 200 times the safe level of lead, arsenic, mercury, copper and cadmium have been seized (Daily Mail, 2015). Because social media can quickly spread bad news to millions of consumers, distancing themselves from dangerous counterfeit products and so protecting brand integrity, has never been more important. Also, the trend in cosmetics is moving away from elitist prestige products and towards masstige and so increasing the opportunities for even more counterfeiting. Personal care brands also cannot afford the financial losses due to counterfeiting, which in the EU is estimated to be $4.7 billion/pa (OECD, 2016).

&#160;

Our Market Response 

&#160;

We believe that our Signature DNA markers and related technologies are the solution to the need to prove quickly the origin of materials when challenged. Signature DNA markers allow the whole supply chain to be followed as never before.

&#160;

Signature DNA is the next cutting-edge technology for the cosmetic industry to digest, adopt and adapt. SigNature DNA markers are safe, approved for cosmetic use and so can be included today in cosmetic grade raw materials and in finished personal care products, for traceability. Our laboratories at Stony Brook, NY have shown that prestige skin care products already contain far greater background DNA than we need for tracing. (Routinely, SigNature DNA is included at parts per trillion (0.001&#181;g/mg) and in the case of one skin care product, the background DNA content was 6&#181;g/mg of product). Because SigNature DNA markers are botanically derived and have no connection with genetically modified organisms (GMO) in any way, we believe they are perfect for personal care, even for natural brands. The latest advances in forensic science technology enable the presence of SigNature DNA markers in a material, to demonstrate in just tens of minutes even out in the field , making it an effective practical solution for large numbers of supply chain issues.

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our technology enables brands hungry for the next big trend, to now move on from sustainability to authenticity.

&#160; 

Personal care companies using our technologies in their supply chains will become the auditors and certifiers friend. Their paper trails of signatures supporting origin claims will now be supported by forensic proof. SigNature DNA markers from the raw materials will be present in the finished products, giving brands the weapon they need to respond to social media and to defend themselves from many of the consequences of counterfeiters.

&#160;

Food and Beverage 

&#160;

Each year, millions of people are deceived into buying counterfeited food and beverages, posing significant health and safety risks. Thousands of tons of fake and sub-standard food and drink were seized in 57 countries around the world as part of an INTERPOL-Europol coordinated operation. Operation Opson V, conducted from November 2015 through February 2016, resulted in the seizure of more than 11,000 tons of counterfeit and illicit food (Fortune &#8220;Largest Ever Bust of Counterfeit Foods Finds Gruesome Stuff Including Monkey Meat&#8221; April 8, 2016). The initiative, in its fifth year, brought in a record haul , seizing &#8220;foods&#8221; like monkey meat, locusts and caterpillars, as well as fake alcohol. 

&#160;

Counterfeit food threats are becoming more common as supply chains become more global and as imaging and manufacturing technology become more accessible. The distribution and selling of counterfeit foods is officially known as economically motivated adulteration (EMA), a subcategory of food fraud. EMA can be anything from altering the weight of the product by adding a lower quality ingredient to tampering with the product&#8217;s label. Diluting fruit juice with water, adding chemicals to boost the protein content of a food, and changing the expiration dates on meat labels are all good examples. These acts are illegal, of course, and potential health concerns, but the issue is widespread and hard for the government to control. In fact, according to the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention (USP), an estimated 7% of products in grocery stores nationwide contain fraudulent ingredients. There are numerous alarming examples of counterfeit foods that have been reported. For instance, long-grain rice is being labeled and sold as basmati rice, Spanish olive oil is being bottled and sold as Italian olive oil, and mixtures of industrial solvents and alcohol are being sold as vodka. In addition, herbal teas have been found to contain no herbs or tea and juices have been found to contain vegetable oil, which is used as a flame retardant, and labeled tuna turns out to be an unidentifiable concoction of random meats. The National Center for Food Protection and Defense (&#8220;NCFPD&#8221;) has estimated the annual impact to the food industry from fraud to be $10 billion to $15 billion annually&#8212; often due to product disguising the country of origin, substitution, dilution and false labeling (NCFPD, Amy Kircher, Economically Motivated Adulteration and FIDES (2012)). Globally, the anti-counterfeit packaging market accounted for &#160;$57.4 billion in 2013, which is forecast to generate revenue of &#160; $142.7 billion by 2020 at 13.9% CAGR from 2013-2020. (Allied Market Research, &#8220;Anti-Counterfeit Food Packaging Market is Expected to Reach $62.5 Billion, Globally by 2020&#8221; (May 28, 2015)). 

&#160; 

Our Market Response 

&#160;

We believe our SigNature DNA markers and authentication program can help in the battle against counterfeit foods and beverages. We operate under ISO 9001:2008 certification and provide botanical-DNA based security and authentication solutions that help protect brands and their supply-chains.

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

We have 12 employees engaged in sales and marketing, of which six are directly involved with sales. We expect to hire additional sales directors and/or consultants and increase our use of channel and strategic partners to assist us with sales and marketing efforts with respect to our target vertical markets.

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160;

Our research and development efforts are primarily focused on incorporating DNA into carriers (such as ink or textile treatments), and authenticating DNA from the marked substrates or the endogenous DNA both in our laboratories and with the development of infield DNA readers. As part of this effort, we typically conduct feasibility and pilot testing to ensure that DNA application methods are compatible with the customer&#8217;s manufacturing and logistic processes, and that they can be implemented in a cost effective manner. In some cases, the DNA application methods may undergo wash-out and/or adherence tests to ensure that DNA can be authenticated even if it is subjected to aggressive removal techniques. We are also actively involved in identifying new formulation development, and new application methods that provide even better adhesion of DNA to substrates, and more homogeneous distribution of the DNA onto the surface. In short, we have considerable experience working with a wide range of carriers and substrates, and authenticating them even years after they have been applied onto the surface. We believe that our continued development of new and enhanced technologies relating to our core business is essential to our future success. We incurred approximately $3.7 million and $2.6 million on research and development activities for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

On July 14, 2014, we were awarded a Phase II SBIR contract by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency to perform research and development for avoidance of counterfeit parts by expanding the scope and scale of our existing SigNature DNA &#174; technology platform established in its Phase I SBIR contract for Federal Supply Class 5962 electronic components, and by developing an optical reader. The contract provided for monthly payments to us totaling approximately $975,000 over a two-year period. This contract expired during July 2016.

&#160; 

Defense Contractor . On October 4, 2013, we, as seller, entered into a master option agreement with one of the four largest American defense contractors, as buyer (&#8220;Buyer&#8221;), and committed to supply one (1) unique SigNature DNA provenance mark for Buyer and SigNature DNA ink for marking up to 25,000 electronic components/year, upon Buyer&#8217;s request through the issuance of a purchase order. For the Buyer, the agreement is an enterprise-wide option to purchase. The term of the agreement commenced on October 3, 2013 and expires October 3, 2023. Buyer has engaged a third-party marker, which third-party marker is and must remain approved by us, to provide certain services to incorporate our ink onto certain electronic components of Buyer. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach that is uncured for 30 days. We have received from Buyer two purchase orders governed by these terms in the amount of an aggregate of $111,000 thus far. The agreement severely restricts publicity on behalf of both parties.

&#160;

Dreyfus. On May 30, 2015, we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (&#8220;MOU&#8221;) with LD Commodities Cotton LLC (&#8220;Dreyfus&#8221;) which operates under the trade name of Allenberg Cotton Co. The MOU provides for a two year exclusive worldwide license from us to Allenberg to manage the use of SigNature T DNA for the purpose of tagging cotton fiber and to ensure chain of custody of the baled DNA-tagged fiber. In consideration of the MOU, we agreed to only use Allenberg and its designated gins for the tagging of cotton fiber and Allenberg agreed not to use any other tagging technology for marking or authenticating cotton. Allenberg will collect a tagging fee on our behalf for each pound of SigNature T DNA-tagged cotton conditional upon its sale to its customers.

&#160;

&#160;

Himatsingka . On March 25, 2015, we entered into a mutual license agreement with Divatex Home Fashions, Inc., (currently operating as Himatsingka America, Inc.) (&#8220;Himatsingka&#8221;), a supplier of home textiles, to commercialize a supply-chain-DNA&#8211;verified cotton product. Himatsingka is responsible for marketing and we are responsible for licensing our SigNature T DNA technology for application to cotton at the ginning sites. Finished product made from this tagged fiber will be offered for sale under the PimaCott&#8482; content-branded label. The initial term of the license agreement is two (2) years. The term of the license agreement will automatically renew for additional one (1) year periods, unless the agreement is earlier terminated in accordance with its terms. We also have the right to terminate the license agreement if Himatsingka does not complete the cumulative sale of 45 million pounds of product by the second anniversary of the license agreement.

&#160;

We and Himatsingka have reached a confidential agreement on the amount of the licensing and related costs, which we bear, and the marketing and related costs, which Himatsingka bears, and an initial allocation of revenues (the &#8220;Revenue Sharing Model&#8221;). We collect the tagging fee from merchants and pay to Himatsingka its share of the tagging fee on a quarterly basis, based on when payments are received by us. Each party is entitled to be reimbursed for its respective agreed costs. The balance of the tagging fees received are to be divided equally between the parties, except for fees relating to the first 100 million pounds of cotton tagged, which will be distributed as set forth in the Revenue Sharing Model. On June 29, 2016, Himatsingka waived its portion of the tagging fee for up to $250,000.

&#160;

Customer Concentration 

&#160;

Our revenues earned from the sale of products and services for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 included an aggregate of 75% of our total revenues from three customers. These three customers accounted for approximately 20% of our total accounts receivable at September 30, 2016. Our revenues earned from sale of products and services for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015 included an aggregate of 79% from two customers of our total revenues. These two customers accounted for approximately 90% of our total accounts receivable at September 30, 2015. At September 30, 2016, one customer accounted for an aggregate of 78% of our total accounts receivable. Generally, our customers do not have an obligation to make purchases from us and may stop ordering our products and services or may terminate existing orders or contracts at any time with little or no financial penalty. The loss of any of our significant customers, any substantial decline in sales to these customers, or any significant change in the timing or volume of purchases by our customers, could result in lower revenues and could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.

&#160; 

Acquisitions 

&#160; 

Vandalia Asset Purchase 

&#160;

On September 11, 2015, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Asset Purchase Agreement&#8221;), with Vandalia Research, Inc. a West Virginia corporation (&#34;Vandalia&#34;), and Derek A. Gregg, Vandalia&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer and a director of Vandalia, providing for the purchase of substantially all the assets (&#8220;Assets&#8221;) of Vandalia. The Company completed the acquisition of such Assets on the same date (&#8220;Vandalia Asset Acquisition&#8221;). The purchase price for the Assets was $1,500,000, which amount was determined through arms-length negotiation. Of this amount, $500,000 was placed in an escrow account for a period of nine months following the closing to satisfy Vandalia&#8217;s indemnification obligations of which $350,000 was released to Vandalia after sixty days. On June 30, 2016, the Company received $50,000 of the remaining funds in escrow to satisfy indemnification obligations and the balance of $100,000 was released to Vandalia.

&#160;

The Vandalia Assets relate to the business of producing specific, high-quality DNA sequences with the PCR production system known as Triathlon&#8482;, including machinery, equipment, inventory, registered and other intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights and rights to software, and customer contracts. The Assets also include Vandalia&#8217;s rights under a patent license agreement between Marshall University Research Corporation (&#8220;Marshall&#8221;) and Vandalia pursuant to which we will pay to Marshall a royalty of one percent (1%) of the net revenues received by us from the sale of the licensed product. Vandalia and Derek Gregg agreed not to compete with us and not to solicit our employees or customers for a period of five (5) years following the closing. Derek Gregg also entered into a consulting agreement with us for a term of twelve (12) months subject to earlier termination by either party upon thirty (30) days&#8217; notice. Prior to the Vandalia Asset Acquisition, we were a customer of Vandalia, paying approximately $230,300 during fiscal 2014. The consulting agreement with Derek Gregg terminated on September 30, 2016.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The principal markets for our offerings are intensely competitive. We compete with many existing suppliers and new competitors continue to enter the market. Many of our competitors, both in the United States and elsewhere, are major pharmaceutical, chemical and biotechnology companies, or have strategic alliances with such companies, and many of them have substantially greater capital resources, marketing experience, research and development staff, and facilities than we do. Any of these companies could succeed in developing products that are more effective than the products that we have or may develop and may be more successful than us in producing and marketing their existing products. Some of our competitors that operate in the anti-counterfeiting and fraud prevention markets include: 3DTL Inc., Alp Vision Sa, Authentix Inc., Brandwatch Technologies, Chromologic LLC, Collectors Universe Inc., Collotype Labels International, Data Dot Technology, De La Rue Plc., Digimarc Corp., DNA Technologies, Inc., DuPont Authentication Systems, FractureCode Corporation, Haelixa, ICA Bremen GmbH, ID Global Solutions Corporation, IEHCorporationInformium AG,, Eastman Kodak Company, L-1 Identity Solutions Inc., opSec Security Group plc., MicroTagTemed Ltd., Nanotech Security Corp., Nokomis, Inc., ProoftagSAS, SafeTraces Inc., Selectamark Security Systems plc, Spectra Systems Corp., SmartWater Technology, Inc., Sun Chemical Corp, TraceTag International, TruTag Technologies Inc., and YottaMark Inc..

&#160;

&#160; 15 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Some examples of competing security products include:

&#160;

&#8226; fingerprint scanner (a system that scans fingerprints before granting access to secure information or facilities); &#160;

&#8226; voice recognition software (software that authenticates users based on individual vocal patterns); &#160;

&#8226; cornea scanner (a scanner that scans the iris of a user&#8217;s eye to compare with data in a computer database); &#160;

&#8226; face scanner (a scanning system that uses complex algorithms to distinguish one face from another); &#160;

&#8226; integrated circuit chip and magnetic strips (integrated circuit chips that receive and, if authentic, send a correct electric signal back to the reader, and magnetic strips that contain information, both of which are common components of debit and credit cards); &#160;

&#8226; optically variable microstructures (these include holograms, which display images in three dimensions and are generally difficult to reproduce using advanced color photocopiers and printing techniques, along with other devices with similar features); &#160;

&#8226; elemental taggants and fluorescence (elemental taggants are various unique substances that can be used to mark products and other items, are revealed by techniques such as x-ray fluorescence); and &#160;

&#8226; radioactivity and rare molecules (radioactive substances or rare molecules which are uncommon and readily detected). &#160;

We expect competition with our products and services to continue and intensify in the future. We believe competition in our principal markets is primarily driven by:

&#160;

&#8226; product performance, features and liability; &#160;

&#8226; price; &#160;

&#8226; timing of product introductions; &#160;

&#8226; ability to develop, maintain and protect proprietary products and technologies; &#160;

&#8226; sales and distribution capabilities; &#160;

&#8226; technical support and service; &#160;

&#8226; brand loyalty; &#160;

&#8226; applications support; and &#160;

&#8226; breadth of product line. &#160;

If a competitor develops superior technology or cost-effective alternatives to our products, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed.

&#160;

Proprietary Rights 

&#160;

We believe that our 41 patents, 83 patent applications, 37 registered trademarks, and 8 trademark applications, and our trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Our patents will expire at various times between 2021 and 2032. The duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.

&#160;

On May 31, 2016, 3SI granted a non-exclusive license to us to exploit, including the rights to have manufactured and have assembled and offer for sale, sell, market, advertise and distribute nucleic acid tags suitable for use in any product or system covered by one or more valid claims in any unexpired patents worldwide. On September 11, 2015, as part of the Vandalia Asset Acquisition, Marshall University Research Corporation consented to the assignment and transfer of Vandalia's exclusive worldwide right and license under Patents to manufacture, use, produce, sell and have sold, market and develop Licensed Products or derivatives therefrom to us. 

&#160;

However, there are events that are outside of our control that pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our products and services. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed. The efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we may choose not to protect certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the possibility that the scope of the protection gained from one of our issued patents will be insufficient or deemed invalid or unenforceable. We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. This secrecy could be compromised by third parties, or intentionally or accidentally by our employees, which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets.

&#160;

&#160; 16 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights is extensive in the biotechnology industry. In the event of an intellectual property dispute, we may be forced to litigate. This litigation could involve proceedings instituted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or the International Trade Commission, as well as proceedings brought directly by affected third parties. Intellectual property litigation can be extremely expensive, and these expenses, as well as the consequences should we not prevail, could seriously harm our business. If a third party claims an intellectual property right to technology we use, we might need to discontinue an important product or product line, alter our products and processes, pay license fees or cease our affected business activities. Although we might under these circumstances attempt to obtain a license to this intellectual property, we may not be able to do so on favorable terms, or at all.

&#160; 

Government Approvals 

&#160; 

We do not require any material governmental approvals to conduct our business as we currently do.

&#160; 

Impact of Government Regulation 

&#160; 

We and our products are subject to regulation by various U.S. federal regulatory agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission and are subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) concerning employee safety and health matters. Such regulations principally relate to the ingredients, labeling, packaging, advertising and marketing of our products. There are no significant capital expenditures for government regulation matters either planned in the current year or expected in the near future. 

&#160; 

Compliance with Environmental Law 

&#160; 

We believe that we are in compliance with all applicable environmental law.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

As of September 30, 2016 we had a total of 60 employees, consisting of 55 full-time and 5 part-time employees, including 4 in management, 9 in research and development, 1 in life sciences, 4 in forensics, 7 in quality assurance and compliance, 4 in finance and accounting, 10 in operations, 12 in sales and marketing, 1 in human resources, 2 in shared services, 4 in information services, 1 in investor relations, and 1 in product development. We expect to increase staffing dedicated to sales, research and development, manufacturing, and production. Expenses related to travel, marketing, salaries, and general overhead will be increased as necessary to support our growth in revenue. We anticipate that it may become desirable to add additional full and/or part time employees to discharge certain critical functions during the next 12 months. This projected increase in human capital is dependent upon our ability to generate revenues and obtain sources of funding. As we continue to expand, we will incur additional costs for human capital. Since June 2012, we have been working with Insperity Inc. to assist in managing many of our back-end administrative human resources, benefits, and payroll responsibilities. We are an at-will employer and generally do not enter into employment agreements requiring our employees to continue in our employment for any period of time, with the exception of our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. James A. Hayward. The initial term of Dr. Hayward&#8217;s current employment agreement is July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017, and this employment agreement automatically renews for one-year periods subject to ninety days&#8217; prior notice of non-renewal by Dr. Hayward or us any in accordance with the terms of the employment agreement.
