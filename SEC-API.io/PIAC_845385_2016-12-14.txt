 Item 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Except as otherwise indicated, the terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; and the &#8220;Company&#8221; refer to Princeton Capital Corporation; and &#8220;Princeton Investment Advisors&#8221; refers to our investment adviser Princeton Investment Advisors, LLC. 

&#160; 

Overview and Background 

&#160; 

Princeton Capital Corporation&#8217;s predecessor, was initially incorporated in Florida in 1959 as Electro-Mechanical Services, Inc. In 1998 it changed its name from Electro-Mechanical Services, Inc. to Regal One Corporation (&#8220;Regal One&#8221;). In 2005, the then board of directors of Regal One determined it would be in the best interest of shareholders to change the focus of Regal One&#8217;s operations to providing financial services through a network of advisors and professionals. 

&#160; 

On July 14, 2014, Regal One, the Company (then a wholly-owned subsidiary of Regal One), Capital Point Partners, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (&#8220;CPP&#8221;), and Capital Point Partners II, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (&#8220;CPPII&#8221; and, together with CPP, the &#8220;Partnerships&#8221;), entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;) pursuant to which we would acquire certain equity and debt investments of the Partnerships in exchange for shares of common stock. In addition to the customary conditions to closing the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, Regal One was required to (i) effect a reverse stock split of its then outstanding common stock at a ratio of 1-for-2, (ii) reincorporate from Florida to Maryland by merging with and into the Company with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the &#8220;Reincorporation&#8221;) and (iii) become an externally managed business development company (&#8220;BDC&#8221;) by entering into an external investment advisory agreement with Princeton Investment Advisors. 

&#160; 

On March 13, 2015, following the reverse stock split and the Reincorporation, we completed our previously announced acquisition in the approximate amounts of $11.2 million in cash, $43.5 million in equity &#38; debt investments, and $1.9 million in restricted cash escrow deposits of the Partnerships with an aggregate value of approximately $56.6 million and issued approximately 115.5 million shares of our common stock to the Partnerships. The shares issued were based on a pre-valuation presumed fair value of $60.9 million. We also entered into the investment advisory agreement (&#8220;Investment Advisory Agreement&#8221;) with Princeton Investment Advisors. 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end investment company that has elected to be treated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the &#8220;1940 Act&#8221;). We originate and invest primarily in private small and lower middle-market companies (typically those with less than $20.0 million of EBITDA) through first lien loans, second lien loans, unsecured loans, unitranche and mezzanine debt financing, often times with a corresponding equity investment. Our investment objective is to maximize the total return to our stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation through debt and related equity investments in private small and lower middle-market companies. We are managed by Princeton Investment Advisors and PCC Administrator LLC (the &#8220;Administrator&#8221;) provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. 

&#160; 

As a BDC, we must not acquire any assets other than &#8220;qualifying assets&#8221; specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in &#8220;eligible portfolio companies.&#8221; Under the relevant Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) rules, the term &#8220;eligible portfolio company&#8221; includes all private companies, companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, and certain public companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange and have a market capitalization of less than $250 million, in each case organized in the United States. 

&#160; 

Our investment objective is to maximize the total return to our stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation by:

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Investment Advisors&#8217; investment team that include long-standing relationships with private equity firms, commercial banks, investment banks and other financial services firms; &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; investing in what we believe to be companies with strong business fundamentals, generally within our core small and lower middle-market company focus; &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; focusing on a variety of industry sectors, including business services, energy, general industrial, government services, healthcare, software and specialty finance; &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; directly originating transactions rather than participating in broadly syndicated financings; &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; applying the disciplined underwriting standards that the Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; investment team has developed over their extensive investing careers; and &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; capitalizing upon the experience and resources of the Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; investment team to monitor our investments. &#160; 

As a BDC, we are required to comply with regulatory requirements, including limitations on our use of debt. We are permitted to, and expect to continue to, finance our investments through borrowings. However, as a BDC, we are only generally allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after such borrowing. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing, such as the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings, our ability to raise funds through the issuance of our securities and the risks of such borrowings within the context of our investment outlook. Ultimately, we only intend to use leverage if the expected returns from borrowing to make investments will exceed the cost of such borrowings. 

&#160; 

The Company will be taxed as a C corporation and subject to federal and state corporation income taxes for its 2015 and 2014 taxable years.

Our principal executive office is currently located at 700 Alexander Park, Suite 103, Princeton, NJ 08540, and our telephone number is (609) 514-9200.

Princeton Investment Advisors 

&#160; 

Since March 13, 2015, Princeton Investment Advisors manages our investment activities and is responsible for analyzing investment opportunities, conducting research and performing due diligence on potential investments, negotiating and structuring our investments, originating prospective investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. Princeton Investment Advisors is a newly formed investment advisory firm led by certain senior investment professionals of the advisor for the Partnerships. The senior investment professionals of Princeton Investment Advisors have an average of over twenty years of investing, corporate finance, restructuring, consulting and accounting experience and have worked together at several companies during their investing career. The Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; investment team has a wide range of experience in middle-market investing, including originating, structuring and managing loans and debt securities through market cycles. 

&#160; 

Princeton Investment Advisors is headquartered in Houston, Texas, with offices in Kingston, New Jersey. 

&#160; 

Market Opportunity 

&#160; 

We originate and invest primarily in private small and lower middle-market companies through first lien, second lien, unitranche and mezzanine debt financing, often times with a corresponding equity investment. We believe the environment for investing in small and lower middle-market companies is attractive for several reasons, including: 

&#160; 

Increased M&#38;A and Leveraged Buy-out Activity. We believe that large amounts of private equity capital raised over the past 5-7 years remain available for investment. We expect the large amount of uninvested 

&#160; 

- 2 -

&#160;

&#160; 

capital commitments will drive buyout activity over the next several years, which should, in turn, create lending opportunities for us. In addition to increased buyout activity, a high volume of senior secured and high yield debt was originated prior to the credit crisis from 2007 through 2009 and will come due in the near term and, accordingly, we believe that new financing opportunities will increase as many companies seek to refinance this indebtedness. 

&#160; 

Reduced Availability of Capital for Middle-Market Companies. We believe there are fewer providers of, and less capital available for financing to the small and lower middle-market companies we seek to make investments in, as a result of consolidation in the banking and asset management industry. We believe that many financing providers are constrained by their larger economies of scale and have chosen to focus on large, liquid corporate loans and managing capital markets transactions rather than lending to middle-market businesses. In addition, we believe recent regulatory changes, including the adoption of the Dodd-Frank Act and the introduction of new international capital and liquidity requirements under Basel III Accords, have disrupted their securitization activities, and forced a reduction of their loan portfolio and due to their refocusing on larger clients have caused them to curtail their lending to middle-market-companies. We also believe hedge funds and collateralized loan obligation managers are less likely to pursue investment opportunities in our target market because of reduced availability of funding for new investments. As a result, we believe that less competition will facilitate higher quality deal flow and allow for greater selectivity throughout the investment process. 

&#160; 

Attractive Deal Pricing and Structures. We believe that the pricing of middle-market debt investments in fundless equity sponsored transactions, which are more prevalent in our target market, is higher, and the terms of such investments are more conservative, compared to larger liquid, public debt financings, due to the more limited universe of lenders as well as the highly negotiated nature of these financings. These transactions tend to offer stronger covenant packages, higher interest rates, lower leverage levels and better call protection compared to larger financings. In addition, middle-market loans typically offer other investor protections such as default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions and information rights for lenders. 

&#160; 

Specialized Lending Requirements. Lending to small and lower middle-market companies requires in depth diligence, credit expertise, restructuring experience and active portfolio management. We believe that several factors render many U.S. financial institutions ill-suited to lend to small and lower middle-market companies. For example, based on the experience of Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; investment team, lending to small and lower middle-market companies in the United States (a) is generally more labor intensive than lending to larger companies due to the smaller size of each investment and the fragmented nature of the information available with respect to such companies, (b) requires specialized due diligence and underwriting capabilities, and (c) may also require more extensive ongoing monitoring by the lender. We believe that, through Princeton Investment Advisors, we have the experience and expertise to meet these specialized lending requirements. 

&#160; 

Competitive Strengths 

&#160; 

We believe that the following competitive strengths will allow us to achieve positive returns for our investors: 

&#160; 

Experienced Investment Team. Through our investment advisor, Princeton Investment Advisors, we have access to the experience and expertise of the Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; investment team, including its senior investment professionals who have an average of over twenty years of experience and have worked together at several companies. The Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; investment team has a wide range of experience in middle-market investing, including originating, structuring and managing loans and debt securities through market cycles. We believe the members of Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; investment team are proven and experienced, with extensive capabilities in leveraged credit investing, having participated in these markets for the predominant portion of their careers. We believe that the experience and demonstrated ability of the Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; investment team to complete transactions will enhance the quantity and quality of investment opportunities available to us. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Established, Rigorous Investment and Monitoring Process. The Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; investment team has developed an extensive review and credit analysis process over the past nine years with the advisor for the Partnerships. Each investment opportunity that is reviewed by Princeton Investment Advisors is brought through a structured, multi-stage approval process. Of the over 750 investment transactions reviewed by Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; investment professionals from 2006 through 2014, 13, or approximately 1.7%, were fully approved and the transactions consummated. Princeton Investment Advisors will take an active approach in monitoring all investments, including reviews of financial performance on at least a quarterly basis and regular discussions with management. Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; investment and monitoring process and the depth and experience of its investment team should allow it to conduct the type of due diligence and monitoring that enables it to identify and evaluate risks and opportunities. 

&#160; 

Ability to Structure Investments. Princeton Investment Advisors has the expertise and ability to structure investments across all levels of a company&#8217;s capital structure. The Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; investment team has collectively invested over $1.0 billion across the entire capital structure in numerous small and lower middle-market companies. These investments included secured and unsecured debt and related equity securities. Furthermore, we believe that current market conditions will allow us to structure attractively priced debt investments and may allow us to incorporate other return-enhancing mechanisms such as commitment fees, original issue discounts, early redemption premiums, payment-in-kind, or &#8220;PIK&#8221;, interest or some form of equity securities. 

&#160; 

Resources of Princeton Investment Advisors Platform. We have access to the resources and capabilities of Princeton Investment Advisors, which has seven investment professionals. These individuals have developed long-term relationships with small and lower middle-market companies, management teams, equity sponsors, lending institutions and deal intermediaries by providing flexible financing throughout the capital structure. The Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; investment team has completed several financing transactions with funded and fundless equity sponsors. In some cases, we have completed multiple financing transactions with those equity sponsors. We believe that these relationships will provide us with a competitive advantage in identifying investment opportunities in our target market. We also expect to benefit from Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; due diligence, credit analysis, origination and transaction execution experience and capabilities, including the support provided with respect to those functions by our network of third-party service professionals. 

&#160; 

Investment Strategy 

&#160; 

The Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; investment team will employ an opportunistic and flexible investing approach, combined with strong risk management processes, which we believe will yield a highly diversified portfolio across companies, industries, and investment types. We will seek direct origination opportunities of first lien, second lien, unitranche and mezzanine debt financing, often times with modest corresponding equity investments, in small and lower middle-market companies. We believe that businesses in this size range often have limited access to public financial markets, and will benefit from Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; reliable lending partnership. Many financing providers have chosen to focus on large corporate clients and managing capital markets transactions rather than lending to middle-market businesses. Further, many financial institutions and traditional lenders are faced with constrained balance sheets and are requiring existing borrowers to reduce leverage. We also believe hedge funds and collateralized debt obligation/collateralized loan obligation managers are less likely to pursue investment opportunities in our target market as a result of reduced liquidity for new investments. 

&#160; 

With an average of over twenty years of investing, corporate finance, restructuring, consulting and accounting experience, the senior investment team of Princeton Investment Advisors has demonstrated investment expertise throughout the balance sheet and in a variety of situations, including financial sponsor buyouts, growth capital, debt refinancings, balance sheet recapitalizations, rescue financings, distressed opportunities, and acquisition financings. Our investment philosophy emphasizes capital preservation through superior credit selection and risk mitigation. We expect our targeted portfolio to provide downside protection through conservative cash flow and asset coverage requirements, priority in the capital structure and information requirements. We also anticipate benefiting from equity participation through warrants and other equity instruments structured as part of our investments. This flexible approach enables Princeton Investment Advisors to respond to market conditions and offer customized lending solutions. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Princeton Investment Advisors invests across a wide range of industries with deep expertise in select verticals including, but not limited to, business services, energy, general industrial, government services, healthcare software and specialty finance. We will seek to maintain a diversified portfolio of investments as a method to manage risk and capitalize on specific sector trends. Our objective is to act as the lead or largest investor in transactions, generally investing between $1.0 million and $5.0 million per transaction. We expect the average investment holding period to be between three and five years, depending upon portfolio company objectives and conditions in the capital markets. 

&#160; 

We expect to focus on small and lower middle-market companies with less than $20.0 million of EBITDA in a variety of industry sectors with positive long-term dynamics and dependable cash flows. We will seek businesses with management teams with demonstrated track records and economic incentives in strong franchises and sustainable competitive advantages with dependable and predictable cash flows. 

&#160; 

We intend to employ leverage prudently and within the limitations of the applicable laws and regulations for a BDC. Any decision on our part to use leverage will depend upon our assessment of the attractiveness of available investment opportunities in relation to the costs and perceived risks of such leverage. 

&#160; 

Transaction Sourcing 

&#160; 

As access to investment opportunities is highly relationship driven, the senior investment team and other investment professionals of Princeton Investment Advisors spend considerable time developing and maintaining contacts with key deal sources, including private equity firms, investment banks, and senior lenders. The senior investment team and other investment professionals of Princeton Investment Advisors have been actively investing in the middle-market sector for the past decade and have focused on extensive calling and marketing efforts via speaking engagements, sponsorships, industry events, and referrals to broaden their relationship network. Existing relationships are constantly cultivated through transactional work and other personal contacts. 

&#160; 

In addition to financial sponsors, Princeton Investment Advisors has developed a network of other deal sources, including: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; management teams and entrepreneurs; &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; portfolio companies of private equity firms; &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; other investment firms that have strategies similar to Princeton Investment Advisors and are seeking co-investors; &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; placement agents and investment banks representing financial sponsors and issuers; &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; corporate operating advisors and other financial advisors; and &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; consultants, attorneys and other service providers to small and lower middle-market companies and financial sponsors. &#160; 

We believe that Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; broad network of deal origination contacts will afford us with a continuous source of investment opportunities. 

&#160; 

These origination relationships provide access not only to potential investment opportunities but also to market intelligence on trends across the credit markets. Princeton Investment Advisors has completed several financing transactions with funded and fundless equity sponsors. In some cases, affiliates of Princeton Investment Advisors have completed multiple financing transactions with those equity sponsors. 

&#160; 

We believe that over the past decade, the senior investment team and other investment professionals of Princeton Investment Advisors have built a reputation as a thoughtful and disciplined provider of capital to small and lower middle-market companies and a preferred financing source for private equity sponsors and management teams. We 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

believe these factors give Princeton Investment Advisors a competitive advantage in sourcing investment opportunities, which will be put to use for our benefit. 

&#160; 

Investment Structuring 

&#160; 

Princeton Investment Advisors believes that each investment has unique characteristics that must be considered, understood and analyzed. Princeton Investment Advisors structures investment terms based on the business, credit profile, the outlook for the industry in which a potential portfolio company operates, the competitive landscape, the products or services which the company sells and the management team and ownership of the company, among other factors. Princeton Investment Advisors will rely upon the analysis conducted and information gathered through the investment process to evaluate the appropriate structure for our investments. 

&#160; 

We invest primarily in the debt securities of small and lower middle-market companies. Our investments will typically carry a high level of cash pay interest and may incorporate other return-enhancing mechanisms such as commitment fees, original issue discounts, early redemption premiums, PIK interest and some form of equity participation, including preferred stock, common stock, warrants and other forms of equity participation. We expect that a typical debt investment in which we invest will have a maturity of between three and five years. We expect to hold most of our investments to maturity or repayment, but we may sell some of our investments earlier if a liquidity event occurs, such as a sale, recapitalization or worsening of the credit quality of the portfolio company. 

&#160; 

Princeton Investment Advisors negotiates covenants in connection with debt investments that provide protection for us but allow appropriate flexibility for the portfolio company. Such covenants may include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection and change of control provisions. Princeton Investment Advisors will require comprehensive information rights including access to management, financial statements and budgets and, in some cases, membership on the board of directors or board of directors observation rights. Additionally, Princeton Investment Advisors will generally require financial covenants and terms that restrict an issuers use of leverage and limitations on asset sales and capital expenditures. 

&#160; 

Secured Debt 

&#160; 

Secured debt, including first lien, second lien and unitranche financing, will have liens on the assets of the borrower that will serve as collateral in support of the repayment of such loans. 

&#160; 

First Lien Debt . First lien debt will be structured with first-priority liens on the assets of the borrower that will serve as collateral in support of the repayment of such loans. First lien loans may provide for moderate loan amortization in the early years of the loan, with the majority of the amortization deferred until loan maturity. Under market conditions as of the date of this filing, we expect that the interest rate on senior secured loans will range between 5% and 8% over applicable LIBOR. 

&#160; 

Second Lien Debt . Second lien debt will be structured as junior, secured loans, with second priority liens on an issuer&#8217;s assets. These loans typically provide for moderate loan amortization in the initial years of the loan, with the majority of the amortization deferred until loan maturity. Under market conditions as of the date of this filing, we expect that the interest rate on second lien loans will generally range between 8% and 12% over applicable LIBOR. 

&#160; 

Unitranche Debt . Unitranche debt typically will be structured as first lien loans with certain risk characteristics of mezzanine debt. Unitranche debt typically provides for moderate loan amortization in the initial years of the debt, with the majority of the principal payment deferred until loan maturity. Since unitranche debt generally allows the borrower to make a large lump sum payment of principal at the end of the loan term, there is a risk of loss if the borrower is unable to pay the lump sum or refinance the amount owed at maturity. In some cases, we will be the sole lender, or we together with our affiliates will be the sole lender, of unitranche debt, which can provide us with more influence interacting with a borrower in terms of monitoring and, if necessary, remediation in the event of underperformance. Under market conditions as of the date of this filing, we expect that the interest rate on unitranche debt will range between 8% and 12% over applicable LIBOR. 

&#160; 

- 6 -

&#160;

&#160; 

Mezzanine Debt 

&#160; 

Mezzanine debt, including senior unsecured and subordinated loans, will not be secured by any collateral and will be effectively subordinated to the borrower&#8217;s secured indebtedness (to the extent of the collateral securing such indebtedness), including pursuant to one or more intercreditor agreements that we enter into with holders of a borrower&#8217;s senior debt. Under market conditions as of the date of this filing, we expect the interest rate on mezzanine debt will generally range between 12% and 16%. 

&#160; 

Senior Unsecured Loans . Senior unsecured loans will be structured as loans that rank senior in right of payment to any of the borrower&#8217;s unsecured indebtedness that is contractually subordinated to such loans. These loans generally provide for fixed interest rates and amortize evenly over the term of the loan. Senior unsecured loans are generally less volatile than subordinated loans due to their priority to creditors over subordinated loans. Under market conditions as of the date of this filing, we expect the interest rate on senior unsecured loans will generally range between 10% and 14%. 

&#160; 

Subordinated Loans . Subordinated loans will be structured as unsecured, subordinated loans that provide for relatively high, fixed interest rates that provide us with significant current interest income. These loans typically will have interest-only payments (often representing a combination of cash pay and PIK interest) in the early years, with amortization of principal deferred to maturity. Subordinated loans generally allow the borrower to make a large lump sum payment of principal at the end of the loan term, and there is a risk of loss if the borrower is unable to pay the lump sum or refinance the amount owed at maturity. Subordinated loans are generally more volatile than secured loans and may involve a greater risk of loss of principal. Subordinated loans often include a PIK feature, which effectively operates as negative amortization of loan principal, thereby increasing credit risk exposure over the life of the loan. Under market conditions as of the date of this filing, we expect the interest rate on subordinated loans will generally range between 11% and 17%. 

&#160; 

Equity Securities 

&#160; 

In connection with some of our debt investments, we will also invest in preferred or common stock or receive nominally priced warrants or options to buy an equity interest in the portfolio company. As a result, as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from this equity interest. We may structure such equity investments and warrants to include provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as a &#8220;put,&#8221; or right to sell such securities back to the issuer, upon the occurrence of specified events. In many cases, we may also seek to obtain registration rights in connection with these equity interests, which may include demand and &#8220;piggyback&#8221; registration rights. 

&#160; 

Invested Industries 

&#160; 

We invest in portfolio companies in a variety of different industries where some aspect of tangible or intangible assets are available for collateral protection. Our portfolio contains investments in the Casual Dining, Business Services, Manufacturing, Energy Services, Nickel Pipe, Fittings and Flanges to the Specialty Chemical Industry and Real Estate industries as well as others. However, these industries are not our only focus and we seek investments across a broad range of industries to diversify the portfolio and minimize risk within any specific industry. As of December 31, 2015, our three largest industry concentrations as a percentage of net assets has been 21.52% in Casual Dining, 19.09% in Nickel Pipe, Fittings and Flanges to the Specialty Chemical Industry and 16.75% in Real Estate Development. 

&#160; 

Investment Process 

&#160; 

Through the resources of Princeton Investment Advisors, we have access to significant research resources, experienced investment professionals, internal information systems and a credit analysis framework and investment process. Princeton Investment Advisors has designed a highly involved and interactive investment management process, which is the core of its culture and the basis for what we believe is a strong track record of investment returns. The investment process seeks to select only those investments which it believes have the most attractive risk/reward characteristics. The process involves several levels of review and is coordinated in an effort to identify risks in potential investments. Princeton Investment Advisors will apply its expertise to screen many of our investment opportunities as described below. This rigorous process combined with our broad origination capabilities have allowed the Princeton Investment Advisors team to be prudent in selecting opportunities in which to make an investment. From 

&#160; 

- 7 -

&#160;

&#160; 

2006 through 2014, the Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; team reviewed over 750 transactions, which resulted in 13 investments, or approximately 1.7% of total investments reviewed. 

&#160; 

All potential investment opportunities undergo an initial informal review by Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; investment professionals. Each potential investment opportunity that an investment professional determines merits investment consideration will be presented and evaluated at a weekly meeting in which Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; investment professionals discuss the merits and risks of a potential investment opportunity as well as the due diligence process and the pricing and structure. If Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; investment professionals believe an investment opportunity merits further review, the deal team will prepare and present to the investment committee for initial review a prescreen memorandum that generally describes the potential transaction and includes a description of the risks, due diligence process and proposed structure and pricing for the proposed investment opportunity. 

&#160; 

Prior to making an investment, Princeton Investment Advisors conducts a rigorous diligence on each investment opportunity. In connection with its due diligence on a potential investment opportunity, Princeton Investment Advisors utilizes its internal diligence resources which include its internally developed credit analytical framework, subscriptions to third party research resources, discussions with industry experts, internal information sharing systems, and the analytical expertise of its investment professionals. Princeton Investment Advisors will typically review the company&#8217;s historical financials; industry drivers and outlook, competitive threats, customer concentration, asset coverage, projected financials, and credit metrics; management background checks; and, if applicable, the track record and funding capabilities of the private equity sponsor. 

&#160; 

Upon review of the prescreen memorandum, if the investment committee determines to proceed with the review of an investment opportunity, the deal team will continue its diligence and deal structuring plans, and prepare a credit approval memorandum for review by the investment committee. The credit approval memorandum, updates the prescreen memorandum with more deal specific detail, including an update to the diligence process and any changes in the structure and pricing of the proposed investment. Upon unanimous approval by the investment committee of the proposed investment as presented in the credit approval memorandum, the Chief Investment Officer will review any amendments before finalizing and closing negotiations with the prospective portfolio company. 

&#160; 

Investment Committee 

&#160; 

Each new investment opportunity is unanimously approved by Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; investment committee. Follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies will require the investment committee&#8217;s approval beyond that obtained when the initial investment in the company was made. In addition, temporary investments, such as those in cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less, may require approval by the investment committee. The purpose of Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; investment committee, which is provided under the Investment Advisory Agreement, is to evaluate and approve all of our investments, subject at all times to the oversight and approval of our board of directors. The investment committee process is intended to bring the diverse experience and perspectives of the committee&#8217;s members to the analysis and consideration of each investment. As of December 31, 2015, the investment committee consisted of Alfred Jackson and Munish Sood. Refer to Note 11 in the Notes to financial statements for further information. The investment committee serves to provide investment consistency and adherence to our core investment philosophy and policies. The investment committee also determines appropriate investment sizing and suggests ongoing monitoring requirements. 

&#160; 

In addition to reviewing investments, investment committee meetings serve as a forum to discuss credit views and outlooks. Potential transactions and deal flow are reviewed on a regular basis. Members of the investment team are encouraged to share information and views on credits with the investment committee early in their analysis. We believe this process improves the quality of the analysis and assists the deal team members to work more efficiently. 

&#160; 

We expect that each transaction will be presented to the investment committee in a formal written report. All of our new investments will require unanimous approval by the investment committee. Each member of the investment committee performs a similar role for other accounts managed by Princeton Investment Advisors. In certain instances, our board of directors may also determine that its approval is required prior to the making of an investment. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Monitoring Investments 

&#160; 

In most cases, we do not have board of directors&#8217; influence over portfolio companies. In some instances, Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; investment professionals may obtain board of directors representation or observation rights in conjunction with our investments. Princeton Investment Advisors will take an active approach in monitoring all investments, including reviews of financial performance on at least a quarterly basis and regular discussions with management. The monitoring process will begin with structuring terms and conditions which require the timely delivery and access to critical financial and business information on portfolio companies. 

&#160; 

Specifically, Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; monitoring system will consist of the following activities: 

&#160; 

Regular Investment Committee Updates . Key portfolio company developments will be discussed each week as part of the standard investment committee agenda. 

&#160; 

Written Reports . The deal teams will provide written updates as appropriate for key events that impact portfolio company performance or valuation. In addition, deal teams will provide written updates following each portfolio company board of directors meeting. 

&#160; 

Quarterly Full Portfolio Review . Princeton Investment Advisor&#8217;s chief investment officer and chief compliance officer will perform a quarterly comprehensive review of every portfolio company with the deal teams. This process will include a written performance and valuation update, and credit-specific discussion on each of our portfolio companies. In addition, pursuant to our valuation policy, quarterly valuations are reviewed by our independent third party valuation firm. 

&#160; 

As part of the monitoring process, Princeton Investment Advisors will also track developments in the broader marketplace. Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; investment professionals have a wealth of information on the competitive landscape, industry trends, relative valuation metrics, and analyses that will assist in the execution of our investment strategy. In addition, Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; extensive communications with brokers and dealers allow its investment professionals to monitor market and industry trends that could affect portfolio investments. Princeton Investment Advisors may provide ongoing strategic, financial and operational guidance to some portfolio companies either directly or by recommending its investment professionals or other experienced representatives to participate on the board of directors. Princeton Investment Advisors maintains a vast network of strategic and operational advisors to call upon for industry expertise or to supplement existing management teams. 

&#160; 

Asset Quality 

&#160; 

In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, Princeton Investment Advisors uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor the quality of our debt investment portfolio. Equity securities and Treasury Bills are not graded. This debt investment rating system uses a five-level numeric scale. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating: 

&#160; 

Investment Rating &#160; Summary Description &#160; &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; Investments that are performing above expectations, and whose risks remain favorable compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment. &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; Investments that are performing within expectations and whose risks remain neutral compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment. All new loans will initially be rated 2. &#160; &#160; &#160; 3 &#160; Investments that are performing below expectations and that require closer monitoring, but where no loss of return or principal is expected. Portfolio companies with a rating of 3 may be out of compliance with financial covenants. &#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; Investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are often in work out. Investments with a rating of 4 will be those for which some loss of return but no loss of principal is expected. &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; Investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are almost always in work out. Investments with a rating of 5 are those for which some loss of return and principal is expected. &#160;

&#160; 

Determination of Net Asset Value 

&#160; 

We will determine the net asset value of our investment portfolio each quarter. Securities that are publicly-traded will be valued at the reported closing price on the valuation date. Securities that are not publicly-traded will be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors. 

&#160; 

The Accounting Standards Codification under Topic 820, or ASC Topic 820 clarifies the definition of fair value for accounting purposes and requires companies to expand their disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 also establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, which includes inputs such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets and quoted prices for identical securities where there is little or no activity in the market; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. 

&#160; 

The Company establishes valuation processes and procedures to ensure that the valuation techniques for investments that are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are fair, consistent, and verifiable. The Company&#8217;s board of directors designates a Valuation Committee (the &#8220;Committee&#8221;) to oversee the entire valuation process of the Company&#8217;s Level 3 investments. The Committee is comprised of independent directors and reports to the Company&#8217;s board of directors. The Committee is responsible for developing the Company&#8217;s written valuation processes and procedures, conducting periodic reviews of the valuation policies, and evaluating the overall fairness and consistent application of the valuation policies. 

&#160; 

The Committee meets on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as needed, to determine the valuations of the Company&#8217;s Level 3 investments. Valuations determined by the Committee are required to be supported by market data, third-party pricing sources, industry accepted pricing models, counterparty prices, or other methods that the Committee deems to be appropriate. 

&#160; 

The Company will periodically test its valuations of Level 3 investments through performing back testing of the sales of such investments by comparing the amounts realized against the most recent fair values reported, and if necessary, uses the findings to recalibrate its valuation procedures. On a quarterly basis, the Company engages the services of a nationally recognized third-party valuation firm to perform an independent valuation of the Company&#8217;s Level 3 investments. 

&#160; 

Determination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations on our financial statements. Below is a description of factors that our board of directors may consider when valuing our equity and debt investments. 

&#160; 

Valuation of fixed income investments, such as loans and debt securities, depends upon a number of factors, including prevailing interest rates for like securities, expected volatility in future interest rates, call features, put features and other relevant terms of the debt. For investments without readily available market prices, we will incorporate these factors into discounted cash flow models to arrive at fair value. Other factors that our board will consider include the borrower&#8217;s ability to adequately service its debt, the fair market value of the portfolio company in relation to the face amount of its outstanding debt and the quality of collateral securing our debt investments. 

&#160; 

Our equity interests in portfolio companies for which there is no liquid public market are valued at fair value. The board of directors, in its analysis of fair value, may consider various factors, such as multiples of EBITDA, cash flows, net income, revenues or in limited instances book value or liquidation value. All of these factors may be subject to adjustments based upon the particular circumstances of a portfolio company or our actual investment position. For 

&#160; 

- 10 -

&#160;

&#160; 

example, adjustments to EBITDA may take into account compensation to previous owners or acquisition, recapitalization, restructuring or other related items. 

&#160; 

We may also look to private merger and acquisition statistics, public trading multiples discounted for illiquidity and other factors, valuations implied by third-party investments in the portfolio companies or industry practices in determining fair value. We may also consider the size and scope of a portfolio company and its specific strengths and weaknesses, as well as any other factors we deem relevant in assessing the value. Generally, the value of our equity interests in public companies for which market quotations are readily available is based upon the most recent closing public market price. Portfolio securities that carry certain restrictions on sale are typically valued at a discount from the public market value of the security. 

&#160; 

Realization of Investments 

&#160; 

The potential exit scenarios of a portfolio company will play an important role in evaluating investment decisions. As such, Princeton Investment Advisors will formulate specific exit strategies at the time of investment. Our debt-orientation will provide for increased potential exit opportunities, including (a) the sale of investments in the private markets, (b) the refinancing of investments held, often due to maturity or recapitalizations, and (c) other liquidity events including the sale or merger of the portfolio company. Since we seek to maintain a debt orientation in our investments, we expect to receive interest income over the course of the investment period, receiving a significant return on invested capital well in advance of final exit. 

&#160; 

Managerial Assistance 

&#160; 

As a BDC, we offer, and must provide upon request, managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board of directors and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. Our Administrator will provide such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. We may receive fees for these services and will reimburse our Administrator for its allocated costs in providing such assistance, subject to the review by our board of directors, including our independent directors. See &#8220;Management Agreements &#8212; Administration Agreement.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Our primary competitors in providing financing to small and lower middle-market companies include public and private funds, other BDC&#8217;s, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, we believe some competitors may have access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC or to the distribution and other requirements we must satisfy to maintain our qualification as a regulated investment company or &#8220;RIC&#8221;. We did not meet the qualifications of a RIC for the 2015 tax year. 

&#160; 

We expect to use the expertise of the investment professionals of Princeton Investment Advisors to which we will have access to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments in portfolio companies. In addition, we expect that the relationships of the investment professionals of Princeton Investment Advisors will enable us to learn about, and compete effectively for, financing opportunities with attractive small and lower middle-market companies in the industries in which we seek to invest. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Relating to our Business and Structure &#8212; We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, which could reduce returns and result in losses.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

We do not have any direct employees, and our day-to-day investment operations are managed by Princeton Investment Advisors. We have a chief executive officer and president, chief financial officer and chief compliance officer. To the extent necessary, our board of directors may hire additional personnel going forward. Our officers are employees of

&#160;

&#160; 

Princeton Investment Advisors and our allocable portion of the cost of our chief executive officer and president, chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs is paid by us pursuant to the administration agreement (the &#8220;Administration Agreement&#8221;) that we have entered into with PCC Administrator LLC, our Administrator. Our Administrator is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Princeton Investment Advisors. 

&#160; 

Management Agreements 

&#160; 

Princeton Investment Advisors serves as our investment advisor and is registered as an investment advisor under the 1940 Act. 

&#160; 

Investment Advisory Agreement 

&#160; 

Subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors and in accordance with the 1940 Act, Princeton Investment Advisors manages our day-to-day operations and provides investment advisory services to us. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, Princeton Investment Advisors: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes; &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; identifies, evaluate and negotiates the structure of the investments we make; &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; executes, closes, services and monitors the investments we make; &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; determines the securities and other assets that we purchase, retain or sell; &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; performs due diligence on prospective portfolio companies; and &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; provides us with such other investment advisory, research and related services as we may, from time to time, reasonably require for the investment of our funds. &#160; 

Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay Princeton Investment Advisors a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components &#8212; a base management fee and an incentive fee. The cost of both the base management fee and the incentive fee will ultimately be borne by our stockholders. 

&#160; 

Management Fee 

&#160; 

The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% of our gross assets, including assets purchased with borrowed funds or other forms of leverage and excluding cash and cash equivalents. For services rendered under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents, at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. Base management fees for any partial month or quarter will be appropriately pro-rated. 

&#160; 

Incentive Fee 

&#160; 

We will pay Princeton Investment Advisors an incentive fee. The incentive fee consists of two components that are independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. 

&#160; 

The first component, which is income-based, will be calculated and payable quarterly in arrears, commencing with the quarter beginning April 1, 2015, based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means, in each case on a consolidated basis, interest income, distribution income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, any interest 

&#160; 

- 12 -

&#160;

&#160; 

expense and any dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. 

&#160; 

The operation of the first component of the incentive fee for each quarter is as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; no incentive fee is payable to our investment advisor in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate of 2.00% (8.00% annualized); &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.50% in any calendar quarter (10.00% annualized) is payable to our investment advisor. We refer to this portion of our pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.50%) as the &#8220;catch-up.&#8221; The effect of the &#8220;catch-up&#8221; provision is that, if such pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds 2.50% in any calendar quarter, our investment advisor will receive 20% of such pre-incentive fee net investment income as if the hurdle rate did not apply; and &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 20% of the amount of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.50% in any calendar quarter (10.00% annualized) is payable to our investment advisor (once the hurdle rate is reached and the catch-up is achieved). &#160; 

The portion of such incentive fee that is attributable to deferred interest (such as PIK interest or original issue discount) will be paid to our investment advisor, together with interest from the date of deferral to the date of payment, only if and to the extent we actually receive such interest in cash, and any accrual will be reversed if and to the extent such interest is reversed in connection with any write-off or similar treatment of the investment giving rise to any deferred interest accrual. Any reversal of such amounts would reduce net income for the quarter by the net amount of the reversal (after taking into account the reversal of incentive fees payable) and would result in a reduction and possibly elimination of the incentive fees for such quarter. 

&#160; 

There is no accumulation of amounts on the hurdle rate from quarter to quarter and, accordingly, there is no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters are below the quarterly hurdle rate and there is no delay of payment if prior quarters are below the quarterly hurdle rate. Since the hurdle rate is fixed, as interest rates rise, it will be easier for our investment advisor to surpass the hurdle rate and receive an incentive fee based on pre-incentive fee net investment income. 

&#160; 

Our net investment income used to calculate this component of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of our consolidated gross assets used to calculate the 1.75% base management fee. These calculations will be appropriately prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current quarter. 

&#160; 

The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income-based component of the incentive fee: 

&#160; 

Quarterly Incentive Fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income 

(expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets) 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Percentage of pre-incentive fee net investment income allocated to first component of incentive fee 

&#160; 

The second component, the capital gains component of the incentive fee, will be determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), commencing on December 31, 2015, and will equal 20% of our cumulative aggregate realized capital gains from January 1st through the end of that calendar year, computed net of our aggregate cumulative realized capital losses and 

&#160; 

- 13 -

&#160;

&#160; 

our aggregate cumulative unrealized capital depreciation through the end of such year, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. If such amount is negative, then no capital gains incentive fee will be payable for such year. Additionally, if the Investment Advisory Agreement is terminated as of a date that is not a calendar year end, the termination date will be treated as though it were a calendar year end for purposes of calculating and paying the capital gains incentive fee. The capital gains component of the incentive fee is not subject to any minimum return to stockholders. 

&#160; 

Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that we may pay an incentive fee in a quarter where we incur a loss. For example, if we receive pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate, we will pay the applicable incentive fee even if we have incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. 

&#160; 

Examples of Quarterly Incentive Fee Calculation 

&#160; 

Example 1: Income Related Portion of Incentive Fee (*): 

&#160; 

Alternative 1 

&#160; 

Assumptions 

&#160; 

Investment income (including interest, distributions, fees, etc.) = 1.25% 

Hurdle rate (1) = 2.00% 

Base management fee (2) = 0.4375% 

Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) (3) = 0.25% 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income 

(investment income - (base management fee + other expenses)) = 0.5625% 

&#160; 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate, therefore there is no incentive fee. 

&#160; 

Alternative 2 

&#160; 

Assumptions 

&#160; 

Investment income (including interest, distributions, fees, etc.) = 2.70% 

Hurdle rate (1) = 2.00% 

Base management fee (2) = 0.4375% 

Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) (3) = 0.25% 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income 

(investment income - (base management fee + other expenses)) = 2.0125% 

&#160; 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate, therefore there is an incentive fee. 

&#160; 

Incentive fee = (100% x &#8220;Catch-Up&#8221;) + (the greater of 0% AND (20% x (pre-incentive fee net investment income - 2.50%)) 

&#160; 

= (100.0% x (pre-incentive fee net investment income &#8211; 2.00%)) + 0% 

= 100.0% x (2.0125% - 2.00%) 

= 100.0% x 0.0125% 

= 0.0125% 

&#160; 

Alternative 3 

&#160; 

Assumptions 

&#160; 

Investment income (including interest, distributions, fees, etc.) = 3.00% 

Hurdle rate (1) = 2.00% 

&#160; 

- 14 -

&#160;

&#160; 

Base management fee (2) = 0.4375% 

Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) (3) = 0.25% 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income 

(investment income - (base management fee + other expenses)) = 2.3125% 

&#160; 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate, therefore there is an incentive fee. 

&#160; 

Incentive fee = (100% x &#8220;Catch-Up&#8221;) + (the greater of 0% AND (20% x (pre-incentive fee net investment income - 2.50%)) 

&#160; 

= (100% &#215; (2.50% - 2.00%)) + (20.0% &#215; (2.3125% - 2.50%)) 

= 0.50% + (20.0% &#215; 0%) 

= 0.50% + 0% 

= 0.45% 

&#160; 

(*) The hypothetical amount of pre-incentive fee net investment income shown is based on a percentage of net assets. (1) Represents 8.00% annualized hurdle rate. (2) Represents 1.75% annualized base management fee. (3) Excludes organizational and offering expenses. &#160; 

Example 2: Capital Gains Portion of Incentive Fee: 

&#160; 

Alternative 1: 

&#160; 

Assumptions 

&#160; 

&#160; Year 1: $20 million investment made in Company A (&#8220;Investment A&#8221;), and $30 million investment made in Company B (&#8220;Investment B&#8221;) &#160; Year 2: Investment A sold for $50 million and fair market value, or FMV, of Investment B determined to be $32 million &#160; Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million &#160; Year 4: Investment B sold for $31 million &#160; 

The capital gains portion of the incentive fee would be: 

&#160; 

&#160; Year 1: None &#160; Year 2: Capital gains incentive fee of $6.0 million ($30 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A multiplied by 20.0%) &#160; Year 3: None; $5.0 million (20.0% multiplied by ($30 million cumulative capital gains less $5.0 million cumulative capital depreciation)) less $6.0 million (previous capital gains fee paid in Year 2) &#160; Year 4: Capital gains incentive fee of $200,000; $6.2 million ($31 million cumulative realized capital gains multiplied by 20.0%) less $6.0 million (capital gains fee paid in Year 2) &#160; 

Alternative 2 

&#160; 

Assumptions 

&#160; 

&#160; Year 1: $20 million investment made in Company A (&#8220;Investment A&#8221;), $30 million investment made in Company B (&#8220;Investment B&#8221;) and $25 million investment made in Company C (&#8220;Investment C&#8221;) &#160; Year 2: Investment A sold for $50 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million and FMV of Investment C determined to be $25 million &#160; Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $27 million and Investment C sold for $30 million &#160; Year 4: FMV of Investment B determined to be $35 million &#160; Year 5: Investment B sold for $20 million &#160; 

- 15 -

&#160;

&#160; 

The capital gains portion of the incentive fee would be: 

&#160; 

&#160; Year 1: None &#160; Year 2: Capital gains incentive fee of $5.0 million; 20.0% multiplied by $25 million ($30 million realized capital gains on Investment A less $5 million unrealized capital depreciation on Investment B) &#160; Year 3: Capital gains incentive fee of $1.4 million; $6.4 million (20.0% multiplied by $32 million ($35 million cumulative realized capital gains less $3 million unrealized capital depreciation on Investment B)) less $5.0 million (capital gains fee received in Year 2) &#160; Year 4: None &#160; Year 5: None; $5.0 million of capital gains incentive fee (20.0% multiplied by $25 million (cumulative realized capital gains of $35 million less realized capital losses of $10 million)) less $6.4 million (cumulative capital gains fee paid in Year 2 and Year 3) &#160;

The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of their duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of their duties and obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement, Princeton Investment Advisors and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons and members, and any other person or entity affiliated with it, are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; services under the Investment Advisory Agreement or otherwise as our investment advisor. 

&#160; 

Board of Directors&#8217; Approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement 

&#160; 

Our board of directors, including a majority of our independent directors, approved the Investment Advisory Agreement at its meeting, held on March 13, 2015. In its consideration of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the board of directors focused on information it had received relating to, among other things: 

&#160; 

&#9679; the nature, quality and extent of the advisory and other services to be provided to us by our investment adviser; 

&#9679; comparative data with respect to advisory fees or similar expenses paid by other BDC&#8217;s with similar investment objectives; 

&#9679; our projected operating expenses and expense ratio compared to BDC&#8217;s with similar investment objectives; 

&#9679; any existing and potential sources of indirect income to our investment adviser from its relationships with us and the profitability of those relationships; 

&#9679; information about the services to be performed and the personnel performing such services under the Investment Advisory Agreement; the organizational capability and financial condition of our investment adviser; 

&#9679; and various other factors. &#160; 

Based on the information reviewed and the discussions, the board of directors, including a majority of the non-interested directors, concluded that the investment management fee rates and terms are reasonable in relation to the services to be provided and approved the Investment Advisory Agreement as being in the best interests of our stockholders.

Administration Agreement 

&#160; 

The Administration Agreement provides that our Administrator furnishes us with office facilities and equipment and provide us with clerical, bookkeeping, recordkeeping and other administrative services at such facilities. Under the Administration Agreement, our Administrator performs, or oversees the performance of, our required administrative services, which include being responsible for the financial and other records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports and other materials filed with the SEC. In addition, our Administrator assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, oversee the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports and other materials to our stockholders, and generally oversees the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Under the Administration Agreement, our Administrator will also provide managerial assistance on our behalf to those portfolio companies that have accepted our offer to provide such assistance. 

&#160; 

Payments under the Administration Agreement will be equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion (subject to the review of our board of directors) of our Administrator&#8217;s overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions and our allocable portion of the cost of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. In addition, if requested to provide significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies, our Administrator will be paid an additional amount based on the services provided, which shall not exceed the amount we receive from such portfolio companies for providing this assistance. The Administration Agreement will have an initial term of two years and may be renewed with the approval of our board of directors. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days&#8217; written notice to the other party. To the extent that our Administrator outsources any of its functions, we will pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis without any incremental profit to the Administrator. Stockholder approval is not required to amend the Administration Agreement. 

&#160; 

Sub-Administration Agreement 

&#160; 

The Administrator has engaged Conifer Asset Solutions LLC (the &#8220;Sub-Administrator&#8221;) to provide certain administrative services to us. In exchange for provided such services, the Administrator pays Conifer an asset-based fee with a $200,000 annual minimum as adjusted for any reimbursement of expenses. This asset-based fee will vary depending upon our gross assets, as adjusted, as follows: 

&#160; 

Gross Assets &#160; &#160; Fee first $150 million of gross assets &#160; 20 basis points (0.20%) next $150 million of gross assets &#160; 15 basis points (0.15%) next $200 million of gross assets &#160; 10 basis points (0.10%) in excess of $500 million of gross assets &#160; 5 basis points (0.05%) &#160; 

Indemnification 

&#160; 

The Administration Agreement provides that, absent criminal conduct, willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, our Administrator, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons and members, and any other person or entity affiliated with it, are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of our Administrator&#8217;s services under the Administration Agreement or otherwise as our Administrator. 

&#160; 

License Agreement 

&#160; 

We have entered into a license agreement with Princeton Investment Advisors under which Princeton Investment Advisors has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name &#8220;Princeton.&#8221; Under this agreement, we have a right to use the &#8220;Princeton&#8221; name for so long as Princeton Investment Advisors or one of its affiliates remains our investment advisor. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#8220;Princeton&#8221; name. This license agreement will remain in effect for so long as the Investment Advisory Agreement with Princeton Investment Advisors is in effect.

Securities Exchange Act Reports 

&#160; 

We maintain a website at www.princetoncapitalcorp.com. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

We make available on or through our website certain reports and amendments to those reports that we file with or furnish to the SEC in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the &#8220;Exchange Act.&#8221; These include our annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current reports on Form 8-K. We make this information available on our website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file the information with, or furnish it to, the SEC. 

&#160; 

Regulation as a BDC 

&#160; 

We are a BDC under the 1940 Act and intend to elect to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the &#8220;Code&#8221;.) The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDC&#8217;s and their affiliates (including any investment advisors), principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than &#8220;interested persons,&#8221; as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities. 

&#160; 

We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an &#8220;underwriter&#8221; as that term is defined in the Securities Act. Our intention is to not write (sell) or buy put or call options to manage risks associated with the publicly traded securities of our portfolio companies, except that we may enter into hedging transactions to manage the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. However, we may purchase or otherwise receive warrants to purchase the common stock of our portfolio companies in connection with acquisition financing or other investments. Similarly, in connection with an acquisition, we may acquire rights to require the issuers of acquired securities or their affiliates to repurchase them under certain circumstances. We also do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any registered investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of more than one investment company. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments might subject our stockholders to additional expenses. None of these policies is fundamental and may be changed without stockholder approval upon 60 days&#8217; prior written notice to stockholders. 

&#160; 

Qualifying Assets 

&#160; 

Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as &#8220;qualifying assets,&#8221; unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company&#8217;s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our proposed business are the following: 

&#160; 

(1) Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. Under the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder, &#8220;eligible portfolio companies&#8221; include (1) private domestic operating companies, (2) public domestic operating companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange ( e.g. , the New York Stock Exchange) or registered under the Exchange Act, and (3) public domestic operating companies having a market capitalization of less than $250 million. Public domestic operating companies whose securities are quoted on the over-the-counter bulletin board or through Pink Sheets LLC are not listed on a national securities exchange and &#160; 

- 19 -

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; therefore are eligible portfolio companies. &#160; 

(2) Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control. &#160; 

(3) Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from a person who is or has been, within the past 13 months, an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident to such a private transaction, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements. &#160; 

(4) Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company. &#160; 

(5) Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities. &#160; 

(6) Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities that mature in one year or less from the date of investment. &#160; 

The regulations defining qualifying assets may change over time. We may adjust our investment focus as needed to comply with and/or take advantage of any regulatory, legislative, administrative or judicial actions in this area. 

&#160; 

Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 

&#160; 

In order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, a BDC must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance. However, when the BDC purchases securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers, employees or agents, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. Princeton Investment Advisors will provide such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. 

&#160; 

Temporary Investments 

&#160; 

Pending investment in other types of qualifying assets, as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less from the date of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets or temporary investments. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, so long as the agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the Diversification Tests in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Princeton Investment Advisors will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 

&#160; 

Senior Securities 

&#160; 

We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset 

&#160; 

- 20 -

&#160;

&#160; 

coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. A loan will be considered temporary if it is repaid within sixty days and is not extended or renewed. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Relating to our Business and Structure &#8212; Regulations governing our operation as a BDC will affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital. As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Common Stock 

&#160; 

We are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock at a price below the current net asset value of the common stock if our board of directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and that of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our board of directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities (less any distributing commission or discount). A proposal, approved by our stockholders at the Special Meeting of Stockholders held on March 6, 2015, authorizes us to sell shares equal to up to 25% of our outstanding common stock below the then current net asset value per share of our common stock in one or more offerings for the period ending on March 13, 2016. We would need similar future approval from our stockholders to issue shares below the then current net asset value per share any time after the expiration of the current approval. We may also make rights offerings to our stockholders at prices per share less than the net asset value per share, subject to applicable requirements of the 1940 Act. 

&#160; 

Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 

&#160; 

We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to Princeton Investment Advisors. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of Princeton Investment Advisors are set out below. The guidelines will be reviewed periodically by Princeton Investment Advisors and our directors who are not &#8220;interested persons,&#8221; and, accordingly, are subject to change. 

&#160; 

Introduction 

&#160; 

As an investment advisor registered under the Advisers Act, Princeton Investment Advisors has a fiduciary duty to act solely in our best interests. As part of this duty, Princeton Investment Advisors recognizes that it must vote our securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in our best interests. 

&#160; 

Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; policies and procedures for voting proxies for its investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 

&#160; 

Proxy Policies 

&#160; 

Princeton Investment Advisors votes proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what it perceives, at that time, to be the best interest of our stockholders. Princeton Investment Advisors reviews on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to assess the effect on the portfolio securities we hold. In most cases Princeton Investment Advisors will vote in favor of proposals that Princeton Investment Advisors believes are likely to increase the value of the portfolio securities and vote against proposals that may have a negative effect on our portfolio securities. Notwithstanding this, the foregoing does not restrict or limit Princeton Investment Advisors from voting as it determines to be appropriate. 

&#160; 

Princeton Investment Advisors has established a proxy voting committee and adopted proxy voting guidelines and related procedures. The proxy voting committee establishes proxy voting guidelines and procedures, oversees the internal proxy voting process, and reviews proxy voting issues. To ensure that Princeton Investment Advisors&#8217; vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, Princeton Investment Advisors requires that (1) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to our Chief Compliance Officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision-making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how Princeton Investment Advisors intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. Where conflicts of 

&#160; 

- 21 -

&#160;

&#160; 

interest may be present, Princeton Investment Advisors will disclose such conflicts to us, including our independent directors and may request guidance from us on how to vote such proxies. 

&#160; 

Proxy Voting Records 

&#160; 

You may obtain information about how Princeton Investment Advisors voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Princeton Capital Corporation, 700 Alexander Park, Suite 103, Princeton, NJ 08540, or by calling us collect at (609) 514-9200. 

&#160; 

Privacy Principles 

&#160; 

We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguarding their nonpublic personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties. 

&#160; 

Generally, we do not receive any nonpublic personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain nonpublic personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third-party administrator). 

&#160; 

We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about our stockholders to employees of Princeton Investment Advisors and its affiliates with a legitimate business need for the information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the nonpublic personal information of our stockholders. 

&#160; 

Other 

&#160; 

We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person&#8217;s office. 

&#160; 

We and Princeton Investment Advisors will each be required to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of relevant federal securities laws, review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation, and designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. 

&#160; 

We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our board of directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. The SEC has interpreted the BDC prohibition on transactions with affiliates to prohibit all &#8220;joint transactions&#8221; between, among other things, entities that share a common investment advisor. The staff of the SEC has granted no-action relief permitting purchases of a single class of privately placed securities provided that the advisor negotiates no term other than price and certain other conditions are met. 

&#160; 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 

&#160; 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; pursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Exchange Act, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports; &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; pursuant to Item 307 under Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management must prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; and &#160; 

- 22 -

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any remedial actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. &#160; 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated under such act. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance with that act. 

&#160; 

Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company 

&#160; 

The Company will be taxed as a C corporation and subject to federal and state corporation income taxes for its 2015 taxable year. As a BDC, we intend to qualify for the 2016 tax year to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally do not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our &#8220;investment company taxable income,&#8221; which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses (the &#8220;Annual Distribution Requirement&#8221;). 

&#160; 

For any taxable year in which we: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; qualify as a RIC; and &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement; &#160; 

we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our income we distribute (or are deemed to distribute) to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders. 

&#160; 

We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on our undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (a) 98% of our net ordinary income for each calendar year, (b) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (c) any income realized, but not distributed, in the preceding year and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax, or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. For this purpose, however, any net ordinary income or capital gain net income retained by us that is subject to corporate income tax for the tax year ending in that calendar year will be considered to have been distributed by year end (or earlier if estimated taxes are paid). We currently intend to make sufficient distributions each taxable year to satisfy the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement. 

&#160; 

In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; continue to qualify as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each year; &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities, and net income derived from interests in &#8220;qualified publicly traded partnerships&#8221; (which generally are partnerships that are traded on an established securities market or tradable on a secondary market, other than partnerships that derive 90% of their income from interest, dividends and other permitted RIC income), or the 90% Income Test; and &#160; 

- 23 -

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer or of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or in the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships, or the Diversification Tests. &#160; 

We may invest in partnerships, including qualified publicly traded partnerships, which may result in our being subject to state, local or foreign income, franchise or withholding liabilities. 

&#160; 

We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, with increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any original issue discount accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. If we are not able to obtain sufficient cash from other sources to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we may fail to maintain our qualification as a RIC and become subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on all of our taxable income without the benefit of the dividends-paid deduction. 

&#160; 

Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy (i) the Annual Distribution Requirements and to otherwise eliminate our liability for U.S. federal income and excise taxes and/or (ii) the Diversification Tests. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted in certain circumstances to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain &#8220;asset coverage&#8221; tests are met. See Item 1A. &#8220;Regulation as a BDC - Senior Securities.&#8221; Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement, the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement or the Diversification Test may be limited by (a) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (b) other requirements relating to our qualifications as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement, the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement or the Diversification Tests, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. 

&#160; 

Certain of our investment practices may be subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (a) treat dividends that would otherwise constitute qualified dividend income as non-qualified dividend income, (b) treat dividends that would otherwise be eligible for the corporate dividends received deduction as ineligible for such treatment, (c) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, (d) convert lower-taxed long term capital gain into higher-taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income, (e) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (f) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash, (g) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (h) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions and (i) produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test. We intend to monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections to mitigate the effect of these provisions and prevent our disqualification as a RIC. 

&#160; 

Gain or loss realized by us from warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such capital gain or loss generally will be long term or short term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant. Some of the income and fees that we may recognize will not satisfy the 90% Income Test. In order to ensure that such income and fees do not disqualify us as a RIC for a failure to satisfy the 90% Income Test, we may hold assets that generate such income and provide services that generate such fees indirectly through one or more entities treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such corporations will be required to pay U.S. federal corporate income tax on their earnings, which ultimately will reduce our return on such income and fees. 

&#160; 

- 24 -

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

If we are unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC, and if certain remedial provisions are not available, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would they be required to be made. Distributions, including distributions of net long-term capital gain, would generally be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate stockholders would be eligible to claim a dividends received deduction with respect to such distributions, non-corporate stockholders would be able to treat such dividend income as &#8220;qualified dividend income,&#8221; which is subject to reduced rates of U.S. federal income tax. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder&#8217;s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, to requalify as a RIC in a subsequent year we may be subject to regular corporate tax on any net built-in gains with respect to certain of our assets (i.e., the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if we had been liquidated) that we elect to recognize on requalification or when recognized over the next ten years (or shorter applicable period). The remainder of this discussion assumes that we will maintain our qualification as a RIC and will satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement.
