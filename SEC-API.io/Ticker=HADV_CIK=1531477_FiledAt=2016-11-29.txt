 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Health Advance Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated on April 14, 2010 in Wyoming. Our business office is located at 3651 Lindell Road, Suite D#155, Las Vegas, NV, 89103. Our telephone number is 702-943-0309. We were founded by Jordan Starkman, who serves as President and sole director. 

&#160; 

On February 14, 2013, the Company effected a 10-for-1 forward split of the Company&#8217;s issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 (the &#8220;Common Stock&#8221;). The Company&#8217;s issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock were therefore increased from 2,452,000 to 24,520,000. All per share amounts have been restated to reflect this stock split. 

&#160; 

The Company is an on-line retailer of home medical products with operations in Canada and the United States, and with administration and infrastructure supported globally. Our strategy is to attract opportunities in the health care industry through the development and growth of our existing web site www.leadingmedicalproducts.com. We believe we can operate more cost efficiently and compete as a discounter that delivers value and low cost branded lines of home medical care products together with valuable customer care that is currently missing in the marketplace. Our goal is to become our customers&#8217; single source for low cost health care supplies, by meeting all of our customer&#8217;s needs. 

&#160; 

The Company has recognized the sales and profit potential of medical/surgical supplies as a necessity item primarily due to the aging population. We strive to offer health care professionals, medical distributors and consumers the highest quality brands and products at the most affordable prices. We expect to achieve this by forming relationships with suppliers that will be able to provide us with preferred prices once we are able to make bulk purchases. 

&#160; 

We do not consider ourselves a blank check company, as we have a specific business plan and have moved forward with our business operations. Specifically we, while in the development stage, are proceeding with our business plan by constructing and implementing an automated website. We have taken certain steps in furtherance of this business plan including establishing the website and the establishment of accounts with wholesale distributors of medical supplies. We do not have any plan, arrangement, or understanding to engage in a merger or acquisition with any other entity. 

&#160; 

The Company operates under the corporate website at www.healthadvanceinc.com and its on-line retailer website at www.leadingmedicalproducts.com. 

&#160; 

The Company believes the outlook for the health care industry in general is positive. Over the next several years, we believe we will benefit significantly from certain favorable demographic and industry trends, including: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

the rising healthcare and prescription drug needs of the ageing Canadian and US population; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

a heightened focus on health and wellness by the baby boomer generation and the increasing demand for lifestyle drugs; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

increased investment in research and development by pharmaceutical and medical supply companies resulting in new and more effective products; and 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

the fragmented nature of the Canadian and US health care retailing marketplace providing tremendous consolidation opportunities. 

&#160; 

Demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing as an aging U.S. population is increasingly using healthcare services. Between 2000 and 2010 the population aged 45-64 grew at a rate of 31.55. The large growth in this age group is primarily due to the aging of the Baby Boom population. In 2011, the first members of the Baby Boom generation will reach age 65, and the Baby Boom will represent 25 percent of the total population (in the middle series). The last of the Baby-Boom population will reach age 65 in the year 2029. By that time, the Baby-Boom population is projected to represent about 16 percent of the total population. Between 2009 and 2019, the 45 and older population is expected to grow by approximately 15%. Between 2009 and 2029, this age group is expected to grow by approximately 30%. 

&#160; 

This compares with expected U.S. population growth rates of approximately 10% between 2009 and 2019 and approximately 20% between 2009 and 2029. Furthermore, it is estimated that 70 million people will be 65 or older by 2030 &#8211; nearly doubling the 34 million today. (The foregoing statistics are extracted from the 2011 U, S. Census.)

&#160; 

The growing senior population demands more medical attention and ten out of the twenty most rapidly growing industries in the U.S. are in the health care sector. As the population ages an increased number of seniors are taking a more active role in managing their health care and as they age in to their golden years, their adult children and family member often become key healthcare support systems. There is a growing trend toward care at home and empowering seniors to be more independent. Today the market for senior care is highly fragmented between online and offline delivery. Nursing home operators, insurance companies and doctors are trying to reduce the visits of elder patients to high cost facilities. 

Strategy 

&#160; 

Our business strategy is designed to drive sales growth, maximize gross margin dollars and operating cash flow, capitalize on cost reduction opportunities and build customer loyalty, which we believe will result in the Company being a leading home healthcare provider. The company will rely on the dedication of its knowledgeable staff for the successful implementation of its business strategy. Key elements of this strategy include: 

&#160; 

Diverse Product Selection 

&#160; 

We carry a vast number of brand named products that are well recognized by our customers. These products will be well priced value products which are used on a regular basis by our customers. 

&#160; 

Strong Customer Service 

&#160; 

We believe the best customer is a happy customer and through third parties and directly, we provide a range of services to educate and tailor support to each senior customer. 

&#160; 

Health Advance&#8217;s Position in the Health Care Industry 

&#160; 

Favorable industry trends, such as those described above, provide the Company with continued opportunities to capitalize on its strengths in providing high quality health care services and building trust with its customers while at the same time educating the customer. The Company intends to strengthen its leadership position in this high growth category by improving operations, enhancing the quality of healthcare services provided to its customers and cultivating a professional environment which the Company believes attracts superior health care staff. A key element of this strategy is increased investment in technology to support the growing demand for health care services and reduce the administrative burden on staff, enabling them to dedicate more time to customer care. These initiatives will best position the Company to maximize profits and customer retention. The Company also intends to build market share in the health care category by continuing to offer the added convenience of expedited home delivery. 

&#160; 

Driving Sales and Profitability 

&#160; 

The Company intends to improve profitability by refining its merchandising mix through the introduction of new product categories and the tactical use of private label products. The focus on an improved product offering is intended to increase customer satisfaction, enhancing the attractiveness of Health Advance web experience as a destination for purchases of all health care needs. Simplifying e-store activities are also key elements of driving retail sales and profitability. 

&#160; 

Marketplace 

&#160; 

The US Industry 

&#160; 

Market National healthcare spending will reach over $4.3 trillion by 2018, up from $1.42 trillion in 2001 and accounting for 20.3% of GDP according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). 

&#160; 

Currently, more than 130 million Americans live with a chronic condition, including Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, arthritis, cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, and diabetes. By 2020, about 157 million Americans will be affected by chronic illness, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services. 

&#160; 

First Research estimates the number of Americans over 65 will double from 34 million to 62 million between 2000 and 2025. Currently, 90 million Americans live with chronic diseases. The research firm Rand estimates the number of Americans with two or more chronic conditions will increase from 60 to 81 million between the years 2000 and 2020. 

&#160; 

Health Advance expects to see continued growth in the health care market driven by advances in medical technology, the growing trend toward shorter hospital stays and an ageing population. The Company believes as the baby boomer population ages, the already flourishing medical supply industry will experience a 20-year explosion in growth. The Company believes that it will be well positioned to participate in the future growth opportunities available in the home health care market.

Industry Trends 

&#160; 

Over the next several years, Health Advance expects to benefit significantly from certain favorable demographic and industry trends, including: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

The rising healthcare and prescription drug needs of the ageing population 

&#9679; 

A heightened focus on health and wellness by the baby boomers generation and the increasing demand for lifestyle drugs: This segment of U.S. and Canadian society is also placing a greater emphasis on prevention and early diagnosis of medical conditions and on the purchase of self-care products. 

&#160; 

Governmental Regulations 

&#160; 

We are not subject to any local, state, federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution and resale of products. All the products marketed through Health Advance are developed and meet US specifications and stringent criteria by the US Federal Drug and Administration bodies, as well as Medicare and Medicaid US government social security operations. 

&#160; 

Canadian Competition 

&#160; 

We face competition from many retailers in the home healthcare and prescription drug business as the sale of these products is not restricted to pharmacy outlets. While the Canadian drug-retailing sector continues to be dominated by groups or chains and independents, the competitive environment has changed significantly in recent years with many new entrants targeting price sensitive consumers. The percentage of pharmacy outlets operated by non-traditional competitors, such as mass merchandisers and supermarkets, has increased over the past three years as they added pharmacy departments to their stores. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s competitors in the industry include independent operators, buying/banner groups such as Shoppers Drug Mart Home Health Care, IDA, Guardian, Pharma Plus, mass merchandisers such as Wal-Mart and Zellers, and large supermarket chains with prescription dispensing such as Loblaws, Sobey&#8217;s and Real Canadian Superstore. 

&#160; 

We believe we will be well positioned to compete against many drug store chains, as well as supermarkets, mass merchandisers and independent drug stores by concentrating on providing high levels of professional service and a diverse product selection. The Company believes that consumers will pay for its value-added services and will be attracted to its large selection of home health care products and home delivery infrastructure. 

&#160; 

US Competition 

&#160; 

The distribution and manufacture of healthcare supplies and equipment is highly competitive. Many of the healthcare distribution products we sell are available to our customers from a number of other suppliers. In addition, our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products. Manufacturers also could seek to sell directly to end-users, and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors. 

&#160; 

In North America, we compete with distributors, as well as several manufacturers primarily on the basis of price, breadth of product line, customer service and value-added products and services. Our primary competitors in the sale of medical products are the General Medical division of McKesson Corp., PSS World Medical, Inc. and the Allegiance division of Cardinal Health, Inc., which are national distributors. 

&#160; 

Significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar reduction in our prices. Any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect our operating results. 

&#160; 

Brick and mortar senior specialty stores - Generally speaking senior supply brick and mortar retail stores focus on high-end expensive equipment. Retails stores catering to seniors also provide very little price comparison or depth of product. They tend to focus on durable medical equipment items from one or two wholesalers and tend to focus on products that are covered by Medicare. 

&#160; 

Large Chains - Increasingly with Walgreens, CVS, and Walmart are entering the smaller ticket item Durable Medical Equipment and Products areas, but their brand and product selection at any one store is limited. Many seniors in many States do not live near major cities and don&#8217;t have easy access to retail stores for their medical needs. With very little visibility consumers are turning to the internet for their home medical supplies. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Senior Websites - The biggest advantage derived by seniors, their care givers and family from using the internet is price comparison, product selection and reach (i.e. access to seniors who are not able to get to or drive to a retail location nearby). Today there are numerous companies on the web catering to the senior market. They fall or position themselves into four areas: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Durable Medical Product Companies who cover a wide range of products and predominately are resellers. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Lifestyle Companies who position themselves as a place to purchase luxury Senior care products 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Specialized web and TV direct response business sites specialize in certain areas such as Diabetes Care or Wheelchair/Power Chair mobility 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Content companies &#8211; that provide knowledge, content and care. Companies such as agingcare.com 

Growth Markets 

&#160; 

Respiratory Diseases 

According to COPD International, over 16 million people in the U.S. have respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive lung disease, asthma, and chronic bronchitis. In 2002, these diseases had a total estimated cost of over $32.1 billion. In 2001, the NHBLI reports 12.1 million adults 25 and older were diagnosed with these diseases and as many as 14 million remain undiagnosed. These ailments require frequent treatment with oral medications and/or aerosol medications, which require a compressor or atomizing device during preparation. 

&#160; 

Diabetes 

&#160; 

Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death among Americans, accounts for $98 billion in medical costs and lost productivity each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.org). In recent years, cases of type 2 (&#8220;adult onset&#8221;) diabetes have been on the rise in the United States; it is now considered a national epidemic. We intend to launch an aggressive campaign to build up this sector of our business. 

&#160; 

Mastectomy Supplies 

Mastectomy supplies typically generate substantial revenues and high gross margins for home health care providers. Mastectomy products include items such as the prosthesis and special bras, sleep and swimwear. According to the National Institute of Health, breast cancer treatment costs nearly $7 billion. 

Regular screening mammographies and self-examinations can result in increased early detection and treatment. With improved diagnostic and treatment technologies, survival rates are increasing, resulting in a rising number of post-mastectomy consumers for longer repeat purchase periods. 

Ostomy Products 

An ostomy is a surgically created opening in the body, which allows body fluids or excrement to escape into a collection device. Product focus areas including two piece, drainable pouches, cohesive seals, skin barrier protective products, irrigation products, tapes, adhesives and deodorants and accessories. Ostomy and Incontinence products market is expected to reach $11.2 billion by 2017, according to Global Industry Analysts. 

&#160; 

Incontinence &#38; Urological 

&#160; 

The larger consumer base for adult incontinence, combined with this growth, has created opportunities for new products in the segment that respond to three major requirements&#8212;comfort, discretion and ease of use. As sufferers of incontinence seek more active lifestyles, they are demanding products that can work with them as they go about their daily lives. 

&#160; 

Durable Medical Equipment 

&#160; 

To address the growing senior market, our online site, Leadingmedicalproducts, carries a full spectrum of durable medical equipment, including: 

&#160; 

Bath related Products key products, include: bidets, portable showers, wheel chair showers, bath traction, bidet accessories, inflatable bidets, inflatable commodes, bath in a bag, high-end bidet system for toilets, and hemorrhoid toilet supports systems. &#160; 

Bed and Sleeping aids key products, include: bed rails, wedge pillows, mattress protectors, folding bed boards, air mattress overlays, bed protection, incontinence bed products, bed rails, and a range of beds for seniors 

&#160; 

Bariatric key products include: obesity aids, bariatric aids, bariatric box-springs, bariatric ring cushions, bariatric home equipment, and extra large blood pressure cuffs. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Power Mobility Sales 

&#160; 

As the population ages, people&#8217;s ability to walk and move around can be diminished, creating increased demand for power mobility equipment, such as power wheelchairs and scooter. 

&#160; 

Operations 

&#160; 

Product Sourcing 

&#160; 

As sales increase, we believe that we will be in a position to negotiate large discounts from its suppliers indicating manufacturer confidence in our company. We will also source products from FDA approved manufacturers in China for private label purposes. We are also developing direct from manufacturer sourcing programs. 

&#160; 

If our supplier is no longer carrying a given product: we may suppress the product altogether. We may keep the product on as a means to attract customers who may be interested in a discontinued product and then we up-sell them to the latest product from the same manufacturer. We have found that in many cases it is good to keep even discontinued older models active on our site. We also learn which products have been discontinued where there is demand and that may result in us considering finding or re developing such product direct from MFG. 

&#160; 

We plan to carry a wide selection of products for post-operative and healthcare, and ranging from the following: 

&#160; 

Aids To Daily Living, Ambulatory Products, Bath Safety, Bed Accessories, Catheters, Core Wound Care, Diabetic, Diagnostic equipment, Enteral Nutrition-Feeding, Home Diagnostics, Incontinence, Lift Chairs / Geri Chairs, IV Supplies, Needles / Syringes, Orthopedics, Ostomy, Pain Management, Patient Lifts &#38; Acc, Personal Protection / Gloves, Professional Use and Diagnostics, Respiratory, Scooters &#38; Accessories, Seating / Cushions, Specialty Medical Equipment &#38; Accessories, Tracheostomy Care, Urologicals / Collection Device, Specialty Wound Care, Wheelchairs Accessories, and Womens-Infant Products. 

&#160; 

Inventory 

&#160; 

Currently, we are working on a cash basis with our suppliers and we have multiple suppliers to facilitate our purchases, therefore we do not have any formal agreements with our suppliers. Each supplier will handle the shipping of our product once the order is received. Our suppliers carry in excess of 10,000 products and with the drop-ship arrangements we will be able to operate more efficiently, and easily update and change our product mix based on changes in online demand for our products without having to financial risk of carrying inventory. Currently we have purchase accounts set up with Invacare, Briggs Healthcare and Complete Medical Supplies. As our operations increase we intend to formalize relationships with additional suppliers and will attempt to set up net 30-day terms with most suppliers. 

&#160; 

System Management 

&#160; 

We currently offer about 3,900 products through our website. In partnership with various vendors we plan to add another 6,000 products over the next 12 months. To optimize and keep current the pricing and product details we are running a routine database extraction mapping and rationalizing program outlined in some detail below. 

&#160; 

We do not have any formal agreements in place with our suppliers. Currently, we have accounts set up with multiple wholesale distributors enabling us to make purchases with them. Since there are various vendors that we can make purchases from, we do not believe it is necessary to formalize any long-term contracts with any particular vendor. 

&#160; 

We map the Leadingmedicalproducts Website to our preferred suppliers products&#8217; database that contain a total of more than 10,000 unique products with all the latest pricing. This database is updated monthly by the supplier. Our programs extract the latest pricing and flag which products have been discontinued. 

&#160; 

During our weekly product and pricing reviews we make decisions based on our database scan of our vendors systems. Each situation is unique and we assess the best strategy in terms of merchandising optimization. Scenarios that we evaluate and decision we make, include the following: 

&#160; 

Optimizing Margins and Pricing 

&#160; 

As a discounter we will need to make at least 23 % gross margin on any order after paying back the supplier and the paying other transaction costs. We use a rules based system to track and optimize profits and margins. We create and model numerous profitability scenarios daily by product, brand, region and inventory. 

&#160; 

New Product Uploads: Our multi-vendor database is designed to correctly manage wholesalers data feeds to our database and shopping cart template, as well as upload data files and images feeds from third party FTP sites. These business rules enable us to categorize product correctly, guaranteeing that all products and images are properly visible and place correctly, and key word search terms are added on a timely basis to optimize search engine marketing. 

&#160; 

Website Daily Maintenance &#38; Support 

&#160; 

We outsource our Website&#8217;s daily maintenance including new product uploading, shipping code management and updates from various vendors, management of our Access database, daily website HTML support and various updates and edits to the front-end of the website as needed. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

8 | Page 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Website Product Management 

&#160; 

To streamline operations we have a strategic partner responsible for uploading data files and image feeds manually and from third party FTP sites to the Leadingmedicalproducts website. Their responsibilities include categorizing product correctly, guaranteeing that all products and images are properly visible and located in correct sub-categories on our website, making sure that the correct key word search terms are added in our shopping cart for each product, and matching correct shipping code and rates provided by different vendor. 

&#160; 

Customer Service 

&#160; 

There is a knowledge gap and fear today as elder citizens and their families fend for themselves through a range of medical complications. This provides an opportunity for a trusted knowledge service provider who will take the time to listen and solve problems specific to each customer&#8217;s unique product needs and concerns. Many medical needs for senior citizens are chronic, and life-long but are not life threatening. This creates a long term annuity business opportunity. 

&#160; 

Customer Inquiry Management 

&#160; 

We plan to establish an operating team to handle inbound customer calls in the US and Canada during the working hours from 8-8 pm Pacific. We will begin extended hours and provide support service for International inquiries in the second half of our operating year once we develop quality level standards that are consistent across multiple markets. We also plan to launch a live 24-hour nursing service hotline and 24-hour global customers handling by phone, email and chat within the first six months of operations once funding has been obtained. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Level 1 - Simple questions that can be answered on the spot &#8211; i.e. order status, delivery costs, etc. 

&#9679; 

Level 2 - More complex (Needs Analysis) questions &#8211; that require research with the wholesaler about availability, color, dimensions etc 

&#9679; 

Level 3 - Product inquiries (Problem Solving) that for items we do not carry on our site, but may be able to source. This requires significant research and may or may not be worth the investment. Within one-hour from receiving customer call, we will complete research from various vendors if needed, confirm product availability and verify and product questions from the prospective customer 

&#160; 

Customer - Privacy and Security 

&#160; 

Health Advance has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this web site. 

&#160; 

We do not sell customer e-mail address or related information to third parties and unless customers join our mailing list they will not receive advertising e-mails from us. We track IP addresses for security reasons to discourage fraudulent activity attempts. By doing this we are making our customer shopping experience more safe and secure. 

&#160; 

Our site uses cookies to keep track of customers shopping cart for multiple purchases while our customers are shopping with us. We do not require our customers to open an account with us in order to shop so each purchase session usually means you may need to re-enter your information. 

&#160; 

Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information, like their name and email address, and unique identifiers. We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about purchases that have been processed. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary if they have subscribed to the mail list. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings by choosing to unsubscribe. 

&#160; 

This site may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. 

Order Fulfillment 

&#160; 

Our order fulfillment is handling systematically when we are working with vendors whose systems can integrate with Leadingmedicalproducts. However, there are a number of product vendors and wholesalers with whom we have not integrated our systems. 

&#160; 

Currently, management will process any order received. The order fulfillment process entails, checking and monitor for incoming orders (during US business Hours), verifying product inventory availability by calling wholesalers and checking their online catalogue and handling any clarifications with customer before charging their credit card. 

Returns 

&#160; 

We have a general set of standards we use to manage our returns process. Returns are accepted for the full product credit if received at our vendors warehouse within 30 days form the date of purchase. After 30 days, a minimum restocking fee of 15% will be applied to all returns. Merchandise returns are not accepted after 60 days from the date of purchase. Shipping cost refunds will not include reimbursing of the original shipping fees. The return process begins by calling our 1-800-854-7970 number or sending an email to info@healthadvanceinc.com. Return without an authorized number or an expired authorization number will not be accepted. Return merchandise must be in the same unit of measure as originally purchased. Refunds will not be granted for merchandise unsuitable for resale. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

9 | Page 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Sterile items, incontinence, underwear, etc and product that are made unsuitable for resale once opened are not returnable. Defective merchandise will be repaired or replaced based on the manufacturer&#8217;s policy. Our close-out and special orders are not returnable. 

&#160; &#160; 

Shipping 

&#160; 

We will have different drop-ship arrangements with each supplier. Generally we will allow each of our suppliers to decide which shipping company to use for a particular shipment. For domestic shipment orders our suppliers ship via Fedex, UPS Ground or United States Postal Service Priority Mail depending on the size and weight of the order. Small orders generally ship Priority Mail. Large orders generally ship by Fedex. Very small orders, at our discretion, may be sent via First Class Mail with a reduced shipping and handling charge. 

&#160; 

Health Advance offers &#8220;auto-ship&#8221; on frequently consumed items and we currently have an auto-ship program running for Incontinence products. At this time we do not offer free shipping as part of a plan to be as upfront as possible about our pricing while many companies build the shipping price into their products while supposedly offering free shipping. We would like to offer the lowest possible product price therefore we charge separately for shipping so the customer knows the exact cost of the product and the exact cost of the shipping. 

&#160; 

International Shipments 

&#160; 

Shipping charges for international orders vary greatly. For international shipping we have requested that customers email us with the items they are interested in buying with their address and the destination country. We email back international customers with information on ordering, including shipping and handling charges. 

&#160; 

The Leadingmedicalproducts website is also planning to partner with Bongo International Parcel and mail forwarding to service our international customers. Bongo International provides its customers with their very own US address (not a P.O. Box). Once customers have a US address, they will be able to make purchases at our website as well as other US based online retailers. Bongo receives customer orders and logs them into their online system where they are consolidated with other orders. This process saves international customers up to 82% off typical international shipping rates. 

&#160; 

Payment Handling 

&#160; 

We accept payments today on a cash and carry basis that means we do not accept or process Medicare or Medicaid payments. For our website business, Health Advance is setting up a merchant account and processes American Express, Visa, MasterCard, and Discover through the merchant service provider Merchant Warehouse, Inc., and has set up a Paypal account. 

&#160; 

Warranties 

&#160; 

We act as a reseller and as such our product liability is mitigated through the warranty and liability coverage provided by the product manufacturers and distributors we work with. Each of our supplier and manufacturers who sell on our site provide a minimum of a one-year warranty on the products that we sell to protect the consumer from product defects. Health Advance will be an authorized dealer for all of the home medical equipment we sell. This means our customers can buy with knowing that the manufacturers provide their manufacturer&#8217;s warranty behind all the products we sell. Customers receive full warranties from the manufacturers when a customer purchases a product from Health Advance. 

&#160; 

Typically the product manufacturers offer one-year warranty and product coverage parts &#38; labor on any internal-wear of components &#38; control-panel components. Any other product defects are addressed on an as-is basis. Customers can call our Toll-Free telephone number and we will direct them to the needed manufacturer to resolve their product warranty claims within the first year. After the first year we direct our customers directly to the manufacturers. 

&#160; 

At this time we do not sell or offer any extended product warranties on any product we sell. These programs may exist with individual suppliers and from time to time we investigate this option for a customer. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Sales 

&#160; 

Marketing and Brand Recognition 

&#160; 

Strategic communications are central to building and reinforcing the Health Advance brand. The Health Advance advertising, marketing and public relations strategy are expected to be established by the Company&#8217;s management and, where appropriate, implemented with the support of industry professionals. The Company&#8217;s marketing communications strategy will focus on both brand awareness as well as more traditional product/price advertising. Brand awareness advertising will focus on the Company&#8217;s health care services and private label products and is used to communicate to consumers that Health Advance is a market leader in terms of understanding consumer needs and bringing innovative products and services to market. 

&#160; 

Market Segments 

&#160; 

We have two distinct market channel segments: B2B &#8211; hospitals, elderly care facilities, hospitals, nursing facilities, clinics, schools, and private business practices. B2C - nurse practitioners, adult children of senior citizens and increasingly the senior citizens themselves. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Internet Sales and Home Delivery
