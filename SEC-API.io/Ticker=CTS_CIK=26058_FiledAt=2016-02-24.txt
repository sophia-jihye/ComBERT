 Item 1. Business 

CTS Corporation ("CTS", "we", "our", "us" or the "Company") is a global manufacturer of sensors, electronic components, and actuators. CTS was established in 1896 as a provider of high-quality telephone products and was incorporated as an Indiana corporation in February 1929. Our principal executive offices are located in Elkhart, Indiana. 

We design, manufacture, and sell a broad line of sensors, electronic components, and actuators primarily to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") for the transportation, communications, defense and aerospace, medical, industrial, and information technology markets. We operate manufacturing facilities located throughout North America, Asia, and Europe. Sales and marketing are accomplished through our sales engineers, independent manufacturers' representatives, and distributors. 

On October 2, 2013, CTS sold its Electronics Manufacturing Solutions ("EMS") business to Benchmark Electronics, Inc. ("Benchmark") for approximately $75 million in cash. The sale of EMS has allowed CTS to sharpen its focus on its remaining business. The 2013 amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings (Loss) related to EMS have been reported separately as discontinued operations. 

See the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Part II, Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for financial information regarding the Company.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION 

Sales and marketing to OEMs is accomplished through our sales engineers, independent manufacturers' representatives, and distributors. We maintain sales offices in China, Germany, Japan, Scotland, Singapore, India, Taiwan, and the United States. Approximately 90% of 2015 net sales were attributable to our sales engineers. 

Our sales engineers generally service the largest customers with application-specific products. The sales engineers work closely with major customers in designing and developing products to meet specific customer requirements. 

We utilize the services of independent manufacturers' representatives for customers not serviced directly by our sales engineers. Independent manufacturers' representatives receive commissions from CTS. During 2015, approximately 5% of net sales were attributable to independent manufacturers' representatives. We also use independent distributors. Independent distributors purchase products from CTS for resale to customers. In 2015, independent distributors accounted for approximately 5% of net sales.

RAW MATERIALS 

We utilize a wide variety of raw materials and purchased parts in our manufacturing processes. The following are the most significant raw materials and purchased components: 

Conductive inks and contactors, passive electronic components, integrated circuits and semiconductors, certain rare earth elements ("REEs"), ceramic components, plastic components, molding compounds, printed circuit boards and assemblies, quartz blanks and crystals, wire harness assemblies, copper, brass, silver, gold, and steel-based raw materials and components. 

These raw materials and parts are purchased from several vendors, and, except for certain semiconductors, REEs, and conductive inks, we do not believe we are dependent upon one or a limited number of vendors. Although we purchase all of our semiconductors, REEs, and conductive inks from a limited number of vendors, alternative sources are available. 

We do not currently anticipate any significant raw material shortages that would limit production. However, the lead times between the placement of orders for certain raw materials and purchased parts and actual delivery to us may vary. Occasionally, we may need to order raw materials in greater quantities and at higher-than-optimal prices to compensate for the variability of lead times for delivery. 

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, AND LICENSES 

We maintain a program of obtaining and protecting U.S. and non-U.S. patents relating to products that we have designed and manufactured, as well as processes and equipment used in our manufacturing technology. We were issued 11 new U.S. patents and 12 non-U.S. patents in 2015 and currently hold 155 U.S. patents and 133 non-U.S. patents. We have 10 registered U.S. trademarks, 22 registered foreign trademarks and two international trademark registrations. We have licensed the right to use several of our patents. In 2015, license and royalty income was less than 1% of net sales. 

MAJOR CUSTOMERS 

Sales to our 15 largest customers as a percentage of total net sales were as follows:

CTS sells automotive parts to both Honda and Toyota for certain vehicle platforms under purchase agreements that have no volume commitments and are subject to purchase orders issued from time to time. 

No other customer accounted for 10% or more of total net sales during these periods. 

CTS continues to broaden its customer base. Changes in the level of our customers' orders have, in the past, had a significant impact on our operating results. If a major customer reduces the amount of business it does with us, or substantially changes the terms of that business, there could be an adverse impact on our operating results. 

4 &#32;CTS CORPORATION 

Additionally, we expect to continue to depend on sales to our major customers. Because our customers are under no obligation to continue to do business with us on a long-term basis, it is possible that one or more customers may choose to work with a competitor and reduce their business with us. Customers may also reduce or delay their business with us because of economic or other conditions or decisions that reduce their need for our products or services. Since it is difficult to replace lost business on a timely basis, it is likely that our operating results would be adversely affected if one or more of our major customers were to cancel, delay, or reduce a large amount of business with us in the future. If one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay for our products and/or services, our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected. 

ORDER BACKLOG 

Order backlog represents open purchase orders CTS has received from its customers. Order backlog may not provide an accurate indication of present or future revenue levels for CTS. Typically, the period between receipt of orders and expected delivery is relatively short. However, large orders from major customers may include backlog covering an extended period of time. Production scheduling and delivery for these orders could be changed or canceled by the customer on relatively short notice. 

The following table shows order backlog of January 31, 2016 and January 25, 2015.

Order backlog as of the January month-end will generally be recognized into revenue during the same fiscal year. 

COMPETITION 

We compete with many domestic and foreign manufacturers principally on the basis of product features, price, technology, quality, reliability, delivery, and service. Most of our product lines encounter significant global competition. The number of competitors varies from product line to product line. No one competitor competes with us in every product line, but many competitors are larger and more diversified than us. 

Some customers have reduced or plan to reduce their number of suppliers, while increasing the volume of their purchases. Customers demand better cost and higher quality, reliability, and delivery standards from us as well as from our competitors. These trends create opportunities for us, but also increase the risk of loss of business to competitors. We are subject to competitive risks that are typical within the electronics industry, including in some cases short product life cycles and technical obsolescence. 

We believe we compete most successfully in custom engineered products manufactured to meet specific applications of major OEMs. 

NON-U.S. REVENUES AND ASSETS 

Our net sales to external customers originating from non-U.S. operations as a percentage of total net sales were as follows:

A substantial portion of these assets, other than cash and cash equivalents, cannot readily be liquidated. We believe the business risks to our non-U.S. operations, though substantial, are normal risks for global businesses. These risks include currency controls and changes in currency exchange rates, longer collection cycles, political and transportation risks, economic downturns and inflation, government regulations, and expropriation. Our non-U.S. manufacturing facilities are located in Canada (closed in 2015), China, Czech Republic, India, Mexico (Maquiladora) and Taiwan.

Ongoing research and development activity is primarily focused on expanded applications, new product development, and current product and process enhancements. 

We believe a strong commitment to research and development is required for growth. Most of our research and development activities relate to developing new, innovative products and technologies to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We provide our customers with full systems support to ensure quality and reliability through all phases of design, launch, and manufacturing to meet or exceed customer requirements. Many such research and development activities benefit one or a limited number of customers or potential customers. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred. 

EMPLOYEES 

We employed 2,883 people at December 31, 2015, with 74.3% of these employees located outside the U.S. We employed 2,948 people at December 31, 2014. Approximately 190 CTS employees at one location in the United States were covered by two collective bargaining agreements as of December 31, 2015. One agreement, which covers 163 employees, is scheduled to expire in 2018 and the other, which covers 27 employees, is scheduled to expire in 2016.
