You should consider each of the following risk factors and any other information set forth in this Form 10-K and the other Company&#8217;s reports filed with the SEC, including the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and related notes, in evaluating the Company&#8217;s business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that impact the Company&#8217;s operations and business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company, or that the Company currently considers immaterial, may also impair its business or operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, the Company&#8217;s business and financial condition, results or prospects could be harmed.

&#160; 

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY&#8217;S PROSPECTIVE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS 

&#160; 

The Company lacks meaningful operating history and will require substantial capital if it is to be successful. We will require additional funds for our operations. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, we had a working capital deficiency of $675,031. We will require significant cash in order to implement any acquisitions. No assurances can be given that the Company will be able to obtain the necessary funding during this time to make any acquisitions. The inability to raise additional funds will have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, plan of operation and prospects. Acquisitions may be made with cash or our securities or a combination of cash and securities. To the extent that we require cash, we may have to borrow the funds or sell equity securities. The issuance of equity, if available, would result in dilution to our stockholders. We have no commitments from any financing source and we may not be able to raise any cash necessary to complete an acquisition. If we fail to make any acquisitions, our future growth may be limited. If we make any acquisitions, they may disrupt or have a negative impact on our business. 

&#160; 

The terms on which we may raise additional capital may result in significant dilution and may impair our stock price. Because of our cash position, our stock price and our immediate cash requirements, it is difficult for us to raise capital for any acquisition. We cannot be assured that we will be able to get financing on any terms, and, if we are able to raise funds, it may be necessary for us to sell our securities at a price that is at a significant discount from the market price and on other terms which may be disadvantageous to us. In connection with any such financing, we may be required to provide registration rights to the investors and pay damages to the investor in the event that the registration statement is not filed or declared effective by specified dates. The price and terms of any financing which would be available to us could result in both the issuance of a significant number of shares and significant downward pressure on our stock price. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s officers and directors may have conflicts of interest in that they are and may become affiliated with other companies. In addition, the Company&#8217;s officers do not devote full time attention to the Company&#8217;s operations. Until such time that the Company can afford executive compensation commensurate with that being paid in the marketplace, its officers will not devote their full time and attention to the operations of the Company. No assurances can be given as to when the Company will be financially able to engage its officers on a full time basis. 

&#160; 

The loss of key members of our senior management team could adversely affect the execution of our business strategy and our financial results. If any members of our senior management team become unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, our financial results and our business could be materially adversely affected. 

&#160; 

We have had little success with our current business operations and there can be no assurance that our new business venture will be successful. 

&#160; 

We will continue to operate our current business until and unless we secure sufficient financing for WHEH. As WHEH is a developmental stage company, there can be no assurance that WHEH will be able to successfully implement its planned business model. While its officers have significant experience in the field, without proper financing and/or government grants, it is highly unlikely that WHEH will be able to implement its business plan. 

&#160; 

In addition, WHEH faces intense competition from larger, better-capitalized companies. 

&#160; 

We have not voluntarily implemented various corporate governance measures in the absence of which, stockholders may have more limited protections against interested director transactions, conflicts of interest and similar matters. 

&#160; 

Recent Federal legislation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures designed to promote the integrity of the corporate management and the securities markets. Some of these measures have been adopted in response to legal requirements. Others have been adopted by companies in response to the requirements of national securities exchanges, such as the NYSE or The NASDAQ Stock Market, on which their securities are listed. Among the corporate governance measures that are required under the rules of national securities exchanges and NASDAQ are those that address board of directors&#8217; independence, audit committee oversight, and the adoption of a code of ethics. While our board of directors has adopted a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, we have not yet adopted any of these corporate governance measures and, since our securities are not yet listed on a national securities exchange or NASDAQ, we are not required to do so. It is possible that if we were to adopt some or all of these corporate governance measures, shareholders would benefit from somewhat greater assurances that internal corporate decisions were being made by disinterested directors and that policies had been implemented to define responsible conduct. For example, in the absence of audit, nominating and compensation committees comprised of at least a majority of independent directors, decisions concerning matters such as compensation packages to our senior officers and recommendations for director nominees may be made by a majority of directors who have an interest in the outcome of the matters being decided. Prospective investors should bear in mind our current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating their investment decisions.

&#160; 

Provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws may delay or prevent take-over which may not be in the best interest of our stockholders. 

&#160; 

Provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may be deemed to have anti-takeover effects, which include when and by whom special meetings of our stockholders may be called, and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt. In addition, certain provisions of corporate law also may be deemed to have certain anti-takeover effects, which include that control of shares acquired in excess of certain specified thresholds will not possess any voting rights unless these voting rights are approved by a majority of a corporation&#8217;s disinterested stockholders. In addition, our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which 2,500,0000 shares are issued and outstanding as of April 15, 2016, with such rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors. Preferred stock shareholders are entitled to 350 votes for each share held while common stock shareholders are entitled to one vote for each share held. Our board of directors may, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with dividends, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. As a result, our board of directors can issue such stock to investors who support our management and give effective control of our business to our management.

&#160; 

We may be exposed to potential risks relating to our internal controls over financial reporting and our ability to have those controls attested to by our independent auditors. 

&#160; 

Risks Related to the Company&#8217;s Common Stock 

&#160; 

The Company has never paid cash dividends on its common stock and has no plans to do so in the foreseeable future. The Company intends to retain earnings, if any, to develop and expand its business. 

&#160; 

&#8220;Penny stock&#8221; rules may make buying or selling the common stock difficult and severely limit their market and liquidity. 

&#160; 

Trading in the Company&#8217;s common stock is subject to certain regulations adopted by the SEC commonly known as the &#8220;Penny Stock Rules&#8221;. The Company&#8217;s common stock qualifies as penny stock and is covered by Section 15(g) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;1934 Act&#8221;), which imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell the Company&#8217;s common stock in the market. 

&#160; 

The &#8220;Penny Stock Rules&#8221; govern how broker/dealers can deal with their clients and &#8220;penny stock&#8221;. For sales of the Company&#8217;s common stock, the broker/dealer must make a special suitability determination and receive from clients a written agreement prior to making a sale. The additional burdens imposed upon broker/dealers by the &#8220;penny stock&#8221; rules may discourage broker/dealers from effecting transactions in the Company&#8217;s common stock, which could severely limit its market price and liquidity. This could prevent investors from reselling Echo common stock and may cause the price of the common stock to decline. 

&#160; 

Although publicly traded, the Company&#8217;s common stock has substantially less liquidity than the average trading market for a stock quoted on other national exchanges, and our price may fluctuate dramatically in the future. 

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Although the Company&#8217;s common stock is listed for trading on the OTCQX, the trading market in the common stock has substantially less liquidity than the average trading market for companies quoted on other national stock exchanges. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Due to limited trading volume, the market price of the Company&#8217;s common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future, and these fluctuations may be unrelated to the Company&#8217;s performance. General market price declines or overall market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of the Company&#8217;s common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices. 

&#160; 

On October 28, 2011, the National Securities Clearing Corporation exited positions in WHEH common stock from the Continuous Net Settlement System. This &#8220;chill&#8221; on the common stock may hamper trading liquidity in WHEH.
