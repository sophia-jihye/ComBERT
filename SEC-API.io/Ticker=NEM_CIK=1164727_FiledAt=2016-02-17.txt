&#160; 

Products &#160; 

&#160; 

References in this report to &#8220;attributable gold ounces&#8221; or &#8220;attributable copper pounds&#8221; mean that portion of gold or copper produced, sold or included in proven and probable reserves based on our ownership and/or economic interest, unless otherwise noted. 

&#160; 

Gold 

&#160; 

General. We had consolidated gold production of 5.7 million ounces (5.0 million attributable ounces) in 2015, 5.2 million ounces (4.8 million attributable ounces) in 2014 and 5.5 million ounces (5.1 million attributable ounces) in 2013. Of our 2015 consolidated gold production, approximately 29% came from North America, 16% from South America, 41% from Asia Pacific, and 14% from Africa. 

&#160; 

For 2015, 2014 and 2013, 84%, 90% and 91%, respectively, of our Sales were attributable to gold. Most of our Sales come from the sale of refined gold. The end product at our gold operations, however, is generally dor&#233; bars. Dor&#233; is an alloy consisting primarily of gold but also containing silver and other metals. Dor&#233; is sent to refiners to produce bullion that meets the required market standard of 99.95% gold. Under the terms of our refining agreements, the dor&#233; bars are refined for a fee, and our share of the refined gold and the separately-recovered silver is credited to our account or delivered to buyers. Gold sold from Batu Hijau in Indonesia and a portion of the gold from Boddington and Kalgoorlie in Australia and Phoenix in Nevada is sold in a concentrate containing other metals such as copper and silver. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Gold Uses. Gold generally is used for fabrication or investment. Fabricated gold has a variety of end uses, including jewelry, electronics, dentistry, industrial and decorative uses, medals, medallions and official coins. Gold investors buy gold bullion, official coins and jewelry. 

&#160; 

Gold Supply. A combination of mine production, recycling and draw-down of existing gold stocks held by governments, financial institutions, industrial organizations and private individuals make up the annual gold supply. Based on public information available, for the years 2013 through 2015, mine production has averaged over 70% of the annual gold supply.

&#160; 

On February 9, 2016, the afternoon fixing gold price on the London Bullion Market was $1,191 per ounce. 

&#160; 

We generally sell our gold at the prevailing market price during the month in which the gold is delivered to the buyers. We recognize revenue from a sale when the price is determinable, the gold has been delivered, the title has been transferred and collection of the sales price is reasonably assured. 

&#160; 

Copper 

&#160; 

General. We had consolidated copper production of 619 million pounds (365 million attributable pounds) in 2015, 271 million pounds (191 million attributable pounds) in 2014 and 262 million pounds (179 million attributable pounds) in 2013. Copper sales are in the form of concentrate that is sold to smelters for further treatment and refining, and cathode. For 2015, 2014 and 2013, 16%, 10% and 9%, respectively, of our Sales were attributable to copper. 

&#160; 

Copper Uses. Refined copper is incorporated into wire and cable products for use in the construction, electric utility, communications and transportation industries. Copper is also used in industrial equipment and machinery, consumer products and a variety of other electrical and electronic applications and is also used to make brass. Copper substitutes include aluminum, plastics, stainless steel and fiber optics. Refined, or cathode, copper is also an internationally traded commodity. 

&#160; 

Copper Supply. A combination of mine production and recycled scrap material make up the annual copper supply. Mine production since 2013 has accounted for over 80% of total refined production. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Copper Price. The copper price is quoted on the London Metal Exchange in terms of dollars per metric ton of high grade copper.

&#160; 

On February 9, 2016, the high grade copper closing price on the London Metal Exchange was $2.05 per pound. 

&#160; 

We generally sell our copper concentrate based on the monthly average market price for the third month following the month in which the delivery to the smelter takes place. We recognize revenue from a sale when the price is determinable, the concentrate has been loaded on a vessel or received by the smelter, the title has been transferred and collection of the sales price is reasonably assured. For revenue recognition, we use a provisional price based on the estimated forward price of the month of final settlement. The copper concentrate is marked to market through earnings as an adjustment to revenue until final settlement. 

&#160; 

We generally sell our copper cathode based on the weekly average market price for the week following production. Title is transferred upon loading of the buyer&#8217;s truck. 

&#160; 

Gold and Copper Processing Methods 

&#160; 

Gold is extracted from naturally-oxidized ores by either milling or heap leaching, depending on the amount of gold contained in the ore, the amenability of the ore to treatment and related capital and operating costs. Higher grade oxide ores are generally processed through mills, where the ore is ground into a fine powder and mixed with water into a slurry, which then passes through a carbon-in-leach circuit. Lower grade oxide ores are generally processed using heap leaching. Heap leaching consists of stacking crushed or run-of-mine ore on impermeable pads, where a weak cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold. In both cases, the gold-bearing solution is then collected and pumped to process facilities to remove the gold by collection on carbon or by zinc precipitation. 

&#160; 

Gold contained in ores that are not naturally-oxidized can be directly milled if the gold is liberated and amenable to cyanidation, generally known as free milling ores. Ores that are not amenable to cyanidation, known as refractory ores, require more costly and complex processing techniques than oxide or free milling ore. Higher grade refractory ores are processed through either roasters or autoclaves. Roasters heat finely ground ore to a high temperature, burn off the carbon and oxidize the sulfide minerals that prevent efficient leaching. Autoclaves use heat, oxygen and pressure to oxidize sulfide ores. 

&#160; 

Some gold sulfide ores may be processed through a flotation plant or by bio-milling. In flotation, ore is finely ground, turned into slurry, then placed in a tank known as a flotation cell. Chemicals are added to the slurry causing the gold-containing sulfides to attach to air bubbles and float to the top of the tank. The sulfides are removed from the cell and converted into a concentrate that can then be processed in an autoclave or roaster to recover the gold. Bio-milling incorporates patented technology that involves inoculation of suitable crushed ore on an impermeable leach pad with naturally occurring bacteria strains, which oxidize the sulfides over a period of time. The ore is then processed through an oxide mill. 

&#160; 

At Batu Hijau, ore containing copper and gold is crushed to a coarse size at the mine and then transported from the mine via conveyor to a concentrator, where it is finely ground and then treated by successive stages of flotation, resulting in a copper/gold concentrate containing approximately 26% to 29% copper. The concentrate is dewatered and stored for loading onto ships for transport to smelters. 

&#160; 

&#160;

At Boddington and Phoenix, ore containing copper and gold is crushed to a coarse size at the mine and then transported via conveyor to a process plant, where it is further crushed and then finely ground as a slurry. The ore is initially treated by successive stages of flotation resulting in a copper/gold concentrate containing approximately 15% to 20% copper. Flotation concentrates are also processed via a gravity circuit to recover fine liberated gold and then dewatered and stored for loading onto ships or rail for transport to smelters. The flotation tailings have a residual gold content that is recovered in a carbon-in-leach circuit. 

&#160; 

In addition, at Phoenix, copper heap leaching is performed on copper oxide ore and enriched copper sulfide ore to produce copper cathodes. Heap leaching is accomplished by stacking uncrushed ore onto impermeable, synthetically lined pads where it is contacted with a dilute sulfuric acid solution thus leaching the acid soluble minerals into a copper sulfate solution. The copper sulfate solution is then collected and pumped to the solvent extraction (&#8220;SX&#8221;) plant. The SX process consists of two steps. During the first step, the copper is extracted into an organic solvent solution. The loaded organic solution is then pumped to the second step where copper is stripped with a strong acid solution before being sent through the electrowinning (&#8220;EW&#8221;) process. Cathodes produced in electrowinning are 99.99% copper. 

&#160; 

Hedging Activities &#160; 

&#160; 

Our strategy is to provide shareholders with leverage to gold and copper prices by selling our gold and copper at spot market prices and consequently, we do not hedge our gold and copper sales. We continue to manage certain risks associated with commodity input costs and foreign currencies using the derivative market. 

&#160;

Gold, Copper and Silver Reserves &#160; 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, we had 73.7 million attributable ounces of proven and probable gold reserves. We reduced proven and probable reserves by 5.1 million ounces of revisions, depleted 6.5 million ounces, acquired 4.0 million ounces and divested 0.3 million ounces during 2015. Reserves at December 31, 2015 were calculated at a gold price assumption of $1,200 or A$1,500 per ounce. A reconciliation of the changes in attributable proven and probable gold reserves during the past three years is as follows:

Our exploration efforts are directed to the discovery of new M ineralized M aterial and converting it into proven and probable reserves. We conduct near-mine exploration around our existing mines and greenfields exploration in other regions globally. Near-mine exploration can result in the discovery of additional deposits, which may receive the economic benefit of existing operating, processing, and administrative infrastructures. In contrast, the discovery of mineralization through greenfields exploration efforts will require capital investment to build a stand-alone operation. Our Exploration expense was $156, $164 and $247 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Licenses and Concessions &#160; 

&#160; 

Other than operating licenses for our mining and processing facilities, there are no third party patents, licenses or franchises material to our business. In many countries, however, we conduct our mining and exploration activities pursuant to concessions granted by, or under contracts with, the host government. These countries include, among others, the United States, Australia, Ghana, Indonesia, Peru and Suriname. The concessions and contracts are subject to the politica l risks associated with operations. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, below. For a more detailed description of our Indonesian Contract of Work, see Item 2, Properties, below. 

&#160; 

Condition of Physical Assets and Insurance &#160; 

&#160; 

Our business is capital intensive and requires ongoing capital investment for the replacement, modernization or expansion of equipment and facilities. For more information, see Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources, below. 

&#160; 

We maintain insurance policies against property loss and business interruption and insure against risks that are typical in the operation of our business, in amounts that we believe to be reasonable. Such insurance, however, contains exclusions and limitations on coverage, particularly with respect to environmental liability and political risk. There can be no assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance policies in connection with a particular event. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, below. 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters &#160; 

&#160; 

Our United States mining and exploration activities are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, including the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act; the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act; the Endangered Species Act; the Federal Land Policy and Management Act; the National Environmental Policy Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and related state laws. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. Our activities outside the United States are also subject to various levels of governmental regulations for the protection of the environment and, in some cases, those regulations can be as, or more, restrictive than those in the United States. 

&#160; 

We conduct our operations so as to protect public health and the environment and believe our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. Each operating mine has a reclamation plan in place that meets all applicable 

&#160;

legal and regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2015, $1,553 was accrued for reclamation costs relating to current or recently producing properties. 

&#160; 

We are involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former, primarily historic, mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites. Based upon our best estimate of our liability for these matters, $318 was accrued at December 31, 2015 for such obligations associated with properties previously owned or operated by us or our subsidiaries. The amounts accrued for these matters are reviewed periodically based upon facts and circumstances available at the time. 

&#160; 

For a discussion of the most significant reclamation and remediation activities, see Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Consolidated Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 5 and Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

In addition to legal and regulatory compliance, we have developed complementary programs to guide our Company toward achieving transparent and sustainable environmental and socially responsible performance objectives. In support of our management&#8217;s commitment towards these objectives, our corporate headquarters are located in an environmentally sustainable, LEED, gold-certified building. We are committed to managing climate change related risks and responsibly managing our greenhouse gas emissions. We have publicly reported our greenhouse gas emissions since 2004 to the Carbon Disclosure Project (now known only as CDP). Our greenhouse gas emissions are independently verified to satisfy all the requirements for emissions reporting under ISO International Standard 14064-3:2006. We actively participate in the International Council on Mining and Metals (&#8220;ICMM&#8221;) and are committed to the ICMM&#8217;s 10 Principles of Sustainable Development and its commitment to implement the UN Global Compact's 10 principles on human rights, bribery and corruption, labor and the environment. In 2015, all Newmont operated sites maintained their certification as ISO 14001 compliant, except for Akyem in Ghana. Akyem began production in late 2013 and is currently working through the process to achieve its ISO 14001 certification by mid-year 2016. We transparently report on our sustainability performance in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative &#8220; GRI &#8221; guidelines, including the Mining and Metals Sector Supplement to meet the requirements of GRI Application Level A+. In 2015, the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index (DJSI World) ranked Newmont as the mining industry&#8217;s leader in overall sustainability, marking the ninth consecutive year the Company has been included on the index. Newmont also received the highest score in the mining sector across a number of areas measured by the index including climate strategy; environmental policy/management systems; corporate citizenship and philanthropy; and labor practices and human rights. As of the end of 2015, all of our relevant sites were certified through the International Cyanide Management Code (ICMC), or in the process for re-certification by independent auditors. The Long Canyon and Merian Projects, both in construction now, are planned to be audited under the ICMC within one year of commercial production. 

&#160; 

Health and Safety &#160; 

&#160; 

We conduct our operations so as to protect the health and safety (&#8220;H&#38;S&#8221;) of our employees and contractors and believe that our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. In addition, the Company has an established Health &#38; Safety Management System and Technical Standards that in most cases exceed the regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The quality of our Health &#38; Safety Management System is audited regularly as part of our assurance and governance process. 

&#160; 

In early 2013, Newmont set a five-year target to lead the industry in H&#38;S performance as measured by zero fatalities and the lowest Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate and Occupational Illness Rate among its peers in the ICMM. To achieve our five-year target and embed a culture of Zero Harm, Newmont has centered its H&#38;S activities on four key focus areas: health and safety leadership, fatality prevention, behaviors and engagement and occupational health and wellness. 

&#160; 

Managing fatal and health risks remains a core component of our Safety Journey. In 2015, Newmont introduced a process to assess the effectiveness of critical controls that are in place to manage significant safety and health risks. This critical management process requires sites to identify risks, select team members across all levels, determine the critical controls, verify the controls&#8217; effectiveness and develop improvement plans where and when needed. 

&#160; 

Visible felt leadership is being demonstrated through Safety Shares, Personal Safety Plans and by undertaking quality Safety Interactions in the field. Our frontline leaders are a vital link in our safety programs and we have continued work which began in 2014 to improve their competencies in vital safety areas through the Safety Leadership Coaching Program. Our workforce has been engaged through Newmont&#8217;s Safety Journey programs (My Safety Journey and Vital Behaviors) toward providing the leadership competencies and the focus on individual contributions as safety leaders. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Externally we strive to help improve the overall safety performance of the mining industry and actively participate in the ICMM Health &#38; Safety Committee, the Mining Safety Round Table, the National Mining Association&#8217;s CORESafety program, Earth Moving Equipment Safety Round Table and other industry bodies promoting Health &#38; Safety in mining. 

&#160; 

Employees and Contractors &#160; 

&#160; 

Approximately 15,600 people were employed by Newmont and Newmont subsidiaries at December 31, 2015. In addition, approximately 16,800 people were working as contractors in support of Newmont&#8217;s operations at December 31, 2015.
