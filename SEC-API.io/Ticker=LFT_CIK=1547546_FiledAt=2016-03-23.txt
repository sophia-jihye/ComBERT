 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

General 

&#160;

We are a Maryland corporation that, with its subsidiaries, is focused on investing on a leveraged basis in mortgage and other real estate-related assets, particularly residential mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities, or MBS. We were formed in March 2012 and commenced operations in May 2012; we completed our initial public offering, or our IPO, in March 2013. Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., or the NYSE, under the symbol &#8220;OAKS&#8221; and our Series A Preferred Stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol &#8220;OAKS-PRA&#8221;. For information regarding our subsidiaries and their operations as well as for the geographical concentrations of the mortgage loans underlying certain of our assets, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and the Notes to our consolidated financial statements. 

&#160;

2015 and Subsequent Events 

&#160;

&#183; We reported an economic loss on common equity of 8.4%, comprised of a $2.35 decrease in net book value per share that more than offset a $1.35 dividend per common share. This loss is largely attributable to market volatility, and particularly credit spread widening, in the second half of 2015. &#160;

&#183; Reflecting our continued concern with market volatility in general, and credit market conditions in particular, we reduced our Non-Agency RMBS exposure from $303.4 million at December 31, 2014 to $121.5 million at December 31, 2015. Consistent with our more defensive investment approach, we increased our overall Agency RMBS assets from $314.8 million at December 31, 2014 to $375.3 million at December 31, 2015, approximately 96% of which is represented by Agency hybrid ARMS. See Item 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; for a further discussion of our defensive approach and its implications. &#160;

&#183; On November 10, 2015, we completed our fourth prime jumbo securitization, and the second off our proprietary program &#8211; Oaks Mortgage Trust 2015-2. The $251.3 million transaction was led by Barclays and Credit Suisse. &#160;

&#183; On December 15, 2015, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $10 million, in light of the significant discount to book value at which our stock had been trading during the latter part of 2015. As of December 31, 2015, we had repurchased 68,356 shares at an average per share price of $5.27. &#160;

&#183; On February 12, 2016, the Federal Housing Finance Authority (FHFA) adopted a final rule revising its regulations governing Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) membership. The rule requires that our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary wind down its transactions and terminate its membership with FHLB-Indianapolis on or before February 19, 2017. We have already repaid in full the $49.7 million of advances that were outstanding at December 31, 2015, via the use of regular repurchase agreements, and have initiated the redemption of our FHLB stock with a stated value of $2.4 million. &#160;

Investment Strategy 

&#160;

Our objective is to provide attractive cash flow returns over time to our investors, and to generate income through our mortgage loan acquisition and securitization business. To achieve these objectives, we currently invest in the following assets:

&#160;

&#183; Agency RMBS, which are residential mortgage-backed securities, for which a U.S. Government agency such as Ginnie Mae or a federally chartered corporation such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, guarantees payments of principal and interest on the securities. &#160;

&#183; Securitizations backed by multi-family mortgage loans, or Multi-Family MBS &#160;

&#183; Residential mortgage loans and other mortgage-related investments, including mortgage servicing rights, or MSRs; and &#160;

&#183; Non-Agency RMBS, which are RMBS that are not issued or guaranteed by a U.S. Government-sponsored entity. &#160;

1&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We finance our current investments in Agency RMBS, Multi-Family MBS, residential mortgage loans and Non-Agency RMBS primarily through short-term borrowings structured as repurchase agreements. Our primary sources of income are net interest income from our investment portfolio and non-interest income from our mortgage loan-related activities. Net interest income represents the interest income we earn on investments less the expenses of funding and hedging these investments. Income from our aggregation and securitization activities represents the profit we seek to generate from the acquisition of loans and their subsequent sale or securitization.

&#160; 

Our Available-for-Sale Portfolio 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, our portfolio was comprised of 64.4% Agency RMBS, 17.9% Multi-Family MBS, 1.9% residential mortgage loans and 15.8% Non-Agency RMBS on a United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, basis, or 53.8% Agency RMBS, 27.2% Multi-Family MBS including our net investment in Multi-Family securitization trusts on a non-GAAP basis, 1.6% residential mortgage loans and 17.4% Non-Agency RMBS including our net investment in residential mortgage loan securitization trusts on a non-GAAP basis As further described below, as of December 31, 2015, we have determined that we were the primary beneficiary of two Multi-Family MBS securitization trusts and two residential mortgage loan securitization trusts, based in each case on our ownership of all or substantially all of the most subordinated, or first-loss, tranches in each transaction. Although our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 includes the gross assets and liabilities of the four trusts, the assets of each trust are restricted and can only be used to fulfill the obligations of the individual entity. And we are only exposed to the risk of loss on our net investment in the trusts. We therefore have also presented certain information that includes our net investments in the Multi-Family MBS and residential mortgage loan securitization trusts. This information constitutes non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K, as promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. We believe that this non-GAAP information enhances the ability of investors to analyze our MBS portfolio and the performance of our MBS in the same way that we assess our portfolio and such assets.

&#160;

Prime Jumbo Residential Whole Loans 

&#160;

In June 2013, we established Five Oaks Acquisition Corp., or FOAC, as a Taxable REIT Subsidiary, or TRS, to increase the range of our investments in mortgage-related assets. After acquiring its first residential mortgage loans in May 2014, FOAC completed two third-party securitizations in 2014. Having completed the set-up of its own proprietary program in early 2015, FOAC completed two securitizations from its program during the year, Oaks Mortgage Trust Series 2015-1 and Series 2015-2, into which FOAC sold $518.5 million of loans. FOAC currently has, and at December 31, 2015 had, $275 million of warehouse financing available to it, of which $125 million is currently subject to renewal negotiations. 

&#160; 

Multi-Family MBS 

&#160;

While multi-family securitizations are generally considered to be commercial mortgage-backed securities, the demographic, geographic and credit risk analyses necessary to evaluate such securities share many similarities with the investment analyses that we undertake for Non-Agency RMBS. Multi-Family MBS securitizations, particularly those sponsored by Freddie Mac and known as the K series, have historically exhibited positive credit characteristics.

&#160;

Financing Strategy 

&#160;

We use leverage to seek to increase potential returns to our stockholders by borrowing against existing assets through short-term repurchase agreements, and in the future we may utilize longer-term secured financings, in each case, using the proceeds to acquire additional assets. Financing of Agency RMBS, Multi-Family MBS, residential mortgage loans and Non-Agency RMBS is generally available through, among other vehicles, short-term repurchase agreements. Haircuts, or the discount attributed to the value of securities sold under repurchase agreements, average between 3% and 55% across all our borrowing facilities, and an average of 14.7%, as of December 31, 2015, depending on the specific security or loan used as collateral for such repurchase agreements.

&#160;

Neither our organizational documents nor our investment guidelines place any limit on the maximum amount of leverage that we may use, and we are not required to maintain any particular debt-to-equity leverage ratio. We may continue to change our financing strategy and leverage without the consent of our stockholders. Depending on the different cost of borrowing funds at different maturities, we vary the maturities of our borrowed funds to attempt to produce lower borrowing costs and reduce interest rate risk. Generally, we seek to enter into collateralized borrowings only with institutions that are rated investment grade by at least one nationally-recognized statistical rating organization. Going forward, as we seek to continue expanding the range of available financing sources, we have borrowed and may continue to borrow from institutions that, although not rated investment grade by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization, in the assessment of our management team represent an acceptable counterparty credit risk in providing collateralized financing for our portfolio.

&#160;

2&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The goal of our leverage strategy is to ensure that, at all times, our investment portfolio&#8217;s leverage ratio is appropriate for the level of risk inherent in the investment portfolio and that each asset class has individual leverage targets that are appropriate for its potential price volatility.

&#160; 

Hedging Strategy 

&#160;

As part of our risk management strategy, our Manager actively manages the financing, interest rate, credit, prepayment and convexity risks associated with holding a portfolio of Agency and Non-Agency RMBS, Multi-Family MBS and other mortgage-related investments. We rely on our Manager to manage these risks on our behalf, and, subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, our Manager may incorporate various hedging, asset/liability risk management and credit risk mitigation techniques in order to facilitate our risk management.

&#160;

Interest Rate Risk. We hedge some of our exposure to potential interest rate mismatches between the interest we earn on our longer term investments and the borrowing costs on our shorter term borrowings. Because a majority of our leverage will continue to be in the form of repurchase agreements, our financing costs will fluctuate based on short-term interest rate indices, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR. Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, the hedging techniques utilized may include interest rate swap agreements, interest rate swaptions, interest rate caps or floor contracts, futures or forward contracts and other derivative securities.

&#160;

Prepayment Risk. Because residential borrowers are able to prepay their mortgage loans at par at any time, we face the risk that we will experience a return of principal on our investments earlier than anticipated, and we may have to re-invest that principal at potentially lower yields. In order to manage our prepayment and interest rate risks, we monitor, among other things, our &#8220;duration gap&#8221; and our convexity exposure. Duration is the relative expected percentage change in market value of our assets that would be caused by a parallel change in short and long-term interest rates. Convexity exposure relates to the way the duration of a mortgage security changes when the interest rate and prepayment environment changes.

&#160;

Credit Risk. We intend to accept mortgage credit exposure at levels our Manager deems prudent as an integral part of our diversified investment strategy. Therefore, we retain the risk of potential credit losses on the loans underlying the Non-Agency RMBS we hold. We will seek to manage this risk through prudent asset selection, pre-acquisition due diligence, post-acquisition performance monitoring, sale of assets which we identify as experiencing negative credit trends, the use of various types of credit enhancements, and by using non-recourse financing. Nevertheless, actual credit losses could adversely affect our operating results.

&#160;

Our Manager 

&#160;

We are externally managed and advised by Oak Circle Capital Partners LLC, pursuant to a management agreement between us and Oak Circle. Oak Circle, which was formed for the purpose of becoming our Manager, manages us exclusively and, unless and until Oak Circle agrees to manage any additional investment vehicle, it will not have to allocate investment opportunities in our target assets with any other REIT, investment pool or other entity. As our Manager, Oak Circle implements our business strategy, performs investment advisory services and activities with respect to our assets and is responsible for performing all of our day-to-day operations. Oak Circle is an investment adviser registered with the SEC.

&#160;

Our Manager is majority owned by its employees (including all of our officers) with a minority stake held by XL Global Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of XL Group plc (NYSE: XL). XL Group plc, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, is a global insurance and reinsurance company with total assets of $58.7 billion and a market capitalization of $11.5 billion as of December 31, 2015, and actively invests in alternative investment funds, private investment funds and investment management companies. As of March 4, 2015, XL Investments, together with XL Global, Inc., owned 21.99% of our common stock (or 35.66% after giving effect to the exercise of warrants owned by XL Investments in full, which became exercisable on July 25, 2013 (120 days following the closing of our IPO)).

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Competition &#160;

&#160;

We operate in a highly competitive market for available financing facilities and investment opportunities. Our profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to acquire RMBS, Multi-Family MBS, residential mortgage loans, MSRs and other mortgage related investments at favorable prices. In acquiring these assets, we will compete with a variety of institutional investors, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, public and private funds, hedge funds, commercial and investment banks, commercial finance and insurance companies and other financial institutions. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. Some competitors have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources (including the FHLB system) that are not available to us, such as funding from the U.S. Government. Many of our competitors are not subject to the operating constraints associated with REIT tax compliance or maintenance of an exclusion from the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us.

&#160;

Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations and Our Status as a REIT 

&#160;

We elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our short taxable year ended December 31, 2012, and comply with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code, with respect thereto. Accordingly, we are generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax on our REIT taxable income that we currently distribute to our stockholders so long as we maintain our qualification as a REIT. Our continued qualification as a REIT depends on our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various complex requirements under the Internal Revenue Code relating to, among other things, the source of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the concentration of ownership of our capital stock. Even if we maintain our qualification as a REIT, we may be subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income.

&#160;

Taxable income generated by our TRS is subject to regular corporate income tax. For the fiscal year 2015, our TRS did not generate any taxable income.

&#160;

Qualification as a REIT 

&#160;

Continued qualification as a REIT requires that we satisfy a variety of tests relating to our income, assets, distributions and ownership. The significant tests are summarized below.

&#160;

Income Tests . In order to maintain our REIT qualification, we must satisfy two gross income requirements on an annual basis. First, at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year, excluding gross income from sales of inventory or dealer property in &#8220;prohibited transactions&#8221; (as defined herein), discharge of indebtedness and certain hedging transactions, generally must be derived from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property, including interest income derived from mortgage loans secured by real property (including certain types of mortgage-backed securities), and gains from the sale of designated real estate assets, as well as specified income from temporary investments. Second, at least 95% of our gross income in each taxable year, excluding gross income from &#8220;prohibited transactions&#8221;, discharge of indebtedness and certain hedging transactions, must be derived from some combination of income that qualifies under the 75% gross income test described above, as well as other dividends, interest, and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities, which need not have any relation to real property. Income and gain from certain hedging transactions will be excluded from both the numerator and the denominator for purposes of both the 75% and 95% gross income tests.

&#160;

Asset Tests . At the close of each calendar quarter, we must also satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets. First, at least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by some combination of designated real estate assets, cash, cash items, U.S. Government securities and, under some circumstances, stock or debt instruments purchased with new capital. Assets that do not qualify for purposes of the 75% asset test are subject to the additional asset tests described below. Second, the value of any one issuer&#8217;s securities that we own may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets. Third, we may not own more than 10% of any one issuer&#8217;s outstanding securities, or the 10% of value asset test, as measured by either value or voting power. The 5% and 10% asset tests do not apply to securities of a TRS and qualified REIT subsidiaries and the 10% of value asset test does not apply to &#8220;straight debt&#8221; having specified characteristics and to certain other securities described below. Fourth, the aggregate value of all securities of TRSs that we hold may not exceed 25% of the value of our total assets.

&#160;

Distribution Requirements . In order to maintain our REIT qualification, we are required to distribute dividends, other than capital gain dividends, to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to: (1) the sum of (a) 90% of our REIT taxable income computed without regard to our net capital gains and the deduction for dividends paid, and (b) 90% of our net income, if any, (after tax) from foreclosure property; minus (2) the sum of specified items of non-cash income that exceeds a certain percentage of our income.

&#160;

Ownership . In order to maintain our REIT status, we must not be deemed to be closely held and must have more than 100 shareholders. The closely held prohibition requires that not more than 50% of the value of our outstanding shares be owned by five or fewer &#8220;individuals&#8221; (as defined for this purpose to include certain trusts and foundations) during the last half of our taxable year. The &#8220;more than 100 shareholders&#8221; rule requires that we have at least 100 shareholders for at least 335 days of a taxable year. Failure to satisfy either of these rules would subject us to fines and require us to take curative action to meet the ownership requirements in order to maintain our REIT status.

&#160;
