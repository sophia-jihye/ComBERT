 ITEM 1: BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Introduction 

&#160;

We design and are developing technologies for the purpose of improving key performance characteristics of combustion systems, including emission and operational performance, energy efficiency and overall cost-effectiveness. Our patent-pending Duplex&#8482; and Electrodynamic Combustion Control&#8482; (ECC&#8482;) platform technologies enhance the performance of combustion systems in a broad range of markets, including the refinery, petrochemical, chemical, power and commercial boiler industries. Our Duplex technology uses a porous ceramic tile above a standard burner to significantly reduce flame length and achieve very low emissions without the need for external flue gas recirculation, selective catalytic reduction, or excess air systems. Our ECC technology introduces a computer-controlled high voltage electric field into a combustion volume in order to better control gas-phase chemical reactions and improve system performance and cost-effectiveness. To date, our operations have been funded primarily through sales of our common stock. We have earned no significant revenue since inception in 2008.

&#160;

While we have not yet commercialized our Duplex or ECC technologies and our technologies have not been tested or verified by any independent third party, based on the results of our testing, we believe that our proprietary technology platforms may improve emissions control performance and operational performance for many types of industrial and commercial combustion systems. As a result, we also believe that our technologies may reduce costs associated with the construction (including refurbishment and upgrade), operation and maintenance of these combustion systems as compared to combustion systems that use no or alternative technology to enhance combustion and control emissions.

&#160;

Based on the results of our testing, we believe our technologies compare favorably with current industry-standard air pollution control technologies, such as selective catalytic reduction devices, low- and ultra-low NOx burners (which address nitrogen oxides or NOx), excess air systems and other similar technologies. Such systems are used in our current target market segments of petroleum refining and petrochemical process heaters, package and utility boilers and large-scale once through steam generators (OTSGs).

&#160;

Corporate History 

&#160;

We were incorporated in Washington on January 23, 2008. The address of our corporate headquarters is 12870 Interurban Avenue South, Seattle, Washington 98168 and our telephone number is (206) 673-4848. Our website can be accessed at www.clearsign.com . The information contained on or that may be obtained from our website is not a part of this report. All of our operations are located in the United States.

&#160;

Our Industry 

&#160;

The combustion and emissions control markets are significant, both in the wide array of industries in which the systems are used and in the amount of money spent in installing and upgrading systems. The Energy Information Administration of the U.S. Department of Energy determined in its 2014 Annual Energy Outlook that the world&#8217;s industrial sector consumed 165 quadrillion British thermal units (BTUs) of hydrocarbon fuels. These are used to provide heat for all manner of industrial processes, including boilers, furnaces, kilns and turbines. In order to maximize energy efficiency while keeping pace with regulatory guidelines for air pollution emissions, operators of these systems are continually installing, maintaining and upgrading a variety of costly process control, air pollution control and monitoring systems. Although we believe that there are many potential markets for our technologies, to date we have limited the introduction of our technologies to market segments that include petroleum refining and petrochemical process heaters, package boilers, and OTSGs.

&#160; 

Our Technologies 

&#160; 

We are pursuing development of our technologies to enable future sales. These activities entail (i) field development projects in the case of our Duplex technology where we have successfully demonstrated our proprietary technology operating in our field testing with thermal output of up to 52 million BTU/hr, (ii) laboratory research in the case of our ECC technology where we have demonstrated certain attributes of our proprietary technology operating in our research facility with thermal output of up to 2 million BTU/hr, and (iii) business development and marketing activities with established entities that use steam generators, process heaters, boilers, solid fuel burners, and other combustion systems as well as original equipment manufacturers. We intend to continue to enter into collaborative arrangements, such as those described below, which would enable us to work closely with established companies in targeted industries to apply solutions developed in our laboratory and field settings.

&#160;

Field Testing of our Duplex Technology in Once-Through Steam Generators 

&#160;

After performing testing on our Duplex technology in our laboratory furnace with thermal output up to 5 million BTU/hr, we commenced field development work in the fourth quarter of 2014 with an oil field operator in Southern California to demonstrate and test the Duplex technology in an OTSG with a thermal output ranging from 40 to 62.5 million BTU/hr used to facilitate a thermally enhanced oil recovery process in California&#8217;s San Joaquin Valley. To date, we have tested an OTSG at a rate of 52 million BTU/hr and met the requirements of San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District&#8217;s Rule 4320, Advance Emission Reduction Options for Boilers, Steam Generators and Process Heaters Greater Than 5.0 MMBtu/hr, which prohibits NOx emissions exceeding 5 ppm (corrected at 3% O 2 ). These results were achieved without major modifications to the burner or the need for flue gas recirculation (FGR). During testing, the OTSG unit continued to supply steam at the capacity and quality required for oil field operations. Our agreement with this operator includes time-sensitive pricing, delivery and installation terms, if elected, that will apply to future purchases of this Duplex application. In September 2015, this operator placed an order to retrofit our Duplex technology in a second OTSG unit. Subject to final approval of the design, we expect the retrofit to be completed in 2016.

&#160;

In May 2015, we received an order from an independent Southern California oil producer to retrofit a 25 million BTU/hr OTSG with our Duplex technology. The installation is expected to be completed 2016.

&#160;

Based upon our results to date, we observed a thermal efficiency improvement in OTSGs of approximately 1% when compared to a baseline case with a conventional low NOx burner without FGR. OTSG systems typically operate with FGR to lower NOx emissions. FGR, however, penalizes thermal efficiency, increasing fuel and electricity costs. We estimate that Duplex, compared to systems operating with FGR, will provide an overall energy savings of as much as 3-4% which could represent a significant reduction in annual operating expense depending on variables such as the thermal output of the OTSG and the market price for natural gas and electricity. Further, compliance with current emissions standards would eliminate the cost of any fines associated with the retrofitted operations. We continue to conduct testing to address additional performance criteria in order to further validate the environmental and operational benefits of our Duplex technology.

&#160;

Field Testing of our Duplex Technology in Wellhead Enclosed Flares 

&#160;

In February 2016, we received an order through an intermediary, acting on behalf of a large Southern California oil producer, for installation in wellhead enclosed flares for the purpose of evaluating Duplex as a solution to the oil producer's NOx emissions challenges. We expect to deliver the first unit in 2016. Assuming that testing of the initial unit is successful, payment for the unit will be made and the oil producer plans to purchase four additional units at pre-determined prices approximating $1 million.

&#160; 

Field Testing of our Duplex Technology in Refinery Process Heaters 

&#160;

In August 2015, we executed an agreement with Tesoro Refining &#38; Marketing Company LLC, a subsidiary of Tesoro Corporation, to evaluate our Duplex technology in a multiple-burner process heater located in Tesoro&#8217;s Los Angeles area refinery. The Duplex technology performance will be evaluated based on several performance criteria, including NOx emission criteria determined by California&#8217;s South Coast Air Quality Management District. The first phase of the project, involving initial design, was completed under a fixed price agreement in 2015. Future phases of the project are subject to approval of the design by Tesoro.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In September 2015, we executed an agreement with a subsidiary of Delek US Holdings, Inc. to install our Duplex technology in a process heater located in Delek&#8217;s Tyler, Texas refinery. The Duplex installation is being installed to eliminate potential flame impingement upon process tubes and reduce maintenance costs and downtime. The installation is expected to be completed in 2016.

&#160;

We previously executed two agreements regarding field tests related to process heaters with thermal outputs ranging from 12 to 15 million BTU/hr with two separate petroleum refineries in the San Joaquin Valley. Pursuant to each agreement, if we are able to retrofit the process heaters in accordance with the specifications set forth in the agreements, the refineries will purchase Duplex systems from us. These refineries have no other financial obligations under the agreements. We have commenced field testing in one of the refineries and expect to complete the projects in 2016.

&#160;

We intend to continue field validation of our Duplex technology in order to produce sufficient data to demonstrate product attributes and dependability.

&#160;

Laboratory Research of our ECC Technology 

&#160;

We continue to conduct solid fuel laboratory testing of our ECC technology in conjunction with six parties who contributed, in 2014 and 2015 combined, an aggregate of $125,000 to our research. If successful, this would create a basis for further focused laboratory studies prior to any field demonstrations. There is no assurance that additional research funds will be received, terms relating to further research will be reached, or a final agreement for additional research or laboratory studies will be executed between us and any of these six parties. 

&#160;

Technical Components of our Duplex and ECC Technologies 

&#160; 

Our Duplex burner technology typically consists of a traditional industrial burner and a porous ceramic tile. When the uncombusted mix of gaseous fuel and air is directed at the tile, hot gas combusts within the tile itself. Because the fuel and air have more time to mix, the NOx- forming hot spots that are typically produced in an open flame are greatly eliminated and a dramatically shorter flame is produced. NOx, a regulated pollutant comprised largely of nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide, is greatly reduced without any external fans or associated power, thereby minimizing harmful emissions while improving system efficiency. A shorter flame allows for improved heat transfer and operation of the furnace at a higher capacity since it reduces the possibility of flame impingement and coking in a combustion chamber.

&#160;

Our ECC technology consists, in its simplest form, of four major components: (a) a computer, (b) standard software delivering proprietary algorithms to (c) a power amplifier (resident outside the combustion chamber) and (d) electrodes inside the combustion chamber. ECC introduces a high voltage electric field into the combustion process to control the resulting flames electrically through the naturally forming ions. The electrodes are optimized in material and shape to best suit the specific geometry of a given installation. We have also demonstrated a technique to apply ECC to a combustion system without requiring an electrode to have physical contact with the flame. Based on our research and demonstrations, we believe ECC to be ideally suited to solid fuel combustion.

&#160;

The basic components of both systems are either available &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; or require manufacturing techniques that are well within the current state of the art. Thus, our products are readily available and scalable for high volume demand.

&#160;

We believe our technologies can be retrofitted to existing combustion systems to improve their performance and have the potential to provide substantial savings in both capital and operating costs, or, for new-builds, can serve as the basis for fundamental improvements in the design, cost and operation of combustion systems.

&#160;

&#160; 

Research and Development Plan 

&#160; 

We have tested aspects of our Duplex and ECC technologies in our laboratory on our 1 million and 5 million BTU/hr research furnaces, our 1 million BTU/hr boiler simulator, and our 1 million BTU/hr solid fuel furnace. We have installed our Duplex technology in three field test sites: two OTSG applications and one process heater. We also continue to conduct solid fuel laboratory testing utilizing our ECC technology in conjunction with six parties who contributed, in 2014 and 2015 combined, a total of $125,000 to our research. If successful, this would create a basis for further focused laboratory studies prior to any field demonstrations. Our technologies have not been tested or verified by any independent third party. Our research and development efforts are following this sequence of planned activities:

&#160;

&#183; Scale up to commercially relevant sizes. With regard to our ECC technology, we have designed and built furnaces and burners at what we believe to be a commercially relevant scale. We have identified potential development partners and customers with whom we are engaged in discussions to apply our ECC technology to their particular uses at commercially relevant scales, which can be 1 million BTUs or greater. The solid fuel laboratory testing of our ECC technology as described above is currently ongoing. &#160;

&#183; Site demonstration at full scale. We have begun to demonstrate our Duplex technology at commercial sites firing retrofitted OTSGs up to 52 million BTU/hr and a retrofitted three burner, 12 million BTU/hr petroleum refinery process heater. Our early site demonstrations are aimed at retrofitting existing burners in single or multi-burner systems in order to evaluate our Duplex technology at full scale in several operating systems. &#160;

&#183; Complete first installation. After completion of site demonstrations that include various applications of our Duplex technology, we anticipate that these demonstrations will transition to validation and documentary phases with extended operation periods in the field. This would include validation from prospective customer users and environmental regulatory bodies. Although field development testing of our Duplex technology is ongoing, in December 2015 the South Coast Air Quality Management District governing the greater Los Angeles area designated Duplex as a Best Available Retrofit Control Technology in the field of refinery process heaters and boilers. We believe that such demonstrations, if successful, would provide the impetus for commercial adoption within the applicable industry. &#160;

&#183; Enhancement of our intellectual property portfolio. We have generated inventions that we believe to be patentable subject matter and for which we have been seeking protection through patent application filings. As of January 2016, we have filed approximately 155 patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and certain foreign regulatory bodies related to our Duplex and ECC technologies, which remain pending. We have been granted 6 patents by the USPTO related to our ECC technology. We cannot predict when our patent applications may result in issued patents, if at all. Further, we may modify a patent application in the future as we develop additional information. As a result, we may create additional patent applications from an existing application, consolidate existing patent applications, abandon applications, or otherwise modify applications based upon our judgment in order to protect our intellectual property in a reasonably cost beneficial manner. &#160;

The Combustion Markets 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

We compete in the combustion and emissions control markets. These are highly competitive industries that are currently dominated by companies that have both substantially greater financial resources than we do and established products. However, we believe, based on the testing and the field studies done to date, that our technologies offer a unique and powerful ability to improve emissions and operational performance, energy efficiency and overall cost-effectiveness. We are targeting the following segments of the combustion market:

&#160;

&#183; process heaters for petroleum refining and petrochemical processing, &#160;

&#183; heating systems in package boilers, and &#160;

&#183; larger-scale steam generation systems and power boilers. &#160;

In each segment, we plan to market solutions with our Duplex technology that we believe could simultaneously improve both pollution control and operational efficiency characteristics through (a) cost-effective retrofitting of our Duplex technology onto existing standard system designs, and (b) new system designs.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Market Entry 

&#160;

We believe that our technologies could be applied to a wide range of systems in which there is a flame. While this implies many potential market opportunities, it also requires that we exercise a disciplined approach in comparatively evaluating those opportunities in order to select and prioritize those applications that are cost effective and afford the best mix of time and cost required for development relative to revenue potential. We also aim to select applications in which our technologies either offer immediate, clear, meaningful, and measurable advantages relative to competing technologies or address unmet market needs. 

&#160;

While we believe that the implementation of our technologies will eventually enable improved performance in new system designs, we believe that retrofitting existing systems to improve their performance will provide the quickest path to market. This is because (1) the installed base of existing combustion systems is far greater than the annual number of newly built systems, (2) integrating our technology into a retrofit appears less complex than a new combustion system designed by an OEM, (3) the design cycle of a retrofit application appears to be far shorter, and (4) we believe that with the currently challenging market conditions, less costly retrofits are more attractive to many segments of the energy market than new capital equipment and infrastructure builds to comply with environmental regulations and derive cost efficiencies. We have therefore concluded, based on our preliminary analyses, that the earliest applications of our technologies are likely to involve the retrofit and upgrade of industrial scale combustion systems with our Duplex technology to improve their environmental performance and energy efficiency, while at the same time making them more adaptable to changing operating conditions.

&#160;

Because of the market needs and opportunities that we currently perceive, we intend to first target the following segments of the industrial combustion market:

&#160;

&#183; process heaters for petroleum refining and petrochemical processing, &#183; heating systems in package boilers, and &#183; larger-scale steam generation systems and power boilers &#160; 

Sales and Marketing Plan 

&#160;

Partnership Strategy . We believe that our technologies have the potential to transform industries that rely on combustion and that our technologies are broadly applicable in large, scalable, global markets.

&#160;

We intend to form research and development arrangements to develop our technology within targeted segments. Among the types of potential partners with which we will seek to establish relationships in the U.S. and globally will be: 

&#160;

&#183; End users of OEM products and services interested in advancing the development of our technology in order to address their operational needs; &#183; Large OEMs interested in our technology; &#183; Industry research groups, whose mission is the development and testing of new technologies for the eventual benefit of their member companies; and &#183; Government entities such as the U.S. Department of Energy, who are chartered with the development of longer-range and potentially disruptive energy technologies. &#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We currently are pursuing field development programs of our Duplex technology. These programs are aimed at our target industrial combustion markets and include the enhanced oil recovery industry, where an OTSG has been retrofitted with our technology, and two petroleum refineries, where process heaters will be retrofitted. Further, we continue to conduct solid fuel laboratory testing utilizing our ECC technology.

&#160;

Pricing Strategy . Our target markets are characterized by well-established competitors in mature businesses. As a result, pricing in these markets is typically driven more by competitive pricing rather than broad product value. Since we believe that our technology will provide greater economic value in comparison to our competitors, we plan to price our technology based upon the value that we believe it will provide in reduced air pollution control costs, including fines, and reduced maintenance and operating costs.

&#160;

Channel Structure and Path to Market . Our path to market could involve any combination of (1) licensing our technologies for either one-time or periodic licensing fees for a period of time within specific fields of use and/or territories, (2) sale of our intellectual property rights within specific fields of use and/or territories, or (3) manufacturing the components required to enable our technologies and/or supplying a complete burner package through strategic subcontracting agreements. Since our solutions consist largely of off the shelf components, we do not anticipate that we will require a large manufacturing capacity. To the extent we will require production of specific hardware (electrodes, for example), we plan to rely on outside contract manufacturers, which we believe are widely available and for which a competitive market exists.

&#160;

Competition and Barriers to Entry 

&#160;

The industry in which we operate is global in scope and is populated by large, established suppliers of burners and post-combustion air pollution control systems, all of whom possess substantially greater resources than we do. Worldwide, suppliers of burners and APC equipment include but are not limited to companies such as UOP, Callidus and Maxon (all three are subsidiaries of Honeywell), John Zink Hamworthy Combustion (a subsidiary of Koch Industries and including Coen), Babcock and Wilcox, Westinghouse, Eclipse, General Electric, Haldor Tops&#248;e, Hitachi, Linde, and Fives North American, among others. 

&#160;

These systems include low NO X burners, electrostatic precipitators, bag houses, selective catalytic reduction systems and various types of scrubbers. The companies that provide these systems are well established and their combustion and emissions control technologies are based on mature, well-understood technologies that are proven in the market. However, we believe the further development of their technologies will be limited largely to marginal performance improvements. As a consequence of this relatively slow pace of innovation, we believe current technology offerings have become largely commoditized, and differentiation between suppliers is very often based on price.

&#160;

From a customer's perspective, legacy air pollution control technology is viewed as a cost of doing business, and as a means to operate within regulatory requirements and avoid fines. Unlike most other kinds of capital equipment that provide an economic return through enhanced productivity or efficiency, we believe customers of traditional emissions control equipment do not otherwise expect any positive return on these investments. 

&#160;

We are seeking to enter the combustion and emissions control market and to establish ourselves in a highly competitive industry against companies that have both substantially greater financial resources than we do and established products. Because they have been available in the market for many years, our competitors&#8217; product offerings may have several advantages. Among these are:

&#160;

&#183; Availability of trained technicians: The number of technicians who are able to specify, install and operate our competitors&#8217; products will be greater than those who have been trained on our technology. &#183; Conservative choice: Because our competitors' technologies are well understood and their performance has been proven over time, customers may perceive their offerings represent a safe, low-risk choice. &#183; Business relationships: Because our competitors have established long-standing personal relationships with their customers, they may prefer to continue to do business with one another. &#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

However, if we are able to successfully bring our technology to market, we believe that our technology would be an attractive alternative to the products and solutions offered by companies with which we seek to compete. In particular, we believe that our technology could offer a unique cost-effective means to reduce many pollutants at the source while improving operational efficiency. We believe our technology could be capable of reducing the requirement for costly legacy equipment, offering customers the prospect of a positive return on their investment in the form of enhanced efficiency and productivity while reducing emissions to the levels of existing air pollution control technologies such as scrubbers, electrostatic precipitators and fabric filters (bag houses). In particular, we believe our technology could offer the following advantages when compared with the next best alternatives.

&#160;

Emissions Reduction from Combustion Sources. Current technology reduces emissions by using mechanical mixing aids such as swirlers, staging combustion in two or more zones, or treating emissions such as NO X after the fact using selective catalytic reduction. In contrast, we believe our technology could: 

&#160;

&#183; enhance mixing with none of the additional pressure drop or power requirements that swirlers demand; and &#183; reduce NO X without reducing turndown or narrowing the burner operating window as staged combustion does or requiring expensive post combustion treatments with chemical additives such as catalytic reduction requires. &#160;

Improving flame shape. The main goal of virtually all process combustion is to transfer heat to raise steam or enable a chemical reaction, and to do so as efficiently as possible. Conventional technology uses buoyancy (the natural tendency for a flame and heat to rise opposite to the force of gravity) and momentum (fuel mixed with air and forced through a nozzle, as in a torch) as the only tools to shape flames. Unfortunately, momentum effects die out over distance from their source and buoyancy always operates counter to the gravitational field. Moreover, momentum and buoyancy effects often drive wayward flames into process tubes where they cause overheating and potential failure. In contrast, we believe that our technology could allow the use of much stronger body forces that are not limited by orifice diameter and are unaffected by gravitational fields. We believe the result would be better control over flame shape and direction, allowing the process to operate free of the effects of impingement and non-optimal flame structure. 

&#160;

Enhancing heat-transfer and process efficiency. The main objective of industrial combustion in furnaces and boilers is to transfer heat to a process fluid. Conventional combustion techniques do their best to optimize flame shape to achieve this end, but we believe conventional combustion techniques have no additional means for enhancing heat transfer. In contrast, we believe that our technology could enhance heat transfer to the process tube independent of flame shape using electrical current, and that the result could be an increase in process efficiency or throughput, which is a critical goal in the industrial combustion industry.

&#160;

Compared to the products and solutions of companies with which we seek to compete, we believe our technology could provide our potential customers with a lower total cost of ownership, providing the prospect of a positive economic return on investment to systems operators. We believe this would be due to a reduction in their capital and operating expenses, and an increase in energy efficiency.

&#160;

While we believe that our technology could offer the advantages discussed above, we do not currently represent a significant competitive presence in our industry.

&#160;

Research and Development Program 

&#160;

Our research and development program consists of bench- and pilot-scale research anticipating future site demonstrations. The experience and industry contacts of our management, board of directors, and consultants with potential customers in the petroleum, petrochemical, and industrial steam applications inform our research program. These are supported by field development agreements, research agreements, and memoranda of understanding with potential development partners, customers and research institutions. Our research and development activities make use of employees and consultants that are respective experts in the areas of industrial combustion, statistical experimental design, gas turbines, fluid mechanics, physics of particles and ions, and electric fields. We spent $2,947,000 and $2,327,000, offset by the receipt of $15,000 and $110,000 in each of 2015 and 2014, respectively, from participants in the solid fuel research associated with ECC, on research and development for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Intellectual Property Protection 

&#160;

We are pursuing an aggressive intellectual property strategy including:

&#160;

&#183; Aggressive invention and ideation. Thus far we have identified numerous specific inventions that we believe to be novel and patentable. We are pursuing a proven ideation process to enhance and continue these discoveries. &#183; Development of a strong patent portfolio. As of January 2016, we have been awarded 6 patents related to ECC technology and have 155 patent applications pending for Duplex and ECC technologies. We cannot predict when our patent applications may result in issued patents, if at all. Further, we may modify a patent application in the future as we develop additional information. As a result, we may create additional patent applications from an existing application, consolidate existing patent applications, abandon applications, or otherwise modify applications based upon our judgment in order to protect our intellectual property in a reasonably cost beneficial manner. &#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

Government approval is not required in order for us to sell the principal products or services that we are developing. However, government regulation, particularly environmental regulation, is likely to play a role in shaping our product mix and offerings. Our technology includes enhancement of the combustion process, in the case of our ECC technology inclusion of a computer-controlled electric field to selectively promote, suppress, retard or accelerate chemical reactions as desired, and to reduce certain emissions at a lower cost than current air pollution control devices. Field implementation of our technology will therefore require permits from various local, state and federal agencies that regulate mechanical and electrical infrastructure and fire and air pollution control.

&#160;

We believe that we offer major advances in emissions and efficiency reductions. We believe emissions regulations could enhance market demand for technology if such regulations require a reduction in criteria pollutants such as NO X , SO X , and CO, or others such as CO 2 , or mercury. In such cases, possible legislation on greenhouse gases, boiler MACT rules, or general reductions in required criteria pollutant levels could serve our business objectives. Although the timing of such regulations is uncertain, the general trend over the last decades continues to be government-mandated reduction for all criteria pollutants and the addition of new emissions to those regulated. Ultimately, it may be possible for our technology to achieve EPA BACT (Best Available Control Technology) designation. Although field development testing of our Duplex technology is ongoing, in December 2015 the South Coast Air Quality Management District governing the greater Los Angeles area designated Duplex as a Best Available Retrofit Control Technology in the field of refinery process heaters and boilers. The availability of our technology, by itself, could accelerate the government&#8217;s willingness to adopt more stringent environmental regulations. Further, efficiency improvements include enhanced mixing, lower excess air requirements, and improved heat transfer to the process. We believe such efficiency improvements could generate market demand regardless of the existing regulatory framework because they could result in savings to businesses that adopt our technology.

&#160;

We are not aware of any current or proposed federal, state or local environmental compliance regulations that would have a material detrimental effect on our business objectives. We do not anticipate any major expenditures to be required in order for our technology to comply with any environmental protection statutes.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of March 3, 2016, we had 18 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee. None of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.
