 Item 1. Business 

In this report, the terms &#8220;Prospect,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; mean Prospect Capital Corporation and all entities included in our consolidated financial statements, unless the context specifically requires otherwise. 

General 

Prospect Capital Corporation is a financial services company that primarily lends to and invests in middle market privately-held companies. We are a closed-end investment company incorporated in Maryland. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company (&#8220;BDC&#8221;) under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the &#8220;1940 Act&#8221;). As a BDC, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (&#8220;RIC&#8221;), under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). We were organized on April 13, 2004 and were funded in an initial public offering completed on July 27, 2004. &#32;We are one of the largest BDCs with approximately $6.28 billion &#32;of total assets as of June 30, 2016 . 

We are externally managed by our investment adviser, Prospect Capital Management L.P. (&#8220;Prospect Capital Management&#8221; or the &#8220;Investment Adviser&#8221;). Prospect Administration LLC (&#8220;Prospect Administration&#8221; &#32;or the &#8220;Administrator&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Investment Adviser, provides administrative services and facilities necessary for us to operate. &#32; 

Our investment objective is to generate both current income and long-term capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We invest primarily in senior and subordinated debt and equity of private companies in need of capital for acquisitions, divestitures, growth, development, recapitalizations and other purposes. We work with the management teams or financial sponsors to seek investments with historical cash flows, asset collateral or contracted pro-forma cash flows. &#32; 

We currently have nine origination strategies in which we make investments: (1) lending in private equity sponsored transactions, (2) lending directly to companies not owned by private equity firms, (3) control investments in corporate operating companies, (4) control investments in financial companies, (5) investments in structured credit, (6) real estate investments, (7) investments in syndicated debt, (8) aircraft leasing and (9) online lending. We continue to evaluate other origination strategies in the ordinary course of business with no specific top-down allocation to any single origination strategy. &#32; 

Lending in Private Equity Sponsored Transactions &#8211; We make loans to companies which are controlled by leading private equity firms. This debt can take the form of first lien, second lien, unitranche or unsecured loans. In making these investments, we look for a diversified customer base, recurring demand for the product or service, barriers to entry, strong historical cash flow and experienced management teams. These loans typically have significant equity subordinate to our loan position. Historically, this strategy has comprised approximately 50%-60% of our business, but more recently it is less than 50% of our business. &#32; 

Lending Directly to Companies &#8211; We provide debt financing to companies owned by non-private equity firms, the company founder, a management team or a family. Here, in addition to the strengths we look for in a sponsored transaction, we also look for the alignment with the management team with significant invested capital. This strategy often has less competition than the private equity sponsor strategy because such company financing needs are not easily addressed by banks and often require more diligence preparation. Direct lending can result in higher returns and lower leverage than sponsor transactions and may include warrants or equity to us. Historically, this strategy has comprised approximately 5%-15% of our business, but more recently it is less than 5% of our business. &#32; 

Control Investments in Corporate Operating Companies &#8211; This strategy involves acquiring controlling stakes in non-financial operating companies. Our investments in these companies are generally structured as a combination of yield-producing debt and equity. We provide enhanced certainty of closure to our counterparties, give the seller personal liquidity and generally look for management to continue on in their current roles. This strategy has comprised approximately 10%-15% of our business. &#32; 

Control Investments in Financial Companies &#8211; This strategy involves acquiring controlling stakes in financial companies, including consumer direct lending, sub-prime auto lending and other strategies. Our investments in these companies are generally structured as a combination of yield-producing debt and equity. These investments are often structured in a tax-efficient RIC-compliant partnership, enhancing returns. This strategy has comprised approximately 5%-15% of our business. &#32; 

Investments in Structured Credit &#8211; We make investments in CLOs, generally taking a significant position in the subordinated interests (equity) of the CLOs. The CLOs include a diversified portfolio of broadly syndicated loans and do not have direct exposure to real estate, mortgages, debt or consumer based debt. The CLOs in which we invest are managed by top-tier collateral managers that have been thoroughly diligenced prior to investment. This strategy has comprised approximately 10%-20% of our business. &#32; 

Real Estate Investments &#8211; We make investments in real estate through our wholly-owned tax-efficient real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;) &#32;National Property REIT Corp. (&#8220;NPRC&#8221;), the surviving entity of the May 23, 2016 merger with &#32;American Property REIT Corp. (&#8220;APRC&#8221;) and United Property REIT Corp. (&#8220;UPRC&#8221;). Our real estate investments are in various classes of fully developed and occupied real estate properties that generate current yields. We seek to identify properties that have historically high occupancy and steady cash flow generation. NPRC co-invests with established and experienced property managers that manage such properties after acquisition. This investment strategy has comprised approximately 5%-10% of our business. &#32; 

Investments in Syndicated Debt &#8211; On an opportunistic basis, we make investments in loans and high yield bonds that have been sold to a syndicate of buyers. Here we look for investments with attractive risk-adjusted returns after we have completed a fundamental credit analysis. These investments are purchased with a long term, buy-and-hold outlook and we look to provide significant structuring input by providing anchoring orders. This strategy has comprised approximately 5%-10% of our business. &#32; 

Aircraft Leasing &#8211; We invest in debt as well as equity in aircraft assets subject to commercial leases to credit-worthy airlines across the globe. These investments present attractive return opportunities due to cash flow consistency from long-lived assets coupled with hard asset collateral. We seek to deliver risk-adjusted returns with strong downside protection by analyzing relative value characteristics across the spectrum of aircraft types of all vintages. Our target portfolio includes both in-production and out-of-production jet and turboprop aircraft and engines, operated by airlines across the globe. This strategy comprised approximately 1% of our business. 

Online Lending &#8211; We make investments in loans originated by certain consumer loan and small and medium sized business (&#8220;SME&#8221;) loan facilitators. We purchase each loan in its entirety (i.e., a &#8220;whole loan&#8221;). The borrowers are consumers and SMEs. The loans are typically serviced by the facilitators of the loans. This investment strategy has comprised approximately 4%-7% of our business. 

We invest primarily in first and second lien secured loans and unsecured debt, which in some cases includes an equity component. First and second lien secured loans generally are senior debt instruments that rank ahead of unsecured debt of a given portfolio company. These loans also have the benefit of security interests on the assets of the portfolio company, which may rank ahead of or be junior to other security interests. Our investments in CLOs are subordinated to senior loans and are generally unsecured. We invest in debt and equity positions of CLOs which are a form of securitization in which the cash flows of a portfolio of loans are pooled and passed on to different classes of owners in various tranches. Our CLO investments are derived from portfolios of corporate debt securities which are generally risk rated from BB to B. &#32; 

Typically, we concentrate on making investments in companies with annual revenues of less than $750 million and enterprise values of less than $1 billion. Our typical investment involves a secured loan of less than $250 million. We also acquire controlling interests in companies in conjunction with making secured debt investments in such companies. In most cases, companies in which we invest are privately held at the time we invest in them. We refer to these companies as &#8220;target&#8221; or &#8220;middle market&#8221; companies and these investments as &#8220;middle market investments.&#8221; 

We seek to maximize total returns to our investors, including both current yield and equity upside, by applying rigorous credit analysis and asset-based and cash-flow based lending techniques to make and monitor our investments. We are constantly pursuing multiple investment opportunities, including purchases of portfolios from private and public companies, as well as originations and secondary purchases of particular securities. We also regularly evaluate control investment opportunities in a range of industries, and some of these investments could be material to us. There can be no assurance that we will successfully consummate any investment opportunity we are currently pursuing. If any of these opportunities are consummated, there can be no assurance that investors will share our view of valuation or that any assets acquired will not be subject to future write downs, each of which could have an adverse effect on our stock price. 

&#8220;Spin-Offs&#8221; of Certain Business Strategies 

We previously announced that we intend to unlock value by &#8220;spinning off&#8221; three &#8220;pure play&#8221; business strategies - our consumer online lending business, real estate business and structured credit business - to our shareholders in conjunction with rights offering capital raises in which existing Prospect shareholders could elect to participate in each offering or sell their rights. The goals of these &#8220;spin-offs&#8221; include leverage and earnings neutrality for Prospect. Our primary objective is to maximize the valuation of each offering (declining to proceed with any offering if we find any valuation not to be attractive). The size and likelihood of each of these dispositions, some of which are expected to be partial rather than complete spin-offs, remain to be determined, but we currently expect the collective size of these three dispositions, if any, to be 10% or less of our asset base. Any such dispositions cannot occur unless and until our application for exemptive relief is granted by the SEC. Should the SEC not grant our application for exemptive relief, these dispositions will not occur as initially planned. The consummation of any of the dispositions also depends upon, among other things: market conditions, regulatory and exchange listing approval, and sufficient investor demand. There can be no assurance that we will consummate any of these dispositions. &#32; 

Our Investment Objective and Policies 

Our investment objective is to generate both current income and long-term capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We focus on making investments in private companies. We are a non-diversified company within the meaning of the 1940 Act. 

We invest primarily in first and second lien secured loans and unsecured debt, which in some cases includes an equity component. First and second lien secured loans generally are senior debt instruments that rank ahead of unsecured debt of a given portfolio company. These loans also have the benefit of security interests on the assets of the portfolio company, which may rank ahead of or be junior to other security interests. Our investments in CLOs are subordinated to senior loans and are generally unsecured. We invest in debt and equity positions of CLOs which are a form of securitization in which the cash flows of a portfolio of loans are pooled and passed on to different classes of owners in various tranches. Our CLO investments are derived from portfolios of corporate debt securities which are generally risk rated from BB to B. 

We also acquire controlling interests in companies in conjunction with making secured debt investments in such companies. These may be in several industries, including industrial, service, aircraft leasing, real estate and financial businesses. 

We seek to maximize returns and minimize risk for our investors by applying rigorous analysis to make and monitor our investments. While the structure of our investments varies, we can invest in senior secured debt, senior unsecured debt, subordinated secured debt, subordinated unsecured debt, convertible debt, convertible preferred equity, preferred equity, common equity, warrants and other instruments, many of which generate current yield. While our primary focus is to seek current income through investment in the debt and/or dividend-paying equity securities of eligible privately-held, thinly-traded or distressed companies and long-term capital appreciation by acquiring accompanying warrants, options or other equity securities of such companies, we may invest up to 30% of the portfolio in opportunistic investments in order to seek enhanced returns for stockholders. Such investments may include investments in the debt and equity instruments of broadly-traded public companies. We expect that these public companies generally will have debt securities that are non-investment grade. Such investments may also include purchases (either in the primary or secondary markets) of the equity and junior debt tranches of a type of such pools known as CLOs. Structurally, CLOs are entities that are formed to hold a portfolio of senior secured loans made to companies whose debt is rated below investment grade or, in limited circumstances, unrated. The senior secured loans within a CLO are limited to senior secured loans which meet specified credit and diversity criteria and are subject to concentration limitations in order to create an investment portfolio that is diverse by senior secured loan, borrower, and industry, with limitations on non-U.S. borrowers. Within this 30% basket, we have and may make additional investments in debt and equity securities of financial companies and companies located outside of the United States. 

Our investments may include other equity investments, such as warrants, options to buy a minority interest in a portfolio company, or contractual payment rights or rights to receive a proportional interest in the operating cash flow or net income of such company. When determined by the Investment Adviser to be in our best interest, we may acquire a controlling interest in a portfolio company. Any warrants we receive with our debt securities may require only a nominal cost to exercise, and thus, as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from this equity interest. We have structured, and will continue to structure, some warrants to include provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest or, if applicable, controlling-interest holder, as well as puts, or rights to sell such securities back to the company, upon the occurrence of specified events. In many cases, we obtain registration rights in connection with these equity interests, which may include demand and &#8220;piggyback&#8221; registration rights. 

We plan to hold many of our debt investments to maturity or repayment, but will sell a debt investment earlier if a liquidity event takes place, such as the sale or recapitalization of a portfolio company, or if we determine a sale of such debt investment to be in our best interest. 

We have qualified and elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally do not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To continue to qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, to qualify for RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our &#8220;investment company taxable income,&#8221; which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses. 

For a discussion of the risks inherent in our portfolio investments, see &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Risks Relating to Our Investments.&#8221; 

Industry Sectors 

Our portfolio is invested across 27 &#32;industry categories. Excluding our CLO investments, which do not have industry concentrations, no individual industry comprises more than 8.2% &#32;of the portfolio on either a cost or fair value basis. 

Ongoing Relationships with Portfolio Companies 

Monitoring 

Prospect Capital Management monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. Prospect Capital Management will continue to monitor the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its business plan and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. 

Prospect Capital Management employs several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and value of our investments, which may include, but are not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; 

Assessment of success in adhering to the portfolio company&#8217;s business plan and compliance with covenants; 

&#8226; 

Regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; 

&#8226; 

Comparisons to other portfolio companies in the industry, if any; 

&#8226; 

Attendance at and participation in board meetings of the portfolio company; and 

&#8226; 

Review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for the portfolio company. 

Investment Valuation &#32; 

To value our investments, we follow the guidance of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement &#32;(&#8220;ASC 820&#8221;), that defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in conformity with GAAP, and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. In accordance with ASC 820, the fair value of our investments is defined as the price that we would receive upon selling an investment in an orderly transaction to an independent buyer in the principal or most advantageous market in which that investment is transacted. &#32; 

ASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy: &#32; 

Level 1 : Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, accessible by us at the measurement date. &#32; 

Level 2 : Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices. &#32; 

Level 3 : Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. &#32; 

In all cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment. &#32; 

Our Board of Directors has established procedures for the valuation of our investment portfolio. These procedures are detailed below. &#32; 

Investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations. &#32; 

For most of our investments, market quotations are not available. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, our Board of Directors has approved a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below. &#32; 

1. 

Each portfolio company or investment is reviewed by our investment professionals with independent valuation firms engaged by our Board of Directors. &#32; 

2. 

The independent valuation firms prepare independent valuations for each investment based on their own independent assessments and issues their report. &#32; 

3. 

The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors reviews and discusses with the independent valuation firms the valuation reports, and then makes a recommendation to the Board of Directors of the value for each investment. &#32; 

4. 

The Board of Directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Investment Adviser, the respective independent valuation firm and the Audit Committee. &#32; 

Our non-CLO investments are valued utilizing a yield analysis, enterprise value (&#8220;EV&#8221;) analysis, net asset value analysis, liquidation analysis, discounted cash flow analysis, or a combination of methods, as appropriate. The yield analysis uses loan spreads for loans, dividend yields for certain investments and other relevant information implied by market data involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. Under the EV analysis, the EV of a portfolio company is first determined and allocated over the portfolio company&#8217;s securities in order of their preference relative to one another (i.e., &#8220;waterfall&#8221; allocation). To determine the EV, we typically use a market multiples approach that considers relevant and applicable market trading data of guideline public companies, transaction metrics from precedent merger and acquisitions transactions and/or a discounted cash flow analysis. The net asset value analysis is used to derive a value of an underlying investment (such as real estate property) by dividing a relevant earnings stream by an appropriate capitalization rate. For this purpose, we consider capitalization rates for similar properties as may be obtained from guideline public companies and/or relevant transactions. The liquidation analysis is intended to approximate the net recovery value of an investment based on, among other things, assumptions regarding liquidation proceeds based on a hypothetical liquidation of a portfolio company&#8217;s assets. The discounted cash flow analysis uses valuation techniques to convert future cash flows or earnings to a range of fair values from which a single estimate may be derived utilizing an appropriate discount rate. The measurement is based on the net present value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts. &#32; 

In applying these methodologies, additional factors that we consider in valuing our investments may include, as we deem relevant: security covenants, call protection provisions, and information rights; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; the portfolio company&#8217;s ability to make payments; the principal markets in which the portfolio company does business; publicly available financial ratios of peer companies; the principal market; and enterprise values, among other factors. &#32; 

Our investments in CLOs are classified as ASC 820 Level 3 securities and are valued using a discounted cash flow model. The valuations have been accomplished through the analysis of the CLO deal structures to identify the risk exposures from the modeling point of view as well as to determine an appropriate call date (i.e., expected maturity). For each CLO security, the most appropriate valuation approach has been chosen from alternative approaches to ensure the most accurate valuation for such security. To value a CLO, both the assets and the liabilities of the CLO capital structure are modeled. Our valuation agent utilizes additional methods to validate the results from the discounted cash flow method, such as Monte Carlo simulations of key model variables, analysis of relevant data observed in the CLO market, and review of certain benchmark credit indices. We use a waterfall engine to store the collateral data, generate collateral cash flows from the assets based on various assumptions for the risk factors, distribute the cash flows to the liability structure based on the payment priorities, and discount them back using appropriate market discount rates. We are not responsible for and have no influence over the asset management of the portfolios underlying the CLO investments we hold as those portfolios are managed by non-affiliated third party CLO collateral managers. The main risk factors are: default risk, interest rate risk, downgrade risk, and credit spread risk. &#32; 

For a discussion of the risks inherent in determining the value of securities for which readily available market values do not exist, see &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Risks Relating to Our Business &#8211; Most of our portfolio investments are recorded at fair value as determined in good faith under the direction of our Board of Directors and, as a result, there is uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments.&#8221; 

Managerial Assistance 

As a BDC, we are obligated under the 1940 Act to make available to certain of our portfolio companies significant managerial assistance. &#8220;Making available significant managerial assistance&#8221; refers to any arrangement whereby we provide significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations, or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. We are also deemed to be providing managerial assistance to all portfolio companies that we control, either by ourselves or in conjunction with others. The nature and extent of significant managerial assistance provided by us to controlled and non-controlled portfolio companies will vary according to the particular needs of each portfolio company. Examples of such activities include (i) advice on recruiting, hiring, management and termination of employees, officers and directors, succession planning and other human resource matters; (ii) advice on capital raising, capital budgeting, and capital expenditures; (iii) advice on advertising, marketing, and sales; (iv) advice on fulfillment, operations, and execution; (v) advice on managing relationships with unions and other personnel organizations, financing sources, vendors, customers, lessors, lessees, lawyers, accountants, regulators and other important counterparties; (vi) evaluating acquisition and divestiture opportunities, plant expansions and closings, and market expansions; (vii) participating in audit committee, nominating committee, board and management meetings; (viii) consulting with and advising board members and officers of portfolio companies (on overall strategy and other matters); and (ix) providing other organizational, operational, managerial and financial guidance. 

Prospect Administration, when performing a managerial assistance agreement executed with each portfolio company to which we provide managerial assistance, arranges for the provision of such managerial assistance on our behalf. When doing so, Prospect 

Administration utilizes personnel of our Investment Adviser. We, on behalf of Prospect Administration, invoice portfolio companies receiving and paying for managerial assistance, and we remit to Prospect Administration its cost of providing such services, including the charges deemed appropriate by our Investment Adviser for providing such managerial assistance. No income is recognized by Prospect. 

Investment Adviser 

Prospect Capital Management manages our investments as the Investment Adviser. Prospect Capital Management is a Delaware limited partnership that has been registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the &#8220;Advisers Act&#8221;) since March 31, 2004. Prospect Capital Management is led by John F. Barry III and M. Grier Eliasek, two senior executives with significant investment advisory and business experience. Both Messrs. Barry and Eliasek spend a significant amount of their time in their roles at Prospect Capital Management working on our behalf. The principal executive offices of Prospect Capital Management are 10 East 40th Street, 42nd Floor, New York, NY 10016. We depend on the due diligence, skill and network of business contacts of the senior management of the Investment Adviser. We also depend, to a significant extent, on the Investment Adviser&#8217;s investment professionals and the information and deal flow generated by those investment professionals in the course of their investment and portfolio management activities. The Investment Adviser&#8217;s senior management team evaluates, negotiates, structures, closes, monitors and services our investments. Our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of the senior management team, particularly John F. Barry III and M. Grier Eliasek. The departure of any of the senior managers of the Investment Adviser could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to achieve our investment objective. In addition, we can offer no assurance that Prospect Capital Management will remain the Investment Adviser or that we will continue to have access to its investment professionals or its information and deal flow. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement (as defined below), we pay Prospect Capital Management investment advisory fees, which consist of an annual base management fee based on our gross assets as well as a two-part incentive fee based on our performance. Mr. Barry currently controls Prospect Capital Management. 

Investment Advisory Agreement 

Terms 

We have entered into an investment advisory and management agreement with the Investment Adviser, Prospect Capital Management L.P., (the &#8220;Investment Advisory Agreement&#8221;) under which the Investment Adviser, subject to the overall supervision of our Board of Directors, manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to, us. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Investment Adviser: (i) determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes, (ii) identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make (including performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies); and (iii) closes and monitors investments we make. &#32; 

The Investment Adviser&#8217;s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired. For providing these services the Investment Adviser receives a fee from us, consisting of two components: a base management fee and an incentive fee. The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 2.00% on our total assets. For services currently rendered under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. &#32; 

The incentive fee has two parts. The first part, the income incentive fee, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees and other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement described below, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a &#8220;hurdle rate&#8221; of 1.75% per quarter (7.00% annualized). &#32; 

The net investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of the gross assets used to calculate the 2.00% base management fee. We pay the Investment Adviser an income incentive fee with respect to our pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows: &#32; 

&#8226; 

No incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate; &#32; 

&#8226; 

100.00% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 125.00% of the quarterly hurdle rate in any calendar quarter (8.75% annualized assuming a 7.00% annualized hurdle rate); and &#32; 

&#8226; 

20.00% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 125.00% of the quarterly hurdle rate in any calendar quarter (8.75% annualized assuming a 7.00% annualized hurdle rate). &#32; 

These calculations are appropriately prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current quarter. &#32; 

The second part of the incentive fee, the capital gains incentive fee, is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals 20.00% of our realized capital gains for the calendar year, if any, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation at the end of such year. In determining the capital gains incentive fee payable to the Investment Adviser, we calculate the aggregate realized capital gains, aggregate realized capital losses and aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, as applicable, with respect to each investment that has been in our portfolio. For the purpose of this calculation, an &#8220;investment&#8221; is defined as the total of all rights and claims which may be asserted against a portfolio company arising from our participation in the debt, equity, and other financial instruments issued by that company. Aggregate realized capital gains, if any, equal the sum of the differences between the aggregate net sales price of each investment and the aggregate cost basis of such investment when sold or otherwise disposed. Aggregate realized capital losses equal the sum of the amounts by which the aggregate net sales price of each investment is less than the aggregate cost basis of such investment when sold or otherwise disposed. Aggregate unrealized capital depreciation equals the sum of the differences, if negative, between the aggregate valuation of each investment and the aggregate cost basis of such investment as of the applicable calendar year-end. At the end of the applicable calendar year, the amount of capital gains that serves as the basis for our calculation of the capital gains incentive fee involves netting aggregate realized capital gains against aggregate realized capital losses on a since-inception basis and then reducing this amount by the aggregate unrealized capital depreciation. If this number is positive, then the capital gains incentive fee payable is equal to 20.00% of such amount, less the aggregate amount of any capital gains incentive fees paid since inception. &#32; 

Examples of Quarterly Incentive Fee Calculation 

Example 1: Income Incentive Fee* 

*The hypothetical amount of pre-incentive fee net investment income shown is based on a percentage of total net assets. 

Alternative 1 

Assumptions 

&#8226; 

Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25% 

&#8226; 

Hurdle rate(1) = 1.75% 

&#8226; 

Base management fee(2) = 0.50% 

&#8226; 

Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.)(3) = 0.20% 

&#8226; 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income &#8211; (base management fee + other expenses)) = 0.55% 

Pre-incentive net investment income does not exceed hurdle rate, therefore there is no income incentive fee. 

Alternative 2 

Assumptions 

&#8226;

&#8226; 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income (investment income &#8211; (base management fee + other expenses)) = 2.00% 

Pre-incentive net investment income exceeds hurdle rate, therefore there is an income incentive fee payable by us to the Investment Adviser. The Income Incentive Fee would be calculated as follows: 

= 100% &#215; &#8220;Catch Up&#8221; + the greater of 0% AND (20% &#215; (pre-incentive fee net investment income &#8211; 2.1875%) 

= (100% &#215; (2.00% - 1.75%)) + 0% 

= 100% &#215; 0.25% + 0% 

= 0.25%

Duration and Termination 

The Investment Advisory Agreement was originally approved by our Board of Directors on June 23, 2004 and was recently re-approved by the Board of Directors on June 21, 2016 for an additional one-year term expiring June 22, 2017. Unless terminated earlier as described below, it will remain in effect from year to year thereafter if approved annually by our Board of Directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, approval by a majority of our directors who are not interested persons. The Investment Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. The Investment Advisory Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon not more than 60 days&#8217; written notice to the other. See &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Risks Relating to Our Business &#8211; We are dependent upon Prospect Capital Management&#8217;s key management personnel for our future success.&#8221; 

Indemnification 

The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, Prospect Capital Management and its officers, managers, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of Prospect Capital Management&#8217;s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement or otherwise as the Investment Adviser. 

Administration Agreement 

We have also entered into an administration agreement (the &#8220;Administration Agreement&#8221;) with Prospect Administration under which Prospect Administration, among other things, provides (or arranges for the provision of) administrative services and facilities for us. For providing these services, we reimburse Prospect Administration for our allocable portion of overhead incurred by Prospect Administration in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and his staff, including the internal legal staff. Under this agreement, Prospect Administration furnishes us with office facilities, equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities. Prospect Administration also performs, or oversees the performance of, our required administrative services, which include, among other things, being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, Prospect Administration assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders, and generally oversees the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Under the Administration Agreement, Prospect Administration also provides on our behalf managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance (see Managerial Assistance &#32;section below). The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days&#8217; written notice to the other party. Prospect Administration is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Investment Adviser. &#32; 

The Administration Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, Prospect Administration and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of Prospect Administration&#8217;s services under the Administration Agreement or otherwise as administrator for us. Our payments to Prospect Administration are periodically reviewed by our Board of Directors. &#32; 

Payment of Our Expenses 

All investment professionals of the Investment Adviser and its respective staff, when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services, and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of such personnel allocable to such services, will be provided and paid for by the Investment Adviser. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including those relating to: organization and offering; calculation of our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm); expenses incurred by Prospect Capital Management payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisers (such as independent valuation firms, accountants and legal counsel), in monitoring our financial and legal affairs and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies; interest payable on debt, if any, and dividends payable on preferred stock, if any, incurred to finance our investments; offerings of our debt, our preferred shares, our common stock and other securities; investment advisory fees; fees payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments; transfer agent and custodial fees; registration fees; listing fees; taxes; independent directors&#8217; fees and expenses; costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents with the SEC; the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to stockholders, including printing costs; our allocable portion of the fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any 

other insurance premiums; direct costs and expenses of administration, including auditor and legal costs; and all other expenses incurred by us, by the Investment Adviser or by Prospect Administration in connection with administering our business, such as our allocable portion of overhead under the Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and his staff. 

License Agreement 

We entered into a license agreement with Prospect Capital Management pursuant to which Prospect Capital Management agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty free license to use the name &#8220;Prospect Capital.&#8221; Under this agreement, we have a right to use the Prospect Capital name, for so long as Prospect Capital Management or one of its affiliates remains the Investment Adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the Prospect Capital name. This license agreement will remain in effect for so long as the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Investment Adviser is in effect. 

Determination of Net Asset Value 

The net asset value per share of our outstanding shares of common stock will be determined quarterly by dividing the value of total assets minus liabilities by the total number of shares outstanding. 

In calculating the value of our total assets, we will value investments for which market quotations are readily available at such market quotations. Short-term investments which mature in 60 days or less, such as U.S. Treasury bills, are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. The amortized cost method involves recording a security at its cost (i.e., principal amount plus any premium and less any discount) on the date of purchase and thereafter amortizing/accreting that difference between the principal amount due at maturity and cost assuming a constant yield to maturity as determined at the time of purchase. Short-term securities which mature in more than 60 days are valued at current market quotations by an independent pricing service or at the mean between the bid and ask prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers (if available, or otherwise by a principal market maker or a primary market dealer). Investments in money market mutual funds are valued at their net asset value as of the close of business on the day of valuation. 

Most of the investments in our portfolio do not have market quotations which are readily available, meaning the investments do not have actively traded markets. Debt and equity securities for which market quotations are not readily available are valued with the assistance of an independent valuation service using a documented valuation policy and a valuation process that is consistently applied under the direction of our Board of Directors. For a discussion of the risks inherent in determining the value of securities for which readily available market values do not exist, see &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Risks Relating to Our Business &#8211; Most of our portfolio investments are recorded at fair value as determined in good faith under the direction of our Board of Directors and, as a result, there is uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments.&#8221; 

The factors that may be taken into account in valuing such investments include, as relevant, the portfolio company&#8217;s ability to make payments, its estimated earnings and projected discounted cash flows, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the financial environment in which the portfolio company operates, comparisons to securities of similar publicly traded companies, changes in interest rates for similar debt instruments and other relevant factors. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have readily available market quotations, the fair value of these investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had such market quotations existed for such investments, and any such differences could be material. 

As part of the fair valuation process, the independent valuation firms engaged by the Board of Directors perform a review of each debt and equity investment requiring fair valuation and provide a range of values for each investment, which, along with management&#8217;s valuation recommendations, is reviewed by our Audit Committee. Management and the independent valuation firms may adjust their preliminary evaluations to reflect comments provided by our Audit Committee. The Audit Committee reviews the final valuation reports and management&#8217;s valuation recommendations and makes a recommendation to the Board of Directors based on its analysis of the methodologies employed and the various weights that should be accorded to each portion of the valuation as well as factors that the independent valuation firms and management may not have included in their evaluation processes. The Board of Directors then evaluates the Audit Committee recommendations and undertakes a similar analysis to determine the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith. 

Determination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates not susceptible to substantiation by auditing procedures. Accordingly, under current accounting standards, the notes to our financial statements will refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our financial statements. 

Dividend Reinvestment Plan 

We have adopted a dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan that provides for reinvestment of our dividends or distributions on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash as provided below, and the ability to purchase additional shares by making optional cash investments. As a result, when our Board of Directors authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend or distribution, then our stockholders who have not &#8220;opted out&#8221; of our dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan will have their cash dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving the cash dividends or distributions. If you are not a current stockholder and want to enroll or have &#8220;opted out&#8221; and wish to rejoin, you may purchase shares directly through the plan or opt in by enrolling online or submitting to the plan administrator a completed enrollment form and, if you are not a current stockholder, making an initial investment of at least $250. 

No action is required on the part of a registered stockholder to have their cash dividend or distribution reinvested in shares of our common stock. A registered stockholder may elect to receive an entire dividend or distribution in cash by notifying the plan administrator and our transfer agent and registrar, in writing so that such notice is received by the plan administrator no later than the record date for dividends to stockholders. The plan administrator will set up a dividend reinvestment account for shares acquired pursuant to the plan for each stockholder who has not so elected to receive dividends and distributions in cash or who has enrolled in the plan as described herein (each, a &#8220;Participant&#8221;). The plan administrator will hold each Participant&#8217;s shares, together with the shares of other Participants, in non-certificated form in the plan administrator&#8217;s name or that of its nominee. Upon request by a Participant to terminate their participation in the plan, received in writing, via the internet or the plan administrator&#8217;s toll free number no later than 3 business days prior to a dividend or distribution payment date, such dividend or distribution will be paid out in cash and not be reinvested. If such request is received fewer than 3 business days prior to a dividend or distribution payment date, such dividend or distribution will be reinvested but all subsequent dividends and distributions will be paid to the stockholder in cash on all balances. Upon such termination of the Participant&#8217;s participation in the plan, all whole shares owned by the Participant will be issued to the Participant in certificated form and a check will be issued to the Participant for the proceeds of fractional shares less a transaction fee of $15. Those stockholders whose shares are held by a broker or other financial intermediary may receive dividends or distributions in cash by notifying their broker or other financial intermediary of their election. 

We primarily use newly-issued shares to implement reinvestment of dividends and distributions under the plan, whether our shares are trading at a premium or at a discount to net asset value. However, we reserve the right to purchase shares in the open market in connection with the implementation of reinvestment of dividends or distributions under the plan. The number of shares to be issued to a stockholder is determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the dividend or distribution payable to such stockholder by the market price per share of our common stock at the close of regular trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the last business day before the payment date for such dividend or distribution. Market price per share on that date will be the closing price for such shares on the NASDAQ Global Select Market or, if no sale is reported for such day, at the average of their reported bid and asked prices. The number of shares of our common stock to be outstanding after giving effect to payment of the dividend or distribution cannot be established until the value per share at which additional shares will be issued has been determined and elections of our stockholders have been tabulated. Stockholders who do not elect to receive dividends and distributions in shares of common stock may experience accretion to the net asset value of their shares if our shares are trading at a premium at the time we issue new shares under the plan and dilution if our shares are trading at a discount. The level of accretion or discount would depend on various factors, including the proportion of our stockholders who participate in the plan, the level of premium or discount at which our shares are trading and the amount of the dividend or distribution payable to a stockholder. 

There are no brokerage charges or other charges to stockholders who participate in reinvestment of dividends or distributions under the plan. The plan administrator&#8217;s fees under the plan are paid by us. If a participant elects by written notice to the plan administrator to have the plan administrator sell part or all of the shares held by the plan administrator in the participant&#8217;s account and remit the proceeds to the participant, the plan administrator is authorized to deduct a $15 transaction fee plus a $0.10 per share brokerage commissions from the proceeds. 

Stockholders who receive dividends or distributions in the form of stock are subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as are stockholders who elect to receive their dividends or distributions in cash. A stockholder&#8217;s basis for determining gain or loss upon the sale of stock received in a dividend or distribution from us will be equal to the total dollar amount of the dividend or distribution payable to the stockholder. Any stock received in a dividend or distribution will have a new holding period for tax purposes commencing on the day following the day on which the shares are credited to the U.S. Stockholder&#8217;s account (as defined below). 

Participants in the plan have the option of making additional cash payments to the plan administrator for investment in the shares at the then current market price. Such payments may be made in any amount from $25 to $10,000 per transaction. Participants in the plan may also elect to have funds electronically withdrawn from their checking or savings account each month. Direct debit of cash will be performed on the 10th of each month. Participants may elect this option by submitting a written authorization form or by enrolling online at the plan administrator&#8217;s website. The plan administrator will use all funds received from participants 

since the prior investment of funds to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market. We will not use newly-issued shares of our common stock to implement such purchases. Purchase orders will be submitted daily. The Plan Administrator may, at its discretion, submit purchase orders less frequently but no later than 30 days after receipt. The plan administrator will charge each stockholder who makes such additional cash payments $2.50, plus a $0.10 per share brokerage commission. Cash dividends and distributions payable on all shares credited to your plan account will be automatically reinvested in additional shares pursuant to the terms of the plan. Brokerage charges for some purchases are expected to be less than the usual brokerage charge for such transactions. Instructions sent by a participant to the plan administrator in connection with such participant&#8217;s cash payment may not be rescinded. 

Participants may terminate their accounts under the plan by notifying the plan administrator via its website at www.amstock.com or by filling out the transaction request form located at the bottom of their statement and sending it to the plan administrator at American Stock Transfer &#38; Trust Company, P.O. Box 922, Wall Street Station, New York, NY 10269-0560 or by calling the plan administrator&#8217;s Interactive Voice Response System at (888) 888-0313. Upon termination, the stockholder will receive certificates for the full shares credited to your plan account. If you elect to receive cash, the plan administrator sells such shares and delivers a check for the proceeds, less the $0.10 per share commission and the plan administrator&#8217;s transaction fee of $15. In every case of termination, fractional shares credited to a terminating plan account are paid in cash at the then-current market price, less any commission and transaction fee. 

The plan may be terminated by us upon notice in writing mailed to each participant at least 30 days prior to any payable date for the payment of any dividend by us or distribution pursuant to any additional cash payment made. All correspondence concerning the plan should be directed to the plan administrator by mail at American Stock Transfer and Trust Company LLC, 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, New York 11219, or by telephone at 888-888-0313. 

Stockholders who purchased their shares through or hold their shares in the name of a broker or financial institution should consult with a representative of their broker or financial institution with respect to their participation in our dividend reinvestment plan and direct stock purchase plan. Such holders of our stock may not be identified as our registered stockholders with the plan administrator and may not automatically have their cash dividend or distribution reinvested in shares of our common stock by the plan administrator. 

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations 

The following discussion is a general summary of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to us and to an investment in our shares. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the income tax considerations applicable to us or our investors on such an investment. For example, we have not described tax consequences that we assume to be generally known by investors or certain considerations that may be relevant to certain types of holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, including stockholders subject to the alternative minimum tax, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, dealers in securities, pension plans and trusts, financial institutions, U.S. Stockholders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, persons who mark-to-market our shares and persons who hold our shares as part of a &#8220;straddle,&#8221; &#8220;hedge&#8221; or &#8220;conversion&#8221; transaction. This summary assumes that investors hold our common stock as capital assets (within the meaning of the Code). The discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations, each as of the date of this report and all of which are subject to change, possibly retroactively, which could affect the continuing validity of this discussion. This summary does not discuss any aspects of U.S. estate or gift tax or foreign, state or local tax. It does not discuss the special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws that could result if we invested in tax-exempt securities or certain other investment assets. 

A &#8220;U.S. Stockholder&#8221; is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes: 

&#8226; 

A citizen or individual resident of the United States; 

&#8226; 

A corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia; 

&#8226; 

An estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or 

&#8226; 

A trust if (1) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) it has a valid election in place to be treated as a U.S. person. 

A &#8220;Non-U.S. Stockholder&#8221; is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is not a partnership and is not a U.S. Stockholder. 

If a partnership (including an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds shares of our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A prospective stockholder that is a partner of a partnership holding shares of our common stock should consult its tax advisor with respect to the purchase, ownership and disposition of shares of our common stock. 

Tax matters are very complicated and the tax consequences to an investor of an investment in our shares will depend on the facts of his, her or its particular situation. We encourage investors to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific consequences of such an investment, including tax reporting requirements, the applicability of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax laws, eligibility for the benefits of any applicable tax treaty and the effect of any possible changes in the tax laws. 

Election to be Taxed as a RIC 

As a business development company, we have elected and intend to continue to qualify to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally are not subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, to obtain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our &#8220;investment company taxable income,&#8221; which is generally our ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses (the &#8220;Annual Distribution Requirement&#8221;). 

Taxation as a RIC 

In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things: 

&#8226; 

Qualify to be treated as a business development company or be registered as a management investment company under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year; 

&#8226; 

Derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or other securities or currencies or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies and net income derived from an interest in a &#8220;qualified publicly traded partnership&#8221; (as defined in the Code) (the &#8220;90% Income Test&#8221;); and 

&#8226; 

Diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: 

&#9702; 

At least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets and more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer (which for these purposes includes the equity securities of a &#8220;qualified publicly traded partnership&#8221;); and 

&#9702; 

No more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, (i) of one issuer (ii) of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or (iii) of one or more &#8220;qualified publicly traded partnerships,&#8221; (the &#8220;Diversification Tests&#8221;). 

To the extent that we invest in entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes (other than a &#8220;qualified publicly traded partnership&#8221;), we generally must include the items of gross income derived by the partnerships for purposes of the 90% Income Test, and the income that is derived from a partnership (other than a &#8220;qualified publicly traded partnership&#8221;) will be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test only to the extent that such income is attributable to items of income of the partnership which would be qualifying income if realized by us directly. In addition, we generally must take into account our proportionate share of the assets held by partnerships (other than a &#8220;qualified publicly traded partnership&#8221;) in which we are a partner for purposes of the Diversification Tests. If the partnership is a &#8220;qualified publicly traded partnership,&#8221; the net income derived from such partnership will be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test, and interests in the partnership will be &#8220;securities&#8221; for purposes of the Diversification Tests. We monitor our investments in equity securities of entities that are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes to prevent our disqualification as a RIC. 

In order to meet the 90% Income Test, we may establish one or more special purpose corporations to hold assets from which we do not anticipate earning dividend, interest or other qualifying income under the 90% Income Test. Any such special purpose corporation would generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax, and could result in a reduced after-tax yield on the portion of our assets held by such corporation. 

Provided that we qualify as a RIC and satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain (which we define as net long-term capital gains in excess of net short-term capital losses) we timely distribute to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders. Any undistributed taxable income is subject to U.S. federal income tax. 

We will be subject to a 4% non-deductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income of RICs unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98% of our ordinary income recognized during the calendar year, (ii) 98.2% of our capital gain net income, as defined by the Code, recognized for the one year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (iii) any income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years. 

We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount, we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any original issue discount accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. 

Gain or loss realized by us from warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term or short-term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant. As a RIC, we are not allowed to carry forward or carry back a net operating loss for purposes of computing our investment company taxable income in other taxable years. 

Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain &#8220;asset coverage&#8221; tests are met. See &#8220;Regulation as a Business Development Company &#8211; Senior Securities.&#8221; Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or to avoid the excise tax, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. 

On September 16, 2015, we received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the &#8220;IRS&#8221;) permitting us to pay up to 80% of our required dividends in stock for the tax years ending August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2017. Any dividends paid in stock will be taxable to the shareholder as if the dividend had been paid in cash and we will receive a dividend paid deduction for such distribution. 

If we fail to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement or otherwise fail to qualify as a RIC in any taxable year, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would we be required to make distributions. Distributions would generally be taxable to our individual and other non-corporate taxable stockholders as ordinary dividend income eligible for the reduced maximum rate applicable to qualified dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, provided certain holding period and other requirements are met. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. To qualify again to be taxed as a RIC in a subsequent year, we would be required to distribute to our shareholders our accumulated earnings and profits attributable to non-RIC years reduced by an interest charge on 50% of such earnings and profits payable by us as an additional tax. In addition, if we failed to qualify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, then, in order to qualify as a RIC in a subsequent year, we would be required to elect to recognize and pay tax on any net built-in gain (the excess of aggregate gain, including items of income, over aggregate loss that would have been realized if we had been liquidated) or, alternatively, be subject to taxation on such built-in gain recognized for a period of ten years. 

Certain of our investment practices may be subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (i) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, (ii) convert lower taxed long-term capital gain and qualified dividend income into higher taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income, (iii) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (iv) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash, (v) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (vi) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions, and (vii) produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test. We will monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections in order to mitigate the effect of these provisions. 

We may invest in preferred securities or other securities the U.S. federal income tax treatment of which may be unclear or may be subject to recharacterization by the IRS. To the extent the tax treatment of such securities or the income from such securities 

differs from the expected tax treatment, it could affect the timing or character of income recognized, requiring us to purchase or sell securities, or otherwise change our portfolio, in order to comply with the tax rules applicable to RICs under the Code. 

Taxation of U.S. Stockholders 

Distributions by us generally are taxable to U.S. Stockholders as ordinary income or capital gains. Distributions of our &#8220;investment company taxable income&#8221; (which is, generally, our ordinary income plus realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses) will be taxable as ordinary income to U.S. Stockholders to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, whether paid in cash or reinvested in additional common stock. Provided that certain holding period and other requirements are met, such distributions (if designated by us) may qualify (i) for the dividends received deduction available to corporations, but only to the extent that our income consists of dividend income from U.S. corporations and (ii) in the case of individual shareholders, as qualified dividend income eligible to be taxed at long-term capital gain rates to the extent that we receive qualified dividend income (generally, dividend income from taxable domestic corporations and certain qualified foreign corporations). There can be no assurance as to what portion, if any, of our distributions will qualify for favorable treatment as qualified dividend income. 

Distributions of our net capital gain (which is generally our realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) properly designated by us as &#8220;capital gain dividends&#8221; will be taxable to a U.S. Stockholder as long-term capital gains, regardless of the U.S. Stockholder&#8217;s holding period for its common stock and regardless of whether paid in cash or reinvested in additional common stock. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits first will reduce a U.S. Stockholder&#8217;s adjusted tax basis in such stockholder&#8217;s common stock and, after the adjusted basis is reduced to zero, will constitute capital gains to such U.S. Stockholder. 

Although we currently intend to distribute any long-term capital gains at least annually, we may in the future decide to retain some or all of our long-term capital gains, and designate the retained amount as a &#8220;deemed distribution.&#8221; In that case, among other consequences, we will pay tax on the retained amount, each U.S. Stockholder will be required to include his, her or its proportionate share of the deemed distribution in income as if it had been actually distributed to the U.S. Stockholder, and the U.S. Stockholder will be entitled to claim a credit equal to its allocable share of the tax paid thereon by us. The amount of the deemed distribution net of such tax will be added to the U.S. Stockholder&#8217;s tax basis for his, her or its common stock. Since we expect to pay tax on any retained capital gains at our regular corporate tax rate, and since that rate is in excess of the maximum rate currently payable by individuals on long-term capital gains, the amount of tax that individual stockholders will be treated as having paid and for which they will receive a credit will exceed the tax they owe on the retained net capital gain. Such excess generally may be claimed as a credit against the U.S. Stockholder&#8217;s other U.S. federal income tax obligations or may be refunded to the extent it exceeds a stockholder&#8217;s liability for U.S. federal income tax. A stockholder that is not subject to U.S. federal income tax or otherwise required to file a U.S. federal income tax return would be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return on the appropriate form in order to claim a refund for the taxes we paid. In order to utilize the deemed distribution approach, we must provide written notice to our stockholders prior to the expiration of 60 days after the close of the relevant taxable year. We cannot treat any of our investment company taxable income as a &#8220;deemed distribution.&#8221; 

For purposes of determining (1) whether the Annual Distribution Requirement is satisfied for any year and (2) the amount of capital gain dividends paid for that year, we may, under certain circumstances, elect to treat a dividend that is paid during the following taxable year as if it had been paid during the taxable year in question. If we make such an election, the U.S. Stockholder will still be treated as receiving the dividend in the taxable year in which the distribution is made. However, any dividend declared by us in October, November or December of any calendar year, payable to stockholders of record on a specified date in any such month and actually paid during January of the following year, will be treated as if it had been received by our U.S. Stockholders on December 31 of the year in which the dividend was declared. 

If a U.S. Stockholder purchases shares of our common stock shortly before the record date of a distribution, the price of the shares will include the value of the distribution and the investor will be subject to tax on the distribution even though it represents a return of its investment. 

A U.S. Stockholder generally will recognize taxable gain or loss if such U.S. Stockholder sells or otherwise disposes of its shares of our common stock. Any gain or loss arising from such sale or taxable disposition generally will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Stockholder has held his, her or its shares for more than one year. Otherwise, it would be classified as short-term capital gain or loss. However, any capital loss arising from the sale or taxable disposition of shares of our common stock held for six months or less will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of the amount of capital gain dividends received, or undistributed capital gain deemed received, with respect to such shares. In addition, all or a portion of any loss recognized upon a taxable disposition of shares of our common stock may be disallowed if other substantially identical shares are purchased (whether through reinvestment of distributions or otherwise) within 30 days before or after the disposition. Capital losses are deductible 

only to the extent of capital gains (subject to an exception for individuals under which a limited amount of capital losses may be offset against ordinary income). 

In general, individual U.S. Stockholders currently are subject to a preferential rate on their net capital gain, or the excess of realized net long-term capital gain over realized net short-term capital loss for a taxable year, including long-term capital gain derived from an investment in our shares. Such rate is lower than the maximum rate on ordinary income currently payable by individuals. Corporate U.S. Stockholders currently are subject to U.S. federal income tax on net capital gain at ordinary income rates. 

Certain U.S. Stockholders who are individuals, estates or trusts and whose income exceeds certain thresholds will be required to pay a 3.8% Medicare tax on all or a portion of their &#8220;net investment income,&#8221; which includes dividends received from us and capital gains from the sale or other disposition of our stock. 

We will make available to each of our U.S. Stockholders, as promptly as possible after the end of each calendar year, a notice detailing, on a per share basis, the amounts includible in such U.S. Stockholder&#8217;s taxable income for such year as ordinary income and as long-term capital gain on form 1099-DIV. In addition, the amount and the U.S. federal tax status of each year&#8217;s distributions generally will be reported to the IRS. Distributions may also be subject to additional state, local and foreign taxes depending on a U.S. Stockholder&#8217;s particular situation. 

Payments of dividends, including deemed payments of constructive dividends, or the proceeds of the sale or other taxable disposition of our common stock generally are subject to information reporting unless the U.S. Stockholder is an exempt recipient. Such payments may also be subject to U.S. federal backup withholding at the applicable rate if the recipient of such payment fails to supply a taxpayer identification number and otherwise comply with the rules for establishing an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax, and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules generally will be allowed as a refund or credit against the holder&#8217;s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that certain information is provided timely to the IRS. 

Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders 

Whether an investment in our common stock is appropriate for a Non-U.S. Stockholder will depend upon that person&#8217;s particular circumstances. An investment in our common stock by a Non-U.S. Stockholder may have adverse tax consequences. Non-U.S. Stockholders should consult their tax advisers before investing in our common stock. 

Distributions of our &#8220;investment company taxable income&#8221; to Non-U.S. Stockholders that are not &#8220;effectively connected&#8221; with a U.S. trade or business conducted by the Non-U.S. Stockholder, will generally be subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or lower applicable treaty rate) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. 

We generally are not required to withhold federal tax for distributions to non-U.S. stockholders if (i) the distributions are properly reported to our stockholders as &#8220;interest-related dividends&#8221; or &#8220;short-term capital gain dividends,&#8221; (ii) the distributions are derived from sources specified in the Code for such dividends and (iii) certain other requirements were satisfied. However, depending on our circumstances, we may report all, some or none of our potentially eligible dividends as such qualified net interest income or as qualified short-term capital gains, and/or treat such dividends, in whole or in part, as ineligible for this exemption from withholding. In order to qualify for this exemption from withholding, a Non-U.S. Stockholder needs to comply with applicable certification requirements relating to its non-U.S. status (including, in general, furnishing an IRS Form W-8BEN or substitute form). In the case of shares held through an intermediary, the intermediary may withhold even if we report the payment as qualified net interest income or qualified short-term capital gain. Non-U.S. Stockholders should contact their intermediaries with respect to the application of these rules to their accounts. There can be no assurance as to what portion of our distributions will qualify for favorable treatment as qualified net interest income or qualified short-term capital gains. 

Actual or deemed distributions of our net capital gain to a Non-U.S. Stockholder, and gains recognized by a Non-U.S. Stockholder upon the sale of our common stock, that are not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business conducted by the Non-U.S. Stockholder, will generally not be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax and generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless the Non-U.S. Stockholder is a nonresident alien individual and is physically present in the United States for 183 or more days during the taxable year and meets certain other requirements. 

Distributions of our &#8220;investment company taxable income&#8221; and net capital gain (including deemed distributions) to Non-U.S. Stockholders, and gains realized by Non-U.S. Stockholders upon the sale of our common stock that are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business conducted by the Non-U.S. Stockholder, will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the graduated rates applicable to U.S. citizens, residents and domestic corporations. In addition, if such Non-U.S. Stockholder is a foreign corporation, it may also be subject to a 30% (or lower applicable treaty rate) branch profits tax on its effectively connected earnings and profits 

for the taxable year, subject to adjustments, if its investment in our common stock is effectively connected with its conduct of a U.S. trade or business. 

If we distribute our net capital gain in the form of deemed rather than actual distributions (which we may do in the future), a Non-U.S. Stockholder will be entitled to a U.S. federal income tax credit or tax refund equal to the stockholder&#8217;s allocable share of the tax we pay on the capital gains deemed to have been distributed. In order to obtain the refund, the Non-U.S. Stockholder must obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number and file a U.S. federal income tax return even if the Non-U.S. Stockholder would not otherwise be required to obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number or file a U.S. federal income tax return. 

Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act 

In addition, after June 30, 2014, withholding at a rate of 30% will be required on interest and dividends, and after December 31, 2018, withholding at a rate of 30% will be required on gross proceeds from the sale of, shares of our stock held by or through certain foreign financial institutions (including investment funds), unless such institution enters into an agreement with the Secretary of the Treasury to report, on an annual basis, information with respect to interests in, and accounts maintained by, the institution to the extent such interests or accounts are held by certain U.S. persons or by certain non-U.S. entities that are wholly or partially owned by U.S. persons and to withhold on certain payments. Accordingly, the entity through which our shares are held will affect the determination of whether such withholding is required. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country, or future Treasury regulations or other guidance, may modify these requirements. Similarly, dividends in respect of, and gross proceeds from the sale of, our shares held by an investor that is a non-financial non-U.S. entity that does not qualify under certain exemptions will be subject to withholding at a rate of 30%, unless such entity either (i) certifies to us that such entity does not have any &#8220;substantial United States owners&#8221; or (ii) provides certain information regarding the entity&#8217;s &#8220;substantial United States owners,&#8221; which we will in turn provide to the IRS. We will not pay any additional amounts to stockholders in respect of any amounts withheld. Non-U.S. Stockholders are encouraged to consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of the legislation on their investment in our shares. 

A Non-U.S. Stockholder generally will be required to comply with certain certification procedures to establish that such holder is not a U.S. person in order to avoid backup withholding with respect to payments of dividends, including deemed payments of constructive dividends, or the proceeds of a disposition of our common stock. In addition, we are required to annually report to the IRS and each Non-U.S. Stockholder the amount of any dividends or constructive dividends treated as paid to such Non-U.S. Stockholder, regardless of whether any tax was actually withheld. Copies of the information returns reporting such dividend or constructive dividend payments and the amount withheld may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which a Non-U.S. Stockholder resides under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty. Backup withholding is not an additional tax, and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules generally will be allowed as a refund or credit against a Non-U.S. Stockholder&#8217;s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that certain required information is provided timely to the IRS. 

Non-U.S. persons should consult their tax advisors with respect to the U.S. federal income tax and withholding tax, and state, local and foreign tax consequences of an investment in our common stock. 

Failure to Obtain RIC Tax Treatment 

If we were unable to obtain tax treatment as a RIC, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would they be required to be made. Distributions would generally be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income eligible for the reduced maximum rate applicable for qualified dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. 

Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder&#8217;s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. 

The discussion set forth herein does not constitute tax advice, and potential investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning the tax considerations relevant to their particular situation. 

Regulation as a Business Development Company 

General 

We are a closed-end, non-diversified investment company that has filed an election to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and has elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between business development companies and their affiliates (including any investment advisers or sub-advisers), 

principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters and requires that a majority of the directors be persons other than &#8220;interested persons,&#8221; as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a business development company unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities. 

We may invest up to 100% of our assets in securities acquired directly from issuers in privately negotiated transactions. With respect to such securities, we may, for the purpose of public resale, be deemed an &#8220;underwriter&#8221; as that term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933. Our intention is to not write (sell) or buy put or call options to manage risks associated with the publicly traded securities of our portfolio companies, except that we may enter into hedging transactions to manage the risks associated with interest rate, foreign currency and other market fluctuations. However, in connection with an investment or acquisition financing of a portfolio company, we may purchase or otherwise receive warrants to purchase the common stock of the portfolio company. Similarly, in connection with an acquisition, we may acquire rights to require the issuers of acquired securities or their affiliates to repurchase them under certain circumstances. We also do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, except with respect to money market funds, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any regulated investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of more than one investment company. With regard to that portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies, it should be noted that such investments subject our stockholders indirectly to additional expenses. None of these policies are fundamental and may be changed without stockholder approval. 

Qualifying Assets 

Under the 1940 Act, a business development company may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the company&#8217;s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following: 

1. 

Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An &#8220;eligible portfolio company&#8221; is defined in the 1940 Act and rules adopted pursuant thereto as any issuer which: 

a. 

is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States; 

b. 

is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the business development company) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act for certain financial companies such as banks, brokers, commercial finance companies, mortgage companies and insurance companies; and 

c. 

satisfies any of the following: 

i. 

does not have any class of securities with respect to which a broker or dealer may extend margin credit; 

ii. 

is controlled by a business development company or a group of companies including a business development company and the business development company has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; 

iii. 

is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2 million; 

iv. 

does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange; or 

v. 

has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million. 

2. 

Securities in companies that were eligible portfolio companies when we made our initial investment if certain other requirements are satisfied. 

3. 

Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control. 

4. 

Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing agreements. 

5. 

Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company. 

6. 

Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities. 

7. 

Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. 

In addition, a business development company must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2), (3) or (4) above. 

Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 

In order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, a business development company must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance; except that, where the business development company purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. &#8220;Making available significant managerial assistance&#8221; refers to any arrangement whereby we provide significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations, or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. We are also deemed to be providing managerial assistance to all portfolio companies that we control, either by ourselves or in conjunction with others. The nature and extent of significant managerial assistance provided by us will vary according to the particular needs of each portfolio company. Examples of such activities include advice on marketing, operations, fulfillment and overall strategy, capital budgeting, managing relationships with financing sources, recruiting management personnel, evaluating acquisition and divestiture opportunities, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies, and providing other organizational and financial guidance. We provide significant managerial assistance to all portfolio companies that we control, either by ourselves or in conjunction with others. Prospect Administration provides such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies, including controlled companies, when we are required to provide this assistance, utilizing personnel from Prospect Capital Management. 

Temporary Investments 

Pending investment in other types of &#8220;qualifying assets,&#8221; as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, including money market funds, U.S. government securities or high quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in money market funds, U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements that are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the Diversification Tests in order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. The Investment Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 

Senior Securities 

We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any preferred stock or public debt securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios after giving effect to such distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Risks Relating to Our Securities.&#8221; 

Code of Ethics 

We, Prospect Capital Management and Prospect Administration have each adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions. Personnel subject to each code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by us, so long as such investments are made in accordance with the code&#8217;s requirements. For information on how to obtain a copy of each code of ethics, see &#8220;Available Information.&#8221; 

Compliance Policies and Procedures 

We and the Investment Adviser have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the U.S. federal securities laws and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation and to designate a Chief Compliance Officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures.

Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 

We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to Prospect Capital Management. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of Prospect Capital Management are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by Prospect Capital Management and our independent directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change. 

Introduction. As an investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act, Prospect Capital Management has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, Prospect Capital Management recognizes that it must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of its clients. 

These policies and procedures for voting proxies for Prospect Capital Management&#8217;s Investment Advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 

Proxy policies. These policies are designed to be responsive to the wide range of subjects that may be the subject of a proxy vote. These policies are not exhaustive due to the variety of proxy voting issues that Prospect Capital Management may be required to consider. In general, Prospect Capital Management will vote proxies in accordance with these guidelines unless: (1) Prospect Capital Management has determined to consider the matter on a case-by-case basis (as is stated in these guidelines), (2) the subject matter of the vote is not covered by these guidelines, (3) a material conflict of interest is present, or (4) Prospect Capital Management might find it necessary to vote contrary to its general guidelines to maximize stockholder value and vote in its clients&#8217; best interests. In such cases, a decision on how to vote will be made by the Proxy Voting Committee (as described below). In reviewing proxy issues, Prospect Capital Management will apply the following general policies: 

Elections of directors. In general, Prospect Capital Management will vote in favor of the management-proposed slate of directors. If there is a proxy fight for seats on the Board of Directors or Prospect Capital Management determines that there are other compelling reasons for withholding votes for directors, the Proxy Voting Committee will determine the appropriate vote on the matter. Prospect Capital Management believes that directors have a duty to respond to stockholder actions that have received significant stockholder support. Prospect Capital Management may withhold votes for directors that fail to act on key issues such as failure to implement proposals to declassify boards, failure to implement a majority vote requirement, failure to submit a rights plan to a stockholder vote and failure to act on tender offers where a majority of stockholders have tendered their shares. Finally, Prospect Capital Management may withhold votes for directors of non-U.S. issuers where there is insufficient information about the nominees disclosed in the proxy statement. 

Appointment of auditors. Prospect Capital Management believes that the company remains in the best position to choose the auditors and will generally support management&#8217;s recommendation. 

Changes in capital structure. Changes in a company&#8217;s charter, articles of incorporation or by-laws may be required by state or U.S. federal regulation. In general, Prospect Capital Management will cast its votes in accordance with the company&#8217;s management on such proposal. However, the Proxy Voting Committee will review and analyze on a case-by-case basis any proposals regarding changes in corporate structure that are not required by state or U.S. federal regulation. 

Corporate restructurings, mergers and acquisitions. Prospect Capital Management believes proxy votes dealing with corporate reorganizations are an extension of the investment decision. Accordingly, the Proxy Voting Committee will analyze such proposals on a case-by-case basis. 

Proposals affecting the rights of stockholders. Prospect Capital Management will generally vote in favor of proposals that give stockholders a greater voice in the affairs of the company and oppose any measure that seeks to limit those rights. However, when analyzing such proposals, Prospect Capital Management will weigh the financial impact of the proposal against the impairment of the rights of stockholders. 

Corporate governance. Prospect Capital Management recognizes the importance of good corporate governance in ensuring that management and the Board of Directors fulfill their obligations to the stockholders. Prospect Capital Management favors proposals promoting transparency and accountability within a company. 

Anti-takeover measures. The Proxy Voting Committee will evaluate, on a case-by-case basis, proposals regarding anti-takeover measures to determine the measure&#8217;s likely effect on stockholder value dilution. 

Stock splits. Prospect Capital Management will generally vote with the management of the company on stock split matters. 

Limited liability of directors. Prospect Capital Management will generally vote with management on matters that would affect the limited liability of directors. 

Social and corporate responsibility. The Proxy Voting Committee may review and analyze on a case-by-case basis proposals relating to social, political and environmental issues to determine whether they will have a financial impact on stockholder value. Prospect Capital Management may abstain from voting on social proposals that do not have a readily determinable financial impact on stockholder value. 

Proxy voting procedures. Prospect Capital Management will generally vote proxies in accordance with these guidelines. In circumstances in which (1) Prospect Capital Management has determined to consider the matter on a case-by-case basis (as is stated in these guidelines), (2) the subject matter of the vote is not covered by these guidelines, (3) a material conflict of interest is present, or (4) Prospect Capital Management might find it necessary to vote contrary to its general guidelines to maximize stockholder value and vote in its clients&#8217; best interests, the Proxy Voting Committee will vote the proxy. 

Proxy voting committee. Prospect Capital Management has formed a proxy voting committee to establish general proxy policies and consider specific proxy voting matters as necessary. In addition, members of the committee may contact the management of the company and interested stockholder groups as necessary to discuss proxy issues. Members of the committee will include relevant senior personnel. The committee may also evaluate proxies where we face a potential conflict of interest (as discussed below). Finally, the committee monitors adherence to guidelines, and reviews the policies contained in this statement from time to time. 

Conflicts of interest. Prospect Capital Management recognizes that there may be a potential conflict of interest when it votes a proxy solicited by an issuer that is its advisory client or a client or customer of one of our affiliates or with whom it has another business or personal relationship that may affect how it votes on the issuer&#8217;s proxy. Prospect Capital Management believes that adherence to these policies and procedures ensures that proxies are voted with only its clients&#8217; best interests in mind. To ensure that its votes are not the product of a conflict of interests, Prospect Capital Management requires that: (i) anyone involved in the decision making process (including members of the Proxy Voting Committee) disclose to the chairman of the Proxy Voting Committee any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (ii) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how Prospect Capital Management intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. 

Proxy voting. Each account&#8217;s custodian will forward all relevant proxy materials to Prospect Capital Management, either electronically or in physical form to the address of record that Prospect Capital Management has provided to the custodian. 

Proxy recordkeeping. Prospect Capital Management must retain the following documents pertaining to proxy voting: 

&#8226; 

copies of its proxy voting policies and procedures; 

&#8226; 

copies of all proxy statements; 

&#8226; 

records of all votes cast by Prospect Capital Management; 

&#8226; 

copies of all documents created by Prospect Capital Management that were material to making a decision how to vote proxies or that memorializes the basis for that decision; and 

&#8226; 

copies of all written client requests for information with regard to how Prospect Capital Management voted proxies on behalf of the client as well as any written responses provided. 

All of the above-referenced records will be maintained and preserved for a period of not less than five years from the end of the fiscal year during which the last entry was made. The first two years of records must be maintained at our office. 

Proxy voting records. Clients may obtain information about how Prospect Capital Management voted proxies on their behalf by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Compliance Officer, Prospect Capital Management LLC, 10 East 40th Street, 42nd Floor, New York, NY 10016.
