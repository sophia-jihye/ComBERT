 ITEM 1 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS &#160; 

Organization and Business 

&#160; 

Sono-Tek Corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;Sono-Tek&#8221;, &#8220;We&#8221; or &#8220;Our&#8221;) was incorporated in New York on March 21, 1975 for the purpose of engaging in the development, manufacture and sale of ultrasonic liquid atomizing nozzles and systems. Ultrasonic nozzle systems atomize low to medium viscosity liquids by converting electrical energy into mechanical motion in the form of high frequency ultrasonic vibrations that break liquids into minute drops that can be applied to surfaces at low velocity. The principal advantage of these nozzle systems is that they use much less liquid than competitive nozzle systems to attain the required coatings on solar cells, fuel cells, glass, advanced textiles, food and food packaging, circuit boards, medical devices and many other coating applications. This advantage translates into precise thin films and lower costs for materials, less costly liquid consumption, less energy required for subsequent drying operations and less release into the environment of spray that would typically bounce back and scatter while using competitive nozzle systems. These factors are increasingly important to customers at a time of rising commodity and energy costs and supply limitations.

&#160;

We use our core technology &#8211; ultrasonic spray coating &#8211; to provide both standard and customized coating solutions to a wide range of manufacturing companies, enabling them to reduce their product costs and to develop new products with superior features and quality. Presently, our customers are in six major industries: electronics, advanced energy (solar and fuel cells), medical device, glass, textiles and foods. Our systems are widely used by leading high tech companies and research institutions, as well as by governmental, defense, energy and health agencies around the world.

&#160;

Our diversified group of customers provides the base for both financial stability and business growth opportunities.

&#160;

Markets 

&#160;

Our diverse offerings have positioned us to provide a unique and superior family of customized products to the six major industries that we serve. All of these systems are based on our core technology of ultrasonic spray coating. Many of these systems have been commercially proven in 24/7 working schedules, under harsh and challenging manufacturing environments, where they provide value in a continuous and reliable fashion.

&#160;

1. Electronics Industry. 

&#160;

We serve this industry primarily in two sectors; Printed Circuit Board (PCB) manufacturing and Semiconductor manufacturing.

&#160;

We provide manufacturers of PCBs with state-of-the-art solder fluxers. Spray fluxers are used in the manufacturing process of PCBs to apply flux, which removes oxidation and prepares the PCB for the process of soldering components onto it.

&#160;

Our ultrasonic spray fluxers reduce the amount of fluxing chemical needed, enhance the quality of the boards, and provide our customers with a better product at reduced costs of operations, when compared with conventional foam fluxers and pressure assisted fluxers.

3&#160;

&#160;

We are recognized as a standard setter in the industry and our systems are incorporated by various original equipment manufacturers (OEM) in their manufacturing lines for the production of electronic printed circuit boards. Some examples of products that we market to the electronics industry include: SonoFlux 2000F, SelectaFlux, SonoFlux EZ and SonoFlux Servo.

&#160;

Pursuant to an exclusive distribution agreement with EVS International Ltd (&#8220;EVS&#8221;) for the territories of the United States and Canada, we offer the EVS solder recovery system to our PCB customer base.

&#160;

We also have a significant established customer base in the semiconductor industry. The semi-conductor industry utilizes our ultrasonic atomizing nozzles and robotic XYZ coating platforms for the application and deposition of photo-resist onto semiconductor wafers. Certain of our semi-conductor manufacturing industry customers engaged in the production of micro-electro-mechanical systems, &#8220;MEMS&#8221;, have proven the ability of our technology to apply micron thick coatings to these complex wafers.

&#160;

2. Advanced Energy Industry. 

&#160;

Manufacturers of solar cells and fuel cells share two major technical and business challenges: enhancing the energy efficiency of their products and manufacturing their products in a cost effective way. Extremely uniform, thin layer coatings are at the heart of the solution for these advanced energy systems&#8217; challenges.

&#160;

Our precision coating systems provide superior surface uniformity and density, which are directly related to enhanced energy efficiency, compared to conventional systems. Our systems also afford our energy industry clients with the capabilities of saving up to 80% of the expensive catalysts and nano-materials used in these manufacturing processes. Some examples of our products marketed to the advanced energy industry include: ExactaCoat FC &#38; SC, Sonic Syringe, VersiCoat, and FlexiCoat FC &#38; SC, and SonoFlow Fusion.

&#160;

3. Medical Device Industry. 

&#160;

Our ultrasonic coating technology is used by medical device manufacturers worldwide. The leading applications for this industry are coating of arterial stents and balloon catheters with precise and uniform micron layers of polymers and drugs; coating of various implantable devices with biomedical materials and coating of blood collection tubes with anti-coagulants. These applications are typically performed under strict regulatory supervision of governmental agencies in different countries, and the continuing demand for our systems from these customers is indicative of the high quality performance that our systems provide these customers. Some examples of our products marketed to the medical device industry include: MediCoat I; Medicoat II; Medicoat PSI; MedXT; MediCoat BCC and ExactaCoat MD.

&#160;

4. Glass Industry. 

&#160;

The manufacture of float glass occurs under extremely harsh conditions of elevated temperatures. Our ultrasonic coating technology provides this manufacturing process with the means to precisely and uniformly apply anti-stain, and other specialty chemical agents, on the hot glass. Our customers benefit from an improved quality product, enhanced productivity and significantly reduced expenditures on annual maintenance, often resulting in a return on investment of less than one year. Based on this equipment&#8217;s recent successful performance, our systems are now specified by many global glass manufacturers as their equipment of choice.

&#160;

The equipment we offer to the glass industry is the WideTrack &#8211; wide area modular coating system.

4&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

5. Advanced Textiles Industry. 

&#160;

The textiles industry is expanding the introduction of high performance value adding coatings onto fabrics, such as anti-microbial, anti-stain, flame retardant and moisture barriers. The current manufacturing process for applying these expensive coatings creates significant waste of material, energy and water. We are working with this industry to incorporate our ultrasonic technology, often in combination with unique pre and post treatments of the coating materials, to reduce the effective material and energy usage by as much as 90%.

&#160;

6. Food Safety and Food Coatings Industry. 

&#160;

The food industry is evolving in response to greater demands for reduction of food borne illnesses. We have successfully introduced an anti-microbial coating system for sliced packaged meats, and we are focusing efforts on those global food companies that will need this technology to meet the new demands. We have also introduced our systems to other segments of the food industry for the coating of flavors, ingredients and other additives of interest. Most of our food industry equipment is designed on the WideTrack platform.

&#160;

Products 

&#160;

We have core technology and have developed and market the following products:

&#160;

1. SonoFlux 2000F &#8211; spray fluxer product &#8211; designed for high volume operations with standard width lines requiring low maintenance using a variety of solder fluxes, including rosin flux. It is designed to be used by electronic circuit board manufacturers to apply solder flux to fixed width circuit boards. The primary customers for the SonoFlux 2000F are original equipment manufacturers that produce their own electronic circuit boards. &#160;

2. SonoFlux EZ- spray fluxer product - applies solder flux to electronic printed circuit boards that vary from two inches to up to 18 inches in width in a cost-effective and uniform manner. They are designed to be used by either OEMs or contract manufacturers of electronic circuit assemblies. This is an economically priced system which sells effectively to smaller manufacturers. &#160;

3. SonoFlux Servo &#8211; a higher end spray fluxer capable of providing flux to both wide areas of a circuit board as well as selective fluxing. We also sell a selective fluxing apparatus known as Selectaflux. &#160;

4. MediCoat and MediCoat II for stent coating &#8211; table-top and stand alone, fully-contained systems designed to apply thin layers of polymer and drug coatings to arterial stents with high precision. The system incorporates motion control of the stent during the coating process and produces coatings having excellent uniformity. The MediCoat systems use either the AccuMist or MicroMist nozzle systems, which are precision nozzle configurations used in applications where precise patterns and coatings are required. These products minimize waste of expensive drug polymer coatings and provide high uniformity of drug addition from stent to stent. MediCoat II is similar to the MediCoat, but it has higher throughput capabilities more suited for a production environment. We also have additional medical coating platforms to address developing market segments for drug coated balloons, catheters and other implantable devices. 5&#160;

&#160;

5. WideTrack &#8211; Wide area modular coating system &#8211; designed to be used in applications that require efficient web-coating or wide area spraying capability. One module can cover substrates from six inches to 24 inches wide, depending on the application. Much greater widths can be achieved by linking modules together, and these systems have been applied in glass lines of up to 13 feet wide. A large number of systems have been sold over the past six years, and this application holds promise for the future due to cost and environmental savings demonstrated at customer sites. It uses non-clogging ultrasonic atomizing nozzles to produce a low velocity, highly controllable spray. The WideTrack System offers significant advantages over conventional pressure-spray methods in a broad range of applications such as non-woven fabrics, float glass, or odd-shaped industrial or consumer products. Since the ultrasonic spray can be easily controlled, it is possible to use fewer chemicals and less water and energy in applying coatings to glass, textiles, food products and packaging materials than with traditional nozzles. This also results in reduced environmental impact due to less overspray. &#160;

6. Exactacoat/Flexicoat &#8211; We offer a line of robotic XYZ coating equipment for applications involving coatings for fuel cell membranes, solar energy panels and specialty lens products. This equipment is offered in bench-top configurations as our ExactaCoat product and standalone as our FlexiCoat product. These platforms position and move our nozzle systems in a precise three dimensional application pattern. These coaters are extremely efficient especially when combined with our patented ultrasonic syringe pump, and patented sonic syringe to agitate and suspend nano-particles, which are often used in many of our applications. &#160;
