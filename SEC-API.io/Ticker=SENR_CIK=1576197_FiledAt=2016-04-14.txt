 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Strategic Environmental &#38; Energy Resources, Inc. (&#8220;the Company&#8221; or &#8220;SEER&#8221;) was originally organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on February 13, 2002 for the purpose of acquiring one or more businesses, under the name of Satellite Organizing Solutions, Inc (&#8220;SOZG&#8221;). In January 2008, SOZG changed its name to Strategic Environmental &#38; Energy Resources, Inc., reduced its number of outstanding shares through a reverse stock split and consummated the acquisition of both, REGS, LLC and Tactical Cleaning Company, LLC. SEER is dedicated to assembling complementary service and environmental, clean-technology businesses that provide safe, innovative, cost effective, and profitable solutions in the oil &#38; gas, environmental, waste management and renewable energy industries. SEER currently operates six companies with five offices in the western and mid-western U.S. Through these operating companies, SEER provides products and services throughout the U.S. and has licensed technologies with many customer installations throughout the U.S. Each of the six operating companies is discussed in more detail below. The Company also has non-controlling interests in joint ventures, some of which have no or minimal operations.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s domestic strategy is to grow internally through SEER&#8217;s subsidiaries that have well established revenue streams and, simultaneously, establish long-term alliances with and/or acquire complementary domestic businesses in rapidly growing markets for renewable energy, waste and water treatment and oil &#38; gas services. The focus of the SEER family of companies, however is to increase margins by securing or developing proprietary patented and patent-pending technologies and then leveraging its 20 plus-year service experience to place these innovations and solutions into the growing markets of emission capture and control, renewable &#8220;green gas&#8221; capture and sale, compressed natural gas (&#8220;CNG&#8221;) fuel generation, as well as general solid waste and medical/pharmaceutical waste destruction. Many of SEER&#8217;s current operating companies share customer bases and each provides truly synergistic services, technologies and products as well as annuity type revenue streams.

&#160;

The company now owns and manages five operating entities and one entity that has no significant operations to date.

&#160;

Subsidiaries 

&#160; 

REGS, LLC d/b/a Resource Environmental Group Services (&#8220;REGS&#8221;): (operating since 1994) provides general industrial cleaning services and waste management to many industry sectors focusing primarily on oil &#38; gas production (upstream) and refineries (downstream).

&#160;

Tactical Cleaning Company, LLC (&#8220;Tactical&#8221;): (operating since 2005) provides cleaning services to the tanker rail car industry with offices in two states and a focus on both food-grade and petroleum based products, i.e ., fuel oil and asphalt. Tactical has recently been permitted to operate a flare at its Kansas facility and will be expanding its operations in 2016 to include the cleaning of gas and propane rail cars. In 2016 it also intends to commence rail car cleaning operations in Illinois.

&#160;

MV, LLC (d/b/a MV Technologies), (&#8220;MV&#8221;) : (operating since 2003) MV designs and sells patented and/or proprietary, dry scrubber solutions for management of Hydrogen Sulfide (H 2 S) in biogas, landfill gas, and petroleum processing operations.

MV also develops and designs proprietary technologies and systems used to condition biogas for use as renewable natural gas, (&#8220;RNG&#8221;), for a number of applications, such as transportation fuel and natural gas pipeline injection.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Paragon Waste Solutions, LLC (&#8220;PWS&#8221;): (formed late 2010) PWS is an operating company that has developed a patented waste destruction technology using a pyrolytic heating process combined with &#8220;non-thermal plasma&#8221; assisted oxidation. This technique involves gasification of solid waste by heating the waste in a low-oxygen environment, followed by complete oxidation at higher temperatures in the presence of plasma. The term &#8220;non-thermal plasma&#8221; refers to a low energy ionized gas that is generated by electrical discharges between two electrodes. This technology, commercially referred to as CoronaLux&#8482;, is designed and intended for the &#8220;clean&#8221; destruction of hazardous chemical and biological waste (i.e ., hospital &#8220;red bag&#8221; waste) thereby eliminating the need for costly segregation, transportation, incineration or landfill (with their associated legacy liabilities). PWS is a 54% owned subsidiary.

&#160;

ReaCH4BioGas (&#8220;Reach&#8221;) (trade name for Benefuels, LLC): (formed February 2013) owned 85% by SEER. Reach develops renewable natural gas projects that convert raw biogas into pipeline quality gas and/or Renewable, &#8220;RNG&#8221;, for fleet vehicles. Reach has had minimal operations as of December 31, 2015.

&#160;

SEER Environmental Materials, LLC (&#8220;SEM&#8221;) formed September 2015. SEM is a wholly owned subsidiary established as a materials technology business with the purpose of developing advanced chemical absorbents and catalysts that enhance the capability of biogas produced from, landfill, wastewater treatment operations and agricultural digester operations. SEM had minimal operations as of December 31, 2015.

&#160;

&#160;

PWS MWS Joint Venture : In October 2014, PWS and Medical Waste Services, LLC (&#8220;MWS&#8221;) formed a contractual joint venture to exploit the PWS medical waste destruction technology. In 2015, MWS licensed and installed a CoronaLux&#8482; unit at an MWS facility, and subsequently received a limited permit to operate from the South Coast Air Quality Management District (&#8220;SCAQMD&#8221;) and the California Department of Public Health. Operations to date have included the destruction of medical waste while demonstrating the ultralow emissions necessary for application of a more expansive operating permit, submitted to SCAQMD in March 2016.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Segment Information 

&#160; 

The Company currently has identified four segments as follows:

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; % of Annual Revenues &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; 2014 REGS &#160; Industrial Cleaning &#160; &#160; 42 % &#160; &#160; 59 % TCC &#160; Rail Car Cleaning &#160; &#160; 24 % &#160; &#160; 15 % MV, SEM &#160; Environmental Solutions &#160; &#160; 26 % &#160; &#160; 25 % PWS &#160; Solid Waste &#160; &#160; 8 % &#160; &#160; 1 % &#160;

Reach is not currently operating but when operations commence it would be part of the Environmental Solutions segment. The MV RCM Joint Venture is not currently operating but when operations commence it would be part of the Environmental Solutions segment.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had one customer with sales in excess of 10% of our revenue and they represented approximately 35% and 53%, of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The loss of this customer, or a material reduction in revenue from this customer would have a material adverse effect on our business, our results of operations and our working capital. Subsequent to year end we were notified by this significant customer that effective April 1, 2016 we would no longer be providing routine maintenance services but still be eligible to provide other industrial cleaning services. The projected reduction of revenue from this customer is estimated to be between $2.5 and $3 million annually. See Notes 2 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 1A Risk Factors.

&#160;

Financial Condition 

&#160; 

As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has experienced recurring losses, and has an accumulated deficit of approximately $15.4 million as of December 31, 2015 and for the years ended December 31, 2015, and 2014, we incurred net losses, before non-controlling interest, of approximately $3.4 million and $726,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014 our current liabilities exceed our current assets by approximately $2.7 million and $1 million, respectively. Our total assets exceed total liabilities at December 31, 2015 by approximately $1 million and at December 31, 2014 our total assets exceeded our total liabilities by $3.8 million. The primary reason for the increase in negative working capital and the reduction in total assets over total liabilities from 2014 to 2015 is due to funding of Paragon operations and the net loss incurred in 2015 as noted above. Also see Notes 2 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements. Subsequent to year end REGS, a wholly owned subsidiary, was notified that effective April 1, 2016 it would no longer be providing routine maintenance services to its largest customer but would still be eligible to provide other industrial cleaning services. The projected loss of revenue from this customer is estimated to be between $2.5 and $3 million annually. The Company is in the process of opening an additional rail car cleaning facility in the Midwest (Illinois) to offset some of the lost service revenue previously derived from the refinery sector. For the period January 1, 2016 to March 31, 2016, the Company received equity financing in the amount of $325,000 through the sale of common stock.

&#160;

Realization of a major portion of our assets as of December 31, 2015, is dependent upon our continued operations. The Company is dependent on generating additional revenue or obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. In addition, we have undertaken a number of specific steps to continue to operate as a going concern. We continue to focus on developing organic growth in our operating companies, diversifying our service customer and market concentrations and improving gross and net margins through increased attention to pricing, aggressive cost management and overhead reductions. Critical to achieving profitability will be our ability to license and or sell, permit and operate though our joint ventures and licensees our CoronaLux&#8482; waste destruction units. We have increased our business development efforts to address opportunities identified in expanding domestic markets attributable to increased federal and state emission control regulations (particularly in the nation&#8217;s oil and gas fields) and a growing demand and a growing demand for energy conservation and renewable energies. In addition, the Company is evaluating various forms of financing that may be available to it. There can be no assurance that the Company will secure additional financing for working capital, increase revenues and achieve the desired result of net income and positive cash flow from operations in future years. These financial statements do not give any effect to any adjustments that would be necessary should the Company be unable to report on a going concern basis.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Industry 

&#160; 

SEER, with its diverse services, technologies, and environmental solution offerings, participates in the worldwide markets of industrial cleaning, environmental compliance, renewable energy and waste minimization/management. There are ever-increasing emissions and solid waste regulations and statutory programs at the local, state, federal and international levels that create and mandate the need for renewable energies and waste minimization, proper handling, storage, treatment and disposal of virtually all types of waste.

&#160;

The industrial waste management industry in North America was shaped first by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;), which requires waste generators to, among other things, store and dispose of hazardous waste in accordance with specific regulations. Subsequent to RCRA, growing national awareness of environmental issues, coupled with corporate and institutional awareness of environmental liabilities, have contributed to the growth of the industry and associated governing legislation on the state and federal levels.

&#160;

Today, collection and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes are subject to local, state, and federal requirements and controls that regulate health, safety, the environment, zoning and land-use. Included in these regulations is the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), of the United States. CERCLA holds generators and transporters of hazardous substances, as well as past and present owners and operators of sites where there has been a hazardous release, strictly, jointly and severally liable for environmental cleanup costs resulting from the release or threatened release of hazardous materials.

&#160;

The enactment of the federal Clean Air Act of 1970 (CAA) resulted in a major shift in the federal government&#8217;s role in air pollution control. This legislation authorized the development of comprehensive federal and state regulations to limit emissions from both stationary (industrial) sources and mobile sources. The Act has been amended and expanded in scope many times since its enactment and remains a major consideration for safely and responsibly conducting business in the U.S.

&#160;

These and countless other similar regulatory programs mandate the need for environmental and industrial cleaning services and technologies such as those offered by SEER and its companies.

&#160;

There are substantial barriers to entry in the waste management industry, including the high degree of expertise and training required, regulatory compliance, insurance, and licensing costs and procedures, strict federal, state, provincial and local permitting and oversight processes, and significant capital costs of equipment and qualified personnel.

&#160;

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

SEER&#8217;s growth to date has been fueled by a combination of synergistic and vertical integration, acquisitions, strategic alliances and organic growth. SEER acquired REGS, Tactical, and MV as wholly-owned subsidiaries. In Q4 2015 SEM was created to provide recurring and high-margin revenue to the Company by offering an internal source of diverse media solutions that are required for the treatment of various waste and off gas streams. This also enables greater pricing flexibility by the technology solutions affiliates that, in turn, should result in increased sales of systems that leads to greater demand of media. The increased installation and demand for media change outs also creates service opportunities for the Company&#8217;s service sector. We intend to continue pursuing an aggressive strategy of both acquisitions and organic growth while expanding our geographic footprint into other regions of the United States and foreign markets. Potential acquisitions may include businesses that secure supply chain and vendor logistics or are complementary to our core businesses or companies that provide a similar set of services in regions where the Company does not currently have operations.

&#160;

Upon full development of certain of our patented and patent-pending technologies, we intend to explore licensing relationships with larger, established companies to generate sustainable revenue streams from both domestic and international applications.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

MV was issued a patent in 2012 related to &#8220;Oil-Gas Vapor Collection, Storage, and Recovery System, etc.&#8221; Patent No. US 8,206,124 B1. MV was issued a second patent in 2014 titled &#8220;Fugitive Gas Capture&#8221;, US Patent No. 8,708,663 B1, that expanded claims in the earlier patent. The patents will expire in 2029 and 2031, respectively, unless otherwise extended. MV is in the process of expanding the scope and number of claims of this issued patent.

&#160;

In 2013, PWS filed provisional and non-provisional patent applications in the name and for the benefit of SEER arising out of and related to its waste disposal technology involving a pyrolitic first phase and a &#8220;cold plasma&#8221; second phase system referred to as &#8220;plasma light,&#8221; or CoronaLux&#8482; technology. In October 2014 SEER was issued patent No. 8,870,735 for this CoronaLux&#8482; technology. In 2014, PWS filed a provisional patent related to destruction of volatile organic compounds. A pyrolytic process is basically the decomposition of any material at elevated temperatures in a very low oxygen-containing atmosphere, as compared to conventional incineration or pyrolysis processes. PWS is not dependent upon this patent for its business development, although the issuance of the patent would give PWS a competitive advantage.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

The industrial services industry is highly competitive. Our competitors vary in size, geographical coverage and by the mix of services they offer. Our larger competitors include Philip Services, Clean Harbors, and Veolia Environmental Services. Additionally, we compete with a number of small and medium size companies. In the face of this competition we have been effective in growing our revenue due to the wide range of services we offer, a competitive pricing structure, our innovative and proprietary/patent pending technologies, and a reputation for reliability, built over the nearly 20 years of business operations as well as the care we take in performing and completing each customer project.

&#160;

In all its businesses, the Company currently holds very small parts of very large and growing markets. MV competes by providing superior hydrogen sulfide (&#8220;H 2 S&#8221;) &#8220;scrubbing&#8221; solutions that result in more cost effective removal of H 2 S from process gas streams. H 2 S is highly corrosive, and is a precursor to sulfur dioxide, a highly regulated air pollutant. Therefore removing H 2 S from industrial process waste streams is important in order to enhance the safety of personnel, extend the life of industrial equipment, and to minimize resulting air pollution. In the markets served by MV there are a number of competing technologies employed such as: biological scrubbing, chemical scrubbing, and dry scrubbing with activated carbon. REGS and Tactical Cleaning Company compete by offering superior customer response and lower total cost of service. PWS plans to compete by offering a unique on-site, on-demand waste destruction solution, eliminating the need for waste segregation, transportation, incineration, autoclaving and/or landfilling; in turn, eliminating all of the associated costs and legacy liabilities associated with current options for medical waste handling. We believe that the patented CoronaLux&#8482; technology results in a radically superior option in the medical waste management sector and in ultimate emissions cleaner than other solutions available in the market.

&#160;

Environmental Matters and Regulation 

&#160; 

Significant federal environmental laws affecting us are the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), also known as the &#8220;Superfund Act&#8221;, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Toxic Substances Control Act (&#8220;TSCA&#8221;).

&#160;

RCRA. RCRA is the principal federal statute governing hazardous waste generation, treatment, transportation, storage and disposal. Pursuant to RCRA, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the &#8220;EPA&#8221;) has established a comprehensive &#8220;cradle-to-grave&#8221; system for the management of a wide range of materials identified as hazardous or solid waste. States that have adopted hazardous waste management programs with standards at least as stringent as those promulgated by the EPA have been delegated authority by the EPA to administer their facility permitting programs in lieu of the EPA&#8217;s program. Every facility that treats, stores or disposes of hazardous waste must obtain a RCRA permit from the EPA or an authorized state agency, unless a specific exemption exists, and must comply with certain operating requirements.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

The Superfund Act. The Superfund Act is the primary federal statute regulating the cleanup of inactive hazardous substance sites and imposing liability for cleanup on the responsible parties. It also provides for immediate response and removal actions coordinated by the EPA, of the release of hazardous substances into the environment, and authorizes the government to respond to the release or threatened release of hazardous substances or to order responsible persons to perform any necessary cleanup. The statute provides for strict, and in certain cases, joint and several liability for these responses and other related costs, and for liability for the cost of damages to natural resources, to the parties involved in the generation, transportation and disposal of such hazardous substances. Under the statute, we may be deemed liable as a generator or transporter of a hazardous substance which is released into the environment, or as the owner or operator of a facility from which there is a release of a hazardous substance into the environment.

&#160;

The Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act was passed by Congress to control the emissions of pollutants into the air and requires permits to be obtained for certain sources of toxic air pollutants such as vinyl chloride, or criteria pollutants, such as carbon monoxide. In 1990, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to require further reductions of air pollutants with specific targets for non-attainment areas in order to meet certain ambient air quality standards. These amendments also require the EPA to promulgate regulations, which (i) control emissions of 189 hazardous air pollutants; (ii) create uniform operating permits for major industrial facilities similar to RCRA operating permits; (iii) mandate the phase-out of ozone depleting chemicals; and (iv) provide for enhanced enforcement.

&#160;

Clean Water Act. This legislation prohibits discharges into the waters of the United States without governmental authorization and regulates the discharge of pollutants into surface waters and sewers from a variety of sources, including disposal sites and treatment facilities.

&#160;

Toxic Substances Control Act. TSCA established a national program for the management of substances classified as PCBs, which include waste PCBs as well as RCRA wastes contaminated with PCBs. We conduct field services (remediation) activities that are regulated under provisions of the TSCA.

&#160;

Other Federal Laws. In addition to regulations specifically directed at the transportation, storage, and disposal facilities, there are a number of regulations that may &#8220;pass-through&#8221; to the facilities based on the acceptance of regulated waste from affected client facilities. Each facility that accepts affected waste must comply with the regulations for that waste, facility or industry. In our transportation operations, we are regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Railroad Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Coast Guard, as well as by the regulatory agencies of each state in which we operate or through which our vehicles pass. Health and safety standards under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or &#8220;OSHA&#8221;, are applicable to all of our operations.

&#160;

Pursuant to the EPA&#8217;s authorization of their RCRA equivalent programs, a number of states have regulatory programs governing the permitting and operation of hazardous waste facilities. Our facilities are regulated pursuant to state statutes, including those addressing clean water and clean air. Our facilities are also subject to local siting, zoning and land use restrictions. Although our facilities occasionally have been cited for regulatory violations, we believe we are in substantial compliance with all federal, state and local laws regulating our business.

&#160;

Income/Payroll Taxes 

&#160; &#160;

In 2009 and 2010, REGS, a subsidiary of the Company, became delinquent for unpaid federal employer and employee payroll taxes and accrued interest and penalties related to the unpaid payroll taxes.

&#160;

In or around 2010, REGS retained Washington D.C.-based legal counsel specializing in resolving federal tax matters. REGS has been represented by this firm throughout all phases of this tax matter and related proceedings. In September 2011, REGS received approval from the Internal Revenue Service (&#34;IRS&#34;) to begin paying the outstanding federal payroll tax liability plus related interest and penalties totaling approximately $971,000, in installments (the &#34;Installment Plan&#34;). Under the Installment Plan, we were required to pay minimum monthly installments of $12,500 commencing September 2011, which increased to $25,000 per month in September 2012, until the liability was paid in full. Through the duration of the Installment Plan, the IRS continued to charge penalties and interest at statutory rates. If the conditions of the Installment Plan were not met, the IRS could cancel it and could demand the outstanding liability to be repaid through traditional enforcement proceedings available to the IRS. Additionally, the IRS has filed a notice of federal tax lien against certain of REGS assets in order to secure the obligation. The IRS is to release this lien if and when we pay the full amount due. Two of the officers of REGS also have liability exposure for a portion of the taxes if REGS does not pay them.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

In May 2013, REGS filed an Offer in Compromise (&#34;OIC&#34;) with the IRS. While the OIC was under review by the IRS, the requirement to pay $25,000 a month under the Installment Plan was suspended. REGS was informed by its legal counsel that the IRS had accepted REGS&#8217; OIC. However by a letter dated March 27, 2014 REGS was notified that the OIC had been rejected. REGS appealed that rejection decision. However that appeal has been denied. As a result, the Installment Plan is terminated. In June 2014, REGS received notices of intent to levy property or rights to property from the IRS for the amounts owed for the past due payroll taxes, penalty and interest. The IRS has not taken any current action against REGS and REGS continues to be represented by its legal counsel.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the outstanding balance due to the IRS was $970,500, and $947,700, respectively.

&#160;

Other than this outstanding payroll tax matter arising in 2009, all state and federal taxes have been paid by REGS in a timely manner.

&#160;

Insurance 

&#160; 

To cover potential risks associated with the variety of services that the operating companies provide, we maintain adequate insurance coverages, including: 1) Casualty Insurance providing coverage for Commercial General Liability, Automotive Liability, Professional Liability Insurance and Employee Benefits Liability in the amounts of $1 million each, respectively, per year; 2) Contractor&#8217;s Pollution Liability Insurance, which has limits of $1 million per occurrence and $1 million in the aggregate; 3) Transportation Liability Insurance with a $1 million per occurrence; and 4) An Excess Umbrella Liability Policy of $5 million per occurrence and $5 million aggregate limit overall.

&#160;

Health, Safety and Compliance 

&#160; 

Preserving the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate, as well as remaining in compliance with local, state and federal rules and regulations are the highest priorities for us and our companies. We strive to maintain the highest professional standards in our compliance and health and safety activities. To achieve this objective, we have an in-house, full-time, health &#38; safety officer and emphasize comprehensive training programs for new employees as well as ongoing mandatory refresher programs, and safety bonus programs for existing employees. These programs are administered at both the corporate and field levels on a daily basis. Our efforts to ensure the health and safety of employees have been formally recognized by our customers as well as by the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment.

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Research and Development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;) costs are charged to operations when incurred and are included in operating expenses. R&#38;D expenses consist primarily of salaries, project materials, contract labor and other costs associated with ongoing product development and enhancement efforts. We spent approximately $491,200 and $277,000 on R&#38;D for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 70 full time non-union hourly and salaried employees. There is some seasonality to our business which requires us to use day laborers.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;
