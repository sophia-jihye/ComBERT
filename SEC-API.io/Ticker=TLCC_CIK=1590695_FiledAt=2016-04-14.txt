General Development of Business 

&#160;

Mirror Me, Inc. (&#8220;Mirror Me&#8221;) was formed as a Nevada corporation on October 24, 2013. Through September 15, 2014, Mirror Me was engaged in the business of designing and developing a mobile beauty shopping tool application to offer beauty product reviews, location based coupons and a platform for interaction with social networks specific to the products. On August 7, 2014, we changed our name from Mirror Me to Twinlab Consolidated Holdings, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;).

&#160;

On September 4, 2014, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and entered into a First Amendment to Agreement and Plan of Merger on September 16, 2014 (as amended, the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;), by and among the Company, TCC MERGER CO (&#8220;Sub Co&#8221;), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Twinlab Consolidation Corporation (&#8220;TCC&#8221;), a Delaware corporation, whereby TCC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Merger Agreement provided for the merger of Sub Co with and into TCC (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;), with TCC surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

On September 16, 2014, the Company completed the Merger, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, by and among the Company, Sub Co and TCC, whereby TCC became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

&#160;

As a result of the closing of the Merger, the Company became a holding company and redirected its focus to the operations of TCC, which through its operating subsidiaries developed, manufactured and marketed high-quality, science-based nutritional supplements, as well as its intended consolidation strategy of additional acquisitions and integration of acquired companies, as more fully described below under &#8220;Business Strategy.&#8221; As part of such strategy, following the Merger, the Company focused significantly in the last fiscal year on successfully obtaining funding for and completing two acquisitions for which TCC had acquired options prior to the Merger, and which in combination with the TCC operating businesses acquired in the Merger form the foundation for the Company&#8217;s consolidation and growth strategy. The first was the acquisition of the customer relationships of Nutricap Labs, LLC (&#8220;Nutricap&#8221;), a provider of dietary supplement contract manufacturing services, into the Company&#8217;s subsidiary NutraScience Labs, Inc. (&#8220;NutraScience&#8221;) on February 6, 2015, and the second was the acquisition of 100% of the equity interests of Organic Holdings, LLC (&#8220;Organic Holdings&#8221;), a market leader in the healthy aging and beauty from within categories and owner of the award-winning Reserveage&#8482; Nutrition brand. See &#8220;Development of the TCC Business.&#8221;

&#160;

Development of the TCC Business 

&#160;

TCC was incorporated on October 1, 2013 in the state of Delaware. TCC was formed to effect a consolidation strategy in the fragmented vitamin, mineral, herbal and other nutritional supplements sectors of the health and wellness industry (the &#8220;H&#38;W Industry&#8221;). Since TCC&#8217;s formation we have executed on this strategy in an effort to capitalize on the opportunity for consolidation that we believe exists in the H&#38;W Industry.

&#160;

On August 7, 2014, TCC acquired Idea Sphere Inc., a Michigan corporation (&#8220;Idea Sphere&#8221;), and its subsidiaries. This transaction was conducted as a reverse triangular merger (the &#8220;IS Merger&#8221;) in which TCC established a wholly owned subsidiary (&#8220;TCC Subco&#8221;) that merged with Idea Sphere. On August 27, 2014, the name of Idea Sphere was changed to THI. As a consequence of the closing of the IS Merger followed by the closing of the Merger, the Company&#8217;s main focus was redirected to the operations of its operating subsidiary, Twinlab Corporation, which manufactures and markets high-quality, science-based nutritional supplements under a number of brand names.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

THI was incorporated on April 10, 2001 and shortly thereafter incorporated ISI as a wholly owned subsidiary on December 4, 2001. On December 19, 2003, THI successfully completed the acquisition of substantially all of the non-ephedra assets of Twin Laboratories, Inc. out of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy pursuant to Section 363 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the &#8220;Bankruptcy Code&#8221;). The assets acquired by THI at the time constitute the core of the operations that comprise the Company&#8217;s current business.

&#160;

On November 4, 2005, THI completed the acquisition out of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy of substantially all of the non-ephedra assets of Metabolife International, Inc. and its subsidiary Alpine Health Products, LLC, again pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code. Through this acquisition, THI expanded its presence in the diet and energy category.

&#160;

On September 18, 2006, THI acquired the assets of Cole Water Company, LLC (&#8220;Cole Water&#8221;), which owned an aquifer with a recharging spring of naturally calcium-enriched water. This transaction included the acquisition of real property at 51 Strawtown Pike, Peru, Indiana that holds the natural aquifer as well as a bottling facility. Cole Water has marketed calcium-enriched water under a number of brand names. On December 31, 2013, THI discontinued operations of its water products line.

&#160;

On November 20, 2013, THI acquired certain assets of PatentHealth LLC, primarily the Trigosamine&#174; brand, out of receivership, expanding THI&#8217;s brand footprint to include the fast growing joint support category in the mass market and drugstore channels.

&#160;

On February 6, 2015, NutraScience acquired the customer relationships of Nutricap, a provider of dietary supplement contract manufacturing services. The purchase price paid for the acquired assets totaled $12,328, comprised of (i) $6,126 in cash ($8,000 less certain downward adjustments), (ii) deposit of $350 paid in 2014; (iii) assumption of certain liabilities of $1,874; and (iv) promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount of $3,978. Pursuant to a Transition Services Agreement entered into at the closing of the acquisition, Nutricap provided NutraScience with certain transitional services.

&#160;

On October 5, 2015, TCC acquired all of the membership units of Organic Holdings for a total purchase cash purchase price of $41,710, including a deposit of $2,000 paid in 2014. Organic Holdings, through its subsidiaries, is engaged in the business of developing and selling premium nutritional supplements, including under the award-winning Reserveage&#8482; Nutrition brand. With this acquisition, TCC significantly expanded its brand portfolio with the addition of a market leader for resveratrol and collagen supplements in the expanding healthy aging and beauty from within categories.

&#160;

As set forth in the &#8220;Financings&#8221; section below, the Company was able to obtain $37,000 of new equity financing to consummate the Organic Holdings acquisition, and thereby complete in the first fiscal year following the Merger the initial foundational phase of the Company&#8217;s synergistic consolidation strategy.

&#160;

Business Overview 

&#160;

General 

&#160;

We are an integrated manufacturer, marketer, and distributor of branded nutritional supplements and other natural products sold primarily to and through domestic health and natural food stores and food, drug and mass market retailers. Internationally, we market and distribute branded nutritional supplements to and through health and natural product distributors and retailers. Our core business strategy is to acquire, integrate and operate businesses in the natural products industry that manufacture, market and distribute branded nutritional supplements and other natural products. We believe that the consolidation and integration of these acquired businesses will provide ongoing financial synergies through increased scale and market penetration, as well as strengthened customer relationships.

&#160;

We manufacture and sell nutritional products, including primarily a full line of nutritional supplements under the Twinlab&#174; brand (including the Twinlab&#174; Fuel family of sports nutrition products) and the Reserveage&#8482; Nutrition brand. We also manufacture and sell diet and energy products under the Metabolife&#174; brand name, a line of products that promote joint health under the Trigosamine&#174; brand name, and a full line of herbal teas under the Alvita&#174; brand name . 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We manufacture a broad line of branded products, which are sold both domestically and internationally. We believe that as a result of our emphasis on innovation, quality, loyalty, education and customer service, our brands are widely recognized in health and natural food stores and among their customers. In addition, we act as contract manufacturers for private label customers.

&#160;

We were established to affect a consolidation strategy in the fragmented health and wellness industry. Utilizing the manufacturing assets and expertise of Twinlab Corporation as well as the product development, marketing and sales expertise of Organic Holdings, NutraScience and Twinlab, we intend to implement a strategic plan to provide elevated productivity, optimized manufacturing capability and distribution networks, increased market share and enhanced profit margins through selected acquisitions to emerge as a market leader. We have assembled a seasoned management team with extensive acquisition and integration expertise for the purpose of executing our strategic plan.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Business Strategy 

&#160;

We target consumers searching for high quality nutritional supplements and other natural products. We believe many of these consumers shop in sales channels that offer meaningful education, service and support to their customers.

&#160;

The primary channel that offers this type of support to consumers in the United States has been health and natural food stores (&#8220;HNF&#8221;). Our primary focus and strength has been and remains on this channel. This strategy has enabled us to benefit from the growth of the HNF channel. The HNF channel consists of approximately 16,500 retailers, including (i) independent health and natural food stores, (ii) health and natural food stores affiliated with local, regional and national health and natural food chains (including health and natural food store chains, such as Whole Foods Market, and vitamin store chains, such as The Vitamin Shoppe and Vitamin World) and (iii) GNC stores. The HNF channel principally caters to our primary target consumers: those who desire product education, service and high quality nutritional supplements and other natural products. We believe there are significant differences between mass market retailers (such as supermarkets, drugstores and warehouse clubs) that typically offer a limited selection of discounted natural products and lower-potency nutritional supplements and the HNF channel, where natural ingredients, quality, potency, selection and customer support are emphasized. The growth rate of the HNF channel peaked in the 1990&#8217;s but this channel still generates impressive growth and continued high level of consolidation and opportunity.

&#160;

We develop, manufacture, market and distribute a majority of our branded products, particularly in the Twinlab, Alvita, Metabolife and Trigosamine brands, and we believe that the quality of our products is among the highest in the industry. We market our branded products through a combination of our own sales force and brokers dedicated to the HNF channel. We seek to be a market leader in the development of new and innovative products and believe that we benefit from greater customer and product diversification than many of our competitors.

&#160;

We believe that consumers seeking high quality products are also purchasing them through other channels, such as products available through health care practitioners and direct to consumer channels and we continue to seek opportunities through acquisitions to explore reaching our target consumers through these and additional channels.

&#160;

An integral part of our business strategy has been to acquire, integrate and operate businesses in the natural products industry that manufacture, market and distribute branded nutritional supplements. We believe that the consolidation and integration of these acquired businesses provides ongoing financial synergies through increased scale and market penetration, as well as strengthened customer relationships. As discussed in the &#8220;Development of the TCC Business&#8221; section hereof, the Company placed significant priority in the last fiscal year on successfully completing two acquisitions that were targets of TCC at the time of the Merger and critical to TCC&#8217;s roll-up strategy.

&#160;

In addition to our branded products business, the acquisition of the customer relationships of Nutricap provided an important platform to expand our contract manufacturing business.

&#160;

Industry 

&#160;

According to Nutrition Business Journal , the total retail natural products market (the &#8220;Natural Products Market&#8221;) is highly fragmented and totaled approximately $137.4 billion in retail sales in calendar 2012. The Natural Products Market is comprised of the following submarkets (with estimated calendar 2012 sales indicated): (i) personal care, $13.1 billion, (ii) natural and organic foods, $47.9 billion, (iii) functional foods, $43.9 billion and (iv) vitamins, minerals and supplements, $32.5 billion. Historically, our primary focus has been on vitamins, minerals and supplements (the &#34;VMS Market&#34;). Our business plan could include expansion into the other three channels of the Natural Products Market: natural and organic personal care, natural and organic foods, and functional foods.

&#160;

The total retail VMS Market is highly fragmented with estimated sales of $32.5 billion in calendar 2012, $30.0 billion in calendar 2011 and $28.1 billion in calendar 2010. We believe that the VMS Market reached its present size due to a number of factors, including (i) interest in healthier lifestyles, living longer and living well, (ii) the publication of research findings supporting the positive health effects of certain nutritional supplements and (iii) the aging of the &#34;Baby Boom&#34; generation combined with the tendency of consumers to purchase more nutritional supplements and natural foods as they age.

&#160;

Products 

&#160;

We primarily manufacture and market nutritional supplements. Our products include vitamins, minerals, specialty supplements and sports nutrition products primarily under the Twinlab&#174; brands (including the Twinlab&#174; Fuel family of sports nutrition products) and Resereveage&#8482; Nutrition brand. We also manufacture and sell diet and energy products under the Metabolife&#174; brand name, a line of products that promote joint health under the Trigosamine&#174; brand name, and a full line of herbal teas under the Alvita&#174; brand name. To accommodate consumer preferences, our products come in various formulations and delivery forms, including capsules, tablets, softgels, chewables, liquids, sprays, powders and whole herbs.

&#160;

We currently market our products through a multiple brand strategy to offer more customer choice and to encourage retailers to allocate additional shelf space to our brands. We have worked to enhance the strength of our brands by instituting business strategies that have included (i) consolidating or expanding our sales force in certain areas, as appropriate, to maximize each brand's geographic coverage, (ii) performance and growth-based incentives for sales representatives, (iii) introducing more sophisticated management information systems and (iv) periodic updating to brand packaging.

Sales, Marketing and Promotion 

&#160;

Sales 

&#160;

TCC and its subsidiaries are a fully integrated manufacturer, marketer and distributor of nutritional products and generated approximately $82 million in net revenue in 2015. TCC presently sells its products through over 45,000 retail stores in the U.S. and distributes its products in over 55 countries worldwide. 

&#160;

Marketing and Promotion 

&#160;

TCC markets a number of brands to consumers shopping in numerous retail channels as well as online e-tailers. Each channel demands a different approach that meets its distinctive needs. The following is a brief overview of the channels in which we market our varied brands:

&#160;

Sales Channel &#160; Specifics Health and Natural Foods (&#8220;HNF&#8221;) &#160; Retailers who specialize in supplements (i.e., The Vitamin Shoppe, Vitamin World and GNC) and retailers ranging from Whole Foods to small health food stores &#160; &#160; &#160; Performance &#160; Retailers and e-tailers that focus on sports nutrition (i.e., Max Muscle Sports Nutrition and Bodybuilding.com) retailers such as bike shops, and running shops and other sport-centric locations where supplements are sold &#160; &#160; &#160; Food, Drug and Mass Market (&#8220;FDM&#8221;) &#160; Retailers ranging from Walgreens Drugstores to Walmart &#8216;big box&#8217; stores &#160; &#160; &#160; Direct to Consumer (&#8220;DTC&#8221;) &#160; Websites, catalogs, print ads, telemarketing, infomercials, banner ads &#160; &#160; &#160; International &#160; Distributors found in the 55 countries in which Twinlab currently does business &#160; &#160; &#160; Convenience &#160; Retailers ranging from national chains such as 7-Eleven to small local gas station convenience stores &#160; 

Current Lines and Recent Launches 

&#160; 

Reserveage&#8482; Nutrition 

&#160;

Organic Holdings is principally engaged in the business of developing, formulating, manufacturing, distributing and marketing branded and private-label nutritional products and dietary supplements. These brands include Reserveage Nutrition, Rebody, Cocowell, Resvitale, and Natures Code. Products focus largely on health and wellness, along with beauty.

&#160;

Twinlab Brands 

&#160; 

Twinlab markets its products under five primary brand names: Twinlab (vitamins and minerals), Twinlab Fuel, MetaboLife, Trigosamine and Alvita Teas. The Company has recently launched Twinlab ProSeries, a premium brand of sports nutrition products for the serious athlete, Twinlab CleanSeries, a line of products certified to be free of banned substances, and Twinlab Bariatric, a line of products that support bariatric patients. Each individual brand of products has a core channel (or channels) for which it was designed and in which it accurately meets the channel-specific needs.

&#160;

In some cases a product line crosses several channels. Twinlab Vitamins, Twinlab CleanSeries and Alvita Teas focus on the specialty and HNF channels. Twinlab sports nutrition brands (Fuel, ProSeries, and PerformanceSeries) cross from specialty to FDM and the performance channel, while Trigosamine and MetaboLife are primarily sold in FDM. For this reason, marketing tactics vary by brand and channel.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Marketing Efforts by Brand 

&#160;

Twinlab Brand Vitamins 

&#160;

Twinlab is a heritage brand of vitamins that has been in the market for over 45 years and carries a great deal of brand awareness from the health and natural food and specialty consumer. Twinlab vitamins are sold through the specialty and health and natural channel, where retail staff is relied upon to educate consumers about new science and new products. This is sometimes referred to as &#8216;hand selling&#8217;, and for this reason, marketing and promotional efforts consist of many trade activities to educate distributors and retail staff. As a major industry player, Twinlab participates in two leading trade events, Expo West and Expo East, held annually to announce product introductions to retailers nationwide. Since Twinlab is a distributed brand (shipping to certain major retailers, but also to nationwide distributors who resell to smaller retailers), the Company also delivers training to distributor sales teams and participates in distributor and retailer shows designed to reach retailers and store managers.

&#160;

Marketing activities for the Twinlab brand have had two main focuses:

&#160;

1. Trial and awareness of key existing products; and 2. Awareness, trial and education for new products. &#160;

Marketing and promotional efforts for the Twinlab Brand focus on both trade and consumer tactics: 

&#160;

Retailer Promotions &#8211; Promotional programs in stores can drive consumer awareness when they are making purchase decisions. Manufacturer charge backs are created for retailers to support features and promotions of products throughout the year. They are called &#8216;charge-backs&#8217; because retailers deduct the cost of these programs from their product purchases. These programs are designed to incentivize the retailer to display products in secondary placement (multiple store locations) and often require a discount to create excitement and deliver incremental savings in order to drive consumer purchases.

&#160;

Sampling &#8211; Many Twinlab products are immediately experiential either because of their taste or effect. We use samples and retail demo programs to allow for trial and education of our products. These are generally conducted in-store using Twinlab or third party personnel.

&#160;

Consumer and Trade Print Ads &#8211; Print advertising is coordinated with product introductions and spans trade magazines, distributor marketing communications and consumer magazines targeting the health and natural food channel.

&#160;

Public Relations/Bloggers &#8211; Extensive outreach to media and blogger influencers has resulted in numerous features and reviews in online and print media channels. This channel is especially important in our sports nutrition businesses where online influencers can both positively or negatively affect the success of a product.

&#160;

Coupons &#8211; Coupons are incorporated into different communication vehicles when appropriate to drive trial use and create additional excitement around a product.

&#160;

Trade Shows &#8211; Products need to be on the shelf in order for the public to buy. Retailer relations and new product launches are focused on trade shows to create excitement around the brand and drive placement. Display and promotion of products at several industry trade shows annually is a key component of support for the Twinlab brand.

&#160;

Twinlab Bariatric Support 

&#160;

Twinlab Bariatric Support&#8482; is a line of products specifically designed for persons who have undergone bariatric surgery &#8211; resulting in a decreased capacity to digest foods. The focus of Bariatric Support&#8217;s marketing campaign has mainly been on avenues that build awareness with the key influencers &#8211; namely, the doctors, surgeons, nurses, psychologists, and nutritionists who interact directly with pre- and post-op bariatric surgery patients. While their individual supplementation needs may change over time, bariatric surgery patients will typically continue to follow a supplement regimen for a lifetime.

&#160;

Alvita Teas 

&#160;

Started in 1922, Alvita Teas is an herbal therapeutic tea line with a rich history and loyal customers. In 2012, the brand commenced a rebranding exercise to update the look of the packaging while converting the products to organic ingredients. Current marketing efforts have been focused on communication tools and tactics to support the retail transition and educate on the key points of difference in the rebranding.

&#160;

Public relations and social media have also been strategically planned and executed to best maximize our marketing goals. Public relations objectives have attracted editors and bloggers nationwide creating viral buzz and interest. The organic Alvita website continues to expand and serves to educate both consumers and retailers. Facebook is being engaged to aggressively create brand awareness, build a loyal consumer base and attract new customers.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Twinlab Fuel 

&#160;

Twinlab was one of the key early companies that created the sports nutrition industry in the 1970&#8217;s and 1980&#8217;s, and the Twinlab Fuel brand name remains synonymous with products to improve personal physical performance. In 2012, management re-engineered the Company&#8217;s sports nutrition business in a way that would re-authenticate the original Fuel brands to the contemporary performance market.

&#160;

Twinlab ProSeries . ProSeries is a new line of premium high-performance products under Twinlab&#8217;s Fuel brand targeting the hardcore bodybuilder or extreme fitness enthusiast. These products are advanced, cutting edge supplements designed to provide significant results, and the new brand and premium hardcore focus have created a fresh emphasis for the Company that is getting results. The Company positioned the products as a fresh departure with a credit to Twinlab&#8217;s authentic sports nutrition roots in the industry for over 45 years. The innovative products in this line are finding enthusiastic acceptance in the performance channel but also breaking into the mass market in certain cases. ProSeries employs a critical cross-section of marketing activities ranging from attending performance shows to print and electronic media &#8211; including training videos on key performance sites. Believing sampling is the surest way to drive sales, the ProSeries division has its own &#8216;Fuel Militia&#8217; of fitness professionals and body builders that attend events, provide performance demonstrations and distribute samples to the public.

&#160;

Twinlab CleanSeries . CleanSeries, launched in 2012, is a new line of non-genetically modified organism tested products certified to be free of any banned substances. This sports nutrition brand is purpose-built for the health and natural food channel where face-to-face education and hand-selling rule the day. The marketing is focused on in-store demos, couponing, events, retailer education sessions, social media and limited print advertising.

&#160;

Twinlab PerformanceSeries . PerformanceSeries is the Company&#8217;s new positioning for the existing Fuel line products that languished after the turn of the century. Still driving sales based on their high quality and strong reputation, this line needed a new direction and new start. The line has been reengineered to be a high performance, high value foundational product line. Excitement has been created around the brand by updating formulas where appropriate and redesigning the look and targeted appeal of the line. Marketing activities center on the younger and mature athletes who seek core sports nutrition products and strong value for their money.

&#160;

MetaboLife 

&#160;

The MetaboLife brand of diet and energy products is one of the nation&#8217;s most recognized brands and was acquired by Twinlab on November 4, 2005. MetaboLife has been positioned to serve the FDM channel. MetaboLife benefits from very high un-aided consumer awareness and targeted, advertorial marketing.

&#160;

Trigosamine 

&#160;

The Trigosamine brand, acquired on November 20, 2013, focuses on support for joints &#8211; one of the larger product segments after the diet segment. The brand is focused in mass market, and the Company began limited sales in the DTC channel during the last fiscal year.

&#160;

Research and Development; Quality Control 

&#160;

We have a commitment to research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;) and to introducing innovative products to correspond with consumer trends and scientific research. We believe that product quality and innovation are fundamental to our long-term growth and success. Through our R&#38;D efforts, we seek to (i) test the safety, purity and potency of products, (ii) develop testing methods for ensuring and verifying the consistency of the dosage of ingredients included in our products, (iii) develop new, more effective product delivery forms and (iv) develop new products either by combining existing ingredients used in nutritional supplements or identifying new ingredients that can be used in nutritional supplements. Our efforts are designed to lead not only to the development of new and improved products, but also to ensure effective manufacturing quality control measures.

&#160;

We conduct R&#38;D in our own facilities and we also work with outside firms to perform testing and other aspects of R&#38;D. We currently employ various professionals in R&#38;D and quality control with degrees in, among other things, chemistry, microbiology and engineering and, in many cases, these professionals have also received training in natural health food products. In addition, we retain the services of outside laboratories from time to time to validate our product standards and manufacturing protocols.

&#160;

We spent approximately $1,577 and $1,559 for R&#38;D for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

&#160;

Our quality control and safety programs seek to ensure the safety and superior quality of our products and that they are manufactured in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (&#8220;cGMPs&#8221;). The Company has always had an acute focus on safety, quality, efficacy and compliance with law. Our processing methods are monitored closely to ensure that only quality ingredients are used and to ensure product purity.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Marketing and Sales 

&#160;

We believe our marketing and sales efforts help to promote demand for our products by educating retailers, who in turn educate their customers, as to the quality and attributes of our natural nutritional supplements and other products. Our branded products are currently sold in the United States primarily in the HNF channel. We believe that our products are attractive to retailers in the HNF channel due to factors such as the strength of our brand names, the breadth of our product offerings, the quality and efficacy of our products and the availability of service, sales support and educational materials. We have developed numerous Internet sites (including http:// reserveage.com , www.twinlab.com , www.metabolife.com , www.alvita.com , www.twinlabfuel.com , www.bariatricvitamins.com , www.cleanseries.twinlab.com , www.twinlabbeachbody.com ) that provide information about our branded lines and the various products within each brand. We have included our Internet site here and elsewhere only as an inactive textual reference. The information contained on the Internet site is not incorporated by reference into this Report.

&#160;

We employ a sales force dedicated to each of the individual channels in which we sell our products. The dynamics and buying patterns of the various channels require specific approaches and skills necessitating specific sales approaches. Our sales representatives regularly visit each assigned customer in their respective areas to assist in the solicitation of orders for products, provide related product sales assistance and pitch new products to buyers. In addition to our field reps, we maintain a highly skilled internal phone-based sales force that keeps in touch with customers and through which they purchase our products. This technique covers a broad swath of the industry. We also engage skilled brokers, where appropriate and helpful based on their particular expertise and relationships with particular customers.

&#160;

Significant Customers 

&#160;

Sales to the Company&#8217;s top three customers aggregated to approximately 23% and 26% of total consolidated sales in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Sales to one of those customers, Wal-Mart, were approximately 15% and 12% of total consolidated sales in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Accounts receivable from these customers were approximately 24% of total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.

&#160;

Manufacturing 

&#160;

We manufacture domestically in Utah, at which a significant majority of our Twinlab branded products are manufactured, and also have certain of our products manufactured by highly qualified third-party providers located primarily in the U.S. and Canada. The Company has industry-standard manufacturing and production facilities in its 170,000 square foot facility in American Fork, Utah.

&#160;

Our manufacturing process generally consists of the following operations: (i) sourcing ingredients for products, (ii) warehousing raw ingredients, (iii) measuring ingredients for inclusion in products, (iv) blending, grinding, and chilsonating ingredients into a mixture with a homogeneous consistency and (v) encapsulating, tableting, pouring, pouching, bagging or boxing the blended mixture into the appropriate dosage form using either automatic or semiautomatic equipment. The next step, bottling and packaging, involves placing the product in packaging with appropriate tamper-evident features and sending the packaged product to a distribution point for delivery to retailers. We place special emphasis on quality control, including raw material verification, homogeneity testing, weight deviation measurements and quality sampling. See &#34;Research and Development; Quality Control.&#34;

&#160;

We manufactured approximately 54% of our products in fiscal 2015, based on net sales. For the products we manufacture ourselves, our manufacturing operations are performed primarily in our facilities located in Utah. We also have numerous contract manufacturers geographically spread across the country. These contract manufacturers include softgel manufacturers, liquid manufacturers and other specialty manufacturers as and when needed. These contract manufacturers do business with us under both short and long term contracts depending on our needs. The Company does not manufacture any of the basic materials used in packaging (bottles, boxes, shipping cartons, caps, tamper resistant films, etc.).

&#160;

Management Information and Communication Systems 

&#160;

We use customized computer software systems, as well as commercially-packaged software, for handling order entry and invoicing, manufacturing, inventory management, shipping, warehouse operations, customer service inquiries, accounting operations and management information. The Company currently uses an SAP system to maintain its accounts and various bolt on systems to manage the aforementioned work processes. The Company has been working on updating our ERP and MRP systems with a new Deacom system to be initially launched at Twinlab Corporation in 2016 and thereafter rolled out to NutraScience and Organic Holdings, which currently have their own accounting and management information systems.

&#160;

Materials and Suppliers 

&#160;

We employ a purchasing staff that works with marketing, product development, formulations and quality control personnel to source raw materials for products as well as other items purchased by us. Raw materials are sourced for domestic and international approved suppliers principally from the United States, Europe and China. Raw materials used by us are available from a variety of suppliers. We believe our relationships with our principal suppliers are good. We have adopted dual sourcing for raw materials where available to mitigate the impact of raw materials shortages that happen from time to time.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

The formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, distribution and sale (hereafter, &#34;sale&#34; or &#34;sold&#34; may be used to signify all of these activities) of our products are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies. The primary federal level regulators are the Food and Drug Administration (&#34;FDA&#34;) and the Federal Trade Commission (&#34;FTC&#34;). In addition, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (&#34;CPSC&#34;), the United States Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency also regulate the industry. Our activities are also regulated by various governmental agencies for the states and localities in which our products are sold, as well as by governmental agencies in countries outside the United States in which our products are sold. Among other matters, regulation by the FDA and FTC is concerned with product safety, adherence to the cGMPs in manufacturing, packaging, or holding the products, and claims made with respect to a product. Specifically, the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (&#34;FDCA&#34;), as amended by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (&#8220;DSHEA&#8221;), regulates the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution and sale of food, including dietary supplements. The FDA also regulates over-the-counter (&#34;OTC&#34;) drugs. The FTC regulates the advertising of these products. The National Advertising Division (&#34;NAD&#34;) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus oversees an industry-sponsored, self-regulating system that permits competitors to resolve disputes over advertising claims. The NAD has no enforcement authority of its own, but may refer matters that appear to violate the FTC Act or the FDCA to the FTC or the FDA for further action, as appropriate.

&#160;

Federal agencies, primarily the FDA and the FTC, have a variety of procedures and enforcement remedies available to them, including initiating investigations, issuing warning letters and cease-and-desist orders, requiring corrective labeling or advertising, requiring consumer redress (for example, requiring that a company offer to repurchase products previously sold to consumers), seeking injunctive relief or product seizures, imposing civil penalties or commencing criminal prosecution. In addition, certain state agencies have similar authority. These federal and state agencies have in the past used these remedies in regulating participants in the food, dietary supplement and OTC drug industries, including the imposition of civil penalties in the millions of dollars against a few industry participants.

&#160;

Some of our products are regulated as conventional foods under the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (&#8220;NLEA&#8221;). The NLEA amended the FDCA to establish additional requirements for ingredient and nutrition labeling and labeling claims for conventional foods. If the NLEA labeling requirements change at a future time, we may need to revise our product labeling. Most of our products are classified as dietary supplements.

&#160;

DSHEA was enacted in 1994, amending the FDCA. We believe DSHEA is generally favorable to consumers and to the dietary supplement industry. DSHEA establishes a statutory class of &#34;dietary supplements.&#34; In general, a dietary supplement is a product (other than tobacco) intended to supplement the diet that bears or contains one or more of the following dietary ingredients: (A) a vitamin; (B) a mineral; (C) an herb or other botanical; (D) an amino acid; (E) a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or (F) a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any ingredient described in (A) through (E). A dietary supplement must be intended for ingestion and labeled as a dietary supplement; and must not be represented as a conventional food or as a sole item of a meal or diet and cannot include an article approved as a, or approved for investigation as a, new drug, antibiotic, or biological (see 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)). Whatever their form may be, DSHEA places dietary supplements in a special category under the general umbrella of &#34;foods,&#34; not drugs. Dietary ingredients marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994 may be marketed without the submission of a &#34;new dietary ingredient&#34; (&#34;NDI&#34;) premarket notification to the FDA. Dietary ingredients not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994, unless subject to certain exemptions, may require the submission, at least 75 days before marketing, of an NDI notification containing information establishing that the ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe for its intended use. Among other things, DSHEA prevents the FDA from regulating dietary ingredients in dietary supplements as &#34;food additives&#34; and allows the use of statements of structure function claims on product labels and in labeling, so long as those statements do not constitute disease claims and are truthful and sufficiently substantiated. The FDA has issued final regulations under DSHEA and has issued draft guidance on NDI notification requirements. Further guidance and regulations are expected. Several bills to amend DSHEA in ways that might make this law less favorable to consumers and industry have been proposed in Congress.

&#160;

The FDA issued a Final Rule on GMPs (Good manufacturing Practices) for dietary supplements on June 22, 2007. The GMPs cover manufacturers, packagers, labelers, distributors, and holders of finished dietary supplement products, including dietary supplement products manufactured outside the United States that are imported for sale into the United States. Among other things, these GMPs: (a) require identity testing on all incoming dietary ingredients, (b) call for a &#34;scientifically valid system&#34; for ensuring finished products meet all specifications, (c) include requirements related to process controls, including statistical sampling of finished batches for testing and requirements for written procedures and (d) require extensive recordkeeping. We have reviewed the GMPs and have taken steps to ensure compliance. While we believe we are in compliance, there can be no assurance that our operations or those of our suppliers will be in compliance in all respects at all times. Additionally, there is a potential risk of increased audits as the FDA and other regulators seek to ensure compliance with the GMPs.

&#160;

On December 22, 2006, Congress passed the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act, which went into effect on December 22, 2007. The law requires, among other things, that companies that manufacture or distribute nonprescription drugs or dietary supplements report serious adverse events allegedly associated with their products to the FDA and institute recordkeeping requirements for all adverse events (serious and non-serious). There is a risk that consumers, the press and government regulators could misinterpret reported serious adverse events as evidence of causation by the ingredient or product complained of, which could lead to additional regulations, banned ingredients or products, increased insurance costs and a potential increase in product liability litigation, among other things.

&#160;

The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (&#34;CPSIA&#34;) primarily addresses children's product safety but also improves the administrative process of the Consumer Safety Product Commission (&#8220;CPSC&#8221;). Among other things, CPSC/CPSIA impact on dietary supplements is principally in requirements for use of child resistant closures (&#8220;CRCs&#8221;), performance validation of CRCs, and requirements for packaging and labeling of iron-containing products. The CPSIA also requires testing and certification of certain products and enhances the CPSC's authority to order recalls.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (&#34;FSMA&#34;), enacted January 4, 2011, amended the FDCA to significantly enhance the FDA's authority over various aspects of food regulation. The FSMA granted the FDA mandatory recall authority when the FDA determines there is a reasonable probability that a food is adulterated or misbranded and that the use of, or exposure to, the food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals. Other changes include, but are not limited to, the FDA's expanded access to records; the authority to suspend food facility registrations and require high risk imported food to be accompanied by a certification; stronger authority to administratively detain food; the authority to refuse admission of an imported food if it is from a foreign establishment to which a U.S. inspector is refused entry for an inspection; and the requirement that importers verify that the foods they import meet domestic standards.

&#160;

One of FSMA's more significant changes is the requirement of preventive controls for food facilities required to register with the FDA, except dietary supplement facilities in compliance with both GMPs and the serious adverse event reporting requirements. Although dietary supplement facilities are exempt from the preventative controls requirements, dietary ingredient facilities might not qualify for the exemption. FDA's proposed preventative controls regulations, issued in February 2013, would require that facilities develop and implement preventive controls to assure that identified hazards are significantly minimized or prevented, monitor the effectiveness of the preventive controls, and maintain numerous records related to those controls. When implemented, the preventative controls requirements may increase the costs of dietary ingredients and affect our ability to obtain dietary ingredients. An additional significant change related to FSMA is the requirement that importers implement a foreign supplier verification program (&#34;FSVP&#34;). FDA's proposed FSVP regulations, issued in July 2013, would require importers to implement supplier verification activities to ensure that the foods they import meet domestic standards. When implemented, the FSVP requirements may affect the cost and the availability of dietary supplements and dietary ingredients.

&#160;

As required by Section 113(b) of the FSMA, the FDA published in July 2011 a draft guidance document clarifying when the FDA believes a dietary ingredient is an NDI, when a manufacturer or distributor must submit an NDI premarket notification to the FDA, the evidence necessary to document the safety of an NDI and the methods for establishing the identity of an NDI. The draft guidance, if implemented as proposed, could have a material impact on our operations. Although our industry has strongly objected to several aspects of the draft guidance, it is unclear whether and what changes FDA will make to the final guidance. In addition, it is possible that the FDA will begin taking enforcement actions consistent with the interpretations in the draft guidance before issuing a final version.

&#160;

The new FSMA requirements, as well as the FDA enforcement of the NDI guidance as written, could require us to incur additional expenses, which could be significant, and negatively impact our business in several ways, including, but not limited to, the detention and refusal of admission of imported products, the injunction of manufacturing of any dietary ingredients or dietary supplements until the FDA determines that such ingredients or products are in compliance and the potential imposition of fees for re-inspection of noncompliant facilities. Each of these events would increase our liability and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

&#160;

The FTC and the FDA have pursued a coordinated effort to challenge what they consider to be unsubstantiated and unsafe weight-loss products, and have also coordinated enforcement against dietary supplement claims in other areas, including immunity and children&#8217;s products. Their efforts to date have focused on manufacturers and marketers as well as media outlets, and have resulted in a significant number of investigations and enforcement actions, some resulting in civil penalties under the FTC Act of several million dollars. We expect that the FTC and the FDA will continue to focus on health-related claims for dietary supplements and foods, and our products could be the subject of an FTC/FDA inquiry.

&#160;

The sale of our products in countries outside the United States is regulated by the governments of those countries. Our plans to commence or expand sales in those countries may be prevented or delayed or even suspended by such regulations or by regulators in those countries. In countries in which we have distributors, compliance with such regulations is generally undertaken by our distributors, but even in these cases we may cooperate by providing information to distributors and there can be no assurance we will not be liable if a distributor fails to comply. These distributors are independent contractors over whom we have limited control.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Health and Natural Foods 

&#160;

The Natural Products Market and the VMS Market are highly competitive. Our principal competitors in the VMS market that sell to the health and natural foods channel include a number of large, nationally-known brands (such as Bluebonnet, Country Life, Enzymatic Therapy, Garden of Life, Jarrow Formulas, Natural Factors, Nature's Plus, Nature's Way, Nordic Naturals, Now Foods, New Chapter and Solgar) and many smaller brands, manufacturers and distributors of nutritional supplements. Within the broader Natural Products Market, there are a number of large, nationally-known competitors, such as Hain Celestial. Because both the health and natural foods market and the VMS Market generally have low barriers to entry, additional competitors enter the market regularly.

&#160;

Private label products of our customers also provide competition to our products. Whole Foods Market, The Vitamin Shoppe, Sprouts Farmers Market, Natural Grocers and many health and natural food stores also sell a portion of their offerings under their own private labels. Private label products are often sold at a discount to branded products.

&#160;

We believe that stores in the HNF channel are increasingly likely to align themselves with those companies that offer a wide variety of high-quality products, have a loyal consumer base, support their brands with strong marketing and education programs and provide consistently high levels of customer service. We believe that we compete favorably with other nutritional supplement companies because of our comprehensive line of products and brands, premium brand names, commitment to quality, ability to rapidly introduce innovative products, competitive pricing, strong and effective sales force, distribution strategy and sophisticated marketing and promotional support. The wide variety and diversity of the forms, potencies and categories of our products are important points of differentiation between us and many of our competitors.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Mass Market 

&#160;

Our sales are focused primarily in limited SKUs in the Trigosamine and Metabolife lines in the mass market retail channel of distribution. Metabolife and Trigosamine were focused on the mass market channel when acquired and do not have a notable presence elsewhere at retail. It is possible that as increasing numbers of companies (or brands) sell nutritional supplement products and other natural products in the mass market channels (such as Pharmavite (Nature Made), The Carlyle Group (Nature's Bounty), Reckitt Benckiser Group (Schiff), Hain Celestial and Church &#38; Dwight) our mass market brands will be negatively impacted. In addition, several major pharmaceutical companies continue to offer nutritional supplement lines in the mass market, including Pfizer (Centrum) and Bayer (One-A-Day).

&#160;

Performance 

&#160;

The performance channel is primarily made up of independent retailers that focus their product mix on performance products, as well as gyms, health clubs and other health and fitness locations that house small stores to cater to the needs of their clients. There is also a small vibrant market serviced by bicycle shops and other specialty sports equipment retailers, and even larger sporting goods stores, like Dick&#8217;s Sporting Goods and Sports Authority, are testing sports nutrition sets in their stores. The retail performance channel is supplied by two specialty distributors that focus exclusively on this channel (Europa Sports Nutrition, Lone Star Distribution). In recent years the performance channel has become dominated by several online retailers ( www.bodybuilding.com , www.supplementwarehouse.com , www.dpsnutrition.com , www.netrition.com , www.allstarhealth.com , www.muscleandstrength.com ) that have the advantage of broad selection and aggressive pricing.

&#160;

Competition in this channel is intense. The character of the target customer makes the barriers to entry in sports nutrition extremely low as consumers look for the next great product that will help them optimize their workout. As a result, in addition to the somewhat large stable core brands (BSN, CytoSport, Five Star, Met-Rx, MHP, MRI, MusclePharm, Optimum Nutrition, Twinlab, VPX, etc.) there is a secondary level of innovative, small companies with niche products focused on a specific targeted customer. Despite intense competition, the performance channel is attractive to us as the hardcore sports nutrition customer will spend several thousand dollars a year to look their best &#8211; far more than the average VMS customer. Twinlab believes it has a three-part advantage in the market; it has the stature of being one of the old and trusted brands, it has a long history of quality and efficacy (trustworthy products) and it has created a new professional bodybuilding line of products (ProSeries) that is getting attention due to the quality, efficacy and relevance of its highly authentic products.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We own numerous trademarks that have been registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and have filed applications to register additional trademarks. In addition, we claim domestic trademark and service mark rights in numerous additional marks that we use. We own a number of trademark registrations in countries outside the United States. Federally registered trademarks in the United States have a perpetual life, as long as they are maintained and renewed on a timely basis and used properly as trademarks, subject to the rights of third parties to seek cancellation of the trademarks if they claim priority or confusion of usage. Most foreign trademark offices use similar trademark renewal processes. We regard our trademarks and other proprietary rights as valuable assets and believe they make a significant positive contribution to the marketing of our products.

&#160;

We protect our legal rights concerning our trademarks by appropriate legal action. We rely on common law trademark rights to protect our unregistered trademarks. Common law trademark rights do not provide us with the same level of protection as afforded by a United States federal registration of a trademark. In addition, common law trademark rights are limited to the geographic area in which the trademark is actually used. We have registered and intend to register certain trademarks in certain limited jurisdictions outside the United States where our products are sold, but we may not register all or even some of our trademarks in every country in which we conduct business or intend to conduct business.

&#160;

We sell a number of products that include patented ingredients. We purchase these ingredients from parties that we believe have the right to manufacture and sell those ingredients to us. However, there are a large number of patents that have been granted or applied for in the dietary supplement industry, and there may be an increased possibility that third parties will seek to compel us and our competitors to purchase their patented ingredients or file infringement actions. The cost of these patented ingredients is typically higher than the cost of non-patented ingredients.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of the date of this report, we had 242 full-time employees and 4 part-time employees. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
