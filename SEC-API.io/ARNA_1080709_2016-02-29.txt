 Item 1. Business. 

Overview 

We are embracing the challenge of improving health by seeking to bring innovative medicines targeting G protein-coupled receptors, or GPCRs, to patients. Our focus is discovering, developing and commercializing drugs to address unmet medical needs, and we have an internally discovered drug, lorcaserin, that is being marketed and a pipeline of novel drug candidates that we intend to advance. 

Lorcaserin, our first and only approved drug, is approved for marketing in the United States and South Korea for the indication of weight management, and is being commercialized under the brand name BELVIQ &#174; &#32;(which is pronounced as &#8220;BEL-VEEK&#8221;). BELVIQ was made available by prescription in the United States in June 2013 and in South Korea in February 2015, and there are pending applications for the regulatory approval of BELVIQ for marketing in a number of additional territories. We also have a pending application with the US Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the regulatory approval of a once-daily formulation of BELVIQ, which is planned to be marketed under the brand name BELVIQ XR &#174; . 

We have collaborations with Eisai Inc. and Eisai Co., Ltd. (collectively, Eisai) and other pharmaceutical companies for the marketing of BELVIQ in most of the world, and our Swiss subsidiary, Arena Pharmaceuticals GmbH, or Arena GmbH, is responsible for manufacturing and supplying BELVIQ for these companies. 

In addition to BELVIQ, we have a pipeline of drug candidates and other compounds at various stages of research and development, all of which have been internally discovered. Our drug candidates in clinical development include APD334 for autoimmune diseases, ralinepag for vascular diseases, and APD371 for pain. Our programs under collaboration include nelotanserin for dementia-associated psychosis, temanogrel for thrombotic diseases, and an undisclosed orphan GPCR for central nervous system, or CNS, indication(s). We also have numerous earlier-stage programs. 

The key elements of our 2016 strategic focus are as follows: 

&#8226; 

Advance our proprietary clinical programs: 

&#9702; 

APD334 - a modulator of the sphingosine 1-phosphate subtype 1, or S1P 1 , receptor 

&#9702; 

Ralinepag - an agonist of the prostacyclin, or IP, receptor 

&#9702; 

APD371 - an agonist of the cannabinoid-2, or CB 2 , receptor 

&#8226; 

Pursue strategic collaborations for certain clinical and pre-clinical programs 

&#8226; 

Discover and develop additional pre-clinical drug candidates 

&#8226; 

Support Eisai and our other collaborators in their BELVIQ efforts, including their work to: 

&#9702; 

Complete the cardiovascular outcomes trial, or CVOT, to assess the effect of BELVIQ on major adverse cardiovascular events and a possible reduction in conversion to Type 2 diabetes compared to placebo 

&#9702; 

Obtain regulatory approval for BELVIQ XR 

&#9702; 

Obtain regulatory approval in additional territories 

In October 2015, at the request of our Board of Directors, our former President, Chief Executive Officer and principal financial officer, retired from our company. On the same date, our Board appointed Harry F. Hixson, Jr., Ph.D., one of our directors since September 2004, to the position of interim Chief Executive Officer and interim principal financial officer. We have initiated a search for a new chief executive officer. 

Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc., incorporated in the state of Delaware in April 1997, and is located in San Diego, California. Our operations outside of the United States are primarily located at Arena GmbH in Zofingen, Switzerland. Activities conducted at Arena GmbH include manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance, development of manufacturing processes, qualifying suppliers and otherwise managing aspects of the supply chain, regulatory compliance, distribution of finished products, alliance management, and strategic planning and development. Arena GmbH and its wholly owned subsidiary, API Development LTD, also hold certain intellectual property rights for lorcaserin and nelotanserin. 

Product and Research and Development Programs 

Below is a summary of our GPCR portfolio of clinical-stage drug candidates and partnered programs. Our portfolio also includes earlier-stage programs in various therapeutic areas, including cardiovascular, central nervous system and metabolic diseases. 

Lorcaserin 

Our internally discovered drug, lorcaserin, is available by prescription in the United States and South Korea for weight management under the brand name BELVIQ. There are pending applications for the regulatory approval of lorcaserin for marketing for weight management in a number of additional territories. 

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than one-third of US adults (35.7%) were obese in 2009-2010. Studies have shown that a weight loss of 5% to 10% of body weight from baseline can result in meaningful improvements in cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., lipids, blood pressure and blood glucose), quality of life and functional capacity, and a significant reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes. 

BELVIQ is believed to decrease food consumption and promote satiety by selectively activating serotonin 2C receptors in the brain. Activation of these receptors may help a person eat less and feel full after eating smaller amounts of food. 

We have collaborations with pharmaceutical companies that provide them rights and responsibilities to seek regulatory approval and commercialize BELVIQ for weight management. These collaborations are with Eisai for all of the countries in the world, except for South Korea, Taiwan, Israel, Australia and New Zealand; Ildong Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Ildong, for South Korea; CY Biotech Company Limited, or CYB, for Taiwan; and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.&#8217;s local Israeli subsidiary, Abic Marketing Limited, or Teva, for Israel. 

BELVIQ availability in the United States 

In June 2013, Eisai made BELVIQ available in the United States to patients by prescription, following marketing approval by the FDA and scheduling by the US Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA. BELVIQ is indicated in the United States as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adult patients with an initial body mass index, or BMI, of: 

&#8226; 

30 kg/m 2 &#32;or greater (obese), or 

&#8226; 

27 kg/m 2 &#32;or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes). 

Limitations of Use: 

&#8226; 

The safety and efficacy of coadministration of BELVIQ with other products intended for weight loss, including prescription drugs (e.g., phentermine), over-the-counter drugs, and herbal preparations, have not been established. 

&#8226; 

The effect of BELVIQ on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been established. 

The recommended daily dose of BELVIQ is 10 mg twice daily. 

US postmarketing requirements 

As part of the US approval of BELVIQ, the FDA is requiring the evaluation of the effect of long-term treatment with BELVIQ on the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events, or MACE, in overweight and obese patients with cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors (otherwise known as the CVOT), as well as to conduct postmarketing studies to assess the safety and efficacy of BELVIQ for weight management in obese pediatric patients. 

The CVOT reached its target enrollment of approximately 12,000 patients around December 2015. The CVOT, which is also referred to as CAMELLIA (Cardiovascular And Metabolic Effects of Lorcaserin In Overweight And Obese Patients), is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that is enrolling patients with cardiovascular disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors. The trial is expected to run for several more years. 

The FDA-required portion of CAMELLIA is designed to evaluate BELVIQ&#8217;s effect on the incidence of MACE (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death) compared to placebo, with a non-inferiority margin for the hazard ratio of 1.4. In addition, as part of the non-FDA required portion of the trial, CAMELLIA will also evaluate whether BELVIQ reduces the incidence of conversion to type 2 diabetes in patients without type 2 diabetes at baseline and the incidence of MACE+ (MACE or hospitalization for unstable angina or heart failure, or any coronary revascularization), both as compared to placebo. CAMELLIA also includes echocardiograms in a subset of the patients. 

As the first of four postmarketing commitments related to adolescent and pediatric patients, we have completed a pharmacokinetic study of BELVIQ in adolescents. Eight adolescent boys and girls, aged 12-17, with a BMI of greater than or equal to the 95 th &#32;percentile for age and sex, but less than or equal to 44 kg/m 2 , were administered a single 10 mg dose of BELVIQ. Based on the results of the trial, the exposure in adolescents appears to be similar to the exposure in overweight and obese adults. We have also completed a single-dose pharmacokinetic study in eight children, aged 6-11, with a BMI of greater than or equal to the 99 th &#32;percentile for age and sex, but less than or equal to 44 kg/m 2 , and results are pending. 

BELVIQ availability in South Korea 

In February 2015, Ildong made BELVIQ available in South Korea to patients by prescription, following marketing approval by Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, or MFDS. In South Korea, BELVIQ is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight management in adult patients with an initial BMI of: 

&#8226; 

30 kg/m 2 &#32;or greater (obese), or 

&#8226; 

27 kg/m 2 &#32;or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid condition (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes). 

The recommended daily dose of BELVIQ is 10 mg twice daily. 

Lorcaserin collaborations and regulatory activity 

As described above, we have entered into collaborations for the potential regulatory approval and marketing of lorcaserin in most of the world, and below are more detailed descriptions of each of the collaborations. With respect to seeking regulatory approval of BELVIQ, Eisai has pending applications in Brazil and Mexico, Teva has a pending application in Israel, and CYB has a pending application in Taiwan. We or our collaborators have previously filed applications for marketing approval of BELVIQ with the regulatory authorities for the European Union, Canada and Switzerland. We withdrew the 

applications in the European Union and Canada, and the regulatory authority for Switzerland notified us that we had not yet satisfactorily addressed their concerns and that our application would not be approved. We expect to continue to work with our collaborators in pursuing regulatory approvals for BELVIQ in their respective territories. 

Eisai collaboration 

In November 2013, Arena GmbH and Eisai entered into a restated Marketing and Supply Agreement, or Eisai Agreement, which expanded Eisai&#8217;s exclusive commercialization rights for lorcaserin to all of the countries in the world, except for South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand and Israel. Eisai&#8217;s commercialization rights are subject to applicable regulatory approval. 

Upfront and milestone payments 

In connection with entering into the restated Eisai Agreement, we received from Eisai an upfront payment of $60.0 million. This payment was in addition to the $50.0 million and $5.0 million in upfront payments we received in connection with our earlier agreements with Eisai. We are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $176.0 million in additional regulatory and development milestone payments. 

Product purchase price and purchase price adjustment payments 

We manufacture lorcaserin at our facility in Switzerland, and sell lorcaserin to Eisai for a purchase price starting at 31.5% in the United States and 30.75% outside of the United States (other than Europe, China and Japan, where the purchase price starts at 27.5%) of Eisai&#8217;s aggregate annual net product sales. The purchase price will increase on a tiered basis in the United States and the other territories (other than Europe, China and Japan) to as high as 36.5% and 35.75%, respectively, on the portion of Eisai&#8217;s annual aggregate net product sales exceeding $750.0 million in all territories other than Europe, China and Japan. The purchase price will increase to 35% in Europe, China and Japan on the portion of Eisai&#8217;s annual aggregate net product sales exceeding $500.0 million in such territories. The purchase price is subject to reduction (for sales in a particular country), including in the event of generic competition in the applicable country. 

In addition to payments for purchases of lorcaserin, we are eligible to receive up to an aggregate of $1.56 billion in one-time purchase price adjustment payments and other payments. These payments include up to an aggregate of $1.19 billion that are based on Eisai&#8217;s annual net product sales of lorcaserin in all of the territories under the Eisai Agreement on an aggregate basis, with the first and last amounts payable with annual net product sales of $250.0 million and $2.5 billion, respectively. Of these payments, Eisai will pay us a total of $330.0 million for annual net product sales of up to $1.0 billion. The $1.56 billion also includes $370.0 million in one-time purchase price adjustment payments we are eligible to receive based on annual net product sales in the non-US territories, comprised of $185.0 million based on Eisai&#8217;s annual net product sales in the non-US territories in North and South America and $185.0 million based on Eisai&#8217;s annual net product sales in the territories outside of North and South America. The first and last amounts are payable upon first achievement of annual net product sales of $100.0 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, with respect to each of the following areas: (i) the non-US territories in North and South America and (ii) the territories outside of North and South America. In addition, we are also eligible to receive certain payments from Eisai if certain annual minimum sales requirements in Mexico, Canada and Brazil are not met during the first ten years after initial commercial sale in such territories. 

Development payments 

The chart below summarizes the general agreement regarding cost sharing between Eisai and us for significant development activities under the Eisai Agreement. In addition, Eisai or we may from time to time conduct approved development of lorcaserin at such party&#8217;s own expense. As set forth below, we are obligated to pay 10% of the cost of the FDA-required portion of the CVOT. The FDA-required portion of the CVOT is expected to continue during the next couple of years, and the remaining amount of our share of the cost for this portion is estimated to be approximately $14.0 million. This cost will be incurred over the remaining time that the FDA-required portion of the CVOT is conducted, and the actual amount of the cost will depend on how long it takes to complete this portion of the CVOT and other factors. In addition, if the CVOT is continued to conduct the non-FDA required portion (evaluating MACE+ and conversion to type 2 diabetes), we expect our share of the cost of such portion will be up to $40.0 million, most of which cost is contingent on the success of the FDA-required portion and will occur in years after the FDA-required portion is completed. We are also obligated to share the cost of two remaining FDA-required studies in obese pediatric patients and for additional clinical studies in other territories.

lines and logos related to a lorcaserin product. Arena GmbH will indemnify Eisai for losses resulting from certain third-party claims, including for (i) Arena GmbH&#8217;s negligence, willful misconduct, failure to comply with law, breach of any agreement with a third party with respect to product development prior to the effective date of the original agreement with Eisai, but excluding product liability claims, (ii) Arena GmbH&#8217;s negligence or willful misconduct with respect to certain uses or misuses of a lorcaserin product outside of the agreement, (iii) certain uses or misuses of a lorcaserin product after the term of the agreement, in any territory no longer under the agreement or with respect to any product after the termination of the agreement with respect to such product, (iv) Arena GmbH&#8217;s negligence, willful misconduct or violation of law, but excluding product liability claims, (v) Arena GmbH&#8217;s breach of the Eisai Agreement or related agreements, but excluding product liability claims, (vi) certain infringement of intellectual rights of a third party, and (vii) infringement relating to Eisai&#8217;s use of certain trademarks related to a lorcaserin product. In addition, Arena GmbH and Eisai will, in general, share equally in losses resulting from third-party product liability claims, except where one party&#8217;s acts or omissions did not contribute to the events or circumstances leading to such product liability claim and the other party&#8217;s actual willful misconduct, violation of law or breach of its obligations under the Eisai Agreement or certain other agreements between Arena GmbH and Eisai were the sole and direct cause of the product liability claim. 

Eisai may terminate the Eisai Agreement with respect to any country in the territory following the later of the expiration of all issued lorcaserin patents in such country and 12 years after the first commercial sale of the first lorcaserin product in such country. Arena GmbH and Eisai each has the right to terminate the agreement early in certain circumstances in its entirety or with respect to the applicable country or product, including (a) if the other party is in material breach, (b) for commercialization concerns, and (c) for certain intellectual property infringement. Eisai also has the right to terminate the agreement early in its entirety or with respect to each country in certain circumstances, including (i) termination in a country if sales of generic equivalents of a lorcaserin product in such country exceed sales of the lorcaserin product in that country (based on volume), and (ii) if Eisai is acquired by a company that has a product that competes with a lorcaserin product. In addition, Arena GmbH can terminate the agreement early in its entirety or with respect to each country in the non-US territories in North and South America in certain circumstances, including termination in each country if Eisai does not satisfy certain regulatory filing and commercialization diligence requirements in such country. 

Other collaborations for BELVIQ 

In addition to the Eisai Agreement, Arena GmbH entered into the Marketing and Supply Agreement, or Ildong BELVIQ Agreement, with Ildong for South Korea in November 2012, into the Marketing and Supply Agreement, or CYB Agreement, with CYB for Taiwan in July 2013 and into the Marketing and Supply Agreement, or Teva Agreement, with Teva for Israel in July 2014. These agreements provide such collaborators with rights to lorcaserin for weight loss or weight management in obese and overweight patients, subject to applicable regulatory approval, as well as the possibility of us granting them rights to additional lorcaserin products or indications. 

Ildong collaboration for South Korea 

In connection with entering into the Ildong BELVIQ Agreement, we received from Ildong an upfront payment of $5.0 million, less withholding taxes. In addition to the upfront payment, we received a milestone payment of $3.0 million , less withholding taxes, in March 2015, which we earned upon the February 2015 approval of BELVIQ for marketing in South Korea for weight management. 

We manufacture BELVIQ at our facility in Switzerland, and sell BELVIQ to Ildong for Ildong&#8217;s commercialization in South Korea for a purchase price starting at the higher of the defined minimum amount or 35% of Ildong&#8217;s annual net product sales. The purchase price will increase on a tiered basis up to the higher of the defined minimum amount or 45% on the portion of annual net product sales exceeding $15.0 million. If certain annual net product sales amounts are not met, we can convert Ildong&#8217;s right to commercialize BELVIQ in South Korea to be non-exclusive.

Unless terminated earlier, the agreement with Teva will continue in effect until 15 years after the first commercial sale of lorcaserin in Israel. Either party has the right to terminate the agreement early in certain circumstances, including (a) if the other party is in material breach, (b) for certain development or commercialization disagreements or concerns, (c) if the other party is debarred or listed on the excluded list, (d) with respect to force majeure events, and (e) for certain intellectual property concerns. 

Additional Development of Lorcaserin 

BELVIQ XR 

As described above, the recommended daily dose of BELVIQ is 10 mg twice daily, and we are developing a once-daily formulation of lorcaserin for potential use for weight management, which is planned to be marketed under the brand name BELVIQ XR. We completed an initial study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic properties of different formulations of lorcaserin 20 mg once-daily tablets, and selected a once-daily formulation for further development. We then completed two additional Phase 1 clinical trials to determine the pharmacokinetic properties and bioequivalence of the selected once-daily formulation, which we believe demonstrate bioequivalence between the approved twice-daily and the BELVIQ XR 

formulations and an absence of food effect on the latter formulation at steady state. A New Drug Application, or NDA, for BELVIQ XR has been accepted and is under review by the FDA. 

Cardiovascular Outcomes/Type 2 Diabetes Conversion 

As described above, as part of the non-FDA required portion of the trial, CAMELLIA will also evaluate whether BELVIQ reduces the incidence of conversion to type 2 diabetes in patients without type 2 diabetes at baseline and the incidence of MACE+, both as compared to placebo. 

Other Development 

We may investigate lorcaserin for other indications in the future, but we have no current plans to do so. Under our collaboration with Eisai, we previously studied lorcaserin for smoking cessation and in combination with phentermine. 

Lorcaserin intellectual property 

As of February 16, 2016, we owned issued patents that cover compositions of matter for the lorcaserin new chemical entity, or NCE, and related compounds, and methods of treatment utilizing lorcaserin and related compounds in 69 jurisdictions, including the United States, Japan, China, Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, Canada, Russia, India, Australia and South Korea, and had applications pending in two other jurisdictions, of which the one with the largest pharmaceutical market was Brazil. Based on sales statistics provided by IMS Health, the jurisdictions where lorcaserin patents have been issued accounted for more than 92% of global pharmaceutical sales in 2013, while other jurisdictions where lorcaserin patents remain pending accounted for more than 3% of global pharmaceutical sales in that same year. The patents on lorcaserin issued by the US Patent and Trademark Office have serial numbers US 6,953,787; US 7,514,422; US 7,977,329; US 8,207,158; US 8,273,734; US 8,575,149; US 8,546,379; US 8,846,906 and US 8,993,750, while the corresponding patent granted by the European Patent Office has serial number EP 1 411 881 B1. Other of our lorcaserin issued patents and patent applications, including those directed to the HCl salt of lorcaserin (e.g., US 8,367,657 and US 8,946,207), the hemihydrate of the HCl salt of lorcaserin as well as its crystalline forms (e.g., US 8,168,624; US 8,697,686; US 8,980,881 and EP 1 838 677 B1) and modified-release dosage forms, are all present in a lesser number of commercially important jurisdictions. The earliest priority date for the patents on lorcaserin is 2002. The terms of the NCE patents are capable of continuing into 2023 in most jurisdictions without taking into account any patent term adjustment or extension regimes of any country or any additional term of exclusivity we might obtain by virtue of the later filed patent applications. With respect to the United States, we have filed applications for patent extension, which, if granted, will extend the patent term for one of our lorcaserin composition of matter patents into 2026 and potentially into 2027. 

In April 2015, the US Patent and Trademark Office granted US Patent No. 8,999,970, which describes a method for selecting appropriate patients for lorcaserin based on renal function. We expect this patent to extend exclusivity until 2033. In October 2015, the US Patent and Trademark Office granted US Patent No. 9,169,213, based on the discovery that achieving 5% weight loss with lorcaserin by Week 12 is a strong predictor of responses in weight loss at Week 52 of treatment. We expect that this patent may provide additional support for exclusivity in the US until 2032. 

As of February 16, 2016, we owned registered trademarks for the name BELVIQ in Class 5 for the sale and marketing of pharmaceutical preparations to treat or prevent obesity, for weight management, for weight loss and for the maintenance of weight loss in 143 jurisdictions, including the United States, Japan, China, Germany, France, Brazil, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, Russia, India, Australia and South Korea, and had trademark applications pending in nine other jurisdictions, of which the one with the largest pharmaceutical market was Canada. The trademark on the name BELVIQ registered by the US Patent and Trademark Office has registration number US 4,080,253, while the corresponding trademark registered by the European Union&#8217;s Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market has registration number CTM 010224905. Other of our BELVIQ registered trademarks and trademark applications, including those in classes 9, 16, 41 and 44 for downloadable publications, publications, educational services and medical services, respectively, directed to weight management, weight loss and the maintenance of weight loss are all present in a lesser number of commercially important jurisdictions.

As of February 16, 2016, we also owned registered trademarks for the name BELVIQ XR in Class 5 for the sale and marketing of pharmaceutical preparations to treat or prevent obesity, for weight management, for weight loss and for the maintenance of weight loss in two jurisdictions, including the United States, and had trademark applications pending in three other jurisdictions, of which the one with the largest pharmaceutical market was Japan. 

APD334 Program 

APD334, an orally available modulator of the S1P 1 &#32;receptor, is our internally discovered investigational drug candidate intended for the potential treatment of a number of autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel diseases and rheumatoid arthritis. S1P 1 &#32;receptors have been demonstrated to be involved in the modulation of several biological responses, including lymphocyte trafficking from lymph nodes to the peripheral blood. By isolating lymphocytes in lymph nodes, fewer immune cells are available in the circulating blood to effect tissue damage. Drugs in this class have been associated with certain side effects, including cardiovascular effects, respiratory effects, infection, macular edema and elevations in liver enzymes. We have optimized APD334 as a potent and selective small molecule S1P1 receptor modulator that reduces the severity of disease in preclinical autoimmune-disease models. 

As set forth below, we are currently developing APD334 for ulcerative colitis. Important goals of pharmacotherapy for ulcerative colitis are to induce and maintain remission while improving the patient&#8217;s quality of life. Currently available treatment options have limitations in terms of long-term efficacy and side effects, have complicated administration regimens, and often fail to induce or maintain remission. Therefore, a significant unmet need remains for differentiated agents that are efficacious for induction and maintenance therapy with a favorable side effect profile. We believe that the selectivity, mechanism of action, and current clinical profile of APD334 represents a significant opportunity to provide patients with an effective treatment for ulcerative colitis with an improved safety and dosing profile over current therapies. 

APD334 development 

In July 2015, we initiated patient dosing in a 12-week, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of APD334. The trial will seek to evaluate the effects of APD334 on clinical remission of ulcerative colitis, safety and tolerability in up to 240 patients. 

In January 2015, we announced top-line results from a Phase 1b multiple-ascending dose clinical trial for APD334. In the trial, APD334 demonstrated a dose-dependent effect on lymphocyte count lowering in blood, with mean decreases from baseline of up to 69%. Lymphocyte counts, on average, recovered to baseline within one week of conclusion of dosing. There was a modest impact on heart rate, but none of the changes were classified by the investigator as clinically significant. There were also no findings with respect to pulmonary function or liver enzyme tests that were classified by the investigator as clinically significant. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate contact dermatitis, headache, constipation and diarrhea, with none being clearly drug related. There were no discontinuations for adverse events, and no serious adverse events were observed. 

The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1b clinical trial evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of multiple-ascending doses of APD334. In five different dosing cohorts, 50 healthy volunteers received APD334 and 10 healthy volunteers received placebo for 21 days. 

Prior to commencing the Phase 1b multiple-ascending dose clinical trial for APD334, we completed a Phase 1a single-ascending dose clinical trial of the compound. This randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial evaluated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single-ascending doses of APD334 in 40 healthy adult volunteers. In the trial, APD334 demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects, a dose-responsive reduction in blood lymphocyte count and a slowing of heart rate that appears comparable to other S1P 1 &#32;modulators. The terminal half-life was approximately 35 hours. 

APD334 intellectual property 

As of February 16, 2016, we owned issued patents that cover compositions of matter for APD334 and related compounds, methods of treatment utilizing APD334 and related compounds, and various salts of APD334 and crystalline forms thereof in 19 jurisdictions, including the United States, Japan, China, Australia and Russia, and had applications pending in six other jurisdictions, of which the largest pharmaceutical markets were Europe, Brazil, Canada, India and South Korea. Based on sales statistics provided by IMS Health, the jurisdictions where APD334 patents have been issued accounted for more than 59% of global pharmaceutical sales in 2013, while other jurisdictions where APD334 patents remain pending accounted for more than 33% of global pharmaceutical sales in that same year. The patents on APD334 issued by the US Patent and Trademark Office have serial numbers US 8,580,841 (covering compositions of matter for APD334 and related compounds) and US 9,126,932 (covering methods of treatment utilizing APD334 and related compounds). Other of our APD334 pending patent applications, including those directed to dosage regimens for APD334 and synthetic routes and intermediates useful in the manufacturing of APD334, have all been filed in a lesser number of commercially important jurisdictions. The earliest priority date for the patents on APD334 is 2008. The terms of any patents that may issue from these patent applications should be capable of continuing into 2029 in most jurisdictions without taking into account any patent term adjustment or extension regimes of any country or any additional term of exclusivity we might obtain by virtue of the later filed patent applications. 

Ralinepag Program 

Ralinepag, an orally available agonist of the IP receptor, is our internally discovered investigational drug candidate intended for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. In September 2014, ralinepag was granted orphan drug status for the treatment of PAH by the FDA. 

PAH is a progressive, life-threatening disorder characterized by increased pressure in the arteries that carry blood from the heart to the lungs. The increased pressure strains the heart, which can limit physical activity, result in heart failure and reduce life expectancy. Based on data from the Registry to EValuate Early And Long-term PAH disease management (REVEAL) of patients in the United States, there is an estimated five-year survival rate of 57% from diagnosis. 

Treatment with IP agonists, which can slow disease progression and improve exercise tolerance in PAH patients, is considered standard of care for advanced PAH. All but one available IP agonist belong to the prostanoid class of molecules, and the majority of these products need to be administered frequently or continuously through intravenous, subcutaneous or inhaled delivery methods. An orally available, non-prostanoid IP agonist was recently approved in the United States and recommended for approval in the European Union. We believe that an orally available, non-prostanoid IP agonist that provides clinical benefits similar to currently available, parenterally delivered (meaning intravenous, subcutaneous or inhaled) IP agonists has the potential to improve the standard of care for PAH. Ralinepag&#8217;s oral bioavailability, strong receptor agonism, and approximately 20 to 26 hour half-life may provide advantages over other IP agonists, including improved receptor coverage given long half-life and the potential for once-daily oral dosing. 

Ralinepag development 

In January 2015, we initiated patient dosing in a 22-week, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of ralinepag. The trial will seek to evaluate the hemodynamic and exercise capacity effects, safety and tolerability of ralinepag in up to 60 patients with PAH. 

In 2013, we announced top-line results from a multiple-dose, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating multiple-ascending doses of ralinepag in healthy volunteers. In this trial, 40 healthy volunteers received ralinepag and 15 received placebo. The safety profile of ralinepag was characteristic of IP receptor agonists: the most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events were headache, nausea and jaw pain. One serious adverse event, transient atrial fibrillation, occurred in a single patient, and the study investigator considered it to be possibly treatment related. 

In 2011, we announced top-line results of a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single-ascending doses of ralinepag. The randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial evaluated 32 healthy volunteers in four cohorts of eight participants each, with six randomized to ralinepag and two to placebo. Ralinepag was rapidly absorbed and demonstrated dose-proportional pharmacokinetic exposure over the tested dose range. Consistent with the expected pharmacology of ralinepag, the most common adverse events were headache, vomiting, nausea, jaw pain and flushing. 

Ralinepag intellectual property 

As of February 16, 2016, we owned issued patents covering compositions of matter for ralinepag and related compounds and methods of treatment utilizing ralinepag and related compounds, synthetic routes, and various solid state forms of ralinepag, in 59 jurisdictions, including the United States, Japan, China, Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, Russia and Australia, and we had applications pending in five other jurisdictions, of which the ones with the largest pharmaceutical markets were Brazil, Canada, India and South Korea. Based on sales statistics provided by IMS Health, the jurisdictions where ralinepag patents have been issued accounted for more than 85% of global pharmaceutical sales in 2013, while other jurisdictions where ralinepag patents remain pending accounted for more than 8% of global pharmaceutical sales in that same year. The patent on ralinepag issued by the US Patent and Trademark Office has serial number US 8,895,776, while the corresponding patent granted by the European Patent Office has serial number EP 2 280 696 B2. Other of our ralinepag patent applications, including those directed to synthetic processes and dosage regimens of ralinepag, have been filed. The earliest priority date for the patents on ralinepag is 2008. The terms of these patents are capable of continuing into 2029 in most jurisdictions without taking into account any patent term adjustment or extension regimes of any country or any additional term of exclusivity we might obtain by virtue of the later filed patent applications. 

APD371 Program 

APD371, an orally available agonist of the CB 2 &#32;receptor, is an internally discovered investigational drug candidate we are exploring for the treatment of pain. Currently available CB-receptor agonists have been limited in utility by the psychotropic effects associated with the activation of the CB1, but not CB 2 , receptor subtype. APD371 is intended to retain the analgesic activity of the CB receptor agonists while avoiding the limiting psychotropic side effects. We believe selectively 

targeting the CB 2 &#32;receptor may provide therapeutic benefit without the potential for dependence or abuse associated with opiates and without the gastrointestinal, or GI, and cardiovascular, or CV, side effects associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, which are among the most common pain relievers. 

APD371 development 

In October 2015, we initiated a Phase 1 multiple-ascending dose trial of APD371. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1b clinical trial will enroll approximately 36 healthy adults to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of multiple-ascending doses of APD371. 

In April 2015, we announced top-line results from a Phase 1 single-ascending dose clinical trial of APD371. &#32; The randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial enrolled 56 healthy adults to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single-ascending doses of APD371. Dose-responsive exposure was observed over the explored dose range of 10-400 mg with good tolerability at all doses administered. 

APD371 intellectual property 

As of February 16, 2016, we owned issued patents covering compositions of matter for APD371 and related compounds in eight jurisdictions, including the United States, Japan, China, and Australia, and we had applications pending in 16 other jurisdictions, of which the ones with the largest pharmaceutical markets were Europe, Brazil, Canada, Russia, India and South Korea. Based on sales statistics provided by IMS Health, the jurisdictions where APD371 patents have been issued accounted for more than 58% of global pharmaceutical sales in 2013, while other jurisdictions where APD371 patents remain pending accounted for more than 38% of global pharmaceutical sales in that same year. The patent on APD371 issued by the US Patent and Trademark Office has serial number US 8,778,950. Other of our APD371 patent applications, including those directed to various solid state forms of APD371, have all been filed in a similar number of commercially important jurisdictions. The earliest priority date for the patents on APD371 is 2009. The terms of these patents are capable of continuing into 2030 in most jurisdictions without taking into account any patent term adjustment or extension regimes of any country or any additional term of exclusivity we might obtain by virtue of the later filed patent applications. 

Nelotanserin Program 

Nelotanserin, an orally available inverse agonist of the serotonin 2A receptor, is an internally discovered investigational drug candidate that we originally studied for sleep maintenance. Prior to entering into the collaboration with Axovant Sciences Ltd., or Axovant, we studied nelotanserin in multiple Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials involving over 900 subjects. Although the compound demonstrated significant pharmacology in objective sleep studies (increased deep sleep and decreased microawakenings in brain activity during sleep), this did not translate into a subjective improvement in sleep in patients with sleep maintenance insomnia. 

Further nelotanserin development 

Under our collaboration described below, Axovant recently announced that it has initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial for nelotanserin in patients with dementia with Lewy Bodies, which includes Lewy Body and Parkinson&#8217;s disease dementia, suffering from visual hallucinations. In addition, Axovant plans to initiate in the near term an additional Phase 2 clinical trial of nelotanserin in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies suffering from rapid eye movement, or REM, behavior disorder. In addition, Axovant may pursue the development of nelotanserin for other neuropsychiatric disorders. Axovant is responsible for funding the development and commercialization of nelotanserin. 

Nelotanserin collaboration 

In May 2015, we entered into a Development, Marketing and Supply Agreement with Roivant Sciences Ltd., or Roivant, for nelotanserin. Roivant subsequently assigned all of its rights to develop and commercialize nelotanserin to its subsidiary, Axovant. Under our collaboration, Axovant has exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize nelotanserin, and Arena will manufacture clinical supply and commercial product to sell to Axovant. We received a $4.0 million upfront payment and are eligible to receive $41.5 million in regulatory and development milestone payments. We are also eligible to receive 15% of net sales of nelotanserin in exchange for the manufacture and supply of finished commercial drug product, and up to a total of $60.0 million in one-time purchase price adjustment payments tied to certain commercial sales milestones. 

Axovant will indemnify us for losses resulting from certain third-party claims, including for (a) Axovant&#8217;s negligence, willful misconduct or violation of law, (b) Axovant&#8217;s breach of the development, marketing and supply agreement or related agreements, (c) any product liability claim, (d) certain uses or misuses of nelotanserin, (e) certain infringement of intellectual property rights, and (f) product manufactured according to the product warranty. Arena GmbH will indemnify Axovant for 

losses resulting from certain third-party claims, including for (i) Arena GmbH&#8217;s negligence, willful misconduct or violation of law, and (ii) Arena GmbH&#8217;s breach of the development, marketing and supply agreement or related agreements. 

Axovant has the right to terminate the agreement on a compound-by-compound basis or in its entirety upon 90 days&#8217; prior written notice to Arena GmbH. Arena GmbH has the right to terminate the agreement upon certain intellectual property concerns. Either party has the right to terminate the agreement early in certain circumstances, including if the other party is in material breach. 

Nelotanserin intellectual property 

As of February 16, 2016, we owned issued patents that cover compositions of matter for nelotanserin and related compounds and methods of treatment utilizing nelotanserin and related compounds in 76 jurisdictions, including the United States, Japan, China, Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, Canada, Russia, India, Australia and South Korea, and had applications pending in five other jurisdictions, of which the ones with the largest pharmaceutical markets was Brazil. Based on sales statistics provided by IMS Health, the jurisdictions where nelotanserin patents have been issued accounted for more than 92% of global pharmaceutical sales in 2006, while jurisdictions where nelotanserin patents remain pending accounted for more than 5% of global pharmaceutical sales in that same year. The patent on nelotanserin issued by the US Patent and Trademark Office has serial number US 8,754,238, while the corresponding patent granted by the European Patent Office is serial number EP 1 558 582 B1. The earliest priority date for the patents on nelotanserin is 2003. The terms of these patents are capable of continuing into 2024 in most jurisdictions without taking into account any patent term extension regimes of any country. 

Temanogrel Program 

Temanogrel, an orally available inverse agonist of the serotonin 2A receptor, is an internally discovered investigational drug candidate intended for the treatment of thrombotic diseases. We believe temanogrel has the potential to inhibit serotonin-mediated platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. We believe temanogrel&#8217;s dual mechanism may be therapeutically useful for the treatment or prevention of thrombotic diseases. 

Thrombosis is the formation of a clot, or thrombus, inside a blood vessel. Thrombus formation that occurs in the arteries leading to the heart or brain can lead to serious thrombotic diseases including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome and stroke. One of the initial events in thrombus formation is the activation of platelets, which then aggregate and adhere to one another as they release certain factors, including high concentrations of serotonin. Serotonin promotes further platelet aggregation and also causes constriction, or narrowing, of blood vessels. Elevated serotonin levels have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk. The prothrombotic effects of serotonin on platelets and blood vessels are mediated by the serotonin 2A receptor, and inverse agonists of the serotonin 2A receptor have the potential to inhibit this activity. 

Temanogrel development. 

Under our collaboration described below, Ildong will be responsible for funding and conducting, under the direction of a joint steering committee, the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers to investigate the safety of co-administration with clopidogrel and aspirin and a planned Phase 2a proof-of-concept trial in patients. 

In 2008, we announced top-line results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascending dose trial in 50 healthy male and female volunteers. This trial evaluated safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of multiple-ascending doses of temanogrel over a period of one week. Total daily doses ranged from 15 mg to 80 mg. The most frequently reported adverse event was headache, which was more common in the placebo group than in any temanogrel dose group. None of the adverse events occurred in a dose-related fashion with the exception of epistaxis (nose bleed), which occurred in two of the volunteers who received the 80 mg dose, a dose above the anticipated therapeutic range. Dose-dependent inhibition of serotonin-mediated amplification of platelet aggregation was demonstrated in this trial starting at the 15 mg dose and may permit the identification of exposure ranges that produce minimal, moderate and near-complete inhibition of serotonin-amplified platelet aggregation. 

Earlier in 2008, we announced top-line results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-ascending dose Phase 1a clinical trial evaluating temanogrel in 90 healthy male and female volunteers. Doses originally intended for study ranged from 1 mg to 160 mg, but due to favorable tolerability the maximum dose was increased to 320 mg. In this trial, a maximum tolerated dose could not be defined despite achieving high concentrations in blood. Dose-dependent inhibition of serotonin-mediated amplification of platelet aggregation was demonstrated in this trial. 

Temanogrel collaboration. 

In November 2012, we entered into a Co-Development and License Agreement with Ildong for temanogrel. Under the agreement, we granted Ildong exclusive rights to commercialize temanogrel in South Korea for myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, peripheral artery disease and other cardiovascular diseases, subject to further development and regulatory approval of temanogrel. We will maintain ownership of temanogrel outside of South Korea, and have the rights to use data generated by Ildong for the development and potential commercialization of temanogrel outside of South Korea by us or other Arena licensees. In addition, Ildong has agreed to pay us a $2.0 million development milestone if the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial and the planned Phase 2a clinical trial conducted by Ildong support continued development and we or another Arena licensee initiates a Phase 2b clinical trial of temanogrel. We are also eligible to receive a royalty on net product sales of temanogrel in South Korea, while Ildong is eligible to receive a share of future payments received by us related to licensing transactions and sales of temanogrel in other territories. 

Ildong will indemnify us for losses resulting from certain third-party claims, including for (a) Ildong&#8217;s negligence, willful misconduct or violation of law, (b) Ildong&#8217;s breach of the agreement, (c) certain uses or misuses of temanogrel (including any product liability claim and other claims relating to sales or development of temanogrel in South Korea), and (d) certain governmental investigations of Ildong related to temanogrel. We will indemnify Ildong for losses resulting from certain third-party claims, including for (i) our negligence, willful misconduct or violation of law, and (ii) our breach of the agreement. 

Unless terminated earlier or extended, the agreement will continue in effect until the later of the expiration of all issued patents relating to temanogrel in South Korea and 10 years after the first commercial sale of temanogrel in South Korea. Either party has the right to terminate the agreement early in certain circumstances, including (a) if the other party is in material breach, (b) for certain commercialization concerns, and (c) for certain intellectual property concerns. 

Temanogrel intellectual property. 

As of February 16, 2016, we owned issued patents that cover compositions of matter for temanogrel and related compounds and methods of treatment utilizing temanogrel and related compounds in 87 jurisdictions, including the United States, Japan, China, Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, Canada, Russia, India, Australia and South Korea, and had applications pending in 12 other jurisdictions, of which the largest pharmaceutical market was Brazil. Based on sales statistics provided by IMS Health, the jurisdictions where temanogrel patents have been issued accounted for more than 93% of global pharmaceutical sales in 2013, while other jurisdictions where temanogrel patents remain pending accounted for more than 6% of global pharmaceutical sales in that same year. The patent on temanogrel issued by the US Patent and Trademark Office has serial number US 7,884,101, while the corresponding patent granted by the European Patent Office has serial number EP 1 833 799 B1. Other of our temanogrel issued patents and patent applications, including those directed to the temanogrel HCl salt as well as its crystalline forms, synthetic routes and intermediates useful in the manufacturing of temanogrel, and the active metabolites of temanogrel have all been filed in a lesser number of commercially important jurisdictions. The earliest priority date for the patents on temanogrel is 2004. The terms of these patents are capable of continuing into 2025 in most jurisdictions without taking into account any patent term adjustment or extension regimes of any country or any additional term of exclusivity we might obtain by virtue of the later filed patent applications. 

Orphan GPCR Program 

In December 2015, we entered into an exclusive agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, or Boehringer Ingelheim, to conduct joint research to identify drug candidates targeting a GPCR that belongs to the group of orphan CNS receptors. An &#8220;orphan receptor&#8221; is structurally related to a family of proteins that are known to act as functional cell-surface receptors but whose ligand has not yet been identified. 

We will provide Boehringer Ingelheim exclusive rights to our internally discovered, novel compounds and intellectual property for the orphan CNS receptor. The companies will jointly conduct research to identify additional drug candidates that are suitable for continued research and development as therapeutic compounds for various disease indications, with the initial focus expected to be psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia. The agreement grants Boehringer Ingelheim exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize products resulting from the collaboration. 

Under the terms of the agreement, in addition to the $7.5 million upfront payment, we are eligible to receive certain payments up to an aggregate of $254 million in research funding and success milestones in case of full commercial success of multiple drug products. In addition, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties on future sales of products that arise from the collaboration. 

Boehringer Ingelheim will indemnify us for losses resulting from certain third-party claims, including for (a) Boehringer Ingelheim&#8217;s default under the collaboration and license agreement, (b) Boehringer Ingelheim&#8217;s gross negligence or willful misconduct, (c) Boehringer Ingelheim&#8217;s conduct of the research program, or (d) the development, manufacture or 

commercialization of any compound or product under the agreement. We will indemnify Boehringer Ingelheim for losses resulting from certain third-party claims, including for (i) our default under the agreement, (ii) our gross negligence or willful misconduct, or (iii) our conduct of the research program or use of any compound under the agreement. 

Unless terminated earlier, the collaboration and license agreement will continue in effect until the later of the expiration of certain issued patents relating to a compound under the agreement and 10 years after the first commercial sale in all applicable countries. Either party has the right to terminate the agreement early in certain circumstances, including if the other party defaults under the collaboration and license agreement. In the case of our default, Boehringer Ingelheim has the option to terminate just a portion of agreement instead of the entire agreement. Boehringer Ingelheim has the right to terminate the agreement with 90 day&#8217;s notice during the research term or with 30 days&#8217; notice thereafter. Boehringer Ingelheim also has the right after the research term to terminate development or commercialization with respect to any product under the agreement. We can terminate the agreement for certain development by Boehringer Ingelheim outside of the agreement. 

Research Programs 

We are continuing our efforts to discover and develop additional novel compounds that target GPCRs to address unmet medical needs, including programs that are in the early research stage. The extent to which we devote efforts to these programs will depend on our available resources. 

Our GPCR Focus, Technologies and Programs 

Our drug candidates have resulted from our GPCR-focused drug discovery and development approach, specialized expertise and technologies. GPCRs are categorized as &#8220;known&#8221; when their naturally occurring, or native, ligands have been identified. Scientists have used molecular cloning in combination with the sequencing of the human genome to identify both additional receptor subtypes of known GPCRs as well as hundreds of novel GPCRs. GPCRs are categorized as &#8220;orphan&#8221; GPCRs when their native ligands have not been identified. We believe both orphan and known GPCRs offer significant promise for the development of novel GPCR-based therapeutics. 

Our drug discovery approach, specialized expertise and technologies allow us to identify drug leads that act as receptor activators, or agonists, which increase the detected biological response, or act as receptor inhibitors, which decrease the detected response. We can also identify inverse agonists, which inhibit ligand-independent, as well as ligand-dependent, receptor activity. 

We believe that our drug discovery approach, specialized expertise and technologies offer several advantages for drug discovery, including: (a) eliminating the need to identify the native ligand for an orphan receptor; (b) enhancing the detection of, and allowing us to simultaneously identify, both receptor inhibitor and receptor activator drug leads; (c) allowing for the identification of drug leads that inhibit both ligand-independent and ligand-dependent activity; and (d) providing the ability to discover novel and improved therapeutics directed at known receptors. 

Intellectual Property 

Our success depends in large part on our ability to protect our proprietary technologies, compounds and information, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality, licensing and other agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We seek patent protection for our key inventions, including drug candidates we identify, routes for chemical synthesis, pharmaceutical formulations and drug screening technologies. 

There is no assurance that any of our patent applications will issue, or that any of the patents will be enforceable or will cover a drug or other commercially significant product or method. In addition, we regularly review our patent portfolio to identify patents and patent applications for potential abandonment that we deem to have relatively low value to our ongoing business operations. There is also no assurance that we will correctly identify which of our patents and patent applications should be maintained and which should be abandoned. The term of most of our other current patents commenced, and most of our future patents, if any, will commence, on the date of issuance and terminate 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of the patent application. Because any marketing and regulatory approval for a drug often occurs several years after the related patent application is filed, the resulting market exclusivity afforded by any patent on our drug candidates and technologies will likely be substantially less than 20 years. 

In the United States, patent term adjustment is available for certain delays in patent office proceedings. In addition, under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for patent term extension, or PTE. PTE permits patent term restoration of a US patent as compensation for the patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a PTE of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. This period is generally one-half the 

time between the effective date of an Investigational New Drug, or IND (falling after issuance of the patent), and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, provided the sponsor acted with diligence. The Improving Regulatory Transparency for New Medical Therapies Act was signed into law in 2015 to prevent the loss of PTE (and market exclusivity) for drugs for which the FDA recommends scheduling under the Controlled Substances Act. A PTE cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. The application for PTE is subject to approval by the PTO in conjunction with the FDA. 

Outside of the United States, similar provisions may be available in the European Union, Japan, South Korea and some other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. The length of any such extension would vary by country. Our European patents may be eligible for supplemental protection certificates of up to five years in one or more countries. 

Due to the specific requirements for obtaining these extensions, there is no assurance that our patents will be afforded extensions even if we encounter significant delays in patent office proceedings or marketing and regulatory approval. 

In addition to patent protection, we rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological advances to develop and maintain our competitive position. To maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets and proprietary information, all of our employees are required to enter into and adhere to an employee confidentiality and invention assignment agreement, laboratory notebook policy, and invention disclosure procedures as a condition of employment. Additionally, our employee confidentiality and invention assignment agreements require that our employees not bring to us, or use without proper authorization, any third-party proprietary technology. We also generally require our consultants and collaborators that have access to proprietary property and information to execute confidentiality and invention rights agreements in our favor before beginning their relationship with us. While such arrangements are intended to enable us to better control the use and disclosure of our proprietary property and provide for our ownership of proprietary technology developed on our behalf, they may not provide us with meaningful protection for such property and technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure. 

Competition 

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and are subject to rapid and significant change. We face significant competition from organizations with drugs or drug candidates that do or may compete with BELVIQ or drug candidates we are developing. We may not be able to compete successfully against these organizations, which include many large, well-financed and experienced pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies. 

The focus of our scientific and business strategy is on GPCRs. We believe that many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other organizations also have internal drug discovery and development programs focused on GPCRs. In addition, other companies have attempted to overcome the problems associated with traditional drug screening by embarking on a variety of alternative strategies. Developments by others may render our drug candidates or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. 

Our present competitors with respect to BELVIQ include: Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., the US prescription drug unit of the Roche Group, which markets with Genentech USA, Inc., orlistat under the brand name Xenical; GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare which markets an over-the-counter low-dose version of orlistat in the United States under the brand name alli; VIVUS Inc., which markets a combination of phentermine and topiramate under the brand name Qsymia; Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc., which markets a combination of naltrexone and bupropion under the brand name Contrave; and Novo Nordisk, which markets a formulation of its diabetes drug, liraglutide, under the brand name Saxenda. Another competitor is phentermine, which is a generic drug sold by a number of companies. Prescribers may also prescribe other drugs, including in combination or off label, that would compete with BELVIQ. We also face competition from other approaches for weight loss, including behavior modification (such as diet and exercise), surgical approaches (such as gastric bypass surgery and gastric banding), and herbal or other supplements. In addition, with respect to South Korea, Orexigen announced in October 2015 that it has filed a new drug application with the MFDS for the regulatory approval of Contrave for weight management in overweight or obese adult patients. 

There are also potentially competing drug candidates and other approaches for weight loss being developed by various pharmaceutical and medical device companies and other entities. Some programs in discovery, preclinical or other stages of development may include serotonin 2C programs. 

Many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater drug development capabilities and financial, scientific and marketing resources than we do. Additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated with our competitors. As a result, our competitors may be able to devote greater resources than we can to the research, development, marketing and promotion of therapeutic products or drug discovery techniques, or to adapt 

more readily to technological advances than we can. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, receiving regulatory approval or commercializing drugs before we do. 

We expect to encounter significant competition in the therapeutic areas targeted by our principal drug candidates. Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals and commence commercial sales of their drug candidates before us may achieve a significant competitive advantage. Furthermore, we may be competing against companies with substantially greater manufacturing, marketing, distribution and selling capabilities, and any drug candidate that we successfully develop may compete with existing therapies that have long histories of safe and effective use. 

We may rely on collaborators for support of development programs and for the manufacturing and marketing of drug candidates. Such collaborators may be conducting multiple drug development efforts within the same disease areas that are the subject of their agreements with us, which may negatively impact the development of drugs that are subject to our agreements. In addition, we face and will continue to face intense competition from other companies for such collaborative arrangements, and technological and other developments by others may make it more difficult for us to establish such relationships. 

Government Regulation 

We and our collaborators are subject to significant governmental regulation. The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the preclinical and clinical development, pre-market approval, manufacture, import, export, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other regulatory agencies regulate research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, tracking, recordkeeping, advertising, pricing and promotion of drug candidates and commercialized drugs. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other regulatory requirements may result in inspectional notices of violation, warning letters, civil or criminal penalties, suspension or delays in clinical development, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production, withdrawal of a product from the market or other negative consequences. 

In the United States. &#32;In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&#38;C Act, and its implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before drug candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, many of which are required to be performed in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations; 

&#8226; 

submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and be updated annually; 

&#8226; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each proposed indication; 

&#8226; 

submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials, generally accompanied by payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA; 

&#8226; 

a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of the NDA to file the NDA for review; 

&#8226; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations; and 

&#8226; 

FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States. 

&#8226; 

Prior to commercialization, centrally acting drugs may be subject to review and potential scheduling by the DEA. 

The development and approval process requires substantial expertise, time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our drug candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 

The results of preclinical tests (which include laboratory evaluation as well as GLP studies to evaluate toxicity in animals) for a particular drug candidate, together with related manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA. During the 30-day time period the FDA may require additional information. The FDA may institute a clinical hold at the 30-day time period if any questions are not fully addressed or because of other concerns about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may place an IND on partial or full clinical hold at any time during a product candidate&#8217;s development. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive 

clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, regulations and regulations for informed consent and privacy of individually identifiable information. 

Clinical trials. &#32;For purposes of NDA submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Phase 1 clinical trials. Studies are initially conducted in a limited population to test the drug candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion, typically in healthy volunteers, but in some cases in patients. 

&#8226; 

Phase 2 clinical trials. Studies are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, explore the initial efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose range or pharmacodynamics. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 

&#8226; 

Phase 3 clinical trials. These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies or adequate and well-controlled studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial centers. 

&#8226; 

Phase 4 clinical trials. The FDA may approve an NDA for a drug candidate, but require that the sponsor conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug after NDA approval under a post-approval commitment. In addition, a sponsor may decide to conduct additional clinical trials after the FDA has approved an NDA. Post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. 

New drug applications. &#32;The results of drug development, preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. NDAs also must contain extensive chemistry, manufacturing and control, or CMC, information. An NDA is usually accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing, which occurs, if at all, 60 days after submission by the NDA sponsor. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA&#8217;s goal is to review applications within 10 months from its acceptance of the filing or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months from its acceptance of the filing. The review process can be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA by issuing a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. A CRL may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Data are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or our collaborators interpret data. Approval may occur with Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, that may limit the labeling, distribution or promotion of a drug product. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the safety effects of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these postmarketing programs or other information. 

Other US regulatory requirements. &#32;Products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping, annual product quality review and reporting requirements. Adverse event experience with the product must be reported to the FDA in a timely fashion and pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events are mandated by the FDA. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic inspections (which may be unannounced) by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on Form FDA 483 and warning letters that could cause us to modify certain activities. A Form FDA 483 notice, if issued at the conclusion of an FDA inspection or after the appropriate FDA office review of the Establishment Inspection Report prepared by the investigator, can list conditions the FDA believes may have violated cGMP or other FDA regulations. FDA guidelines specify that a warning letter be issued for violations of &#8220;regulatory 

significance,&#8221; also known as Official Action Indicated, or OAI. Failure to adequately and promptly correct the observation(s) can result in regulatory action. In addition to Form FDA 483 notices and warning letters, failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, recall of product, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil or criminal penalties. 

The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for healthcare professional marketing activities and materials, direct-to-consumer advertising, dissemination of off-label information, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Drugs may be marketed only for their approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the confines of the pivotal studies and the approved label. Further, we may be required to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials, and we may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental NDA for changes to, among other things, the indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities of a drug. Failure to comply with these requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, corrective advertising, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or potential civil and criminal penalties. 

Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the product&#8217;s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA, if in their professional medical judgment the physicians deem such use to be appropriate. Such off-label uses are common across certain medical specialties. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers&#8217; communications regarding off-label use. 

To distribute products commercially, we or our collaborators, as applicable, must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution. 

Drug Enforcement Administration regulation. &#32;The DEA regulates drugs that are controlled substances. Controlled substances are those drugs that appear on one of the five schedules promulgated and administered by the DEA under the Controlled Substances Act, or CSA. The CSA governs, among other things, the inventory, distribution, recordkeeping, handling, security and disposal of controlled substances. Any drug that acts on the central nervous system has the potential to become a controlled substance based on an evaluation of its abuse potential, and scheduling by the DEA is a separate process that may delay the commercial launch of a drug even after FDA approval of the NDA. Companies with a scheduled drug are subject to periodic and ongoing inspections by the DEA and similar state drug enforcement authorities to assess ongoing compliance with the DEA&#8217;s regulations. Any failure to comply with these regulations could lead to a variety of sanctions, including the revocation or a denial of renewal of any DEA registration, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties. 

Outside of the United States. &#32;Outside of the United States, the ability to market a product is contingent upon obtaining marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing and sale of the product in those countries. Approval in the United States does not guarantee approval in other countries and vice-versa. 

Hatch-Waxman Exclusivity. &#32;Market exclusivity provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act can delay the submission or approval of applications seeking to rely upon the FDA&#8217;s findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved NDA. An NCE subject to an NDA is entitled to a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States. A drug is an NCE if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, such an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement of patents listed with the FDA by the NDA holder. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active ingredient. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 

Orphan drug designation and exclusivity. &#32;Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an &#8220;orphan drug&#8221; if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting an NDA. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 

If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication or the same product for the same indication if demonstrated to be clinically superior. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. 

Drug product manufacturing. &#32;Our Swiss subsidiary, Arena GmbH operates a drug product manufacturing facility in Zofingen, Switzerland. Swissmedic, a public service organization of the Swiss federal government, is the central Swiss agency for the authorization and supervision of therapeutic products. Our Swiss manufacturing facility has been inspected by the competent regional authorities (Regionales Heilmittelinspektorat der Nordostschweiz, Basel, Switzerland), acting on behalf of Swissmedic, which issued GMP and production licenses to Arena GmbH for the production of drugs. The FDA conducted a pre-approval inspection of this facility in July 2010 and a subsequent inspection in 2014, which resulted in No Actions Indicated, and classified this facility as acceptable. The FDA generally performs routine inspections about every two years, but the FDA may inspect a facility at any time. 

Prescription drug reimbursement. &#32;In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of prescription drug products depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government health administrative authorities, managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the drug product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. A payer&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Patients are less likely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Therefore, coverage and adequate reimbursement are important to new product acceptance. 

If a drug is reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid, pricing and rebate programs must comply with, as applicable, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 as well as the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, or VHCA, each as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Under the VHCA, drug companies are required to offer certain drugs at a reduced price to a number of federal agencies including US Department of Veterans Affairs and US Department of Defense, the Public Health Service and certain private Public Health Service designated entities in order to participate in other federal funding programs including Medicare and Medicaid. Participation under the VHCA requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations. 

The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. In particular, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, was enacted in the United States in March 2010 and contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain 

Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies&#8217; share of sales to federal healthcare programs. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for our products, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. In the case of BELVIQ, Medicare explicitly excludes coverage of drugs for weight loss. 

In countries outside the United States, pricing of pharmaceutical products may be subject to governmental control. Evaluation criteria used by many government agencies for the purposes of pricing and reimbursement typically focus on a product&#8217;s degree of innovation and its ability to meet a clinical need unfulfilled by currently available therapies. Some countries operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. 

Healthcare fraud and abuse. &#32;Pharmaceutical companies are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including, but not limited to, anti-kickback and false claims laws. We have a commercial compliance program and have adopted the voluntary Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals, or PhRMA Code, promulgated by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and revised in 2009. The PhRMA Code provides guidelines for interactions with respect to marketed products and related pre- and post-launch activities and reinforces the intention that industry interactions with healthcare professionals are professional exchanges designed to benefit patients and to enhance the practice of medicine. 

The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer, or a party acting on its behalf, to knowingly and willfully solicit, offer, receive or provide any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, service or item, including the prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Some of the state prohibitions are broader in scope and apply to referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 

In the course of practicing medicine, physicians may legally prescribe FDA-approved drugs for an indication that has not been approved by the FDA and which, therefore, is not described in the product&#8217;s approved labeling, so-called &#8220;off-label use&#8221; or &#8220;the practice of medicine,&#8221; if deemed appropriate in the physicians&#8217; professional medical judgment. The FDA does not ordinarily regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA and other government agencies do, however, restrict communications on the subject of off-label use by a manufacturer or those acting on behalf of a manufacturer. Companies may not promote FDA-approved drugs for off-label uses. The FDA and other governmental agencies do permit a manufacturer (and those acting on its behalf) to engage in some limited, non-misleading, non-promotional exchanges of scientific information regarding unapproved indications. 

There are numerous federal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws that forbid, among other things, anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. 

Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal, civil and/or administrative sanctions, including individual imprisonment, disgorgement, criminal fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). In addition, under certain healthcare fraud and abuse laws, there is an ability for private individuals to bring similar actions. Additionally, many states have analogous fraud and abuse laws, some of which may be broader in scope. Further, there are an increasing number of state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, or register their sales representatives, as well as prohibiting certain other sales and marketing practices. The federal transparency requirements under the ACA require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to annually report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests. Additionally, recent federal legislation imposes additional obligations on certain pharmaceutical manufacturers, among others, regarding drug product tracking and tracing. 

Our activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. We are also subject to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which prohibits companies and individuals from engaging 

in specified activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. Under the FCPA, it is illegal to pay, offer to pay, or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, governmental staff members, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. 

Healthcare privacy and security laws. &#32;The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. In addition, many state laws apply to the use and disclosure of health information. We may be subject to, or our collaborators&#8217; marketing activities may be limited by, HIPAA and its implementing regulations. 

Manufacturing and Sources and Availability of Raw Materials, Intermediates and Clinical Supplies 

In January 2008, we acquired from Siegfried AG (formerly Siegfried Ltd, and referred to collectively in this document as Siegfried) certain drug product facility assets, including manufacturing facility production licenses, fixtures, equipment, other personal property and real estate assets in Zofingen, Switzerland. We are using this facility to manufacture and package BELVIQ as well as for toll manufacturing of certain drug products for Siegfried. From time to time, we may also use this facility to manufacture and package tablets and capsules for other of our programs or for other entities. 

Most of our toll manufacturing revenues are attributable to a single customer, Siegfried. Our revenues of $38.3 million &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2015 , included $3.5 million , or 9.0% &#32;of our total revenues, from Siegfried. Our revenues of $37.0 million &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2014 , included $1.5 million , or 4.0% of our total revenues, from Siegfried. Our revenues of $81.4 million &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2013 , included $2.7 million , or 3.3% of our total revenues, from Siegfried. 

We purchase raw materials, starting materials, intermediates, API, excipients and other materials from commercial sources. To decrease the risk of an interruption to our supply, when we believe it is reasonable for us to do so, we source these materials from multiple suppliers so that, in general, the loss of any one source of supply would not have a material adverse effect on commercial production, project timelines or inventory of supplies for our studies or clinical trials. However, currently we have only one or a limited number of suppliers for some of these materials for BELVIQ and for other of our programs. The loss of a primary source of supply would potentially delay our production of BELVIQ or our development projects and potentially those of current or future collaborators. We intend to maintain a safety stock of certain of these materials to help avoid delays in production, but we do not know whether such stock will be sufficient. Our facility in Zofingen is the only manufacturer of finished drug product for BELVIQ. We maintain a safety stock of BELVIQ to help mitigate risks related to having only one manufacturer of finished drug product. We may in the future have another source of supply for finished drug product of BELVIQ, but we believe that it would take longer than one year to secure another source. 

Eisai was our only customer for commercial sales of BELVIQ until Ildong received marketing approval of BELVIQ in February 2015. Eisai and Ildong purchase BELVIQ from Arena GmbH, and are the exclusive distributors of BELVIQ in the United States and South Korea, respectively. 

Our revenues of $38.3 million &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2015, included $23.7 million , or 61.9% &#32;of our total revenues, from Eisai, and $8.9 million , or 23.2% &#32;of our total revenues from Ildong. Our revenues of $37.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, included $34.6 million, or 93.6% of our total revenues, from Eisai. Our revenues of $81.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, included $78.1 million, or 96.0% of our total revenues, from Eisai. 

Compliance with Environmental Regulations 

Our research and development programs involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biological materials and various radioactive compounds.

With regard to Arena GmbH&#8217;s drug product manufacturing facility, Arena GmbH has contracted with Siegfried to provide certain safety, health and environmental services. Arena GmbH is subject to regulation under the Environmental Protection Act (Umweltschutzgesetz, USG), the Chemicals Act (Chemikaliengesetz, ChemG), and the Federal Act on the Protection of Waters (Gew&#228;sserschutzgesetz, GSchG), which refer to several ordinances such as the Ordinance on Air Pollution Control (Luftreinhalte-Verordnung, LRV), the Ordinance on Incentive Taxes on Volatile Organic Compounds (Verordnung &#252;ber die Lenkungsabgabe auf fl&#252;chtigen organischen Verbindungen, VOCV), the Water Protection Ordinance (Gew&#228;sserschutzverordnung, GSchV), the Ordinance of the Handling of Wastes (Verordnung &#252;ber den Verkehr mit Abf&#228;llen, 

VeVA), the Chemicals Ordinance (Chemikalienverordnung, ChemV), the Chemical Risk Reduction Ordinance (Chemikalien-Risikoreduktions-Verordnung, ChemRRV) and the Ordinance on Protection against Major Accidents (St&#246;rfallverordnung, StFV). The competent authorities in Switzerland for the implementation of environmental regulations are BAFU (Bundesamt f&#252;r Umwelt / Federal Office for the Environment), which is the Swiss federal agency for the environment, and the respective authorities of the Canton of Aargau (Abteilung f&#252;r Umwelt, AfU). Furthermore, the BAFU and the BAG (Bundesamt f&#252;r Gesundheit / Federal Office of Public Health) share authorities with regard to the implementation and, together with the respective authority of the Canton of Aargau (Amt f&#252;r Verbraucherschutz), the supervision of compliance with the laws and regulations related to chemicals. Occupational health and safety is regulated, in particular, by the EKAS (Eidgen&#246;ssische Koordinationskommission f&#252;r Arbeitssicherheit) guideline No. 6508 (ASA), governing the evaluation of worker safety and the reporting to the relevant authorities. The competent authority for the implementation of occupational health and safety regulations is the Canton of Aargau (Amt f&#252;r Wirtschaft und Arbeit), whereby exposure limits are set by SUVA (Schweizerische Unfallversicherungsanstalt), which is the Swiss Accident Insurance Fund. 

We may be subject to further such regulations in the future. Although we believe that our operations comply in all material respects with the applicable environmental laws and regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and the extent of that liability could exceed our resources. Our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.
