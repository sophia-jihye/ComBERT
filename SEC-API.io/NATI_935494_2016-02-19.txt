Industry Background 

&#160; 

Engineers and scientists use instrumentation to observe, understand , and manage the real-world phenomena, events and processes related to their industries or areas of expertise. Instrumentation systems measure and control electrical signals, such as voltage, current and power, as well as temperature, pressure, speed, flow, volume, torque , and vibration. Common general-purpose instruments include voltmeters, signal generators, oscilloscopes, data loggers, spectrum analyzers, cameras, and temperature and pressure monitors and controllers. Some traditional instruments are also highly application-specific, designed with fixed functionality to measure specific signals for particular vertical industries or applications. Instruments used for industrial automation applications include data loggers, strip chart recorders, programmable logic controllers (&#8220;PLCs&#8221;), and proprietary turn-key devices or systems designed to automate or control specific vertical applications. 

&#160; 

Systems that perform measurement and control can be generally categorized as test, measurement, and embedded systems. These systems access real-world phenomena and &#160; are used throughout the research, design, manufacture, and service phases of a wide variety of products and applications. 

&#160; 

Historically, engineers and scientists have used a variety of high-cost systems that operated independently and could be difficult to customize. Due to the limitations of these systems, adapting them to changing needs can be expensive and time-consuming, and users must often purchase multiple single-purpose instruments, controllers, loggers , and other peripherals. 

&#160; 

Our Approach to Measurement and Automation 

&#160; 

NI offers a different approach called graphical system design. This approach provides an integrated hardware and software platform for measurement and control systems that can be defined by the customer. This allows systems to more easily adapt to changing requirements and technologies over time. NI hardware and software also leverage commercially available technology whenever possible to deliver performance and cost benefits to our customers. Therefore, these customer-defined systems are more flexible, with higher performance and lower costs, compared to traditional vendor-defined systems. 

&#160; 

NI equips engineers and scientists with systems that accelerate productivity, innovation and discovery. Our customers use our platform to develop test, measurement, control and embedded systems across multiple industries from design to production, for advanced research, and to teach engineering and science. 

3 &#160; 

&#160;

Compared with traditional solutions, we believe our products and our platform-based approach provide the following significant benefits to our customers: 

&#160; 

Simpler, Faster Development 

&#160; 

Customers face changing requirements and technologies while having to create more intelligent systems with fewer resources than ever. Our software-based approach simplifies the complexity of creating these systems by providing higher level interfaces to access changing technology and a way to easily upgrade through software while other fixed function systems require new hardware. When hardware changes are required, our modular, reconfigurable platforms enable users to easily change only the functions they need while preserving software continuity over time. In this way, the graphical system design platform-based approach can accelerate the development of any system that needs measurement and control. 

&#160; 

Performance and Efficiency 

&#160; 

O ur software brings the power of commercial computers, handheld devices, networks and the Internet to instrumentation and embedded devices. With features such as graphical programming, automatic code generation, graphical tools libraries, ready-to-use example programs, libraries of specific instrumentation functions, and the ability to deploy applications on a range of platforms, scientists and engineers can quickly build a system that meets individual application needs. Because the continuous performance improvement of personal computers (&#8220;PCs&#8221;), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (&#8220;FPGAs&#8221;) and networking technologies are the core platforms for our approach, scientists and engineers can quickly realize direct performance benefits , faster execution for measurement and automation applications, shorter test times, faster automation, higher performing embedded systems and higher manufacturing throughput. 

&#160; 

Modularity, Reusability and Reconfigurability 

&#160; 

Our products include reusable hardware and software modules to provide considerable flexibility in configuring systems. This ability to reconfigure measurement and automation systems allows users to quickly adapt their systems to new and changing needs, eliminate duplicated programming efforts, and ultimately improve their efficiency and productivity. In addition, these features help protect both hardware and software investments against obsolescence. 

&#160; 

Lower Total Solution Cost 

&#160; 

NI solutions offer price to performance and energy-efficiency advantages over traditional proprietary systems. Graphical system design allows customers to equip powerful industry-standard computers, with reusable system design software and modular cost-effective hardware. In addition, these systems give engineers and scientists the flexibility and portability to adapt to changing needs, while offering a smaller form factor that occupies less space on the manufacturing floor and consumes less energy than traditional instrumentation equipment. 

&#160; 

Products, Technology and Services 

&#160; 

We offer an extensive line of measurement, automation and control products to work either separately, as stand-alone products or as an integrated system; however, customers generally purchase our software and hardware together. We believe that the flexibility, functionality and ease of use of our system design software promotes sales of our other software and hardware products. We offer volume licensing that helps customers maximize their system investment by reducing total cost of ownership and simplifying their software standardization , budgeting, purchasing and upgrading efforts . 

&#160; 

System Design Software 

&#160; 

For more than 30 years, NI has invested in its flagship software product, LabVIEW, which the company believes is the ultimate system design software for measurement , automation and control. LabVIEW promotes problem-solving, accelerates productivity, and empowers innovation. With LabVIEW, users program graphically and can design custom virtual instruments by connecting graphical icons with software wires to create &#8220;block diagrams&#8221; which are natural design notations for scientists and engineers. Users can customize front panels with knobs, buttons, dials and graphs to emulate control panels of instruments or add custom graphics to visually represent the control and operation of processes. 

&#160; 

LabVIEW is a comprehensive development environment with hardware integration and wide-ranging compatibility that engineers and scientists need to design and deploy measurement, automation and control systems. The LabVIEW programming environment is graphical, with engineering-specific libraries of software engineering functions and hardware interfaces. It also offers data analysis, visualization, and sharing features.

The vast majority of our foreign sales are denominated in the customers&#8217; local currency, which exposes us to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We expect that a significant portion of our total revenues will continue to be derived from international sales. (See Note 13 &#8211; Segment information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details concerning the geographic breakdown of our net sales and long-lived assets.)

&#160;

We believe the ability to provide comprehensive service and support to our customers is an important factor in our business. We permit customers to return products within 30 days from receipt for a refund of the purchase price less a restocking charge. Our hardware products are generally warranted against defects in materials and workmanship for one year from the date we ship the products to our customers. Historically, warranty costs and returns have not been material. 

&#160; 

The marketplace for our products dictates that many of our products be shipped very quickly after an order is received. As a result, we are required to maintain significant inventories. Therefore, inventory obsolescence is a risk for us due to frequent engineering changes, shifting customer demand, the emergence of new industry standards and rapid technological advances including the introduction by us or our competitors of products embodying new technology. We strive to mitigate this risk by monitoring inventory levels against product demand and technological changes. Additionally, many of our products have interchangeable parts and many have long lives. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts in the future. 

&#160; 

Our foreign operations are subject to certain risks set forth under &#8220;We are Subject to Various Risks Associated with International Operations and Foreign Economies.&#8221; 

&#160; 

See discussion regarding fluctuations in our quarterly results and seasonality in ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, &#8220; Our Revenues are Subject to Seasonal Variations. &#8221; 

&#160; 

We have one operating segment and one reporting unit. For information regarding revenue, results of operations, and total assets for each of our last three fiscal years, please refer to our financial statements included in this Form 10-K and Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The markets in which we operate are characterized by intense competition from numerous competitors, some of which are divisions of large corporations having far greater resources than we have, and we may face further competition from new market entrants in the future. A key competitor is Keysight Technologies Inc. (&#8220;Keysight&#8221;) which was formerly part of Agilent. Keysight offers hardware and software products that provide solutions that directly compete with our virtual instrumentation products including its own line of PXI based hardware . Keysight is aggressively advertising and marketing products that are competitive with our products. Because of Keysight&#8217;s strong position in the instrumentation business, changes in its marketing strategy or product offerings could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In May 2015, Danaher Corporation announced its intention to separate into two publicly traded companies. The spin off will result in a new public company to be named Fortive and will be comprised of Danaher&#8217;s test and measurement businesses and other specialty industrial businesses which can compete directly with us. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

We believe our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside our control, including: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

general market and economic conditions; 

&#183; 

our ability to maintain and grow our business with our very large customers; 

&#183; 

our ability to meet the volume and service requirements of our very large customers; 

&#183; 

industry consolidation, including acquisitions by our competitors; 

&#183; 

success in developing new products; 

&#183; 

timing of our new product introductions; 

&#183; 

new product introductions by competitors; 

&#183; 

the ability of competitors to more fully leverage low cost geographies for manufacturing and/or distribution; 

&#183; 

product pricing; 

&#183; 

effectiveness of sales and marketing resources and strategies; 

&#183; 

adequate supply of components and materials; 

&#183; 

efficiency of manufacturing operations; 

&#183; 

strategic relationships with our suppliers; 

&#183; 

product quality and performance; 

&#183; 

protection of our products by effective use of intellectual property laws; 

&#183; 

the financial strength of our competitors; 

&#183; 

the outcome of any future litigation or commercial dispute; 

&#183; 

barriers to entry imposed by competitors with significant market power in new markets; and, 

&#183; 

government actions throughout the world. 

&#160; 

T here can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future. 

&#160; 

10 &#160; 

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We believe that our long-term growth and success depends on delivering high quality hardware and software products on a timely basis. We focus our research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and developing new products that incorporate appropriate features and functionality to be competitive with respect to technology and price/performance characteristics. 

&#160; 

Our research and development staff strives to build quality into our products at the design stage in an effort to reduce overall development and manufacturing costs. Our research and development staff also designs proprietary application specific integrated circuits (&#8220;ASICs&#8221;), many of which are designed for use in several of our different products. The goal of our ASIC design program is to further differentiate our products from competing products, to improve manufacturability and to reduce costs. We seek to reduce our time to market for new and enhanced products by sharing our internally developed hardware and software components across multiple products. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed 2,172 people in research and development. Our research and development expenses were $225 million, $227 million and $235 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively . 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark law, contracts and technical measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products. As of December 31, 2015, we held 852 U.S. patents (850 utility patents and 2 design patents) and 32 patents in foreign countries (28 patents registered in Europe, 1 patent in China, 2 patents in Japan, and 1 patent in Mexico), and had 170 patent applications pending in the U.S. and foreign countries. 269 of our issued U.S. patents are software patents related to LabVIEW, and cover fundamental aspects of the graphical programming approach used in LabVIEW. Our patents expire from 2016 to 2035. The expiration of any particular patent in the short term is not expected to have any significant negative impact on our business. No assurance can be given that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents. We also own certain registered trademarks in the United States and abroad. See further discussion regarding risks associated with our patents in ITEM 1A, Risk Factors, &#8220; Our Business Depends on Our Proprietary Rights and We are Subject to Intellectual Property Litigation. &#8221; 

&#160; 

Manufacturing and Suppliers 

&#160; 

We manufacture a substantial majority of our product volume at our facilities in Debrecen, Hungary and Penang, Malaysia. Additional production, primarily of RF products and of low volume, complex or newly introduced products was previously done in Austin, Texas, however, we completed the transition of all of our Austin based manufacturing activities to our manufacturing facilities in Hungary and Malaysia in the third quarter of 2015. In 2016, our site in Malaysia is expected to produce approximately 35% of our global production and our site in Hungary is expected to produce approximately 65% of our global production. Our product manufacturing operations can be divided into four areas: electronic circuit card and module assembly; chassis and cable assembly; technical manuals and product support documentation; and software duplication. Most of our electronic circuit card assemblies, modules and chassis are manufactured in house, although contractors are used from time to time. The majority of our electronic cable assemblies are produced by contractors; however, we do manufacture some on an exception basis. Our software duplication, technical manuals and product support documentation is primarily produced by contractors. &#160; 

&#160; 

Our manufacturing processes use large volumes of high-quality components and subassemblies supplied by outside sources. Several of these components are only available through limited sources. Limited source components purchased include custom ASICs, chassis and other components. We have in the past experienced delays and quality problems in connection with limited source components, and there can be no assurance that these problems will not recur in the future. Accordingly, our failure to receive components from limited suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results. See &#8220; Our Business is Dependent on Key Suppliers &#8221; at page 19 for additional discussion of the risks associated with limited source suppliers. 

&#160; 

See &#8220;Our Operations are Subject to a Variety of Environmental Regulations and Costs&#8221; at page 2 0 for discussion of environmental matters as they may affect our business. 

&#160; 

Backlog 

&#160; 

Backlog is a measure of orders that are received but that are not shipped to customers at the end of a quarter. We typically ship products shortly following the receipt of an order. Accordingly, our backlog typically represents less than 5 days sales. Backlog should not be viewed as an indicator of our future sales. 

11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 7,441 employees worldwide, including 2,172 in research and development, 3,411 in sales and marketing and customer support, 1,020 in manufacturing and 838 in administration and finance. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We consider our employee relations to be good.
