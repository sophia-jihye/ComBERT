&#160; 

Argentina Activities 

&#160;

AWLD, through its wholly-owned subsidiary and holding company, InvestProperty Group (&#8220;IPG&#8221;), identifies and develops specific investments in the boutique hotel, hospitality and luxury property markets and in other lifestyle businesses such as wine production and distribution, golf, tennis and real estate development. AWLD also operates hotel, hospitality and related properties and is actively seeking to expand its real estate investment portfolio by acquiring additional properties and businesses in Argentina, or by entering into strategic joint ventures. Using Algodon&#8217;s icon wines as its ambassador, AWLD&#8217;s mission is to develop a group of real estate projects under its ALGODON&#174; brand with the goal of developing synergies among its luxury properties. AWLD&#8217;s senior management is based in its corporate offices in New York City. AWLD&#8217;s local operations are managed by professional staff with substantial hotel, hospitality and resort experience in Buenos Aires and San Rafael, Argentina.

&#160; 

AWLD&#8217;s Concept and Business: Repositioning of Hotel Properties, Luxury Destinations and Residential Properties 

&#160;

AWLD, through IPG, focuses on opportunities that create value through repositioning of underperforming hotel and commercial assets such as hotel/residential/retail destinations. Repositioning means we are working to gradually increment our average fares to solidify our position as a luxury option. This trend has been well received in large metropolitan areas which have become quite competitive. We believe that the trend is now trickling down to secondary metropolitan, resort and foreign markets where there is significantly less competition from the established major operators. We continue to seek opportunities where value can be added through re-capitalization, repositioning, expansion, improved marketing and/or professional management. We believe that AWLD can increase demand for all of a property&#8217;s various offerings, from its rooms, to its dining, meeting and entertainment facilities, to its retail establishments through careful branding and positioning of properties. While the maxim remains true that the three most important factors in real estate are &#8220;location, location, location,&#8221; management believes that &#8220;style and superior service&#8221; have grown in importance and can lead to increased operating revenues and capital appreciation.

&#160;

We are currently increasing our activity, occupancy and presence in the market by using direct marketing actions (FB, Trip Advisor, Relais &#38; Chateau chains, internet presence), and expanding our net of travel agencies and operators, introducing effective changes in our direct sales capacity (new sales-oriented webpages, joint ventures with other hotel organizations, training of our reservations employees, implementing new reservation software). We have also reached out to travel industry media operators to develop new strategic relationships and we are implementing a new commercial management operation for a more aggressive approach with a sales-oriented objective. AWLD has built a team of industry professionals to assist in implementing its vision toward repositioning real estate assets. See &#8220;Item 10 Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.&#8221;

&#160; 

Plan of Operations 

&#160;

AWLD continues to implement its growth and development strategy that includes a luxury boutique hotel, a resort estate, vineyard and winery, and a large land development project including residential houses within the vineyard. See &#8220;Algodon Wine Estates&#8221; below.

&#160; 

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Long Term Growth Strategy 

&#160;

One of AWLD&#8217;s goals include positioning its brand ALGODON&#174; as one of luxury. We continue to form strategic alliances with well-established luxury brands that have strong followings to create awareness of the Algodon brand and help build customer loyalty. To date, Algodon has been associated and co-branded with several world-class luxury brands including Relais &#38; Ch&#226;teaux, Veuve Clicquot Champagne (owned by Louis Vuitton Mo&#235;t Hennessy), Davidoff Cigars, and L&#8217;Occitane.

&#160;

The Company hopes to continue to self-finance future acquisition and development projects because in countries like Argentina, having cash available to purchase land and other assets provides an advantage to buyers. Bank financing in such countries is often difficult or impossible to obtain. To be able to grow our business and expand into new projects, the Company would first want to deploy excess cash generated by operations, but significant amounts of excess cash flow is not anticipated for at least a number of years. Another option would be obtaining new investment funds from investors, including a possible public offering, and/or borrowing from institutional lenders. AWLD may also be able to acquire property for stock instead of cash.

&#160; 

The ALGODON&#174; Brand 

&#160;

We believe that the force and power of brand is of paramount importance in the luxury real estate/hotel market. AWLD has developed the ALGODON&#174; brand, one of distinction, refinement and elegance. Inspired by both the Cotton Club days of the Roaring 20&#8217;s and the distinctive style and glamour of the 50&#8217;s Rat Pack when travel and leisure was synonymous with cultural sophistication, this brand concept was taken from the Spanish word for &#8220;cotton.&#8221; ALGODON&#174; connotes a clean and pure appreciation for the good life, a sense of refined culture, and ultimately a destination where the best elements of the illustrious past meet the affluent present. AWLD is looking to attract attention and upscale demographic visitors to the ALGODON&#174; properties and to round out the brand experience in various other forms including music, dining, wine, sports and apparel, by marketing themes that highlight active lifestyles and the pleasures of life. Management believes that these types of brand extensions will serve to reinforce the overall brand recognition and further build upon AWLD&#8217;s core presence in the luxury hotel segment.

&#160; 

Description of Specific Investment Projects 

&#160;

AWLD has invested in two ALGODON&#174; brand properties located in Argentina. The first property is Algodon Mansion, a Buenos Aires-based luxury boutique hotel that opened in 2010 and is held in IPG&#8217;s subsidiary, The Algodon &#8211; Recoleta S.R.L. (&#8220;TAR&#8221;). The second property, held by Algodon Wine Estates S.R.L., is a Mendoza-based winery and golf resort called Algodon Wine Estates, which was subdivided for residential development, and expanded by acquiring adjoining wine producing properties.

Algodon Mansion 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Company, through TAR, has renovated a hotel in the Recoleta section of Buenos Aires called Algodon Mansion, a stately six-story mansion (including roof-top facilities and basement) located at 1647 Montevideo Street, a tree-lined street in Recoleta, one of the most desirable neighborhoods in Buenos Aires. The property is approximately 20,000 square feet and is a ten-suite premium-luxury hotel with a restaurant (seating approximately 62), a wine bar (seating approximately 20), a private dining room (seating approximately 16) and a rooftop that houses a luxury spa, terrace pool, and chic open-air cigar bar and lounge. Each guest room is an ultra-luxury two-to-three room suite, each approximately 510-1,200 square feet. Recoleta is Buenos Aires&#8217; embassy and luxury hotel district and has fashionable boutiques, high-end restaurants, caf&#233;s, art galleries, and opulent belle &#233;poque architecture.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In November 2011, it was announced that Relais &#38; Ch&#226;teaux, the renowned fellowship of the world&#8217;s finest hotels and restaurants, extended membership to Algodon Mansion hotel. Having reached the highest standards of service required by Relais &#38; Ch&#226;teaux only a year after celebrating its grand openings, Algodon Mansion is the first Relais &#38; Ch&#226;teaux hotel in Buenos Aires to be awarded this distinction. As of March 4, 2016, Relais &#38; Ch&#226;teaux&#8217;s global fellowship of individually owned and operated luxury hotels and restaurants has 530 members in 64 countries on six continents.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Algodon Club, the restaurant on the main floor of Algodon Mansion, offers a sophisticated menu emphasizing Argentinian-style cuisine. The dining room comfortably seats 62 persons and offers a seasonal menu, serving ingredients acquired locally and from the plantation at Algodon Wine Estates in San Rafael, Mendoza. Algodon products include estate cultivated extra virgin olive oil, fresh fruits and vegetables, cheeses, smoked meats, and homemade breads to exemplify the restaurant&#8217;s wholesome, farm-to-table daily fare. Algodon Club&#8217;s menu complements the wines and local products of Argentina&#8217;s wine region and includes Algodon&#8217;s own premium and icon wines. We own and manage the food and beverage operations (restaurant, events, catering) at Algodon Club.

Algodon Wine Bar, located in the Algodon Mansion lobby, offers a unique wine list that exemplifies the Argentinean wine portfolio, with emphasis on the premium and icon vintages of Algodon&#8217;s own private collection from Algodon Wine Estates in Mendoza.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Algodon Mansion&#8217;s rooftop pool features teak decks and loungers that invite afternoon tanning in the summer sun. An open-air bar and tented cigar lounge, the &#8220;Davidoff Lounge,&#8221; in association with the world-renowned Davidoff Cigars, features a menu of drinks from around the world, and is well suited for twilight soir&#233;es, rooftop parties and late night cocktail events. Also on the rooftop is Le Spa, which features steam, sauna, and massage rooms as well as relaxation areas where guests may be pampered in a calm and tranquil atmosphere and indulge in a variety of treatment options. Le Spa at Algodon Mansion combines natural elements of Argentina&#8217;s native regions with the latest treatments and technology from Europe&#8217;s finest spas. Le Spa&#8217;s licensed medical specialists help to design customized holistic treatments for each individual with an emphasis on organic, non-invasive and non-aggressive products for the face and body. Through March 2016, Le Spa was managed by Carlos Lizardi, creator of the CL45 brand of natural cosmetic products. Beginning in April 2016, Le Spa will be managed by Algodon Mansion.

Algodon Wine Estates 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In July 2007, Algodon Wine Estates S.R.L. (&#8220;AWE&#8221;) acquired 718 acres located in the Cuadro Benegas district of San Rafael, Mendoza. Subsequently, in 2007 and 2008, AWE purchased additional land adjacent to the original 718-acre property, culminating in a 2,050 acre area to be known as Algodon Wine Estates. The resort property is part of the Mendoza wine region nestled in the foothills of the Andes mountain range. This property includes a winery (whose vines date back to the mid-1940&#8217;s), a newly-expanded 18-hole golf course, tennis, restaurant and hotel. The estate is situated on Mendoza&#8217;s Ruta del Vino (Wine Trail). The original 718-acre property has an impressive lineage, both in terms of wine production and golf, and features structures on the property that date back to 1921.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Algodon Wine Estates features Algodon Villa, a private lodge originally built in 1921 that has been fully restored and refurbished to its original farmhouse design of adobe walls and cane roof. The lodge offers three suites, a gallery for private gatherings, a living area that may also serve as a dining and conference room, swimming pool, and adjacent vine-covered picnic area. The Algodon Villa offers five-star service and is situated for vacationing families, business conferences, retreat travelers, golfing companions, or wine route globe trekkers. Algodon Wine Estates has also recently completed the construction of a new lodge which lies adjacent to the original one. The new lodge features six additional suites and a gallery with two fireplaces and a bar.

&#160;

Algodon Wine Estates completed the expansion of its nine-hole golf course to 18 holes during 2013, including irrigation canals and ponds. Adjacent to the course is a clubhouse, pro shop, driving range, and award winning restaurant and the Tennis Center.

&#160; 

Algodon Wines 

&#160;

Algodon Wine Estates contains a vineyard with 310 acres of vines. Over 60 acres have been cultivated since the 1940&#8217;s, and approximately 20 acres since the 1960&#8217;s. The property produces eight varieties of grapes, including Argentina&#8217;s signature varietal, Malbec, as well as Bonarda, Cabernet Sauvingnon, Merlot, Syrah, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Semillon. The primary difference between the old and new vines is the style of pruning. Algodon Wine Estates utilizes a boutique wine making process, typified by production of a low volume of premium wines sold at a higher than average price in the market.

&#160;

In March 2014, Algodon Wine Estates acquired its own bottling machine in order to improve the winery&#8217;s production capacity. This bottling machine allows our winemakers to bottle when desired and when necessary, rather than depending on the availability of external bottling facilities. In April 2014, new stainless steel wine tanks were added to the winery, increasing storage capacity by 55,000 liters. This includes five 5,000 liter tanks and three 10,000 liter tanks. These upgrades have the potential to increase our production significantly. During the production year of 2014, we produced over 169,000 liters, which would translate roughly to about 200,000 bottles or 17,000 cases, representing a production increase of 119% over the prior year&#8217;s production. Despite our increased production capacity, production during 2015 was negatively affected by a significant hailstorm. During 2015, we produced 55,000 liters, which translates to about 73,000 bottles or 6,000 cases of wine.

&#160;

In an effort to increase distribution of its wines, Algodon Wine Estates is working with a number of importers operating in some of the world&#8217;s chief markets for premium wines. In Toronto, Canada, BND Wines &#38; Spirits (www.bndwines.com) represents Algodon Wines. In Europe, Algodon Wine Estates warehouses its wines in Amsterdam for central distribution to clients in Germany and in the U.K. through Condor Wines (www.condorwines.co.uk), which works with regional distribution partners throughout the U.K. such as hotel and restaurant chains, regional and national brewers, pub companies, wholesalers and wine merchants. In Brazil, Algodon has entered the competitive Sao Paulo market in cooperation with www.lupin.com.br andwww.initiumworldwide.com, and believes this may result in a significantly improved presence of Algodon wines in the Brazilian market.

&#160;

Through December 2015, Jomada Imports, LLC (www.jomadaimports.com) (&#8220;Jomada&#8221;), with its principal location at 500 Capital Drive, Lake Zurich, IL 60047 was the authorized importer of wines to the U.S. bearing the name Algodon Wine Estates; San Rafael, Argentina and was authorized to import wine under Federal Basic Permit IL-I-15170. The Company&#8217;s agreement with Jomada was terminated effective January 8, 2016. The Company is currently in discussions with additional importers in an effort to develop additional distribution channels in the U.S.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

None of the understandings with wine importers constitute a binding commitment by either party to produce, import or export the Company&#8217;s wines; performance by any of the parties is dependent upon numerous factors such as economic and political climate, consumer spending, weather, the Company&#8217;s ability to continue wine production operations, the market acceptance of the Company&#8217;s products, and other matters described in the Item 1A - Risk Factors.

&#160;

AWE uses microvinification (barrel fermentation) for its premium varietals and blends. Microvinification is commonly used in France, but is uncommon in Argentina, and Algodon Wine Estates is one of the few wineries in the country to implement this specialized process.

&#160;

James Galtieri holds the title of Senior Wine Advisor on Algodon&#8217;s Advisory Board. James is a founding partner and former President/CEO of Pasternak Wine Imports, a renowned national wine importer and distributor, founded in 1988 in partnership with Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite). He currently maintains an advisory role to Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite), and he is the current President/CEO at Seaview Imports LLC., a national wine importer (based in New York) covering the U.S. market with high-quality, exclusive wine brands. James has considerable background and experience in wine knowledge and wine market dynamics, and he is specialized in corporate management in the wine &#38; spirit industry.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Algodon Wine Estates launched its ultra-premium wine under the &#8220;PIMA&#8221; brand in November 2012. PIMA by Algodon is a single vineyard wine that has been crafted from the finest handpicked grapes of Algodon&#8217;s 1946 Malbec and 1946 Bonarda vineyards utilizing microvinification (barrel fermentation) process from day one of harvest. PIMA wine is a limited collection which currently retails for approximately $100 per bottle. Most recently, Algodon Wine&#8217;s 2010 Bonarda ranked among the World Association of Wine &#38; Spirit Writers&#8217; and Journalists&#8217; (WAWWJ&#174;) Top 100 Wines of the World 2014.

&#160; 

Algodon Wine Estates &#8211; Real Estate Development 

&#160;

AWE has acquired a substantial amount of contiguous real estate surrounding its project in Mendoza, Argentina. This land was purchased with the purpose of developing a vineyard-resort and attracting investment in second or third homes for the well-to-do from around the world. AWLD continues to invest in the ongoing costs of building out infrastructure and anticipates that sales of lots will gradually improve and accelerate as worldwide economic conditions improve.

&#160;

AWLD is currently marketing portions of the property to be developed into luxury residential homes and vineyard estates. Management believes that the power of the ALGODON &#174; brand combined with an attractive package of amenities will promote interest in the surrounding real estate. The estate&#8217;s master plan features a luxury golf and vineyard living community, made up of six distinct village sectors, with 610 home sites ranging in size from 0.2 to 2.8 hectares (0.5 to 7 acres) for private sale and development. The development&#8217;s village sectors have been designed and named in accordance with their characteristic surroundings and landscape: the Wine &#38; Golf Village, the Polo &#38; Equestrian Village, the Sierra Pintada Village, The North Vineyard &#38; Orchard Village, The South Vineyard &#38; Orchard Village, and the Desert Vista Village. The development is located fifteen minutes from both the local airport and city center.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Currently, AWLD is developing lots for sale to third party builders and is not engaged in any construction activity. Sixteen lots have been sold and two additional lots are currently in advanced negotiations. Revenue is recorded when the deeds are issued. The Company expects to close on the sale of twelve lots and record the deeds during 2016. To date, no deeds have been issued. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has $1,175,990 of lot deposits for pending sales.

Owning real estate in Argentina is subject to risk. For more information see &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221;

&#160; 

The Business of DPEC Capital, Inc. 

&#160;

DPEC Capital, Inc. (&#8220;DPEC Capital&#8221;) was formed on February 9, 2001 under the name &#8220;InvestPrivate, Inc.&#8221; and subsequently filed a Certificate of Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation changing its name to DPEC Capital, Inc. on January 16, 2008. DPEC Capital is charged with raising sufficient capital for the development of AWLD&#8217;s operations. DPEC Capital is a broker-dealer registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;). It is fully licensed to engage in traditional retail commission-based business. However, the focus of its business over the past few years has been private placement offerings on behalf of IPG and other affiliated entities developing investment opportunities in international real estate ventures, which to date have all been located in Argentina.

&#160;

DPEC Capital generates operating income principally from placement agent fees and also receives warrants from the companies for which it conducts private placement offerings. Since approximately 2004, DPEC Capital has concentrated its efforts on raising money for investment vehicles that were formed by its corporate affiliates to invest in the various projects being developed in Argentina, or for other operating businesses under common control with AWLD. DPEC Capital has earned warrants to purchase the shares of certain companies including AWLD affiliates for which DPEC Capital has provided investment banking and advisory services. A summary of the currently outstanding warrants owned by DPEC Capital is set forth in Item 13&#8212;Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.

&#160; 

Net-Capital Requirement 

&#160;

DPEC Capital, as a registered broker-dealer, is subject to the SEC&#8217;s Uniform Net Capital Rule 15c3-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that requires the maintenance of minimum net capital of $5,000 and that the ratio of aggregate indebtedness, as defined, to net capital shall not exceed 15 to 1. Advances, dividend payments, and other equity withdrawals are restricted by the regulations of the SEC, and other regulatory agencies are subject to certain notification and other provisions of the net capital rules of the SEC. The Company qualifies under the exemptive provisions of Rule 15c3-3 as the Company does not carry security accounts for customers or perform custodial functions related to customer securities.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

The securities industry in which DPEC Capital operates is heavily regulated by the SEC, FINRA and state regulators. If DPEC Capital fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations, it may face penalties or other sanctions that may be detrimental to its business.

&#160;

The securities industry in the United States is also subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws. Uncertainty regarding the application or violation of these laws and other regulations to its business may adversely affect the viability and profitability of business. DPEC Capital&#8217;s ability to comply with all applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on its establishment and maintenance of a system to ensure such compliance, as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel. DPEC Capital could be subject to disciplinary or other actions due to claimed noncompliance in the future, and the imposition of any material penalties or orders on it could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, it is possible that noncompliance could subject the Company to future civil lawsuits, the outcome of which could harm the business.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

DPEC Capital encounters intense competition in all aspects of its business, and this competition is likely to increase. The financial services industry is highly competitive. DPEC Capital&#8217;s competitors include large and well-established Wall Street firms as well as relatively new securities firms. DPEC Capital&#8217;s private placement advisory and investment banking activities face direct competition primarily from established investment banks and venture capital firms.

Mercari Communications Group, Ltd. 

&#160;

On November 9, 2009, AWLD entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Stock Purchase&#8221;) with Mercari Communications Group, Ltd., a Colorado corporation (&#8220;Mercari&#8221;), Kanouff, LLC (&#8220;KLLC&#8221;) and Underwood Family Partners, Ltd. (the &#8220;Partnership&#8221;), whereby AWLD purchased Mercari shares from Mercari, KLLC and the Partnership. Immediately following the closing of the Stock Purchase Agreement, AWLD owned an aggregate of 43,822,401 shares of Mercari&#8217;s common stock out of the total of 45,411,400 shares of common stock issued and outstanding at the closing, or approximately 96.5% of Mercari&#8217;s issued and outstanding shares.

&#160;

The Stock Purchase Agreement contains post-closing covenants whereby Mercari and AWLD agree to utilize their commercially reasonable efforts to cause Mercari to (i) remain a Section 12(g) reporting company in compliance with and current in its reporting requirements under the Exchange Act; and (ii) cause all of the assets and business or equity interest of AWLD, its subsidiaries and affiliated companies to be transferred to Mercari and, in connection with such transactions, cause Mercari&#8217;s stock to be distributed by AWLD to AWLD&#8217;s stockholders and the holders of equity interests in the affiliated companies (&#8220;Reorganization Transaction&#8221;).

&#160;

AWLD&#8217;s Board of Directors determined that a Reorganization Transaction was no longer commercially reasonable, taking into account all relevant material factors, including without limitation, current economic, financial and market conditions.

&#160;

Mercari has no material assets and no operations, and is a public reporting shell company as that term is defined in SEC Rule 144(i). Nevertheless, Mercari has continued to file its reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, although there is no meaningful public market for the shares of its outstanding common stock and one is not expected to develop in the near term. AWLD does provide some non-material services to Mercari, such as the lease of office space.
