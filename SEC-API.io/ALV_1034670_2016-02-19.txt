A statement of net sales by product group and region for the last three years is contained in Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 84 of the Annual Report and is incorporated herein by reference. 

Products, Market and Competition 

Information concerning products, markets and competition is included in the sections &#147;Innovation&#148;, &#147;Electronics for Active Safety&#148;, &#147;Brake Control and Passive Safety&#148; and &#147;Passive Safety for Protection&#148; on pages 16-21 of the Annual Report and &#147;Our Market and Competitors&#148; on pages 30 and 31 of the Annual Report, and in the Management Discussion and Analysis sections &#147;Dependence on Customers&#148;, &#147;New Competition&#148; and &#147;Patents and Proprietary Technology&#148; on pages 56 and 57 of the Annual Report, and is incorporated herein by reference. 

Manufacturing and Production 

Including joint venture operations, Autoliv has approximately 78 production facilities located in 27 countries, consisting of both component factories and assembly factories. See &#147;Item 2. Properties&#148; for a description of Autoliv&#146;s principal properties. The component factories manufacture inflators, gas generants, initiators, textile cushions, webbing materials, electronics, pressed steel parts, springs and overmoulded steel parts used in seatbelt and airbag assembly, steering wheels and our active safety, vision and night vision systems and our other safety electronic systems. The assembly factories source components from a number of parties, including Autoliv&#146;s own component factories, and assemble complete restraint systems for &#147;just-in-time&#148; delivery to customers. These factories also assemble our active safety, vision and night vision systems. The products manufactured by Autoliv&#146;s consolidated subsidiaries in 2015 consisted of more than 145 million complete seatbelt systems (of which approximately 67 million were fitted with pretensioners), approximately 90 million side-impact airbags (including curtain airbags), approximately 48 million frontal airbag modules, approximately 17 million steering wheels, approximately 18 million electronic units (airbag control), and approximately 8 million active safety units. 

Autoliv&#146;s &#147;just-in-time&#148; delivery systems have been designed to accommodate the specific requirements of each customer for low levels of inventory and rapid stock delivery service. &#147;Just-in-time&#148; deliveries require final assembly, or at least, distribution centers in geographic areas close to customers to facilitate rapid delivery. The fact that the major automobile manufacturers are continually expanding production activities into more countries and require the same or similar safety systems as those produced in Europe, Japan or the U.S. increases the importance for suppliers to have assembly capacity in several countries. Consolidation among our customers also supports this trend. 

If the supply of raw materials and components is not disrupted, Autoliv&#146;s assembly operations generally are not constrained by capacity considerations. When dramatic shifts in light vehicle production occur, Autoliv can generally adjust capacity in response to changes in demand within a few weeks by adding or removing work shifts and within a few 

&#160; 

months by adding or removing standardized production and assembly lines. Most of Autoliv&#146;s assembly factories can make sufficient space available to accommodate additional production lines to satisfy foreseeable increases in capacity. As a result, Autoliv can usually adjust its manufacturing capacity faster than its customers can adjust their capacity to fluctuations in the general demand for vehicles or in the demand for a specific vehicle model, provided that customers promptly notify Autoliv when they become aware of such changes in demand. 

When dramatic shifts in light vehicle production occur or when there is a shift in regional light vehicle production, the capacity adjustments can take more time and be more costly. Additionally, when there is a significant demand for a given product due to a major recall of a competitor&#146;s product, such as our customers are experiencing now, capacity adjustments may take time. 

We could experience disruption in our supply or delivery chain, which could cause one or more of our customers to halt or delay production. For more information, see Item 1A &#150; Risk Factors. 

Quality Management 

Autoliv believes that superior quality is a prerequisite to it being considered a leading global supplier of automotive safety systems and is key to its financial performance, because quality excellence is critical for winning new orders, preventing recalls and maintaining low scrap rates. Autoliv has for many years emphasized a &#147;zero-defect&#148; proactive quality policy and continues to strive to improve its working methods. This means both that Autoliv&#146;s products are expected to always meet performance expectations, and that Autoliv&#146;s products are expected to be delivered to its customers at the right times and in the right amounts. Furthermore, our continued quality improvements further enhance our reputation among customers, employees and governmental authorities. 

Although quality has always been paramount in the automotive industry, especially for safety products, automobile manufacturers have become increasingly focused on quality with even less tolerance for any deviations. This intensified focus on quality is partially due to an increase in the number of vehicle recalls for a variety of reasons (not just safety), including a few high-profile vehicle recalls. This trend is likely to continue as automobile manufacturers introduce even stricter quality requirements and regulating agencies and other authorities increase the level of scrutiny given to vehicle safety issues. We have not been immune to the recalls that have been impacting the entire automotive industry. 

In an effort to improve our quality, we launched a quality initiative called &#147;Q5&#148; in the summer of 2010 as the next step in our strategy of shaping a proactive quality culture of zero defects. It is called &#147;Q5&#148; because it addresses quality in five dimensions: products, customers, growth, behavior and suppliers. The goal of Q5 is to firmly tie together quality with value within all of our processes and for all of our employees, thereby leading to the best value for our customers. Since 2010, we have continually expanded this quality initiative to provide additional skills training to more employees and suppliers. These activities have made a significant contribution to the reduction in occurrences of non-conforming events. 

In our pursuit of excellence in quality, we have developed a chain of four &#147;defense lines&#148; against potential quality issues. These defense lines consist of: 1) robust product designs, 2) flawless components from suppliers and our own in-house component companies, 3) manufacturing flawless products with a system for verifying that our products conform with specifications and 4) an advanced traceability system in the event of a recall. 

Our pursuit of excellence extends from the earliest phases of product development to the proper disposal of a product following many years of use in a vehicle. Autoliv&#146;s comprehensive Autoliv Product Development System includes several key check points 

&#160; 

during the process of developing new products that are designed to ensure that such products are well-built and have no hidden defects. Through this process, we work closely with our suppliers to set clear standards that help to ensure robust component design and lowest cost for function in order to proactively prevent problems and ensure we deliver only the best designs to the market. 

The Autoliv Production System (&#147;APS&#148;), based on the goals of improving quality and efficiency, is at the core of Autoliv&#146;s manufacturing philosophy. APS integrates essential quality elements, such as mistake proofing, statistical process control and operator involvement, into the manufacturing processes so all Autoliv associates are aware of and understand the critical connection between themselves and our lifesaving products. This &#147;zero-defect&#148; principle extends beyond Autoliv to the entire supplier base. All of our suppliers must accept the strict quality standards in the global Autoliv Supplier Manual, which defines our quality requirements and focuses on preventing bad parts from being produced by our suppliers and helps eliminate defective intermediate products in our assembly lines as early as possible. In addition, Autoliv&#146;s One Product One Process (&#147;1P1P&#148;) initiative is its strategy for developing and managing standardization of both core products and customer-specific features, leading not only to improved quality, but also greater cost efficiency and more efficient management of the supply chain. 

Autoliv continues to execute its plan to have all of its subsidiaries certified to ISO/TS 16949, a global automotive quality management standard.

Joint Ventures 

An important element of Autoliv&#146;s strategy has been to establish joint ventures to promote its geographical expansion and technological development and to gain assistance in marketing its full product line to automobile manufacturers. Traditionally in its joint ventures for passive safety systems, Autoliv typically contributes design and production knowledge to joint ventures, with the joint venture partner providing sales support and manufacturing facilities. Some of these local partners for joint ventures for passive safety systems manufacture and sell standardized seatbelt systems, and will, through their joint ventures with Autoliv, be able to upgrade their technology to meet specific customer demands and/or expand their product offerings. 

In addition to the previously announced joint venture with Nissin Kogyo, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016, Autoliv may, in the future, establish other joint ventures for developing technology. For joint ventures with respect to its active safety business, Autoliv would likely utilize its global customer network relationships, technical competence in electronics, strong lean production experience and focus while gaining from its joint venture partner engineering and technological know-how, manufacturing insights and employees, including engineers. 

For information on how these joint ventures are accounted for, including the name and Autoliv&#146;s percentage of ownership, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 72 of the Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
