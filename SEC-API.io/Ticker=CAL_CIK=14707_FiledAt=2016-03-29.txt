 ITEM 1 

BUSINESS 

Caleres, Inc., originally founded as Brown Shoe Company, Inc. in 1878 and incorporated in 1913, is a global footwear retailer and wholesaler with annual net sales of $2.6 billion . In May 2015, the shareholders of Brown Shoe Company, Inc. approved a rebranding initiative that changed the name of the company to Caleres, Inc. (the "Company"). Current activities include the operation of retail shoe stores and e-commerce websites as well as the design, sourcing and marketing of footwear for women and men. Our business is seasonal in nature due to consumer spending patterns, with higher back-to-school and Christmas season sales. Traditionally, the third fiscal quarter accounts for a substantial portion of our earnings for the year. 

During 2015 , categories of our consolidated net sales were approximately 63% women&#8217;s footwear, 23% men&#8217;s footwear, 9% children&#8217;s footwear and 5% accessories. This composition has remained relatively constant over the past few years. Approximately 66% of footwear sales in 2015 &#32;were retail sales, including sales through our e-commerce websites, compared to 67% in 2014 &#32;and 70% in 2013 , while the remaining 34%, 33% and 30% in the respective years represented wholesale sales. 

Employees 

We had approximately 11,000 full-time and part-time employees as of January 30, 2016 . In the United States, there are no employees subject to union contracts. In Canada, we employ approximately 20 warehouse employees under a union contract, which expires in October 2016. 

Competition 

With many companies operating retail shoe stores and shoe departments, we compete in a highly fragmented market. Competitors include local, regional and national shoe store chains, department stores, discount stores, mass merchandisers, numerous independent retail operators of various sizes and e-commerce businesses. Quality of products and services, store location, trend-right merchandise selection and availability of brands, pricing, advertising and consumer service are all factors that impact retail competition. 

In addition, our wholesale customers also sell shoes purchased from competing footwear suppliers. Those competing footwear suppliers own and license brands, many of which are well-known and marketed aggressively. Many retailers, who are our wholesale customers, source directly from factories or through agents. The wholesale footwear business has low barriers to entry, which further intensifies competition. 

&#160; 

FAMOUS FOOTWEAR 

Our Famous Footwear segment includes our Famous Footwear stores and Famous.com, and included our Shoes.com subsidiary prior to its sale in December 2014, as further discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Famous Footwear is one of America&#8217;s leading family-branded footwear retailers with 1,046 &#32;stores at the end of 2015 &#32;and net sales of $1.6 billion &#32;in 2015 . Our core consumers are women who seek leading national brands of casual, athletic and fashionable footwear at a value for themselves and their families. 

Famous Footwear stores feature a wide selection of brand-name athletic, casual and dress shoes for the entire family. Brands carried include, among others, Nike, Skechers, Converse, Vans, adidas, Sperry, New Balance, Asics, Bearpaw and Sof Sole, as well as company-owned and licensed brands including, among others, LifeStride, Dr. Scholl&#8217;s, Naturalizer, Fergalicious and Carlos by Carlos Santana. Our company-owned and licensed products are sold to our Famous Footwear segment by our Brand Portfolio segment at a profit and represent approximately 9% of the Famous Footwear segment's net sales. We work closely with our vendors to provide our consumers with fresh product and, in some cases, product exclusively designed for and available only in our stores. Famous Footwear&#8217;s average retail price is approximately $45 for footwear with retail price points typically ranging from $25 for shoes up to $210 for boots. 

Famous Footwear stores are located in strip shopping centers as well as outlet and regional malls in all 50 states, Guam and Canada. The breakdown by venue at the end of each of the last three fiscal years is as follows:

Stores open at the end of 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;averaged approximately 6,700 square feet. Total square footage at the end of 2015 &#32;decreased 0.1% to 6.9 million &#32;square feet compared to 7.0 million &#32;at the end of 2014 . We expect to open approximately 55 new stores and close approximately 40 stores in 2016 . New stores typically experience an initial start-up period characterized by lower sales and operating earnings than what is generally achieved by more mature stores. While the duration of this start-up period may vary by type of store, economic environment and geographic location, new stores typically reach a normal level of profitability within approximately four years. 

Sales per square foot were $217 &#32;in 2015 , up from $215 &#32;in 2014 . Same-store sales increased 1.9% &#32;during 2015 . Same-store sales changes are calculated by comparing the sales in stores that have been open at least 13 months. Relocated stores are treated as new stores and closed stores are excluded from the calculation. Sales change from new and closed stores, net, reflects the change in net sales due to stores that have been opened or closed during the period and are thereby excluded from the same-store sales calculation. E-commerce sales for those e-commerce websites that function as an extension of a retail chain are included in the same-store sales calculation. 

Famous Footwear relies on merchandise allocation systems and processes that use allocation criteria, consumer segmentation and inventory data in an effort to ensure stores are adequately stocked with product and to differentiate the needs of each store based on location, consumer segmentation and other factors. Famous Footwear&#8217;s distribution systems allow for merchandise to be delivered to each store weekly, or on a more frequent basis, as needed. Famous Footwear also uses regional third-party pooled distribution sites across the country. Famous Footwear&#8217;s in-store point-of-sale systems provide detailed sales transaction data to our corporate office for daily update and analysis in the perpetual inventory and merchandise allocation systems. Certain of these systems also are used for training employees and communication between the stores and the corporate office. 

Famous Footwear&#8217;s marketing programs include digital marketing and social networking, national television, print, e-commerce advertising, cinema and in-store advertisements, all of which are designed to further develop and reinforce the Famous Footwear concept and strengthen our connection with consumers. We believe the success of our campaigns is attributable to highlighting key categories and tailoring the timing of such messaging to adapt to seasonal shopping patterns. In 2015 , we spent approximately $52.6 million to advertise and market Famous Footwear to our target consumers, a portion of which was recovered from suppliers. Famous Footwear has a robust loyalty program (&#8220;Rewards&#8221;), which informs and rewards frequent consumers with product previews, earned incentives based upon purchase continuity and other periodic promotional offers. In 2015 , approximately 74% of our Famous Footwear net sales were generated by our Rewards members compared to 73% in 2014. During the year, we expanded our efforts to connect with and engage our consumers to build a strong brand preference for Famous Footwear through both our loyalty program and social media. In 2015 , we grew our mobile application and had more than 794,000 members enrolled by the end of the year. In 2016 , we will continue to intensify our digital marketing presence to acquire and retain highly valuable consumers. 

As part of our omni-channel approach to reach consumers, we also operate Famous.com. Famous.com offers an expanded product assortment beyond what is sold in Famous Footwear stores. Accessible via desktop, tablet and mobile devices, Famous.com helps consumers explore product assortments, including items available in local stores, and make direct-to-consumer purchases. During 2015, we reduced the average delivery time for direct-to-consumer purchases by expanding our in-store fulfillment initiative to approximately 900 stores. Famous.com also allows Rewards members to see their points status and purchase history, manage profile settings and engage further with the brand. Famous Footwear&#8217;s mobile app further serves as a hub for Rewards members to shop, find local stores, redeem Rewards certificates, and learn about the newest products, latest trends and hottest deals. 

We are investing in our logistics network to meet the omni-channel demands of today, including faster order processing and faster delivery to our customers, as well as to prepare for ongoing growth in our business. The expansion and modernization projects at our distribution centers are intended to provide additional shipping flexibility, operational efficiencies and an expansion of our logistics infrastructure capacity. These projects are anticipated to be complete during the fall of 2016. 

Until December 2014, we owned and operated Shoes.com, Inc., a pure-play Internet retailing company. Shoes.com offered a diverse selection of footwear and accessories for women, men and children, including footwear purchased from third-party suppliers and the Company's other brands. As further discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, we sold Shoes.com in December 2014 and recognized a gain on sale of $4.7 million. 

BRAND PORTFOLIO 

Our Brand Portfolio segment offers retailers and consumers a portfolio of leading brands from our Healthy Living and Contemporary Fashion platforms by designing, sourcing and marketing branded footwear for women and men at a variety of price points. Certain of our branded footwear products are sold under brand names that are owned by the Company and others are developed pursuant to licensing agreements.

At the end of 2015 , we operated six Sam Edelman stores in the United States, and expect to open six stores in 2016 . Sam Edelman footwear is sold primarily through department stores, independent retailers and online at suggested retail price points of $100 for shoes to $200 for boots.

The shoes are for the modern man who is now embracing the return of clean dressing. Suggested retail price points will range from $295 for shoes to $595 for boots, and will sell at traditional brick and mortar stores and online retailers as well as its own e-commerce site that is anticipated to launch in the summer of 2016. 

Wholesale 

Within our Brand Portfolio segment, footwear is distributed on a wholesale basis to over 1,700 retailers, including national chains, department stores, online retailers, mass merchandisers, independent retailers and catalogs throughout the United States and Canada, as well as approximately 65 other countries (including sales to our retail operations). Our most significant wholesale customers include Famous Footwear and many of the nation&#8217;s largest retailers including national chains such as DSW, TJX Corporation (including TJ Maxx and Marshalls), Nordstrom Rack and Ross; department stores such as Nordstrom, Macy&#8217;s, Bloomingdale's and Dillard's; online retailers such as Nordstrom.com, Zappos.com and Amazon; mass merchandisers such as Walmart and Target; and independent retailers such as QVC and Home Shopping Network. We also sell product to a variety of international retail customers and distributors. The loss of any one or more of our significant customers could have a material negative impact on our Brand Portfolio segment and the Company. 

Our Brand Portfolio segment sold approximately 48 million pairs of shoes on a wholesale basis during 2015 . We sell footwear to wholesale customers on both a landed and a first-cost basis. Landed sales are those in which we obtain title to the footwear from our overseas suppliers and maintain title until the footwear clears United States customs and is shipped to our wholesale customers. Landed sales generally carry a higher profit rate than first-cost sales as a result of the brand equity associated with the product along with the additional customs, warehousing and logistics services provided to customers and the risks associated with inventory ownership. To allow for the prompt shipment on reorders, we carry inventories of certain styles. First-cost sales are those in which we obtain title to footwear from our overseas suppliers and typically relinquish title to customers at a designated overseas port. Many of these customers then import this product into the United States. 

Products sold under license agreements accounted for approximately 27%, 26% and 38% of the sales of the Brand Portfolio segment in 2015, 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. Caleres also receives royalty revenues for licensing owned brands, including certain brands listed above, to third parties. 

Retail 

Our Brand Portfolio segment also includes retail stores for certain brands, including Naturalizer and Sam Edelman. The number of our Brand Portfolio retail stores at the end of the last three fiscal years was as follows:

&#160; 

&#160; 

At the end of 2015, we operated 74 Naturalizer stores in the United States (including a store in Guam) and 85 Naturalizer stores in Canada. Of the 159 Naturalizer stores, approximately 50% are concept stores located in regional malls, with a couple stores located in strip centers, and average approximately 1,200 square feet in size. The other 50% of stores are located in outlet malls and average approximately 2,300 square feet in size. Total Naturalizer store square footage at the end of 2015 &#32;was 280,000 compared to 297,000 in 2014 . During 2016 , we expect to open one Naturalizer store and close five stores. At the end of 2015 we operated six Sam Edelman stores. During 2016 , we plan to open six Sam Edelman stores, as we expand our retail presence for this brand. Our four Dr. Scholl&#8217;s stores were closed in 2014, as we shifted our brand focus toward wholesale distribution and e-commerce sales. 

In connection with our omni-channel approach to reach consumers, we also operate Naturalizer.com, Naturalizer.ca, Ryka.com, &#32; DrSchollsShoes.com, LifeStride.com, ViaSpiga.com, SamEdelman.com, CarlosShoes.com, Bzees.com and FergieShoes.com, which offer substantially the same product selection to consumers as we sell to our retail partners. Vince.com and DVF.com complement our distribution of those brands, and we have plans to begin selling product on FrancoSarto.com in the second quarter of 2016.

Marketing 

We continue to build on the recognition of our portfolio of brands to create differentiation and consumer loyalty. Our marketing teams are responsible for the development and implementation of marketing programs for each brand, both for us and for our retail partners. In 2015 , we spent approximately $24.1 million in advertising and marketing support for our Brand Portfolio segment, including print, trade shows, consumer media advertising, production, digital marketing and social media, public relations and in-store displays and fixtures. The marketing teams are also responsible for driving the development of branding and content for our brand websites. We continually focus on enhancing the effectiveness of these marketing efforts through market research, product development and marketing communications that collectively address the ever-changing lives and needs of our consumers. In 2015 , the marketing teams were instrumental in the development and execution of new product launches, including branding, positioning and marketing to both the consumer and trade audiences. In 2016, we will continue to leverage relationships by strengthening business with our key customers and increase market share by targeting new growth areas. 

Sourcing and Product Development Operations 

Our sourcing and product development operations source and develop footwear for our Brand Portfolio segment and also a portion of the footwear sold by our Famous Footwear segment. We have sourcing and product development offices in China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Italy, Macau, Ethiopia, St. Louis and New York. 

Sourcing Operations 

In 2015 , the sourcing operations sourced approximately 47 million pairs of shoes through a global network of third-party independent footwear manufacturers. The majority of our footwear sourced is provided by approximately 60 manufacturers operating approximately 87 manufacturing facilities. In certain countries, we use agents to facilitate and manage the development, production and shipment of product. We attribute our ability to achieve consistent quality, competitive prices and on-time delivery to the breadth of these established relationships. While we generally do not have significant contractual commitments with our suppliers, we do enter into sourcing agreements with certain independent sourcing agents. Prior to production, we monitor the quality of all of our footwear components and also inspect the prototypes of each footwear style. We have a leading lab testing facility in our Putian, China office, and we also perform quality control checks during production and before any footwear leaves the manufacturing facilities. 

In 2015 , approximately 76% of the footwear we sourced was from manufacturing facilities in China. The following table provides an overview of our foreign sourcing in 2015 :

Product Development Operations 

In our Dongguan, China office, we operate a sample-making facility that allows us to have greater control over our product development in terms of accuracy, execution and time to market. We maintain design and product development teams for our brands in St. Louis, New York and China as well as other select fashion locations, including Italy. These teams, which include independent designers, are responsible for the creation and development of new product styles. Our designers monitor trends in fashion footwear and apparel and work closely with retailers to identify consumer footwear preferences. Our design teams create collections of footwear and work closely with our product development and sourcing offices to convert our designs into new footwear styles. 

Our long-range plans include further expansion into new markets outside of China, developing more progressive processes to improve factory capacity and material planning, and continuing to understand ways to drive excellence in product value and execution in a continually evolving manufacturing landscape. 

Backlog 

At January 30, 2016 , our Brand Portfolio segment had a backlog of unfilled wholesale orders of approximately $274.4 million &#32;compared to $284.6 million &#32;on January 31, 2015 . Most orders are for delivery within the next 90 to 120 days, and although orders are subject to cancellation, we have not experienced significant cancellations in the past. The backlog at any particular time is affected by a number of factors, including seasonality, the continuing trend among customers to reduce the lead time on their orders, capacity shifts at foreign manufacturers and the volume of e-commerce drop ship orders that are received immediately rather than in advance. Accordingly, a comparison of backlog from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of eventual actual shipments or the growth rate of sales from one period to the next.
