 Item 1. Business 

&#160;

Corporate Overview 

&#160;

Elephant Talk Communications Corp. and its subsidiaries (also referred to as &#8220;Elephant Talk&#8221;, &#8220;ET&#8221; and &#8220;the Company&#8221;) provide mobile telecommunications technology.

&#160;

Our technology makes it quick and simple to setup a new mobile network or brand, or to reduce the costs of managing a legacy network. By deploying our platform, our customers are able to quickly go to market with a wide range of mobile-network services.

&#160;

Elephant Talk does this by offering a &#8216;single sign-on&#8217; cloud-service which includes Software as a Service (&#8220;SaaS&#8221;), Platform as a Service (&#8220;PaaS&#8221;), and even Infrastructure as a Service (&#8220;IaaS&#8221;). The mobile network, brand, or other enterprise customer, chooses the deployment and functionality to meet its needs.

&#160;

Elephant Talk also provides cloud-based authentication and voice-biometrics technology and services through its wholly owned subsidiary, ValidSoft UK Limited (&#8220;ValidSoft&#8221;).

&#160;

Elephant Talk is comprised of an experienced sales team, architects, software developers, implementation specialists and an operations team bringing turnkey mobile solutions to the telecommunications industry and to other enterprises that depend on communications.

&#160;

The Company deployed its first Mobile Virtual Network Operator (&#8220;MVNO&#8221;) platform for a major mobile network operator (&#8220;MNO&#8221;) in 2008 and has installed managed services platforms for clients globally. Individually, each of the managed services platform implementations has the capacity to support large numbers of subscribers and is capable of supporting multiple service brands through white label deployments.

&#160;

The Elephant Talk platform hosts integrated IT/Back Office and Core Network functionality for MNOs, MVNOs and Mobile Virtual Network Enablers and Aggregators (&#8220;MVNEs&#8221; and &#8220;MVNAs&#8221;) on a fully outsourced SaaS, PaaS and/or IaaS basis: made available either as an on-premise solution or as a fully hosted service in &#8216;the cloud&#8217; depending on the needs of our customers.

&#160;

Elephant Talk also delivers an Operational Support System (&#8220;OSS&#8221;) for channel partners, with Application Program Interfaces (&#8220;APIs&#8221;) for integration with third party systems, workflows for complex application orchestration, customer support with branded portals and plug-ins for a multitude of other applications. These features facilitate and improve the ability of our channel partners to provide support and to drive sales.

&#160;

Elephant Talk&#8217;s valuable intellectual property subsists in our proprietary technology, some of which is patented and patent-pending. We own and manage the source code for over two-thirds of our ET-BOSS&#8482; mobile network platform components, and we own all the source code in Business Support Systems and Operations Support Systems (&#8220;OSS&#8221;) elements within the platform, our industry expertise, in-depth industry knowledge and trade secrets. Our software and source code is in continuous development, and is copyright protected.

This is a key competitive and strategic advantage. It allows us to be autonomous with the ability modify and expand the platform capabilities.

&#160;

Overall Business Strategy 

&#160;

The Elephant Talk service-based business model is highly attractive for MNOs, MVNOS as well as other enterprise customers. Elephant Talk manages the hardware and develops and deploys the software. Elephant Talk configures, tests, launches, operates, supports, maintains and upgrades the platform, enabling carrier-grade reliability and service-availability delivered at a lower total cost of ownership (&#8220;TCO&#8221;) for set-up and operations than competitive solutions for comparable services.

&#160;

Elephant Talk&#8217;s technology enables clients to go to market quickly and reduces the complexity of network management and operations. Instead, everything is built on software, including operations and billing support, subscriber data management, online charging and rating of events and promotion of new services, as well as policy management and control &#8211; all of which are fully integrated and automated.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our platform today is focused on servicing traditional telecommunications markets (MNOs, MVNOs etc.), but we are moving towards a broader enterprise market, as well as hoping to maximize opportunities in machine-to-machine (&#8220;M2M&#8221;) and Internet-of-Things (&#8220;IoT&#8221;) markets as they grow.

&#160;

Elephant Talk also partners with point solution vendors to complement their own offerings and we facilitate and improve the ability of Communication Service Providers and their Channel Partners to sell to and support their end customers. For example, we can support a marketing company launching an application, a service provider adding retail subscribers, without their need for investment in costly infrastructure, or an enterprise looking to aggregate its wireless expenditures.

&#160;

While our strategy anticipates the transformation of the traditional communications markets with relatively &#8220;few&#8221; players (MNOs, MVNOs) to a more heterogeneous and diverse model with many (new) players (i.e. corporate becoming their own MVNOs and OTTs moving to offer regional / global communications services offerings), we continue to be focused on emerging opportunities short term which are:

&#160;

(i) De-regulation of markets in various parts of the world associated with the launch of new MVNOs. Elephant Talk has a proven track record of implementing world-class MVNE solutions to accelerate this business. &#160;

(ii) New, innovative approaches of (incumbent) MNOs to launch new services, i.e. second brands on more agile, cost efficient platform offerings with a fraction of cost and much higher speed to market compared to legacy implementations. Elephant Talk is able to ship a fully productive platform in less than four (4) months to any location in the world. &#160;

(iii) MNOs replacing costly, outdated, bespoke (custom) and complex legacy stacks, replacing it with modern, flexible, and virtualized software based architecture. &#160;

(iv) &#8220;Renaissance&#8221; of MVNO businesses in mature markets, where differentiation and capabilities realized through a full MVNE technology stack opens up significant new opportunities to compete with traditional MNOs. &#160;

Execution and Operational Focus of ET Business Strategy &#160;

Management&#8217;s attention is fully focused on its single sign on and application access (Saas, PaaS, and IaaS) platform, its scalability and flexibility while continuing to develop our sales, marketing, service, and support organization. Our geographical strategic focus is globally where we pursue a &#8220;hub &#38; spoke&#8221; model to leverage the advantages of cloud implementations. Often, we work with the support of local partners in each of those regions to ensure customer proximity and local presence and utilize software development centers in Asia where our Network Operations Center (&#8220;NOC&#8221;) is managed and monitored.

&#160;

Global Developments in Telecommunications Industries 

A number of relevant factors in the converging global telecommunications industries, along with the increasing adoption by consumers and businesses of mobile and wireless based applications, drive our investment in our platform and service. Mobile phones and tablets are already a preferred channel of communication and commerce for consumers and businesses that seek to offer personalized, contextual and relevant services. New entrants offering &#8216;over the top&#8217; applications or services that provide a product over the Internet and bypasses traditional distribution are competing with traditional MNOs, for example, are changing the traditional business model on voice revenues. The industry is moving to data and operators aim at taking advantage of existing investments to leverage assets through Voice over LTE (&#8220;VoLTE&#8221;) as an example.

Global developments in Cyber Security and Fraud Prevention 

The solutions from ValidSoft are designed to combat electronic fraud and enhance cyber security across all payment channels. According to industry leaders such as Symantec Corp. and McAfee Inc., which both sell software to protect computers from hackers, theft of intellectual property costs American companies $250 billion a year. McAfee estimates that the global cost of cybercrime is $1 trillion per annum. Utilizing the ValidSoft solutions and technology enables companies to tackle this endemic problem, reducing fraud, and operating costs while improving the customer experience.

&#160;

ValidSoft entered into a strategic partnering agreement with FICO, the leading company providing analytics and decision making services, in late 2011, for the provision of its solutions relating to SIM Swap fraud protection, false positive prevention, and strong authentication. FICO has an enviable commercial relationship with the largest worldwide issuing banks, and opens up a target market of over 5,000 institutions worldwide. FICO has been pressing ahead with the integration of the ValidSoft solutions into its client base and has already deployed with a leading UK bank for the provision of the ValidSoft SIM Swap technology.

&#160;

ValidSoft in 2015 simplified its branding by consolidating its mobile-device fraud-prevention technologies into a product family called Device Trust &#8482; and its multi-factor authentication and voice-biometrics platform into a solution called User Authentication &#8482;.

&#160;

MNO Telecommunications Markets 

&#160;

There are 800 MNOs in 220 countries, 992 MVNOs, and 260 sub-brands according to GSMA. In the future, we expect that many new market entrants will start offering mobile services to new and existing customers.

&#160;

Legacy telecoms and mobile networking infrastructure have not kept up with the other rapid technological changes. Voice revenues are declining while data revenues alone do not compensate completely for the loss yet. Current legacy telecommunications systems react too slowly to the needs of an agile, fast changing market, while demanding too much capital expenditure (&#8220;Capex&#8221;) to enable disruptive competition from incumbents, or new market entrants.

&#160;

Due to the fast growing demand for data services and increasing competitive and regulatory pressure, along with an increasing cost base, and declining Average Revenue per User (&#8220;ARPU&#8221;) and margins, MNOs are also faced with the challenge of rationalizing their cost base, and can do so by streamlining the way they conduct business in three main areas of operation:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Radio Access Network (&#8220;RAN&#8221;) and Core Network: As all vendors in this domain have access to the same patent pools, driven by the standardization of technologies, each vendor provides almost interchangeable products and services. Because of this, MNOs can outsource this part of their operation to one or a combination of vendors relatively easily. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; Sales, Marketing, Distribution and Channel Management: Most MNOs are trying to rationalize this part of their business, by recognizing the fact that one single brand usually cannot fit all specific market demand in all market segments. Therefore, many MNOs are launching secondary brands, co-branding with well-established consumer brands, and are partnering with a variety of channel partners, or contracting with a third parties, for example MVNOs. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; Service Control, Real-time Rating, Billing and IT/Back Office: MNOs are required to manage, deploy, support, bill and collect payment for any specific service to wholesale and individual customers. There are few standards in this area, and there are no overall patent pools to which vendors and suppliers have common access. Many suppliers are offering their services mostly aimed at a very specific and limited part of an overall required solution. Due to this fragmentation, most MNOs currently have dozens of suppliers serving them. Due to the absence of coordination, lack of overall design, and interfacing and processing standards, most MNOs currently have 20 to 40 different operating and mediation platforms in their IT/Back Office. These platforms seldom communicate efficiently with each other, resulting in platforms operating in isolated silos. This undermines management and service provisioning flexibility needed by MNOs to address a changing market. In the meantime costs increase due to these complex structures and interdependencies. As each of these vendors and suppliers usually retains source code on their own solution (thereby preventing any competitor from controlling their software and equipment), it is virtually impossible for MNOs to fully outsource this whole area to a single vendor or supplier. Some MNOs have tried to relieve their management and performance headaches by outsourcing management of the whole or parts of their IT/Back Office systems to large system integrators, displacing the issue and usually at a steep cost. Elephant Talk&#180;s comprehensive platform, encompassing the overall needs of an MNO, has proven to be an effective solution to this problem. We believe we are well positioned to become a preferred outsourcing partner for a growing number of MNOs that want to combine a flexible, outsourced, single platform solution that could result in higher service level standards and lower operating costs. &#160;

MVNO Telecommunications Markets 

&#160;

By Informa 2 &#160;

Informa expects the global MVNO market will reach 270 million subscriptions by the end of 2018 with North America and Western Europe accounting for the vast majority. These two regions will remain the largest MVNO markets in terms of the number of subscriptions and players and will also continue to top the ranks in terms of MVNO penetration.

&#160;

2 Extract Global MVNO Forecast to 2018, &#169; 2013 Informa Telecom &#38; Media, Publication

&#160;

By GSMA Intelligence 3 &#160;

Early 2015, the world&#8217;s MNOs hosted 992 MVNOs and 260 MNO sub-brands. This represents a total of more than 1,250 mobile service providers worldwide hosted by MNOs, in addition to the MNO&#8217;s own core brands. GSMA research shows that MVNOs remain most prevalent in mature markets where penetration (based on connections) has surpassed 100%. Europe is home to two thirds of domestic MVNOs (585), followed by Asia Pacific (129) and Northern America (107). By contrast, the MVNO sector remains in its infancy in Sub-Saharan African markets with just eight MVNOs across the region. &#8216;International&#8217; MVNOs, those that target roamers and thus operate across multiple markets, make up 10% of global MVNOs. 

&#160;

&#160;

Established MVNO markets 

In Western Europe, the fastest-growing MVNO markets are Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands. Germany and the Netherlands have been the largest MVNO markets (in terms of the number of MVNOs) for many years, and this is not expected to change over the foreseeable future, especially as both markets are regarded as good testing grounds for MVNO&#8217;s looking to trial new business models. Due to aggressive pricing from MNOs to avoid losing market share, there is substantial pressure on these MVNO markets. In due course only larger, established MVNO&#8217;s and niche market participants may survive in the competitive market. This market development is the main reason why Elephant Talk is focused on the MNO outsourcing market.

&#160;

MVNOs in Emerging Markets 

Emerging markets are expected to introduce a greater number of MVNOs in the future. MVNOs are expected to move or grow into markets in Brazil, Chile, Central America and other Latin American countries. Turkey, the Middle East, India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Africa and India also present an attractive opportunity for MVNOs. There are still a number of obstacles impacting MVNO development in these markets including a lack of cooperation from MNOs and a lack of regulation to facilitate new MVNO entrants. The Company expects the majority of new MVNO markets to be relatively small and have limited impact on global MVNO connections and revenues. In markets where changes in regulation may be imminent, market opportunities may increase.

&#160;

MVNO Revenues 

Managed services are increasing at a compounded annual growth rate of 12.5% to $194 billion by 2019. OTT and video revenues are expected exceed $50 billion by 2020 according to Light Reading. Currently, Western Europe and the U.S. account for approximately 80% of global MVNO revenues.

&#160;

Technological Execution of Strategy 

&#160;

Elephant Talk is one of a few vendors that offer a fully integrated OSS/BSS/Core Network platform, providing end-to-end solutions including a fully managed services component. We enable customers to go to market quickly with new services (i.e. a prepaid product in a market, or an MVNE platform for MVNOs), with reduced complexity of network and IT infrastructure, little upfront cost and managed by a third party. Elephant Talk offers strategic partnerships under which customers can &#8220;own and drive&#8221; the platform to their needs, depending on each customer&#8217;s strategy and preference. We can deploy a full, on-site hardware installation on the customer&#180;s premise or run the platform in a &#8220;spoke&#8221; mode from our cloud architecture. We offer flexibility to serve different &#8220;use cases&#8221; depending on what our customers need to be successful in their markets.

&#160;

Elephant Talk owns most of the required software. Therefore, as platform elements move away from specific hardware to software we are well positioned to make transitions quickly and seamlessly and sustain any future market price fluctuations as the majority of investments have already been incurred.

Intellectual Property, Products, Research and Development 

&#160;

Elephant Talk&#8217;s intellectual property (&#8220;IP&#8221;) subsists in our technology, our industry expertise, knowledge and trade secrets, all combined in our ET-BOSS&#8482; mobile network platform and services with new IP being developed, granted and pending. Our software, source codes and licenses are proprietary and in continuous development and are protected by international copyright. Elephant Talk has created a dedicated &#8220;architecture&#8221; function in its organization during 2015 to have a stronger focus on the markets needs to provide thought leadership on the platform and to prioritize investments to ensure we keep our competitive advantage in the market. Also, we have started to productize our offering to simplify our portfolio and to more easily target market demand with &#8220;out of the box&#8221; offerings.

&#160;

Elephant Talk has a patent granted for an important function of its mobile telecommunications platform, concerning the migration of subscribers from one MNO to another without requiring a physical SIM swap, which is achieved using the Authentication Server/Proxy function of the original MNO. As more and more MNOs converge and merge, this technical method is likely to be used by major MNOs, as well being used by MVNOs migrating to our platform. The patent has been granted in the UK and is pending as a result of a Patent Cooperation Treaty application in the US and Europe.

&#160;

Elephant Talk has ownership of and copyright protection in almost all key components in our software solutions as well as a number of registered trademarks in the EU and U.S.

&#160;

Since the acquisition of ValidSoft by Elephant Talk in 2010, ValidSoft has submitted new patent applications for transaction security technologies, principally in the UK, the EU and US jurisdictions. In addition, ValidSoft extended its patent for its core authentication solution in the United Kingdom, which will be effective until 2023.

&#160;

In 2014, ValidSoft filed five new patent applications for inventions in the fields of voice-biometrics, strong authentication and transaction security. Moreover, in July/August 2014, two of ValidSoft&#8217;s patent applications were granted, in Russia, for location-correlation technology.

&#160;

In 2015, ValidSoft filed five new patent applications and had three patents granted in the UK two of which were for call-forwarding fraud detection and one for location-based correlation for fraud prevention.

&#160;

As with ValidSoft&#8217;s other existing patent applications, pursuant to the Patent Co-operation Treaty, ValidSoft will seek patent coverage in major relevant territories such as the UK, EU and USA ValidSoft has a number of additional inventions in the fields of fraud-prevention, biometrics and security that it expects to submit patent applications for during 2016.

&#160;

ValidSoft and Elephant Talk have also registered a number of trademarks in the EU and US. ValidSoft has registered trademarks for, inter alia, ValidSoft&#174;, VALid&#174;, VALid-SSD&#174; and SMART&#174;. Elephant Talk has registered trademarks for, inter alia, Elephant Talk&#174;. Trademarks do not have expiration/duration, however, in certain jurisdictions (i.e. US), the registered trademarks must be renewed every ten years, for another ten years.

&#160;

ValidSoft owns all the proprietary copyright-protected source code used in its solutions and its library has grown significantly in the last two years.

&#160;

European Privacy Seals 

&#160;

One of the most significant barriers to market-entry in authentication and security solutions, particularly those using biometric and location-based data, is privacy and data protection. We have turned this threat into an opportunity and strength by investing in the EuroPriSe system. EuroPriSe is a voluntary audit and, if successful, certification of a technology solution, which tests the solution against the strictest possible European data protection standards. The EuroPriSe audit and certification is carried out by world-leading experts in technology and data protection. ValidSoft now has four European Privacy Seals awarded for Device Trust, User Authentication and Voice Biometric solutions.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Elephant Talk is positioned as a cloud-based pre-integrated platform provider delivering on-demand SaaS and PaaS managed services, integration, and cloud infrastructure. The Company faces competition from network infrastructure vendors, software solution vendors and niche on-demand SaaS and PaaS operators/managed service providers.

&#160;

Management believes that Elephant Talk has technology that is competitive and that will keep pace with imminent and future industry requirements. As the industry requirements go beyond current defined standards, each vendor will need to develop, buy (or license) software elements, then integrate, test and fine-tune these components. This is a massive deployment for a major MNO or other customer type. Our management believes that Elephant Talk has accrued valuable experience in this respect and has the flexibility to adjust accordingly to future market fluctuations.

&#160;

We may need to accelerate the roll-out of our solutions to meet market demand. Telecommunications platforms and services will become more commoditized over the next five to ten years. Integrating ValidSoft&#8217;s security components into our platform will create an additional competitive advantage. The proposed divestiture agreement with ValidSoft provides the Company with a perpetual, royalty-free license to ValidSoft&#8217;s Device Trust&#8482; and User Authentication&#8482; solutions, including the right to incorporate such technologies into our mobile telecommunications-cloud platform and the right to resell such technologies through its platform.

&#160;

The more we can offer a comprehensive one stop shop solution for providing managed telecommunications services and, as required, layered security for mission critical applications in the cloud, the more sustainable our advantages will be against multiple-point solutions and the additional integration and operations complexities they represent. As depth and breadth of solutions are important in addressing the one-stop-shop needs of our customers, a whole range of services should be kept under one roof. Elephant Talk may need to further invest in such services in the future, either with additional in-house development or through acquisitions.

&#160;

Corporate History 

&#160; 

Elephant Talk Communications, Inc., a California corporation (&#8220;Elephant Talk Inc.&#8221;) was formed in 2001 as a result of a merger between Staruni Corporation (USA, 1962) and Elephant Talk Limited (Hong Kong, 1994) (&#8220;ETL&#8221;). Staruni Corporation, formerly named Altius Corporation, Inc., until 1997, was a web and internet services provider from 1997, following its acquisition of Starnet Universe Internet Inc. ETL began operating in 1994 as an international long distance services provider, specializing in international call termination in China. In 2006, Elephant Talk pivoted away from this international calling business.

&#160;

In 2000, securities of Staruni Corporation commenced trading on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol &#8220;SRUN&#8221;, later replaced by &#8220;ETLK&#8221; following the merger with ETL, and then the symbol changed to &#8220;ETAK&#8221; contemporaneously with a 2008 stock-split.

&#160;

In January 2007, through our acquisition of Benoit Telecom (Switzerland), we established a foothold in the European telecommunications market, particularly within the market for Service Numbers (Premium Rate Services and Toll Free Services), and to a lesser extent, Carrier (Pre) Select Services. This background provided experience and expertise in telecom and multimedia systems, telecom regulations and European markets.

&#160;

In March 2010, Elephant Talk Inc. acquired ValidSoft.

&#160;

In December 2011, we upgraded from our OTCBB listing to the NYSE MKT LLC (the &#8220;Exchange&#8221;).

&#160;

In September 2011, Elephant Talk Inc. merged into Elephant Talk Communications Corp., a Delaware corporation (the &#8220;Reincorporation&#8221;). The Reincorporation was approved by the stockholders at the annual shareholder meeting on September 14, 2011. As a result of the Reincorporation, the Company became a Delaware corporation. Elephant Talk Communications, Inc. ceased its corporate existence and Elephant Talk Communications Corp. became the surviving corporation and continued to operate the business of the Company as it existed prior to the Reincorporation.

&#160;

In April 2013, the Company acquired most of the assets of Telnicity, a U.S. MVNE/MVNO enabler company headquartered in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and formed Elephant Talk North America. The Telnicity acquisition sought to provide the Company with an in-market management team with a view to leveraging existing relationships with certain major U.S. mobile telecommunications companies.

&#160;

In October 2015, Elephant Talk announced the retention of an advisor to the Special Committee of the Board of Directors in connection with the previously announced plan to evaluate strategic alternatives designed to maximize stockholders value with respect to its wholly owned subsidiary, ValidSoft.

&#160;

On March 22, 2016, ET provided Cross River Initiatives LLC (the &#8220;Buyer&#8221;) with a notice of default on the Binding Letter Agreement dated February 17, 2016 (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) between the Buyer and the Company concerning the proposed purchase of ValidSoft and governing certain important matters relating to the interim financing of ValidSoft&#8217;s business and operations. While the Company will not totally foreclose consummating the ValidSoft sale transaction with the Buyer as originally contemplated, the Company will no longer give preference or exclusivity to the Buyer.

Government Regulation 

&#160;

We and our customers operate in a heavily regulated industry. As a multinational telecommunications company and provider of services to carriers and operators, we are directly and indirectly subject to varying degrees of regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which we provide our services. Local laws and regulations, and the interpretation of such laws and regulations, differ significantly among the jurisdictions in which we operate. Enforcement and interpretations of these laws and regulations can be unpredictable and are often subject to the informal views of government officials. Certain European, foreign, federal, and state regulations and local franchise requirements have been, are currently, and may in the future be, the subject of judicial proceedings, legislative hearings and administrative proposals. Such proceedings may relate to, among other things, the rates we may charge for our local, network access and other services, the manner in which the Company offers and bundle our services, the terms and conditions of interconnection, unbundled network elements and resale rates, and could change the manner in which telecommunications companies operate. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or the impact they will have on our business, our revenue and our cash flow.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we employed 218 people and retained on a long term basis, the services of 35 independent contractors. Following the Company&#8217;s restructuring plan we anticipate further reductions in headcount of around 35 during the first quarter of 2016. Furthermore, in case the Company is successful in divesting its ValidSoft activities a further headcount reduction of approximately 25 will be the result.

&#160;

Each of our employees and independent contractors is bound by confidentiality and non-competition obligations. Our Spanish employees are represented by a work council and subject to a certain type of collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good.

&#160;
