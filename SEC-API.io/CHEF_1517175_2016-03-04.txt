 Item 1. BUSINESS &#160;

We are a premier distributor of specialty food products in the United States and Canada. We are focused on serving the specific needs of chefs who own and/or operate some of the leading menu-driven independent restaurants, fine dining establishments, country clubs, hotels, caterers, culinary schools, bakeries, patisseries, chocolatiers, cruise lines, casinos and specialty food stores in the United States and Canada. We believe that we have a distinct competitive advantage in serving these customers as a result of our extensive selection of distinctive and hard-to-find specialty and center-of-the-plate food products, our product knowledge and our customer service.

&#160;

We define specialty food products as gourmet foods and ingredients that are of the highest grade, quality or style as measured by their uniqueness, exotic origin or particular processing method. Our product portfolio includes over 34,000 stock-keeping units (&#8220;SKUs&#8221;) from more than 1,700 different suppliers and is comprised primarily of imported and domestic specialty food products, such as artisan charcuterie, specialty cheeses, unique oils and vinegars, truffles, caviar, chocolate and pastry products. We also offer an extensive line of center-of-the-plate products, including custom cut beef, seafood and hormone-free poultry, as well as broadline food products, such as cooking oils, butter, eggs, milk and flour. When marketing our products to our customers, we focus our efforts on chefs, and we believe that, by offering a wide selection of both distinctive and hard-to-find products, together with center-of-the-plate proteins and staple broadline food products, we are able to differentiate ourselves from larger, traditional broadline foodservice distributors, while simultaneously enabling our customers to utilize us as their primary foodservice distributor. Additionally, as a result of our acquisition of Allen Brothers in December 2013, we market certain of our center-of-the-plate products directly to consumers through a mail and e-commerce platform.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Since the formation of our predecessor in 1985, we have expanded our distribution network, product selection and customer base both organically and through acquisitions. From December 30, 2011 to December 25, 2015, our net revenues increased from approximately $401 million to approximately $1,059 million. During these periods and in prior years, our sales to both new and existing customers have increased as a result of an increase in the breadth and depth of our product portfolio, our commitment to customer service, the efforts of our experienced and sophisticated sales professionals, the increased use of technology in the operations and management of our business and our ongoing consolidation of the fragmented specialty foodservice distribution industry. Since April 2012, we have completed seven acquisitions which have increased our penetration in existing markets, expanded our footprint into new markets and/or enhanced our product capabilities. The up-front cash purchase prices for these seven acquisitions ranged from $2.0 million to $123.9 million, resulting in aggregate up-front cash consideration of more than $275.0 million, which we funded with borrowings under our existing senior secured credit facilities, a portion of which we repaid with proceeds from the issuance of $125.0 million of senior secured notes in April 2013 and April 2015, and the proceeds of our common stock offering completed in September 2013.

&#160;

Excluding our direct-to-consumer business, we currently serve more than 26,000 customer locations in our fifteen primary geographic markets across the United States and Canada, including New York, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Miami, Portland, Seattle, Columbus, Cincinnati, Chicago, Sacramento, Vancouver, Edmonton and Toronto. By leveraging an experienced and sophisticated sales force of approximately 416 sales and customer service professionals, we maintain collaborative relationships with thousands of chefs while also acting as a critical marketing arm and route-to-market for many of our suppliers. We operate 25 distribution centers and provide service six days a week in many of our service areas, utilizing our fleet of delivery trucks to fill our customers&#8217; orders.

&#160;

Competitive Strengths 

&#160;

We believe that, during our over 30-year history, we have achieved, developed and/or refined the following strengths which provide us with a distinct competitive position in the foodservice distribution industry and also the opportunity to achieve superior margins relative to most large broadline foodservice distributors:

&#160;

Leading Distributor of Specialty Food Products in Many of the Key Culinary Markets. Based on our management&#8217;s industry knowledge and experience, we believe we are the largest distributor of specialty food products, as measured by net sales, in the New York, Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Los Angeles metropolitan markets. We believe these markets, along with a number of other markets we serve, including Las Vegas, Miami, Philadelphia, Boston, Napa Valley, Portland, Seattle, Chicago, Cincinnati, Vancouver and Toronto, create and set the culinary trends for the rest of the United States and Canada and provide us with valuable insight into the latest culinary and menu practices. Furthermore, we believe our established relationships with many of the top chefs, culinary schools and dining establishments in these key culinary markets have benefited us when we entered into new markets where we believe that chefs at our potential customers were generally knowledgeable of our brand and commitment to quality and excellence from their experience working in other markets which we serve or through their personal relationships throughout the culinary industry.

&#160;

Expansive Product Offering. We offer an extensive portfolio of high-quality specialty food products, ranging from basic ingredients and staples, such as milk and flour, to custom cut steaks and seafood and pastries, as well as delicacies and specialty ingredients sourced from North America, Europe, Asia and South America, which we believe helps our customers distinguish their menu items. We carry more than 34,000 SKUs and we constantly evaluate our portfolio and introduce new products to address regional trends and preferences and ensure that we are on the leading edge of broader culinary trends. Through our importing division, we provide our customers with access to a portfolio of exclusive items, including regional olive oils, truffles and charcuterie from Italy, Spain, France and other Mediterranean countries. In addition, and as evidence of our commitment to aid our customers in creating unique and innovative menu items, we regularly utilize our sourcing relationships and industry insights to procure additional products that we do not regularly carry but that our customers specifically request. We believe that the breadth and depth of our product portfolio facilitates our customers&#8217; ability to distinguish and enhance their menu offerings and differentiates us from larger traditional broadline foodservice distributors. For example, we provide a selection of more than 200 different varieties of olive oil, while large broadline foodservice distributors only carry, on average, 5-10 types of olive oil.

&#160;

Critical Route-to-Market for Specialty Food Suppliers. We currently distribute products from more than 1,700 different suppliers. Our suppliers are located throughout North America, Europe, Asia and South America and include numerous small, family-owned entities and artisanal food producers. We are the largest customer for many of our suppliers. As a result, our experienced and sophisticated sales professionals, customer relationships and distribution platform are important to these suppliers&#8217; route-to-market, which enables us to offer a wide range of products on an exclusive basis.

&#160;

Expanding Base of Premier Customer Relationships. Our breadth and depth of product offerings coupled with our highly regarded customer service has allowed us to develop and retain a loyal customer base that is comprised of chefs who own or work at more than 26,000 of the nation&#8217;s leading menu-driven independent restaurants, fine dining establishments, country clubs, hotels, caterers, culinary schools, bakeries, patisseries, chocolatiers, cruise lines, casinos and specialty food stores. Our focus on product selection, product knowledge and customer service has rewarded us with a number of long-term customer relationships, which often begin when chefs are introduced to us while attending the nation&#8217;s leading culinary schools, including The Culinary Institute of America and The French Culinary Institute, both of which have been customers of ours for more than eight years. Based on our management&#8217;s industry experience and our relationships and dealings with our customers, we believe we are the primary distributor of specialty food products to the majority of our customers that are not part of our direct-to-consumer center-of-the-plate business.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Collaborative Professional and Educational Relationships with our Customers. We employ a sophisticated and experienced sales force of approximately 400 sales and customer service professionals, a significant number of whom have formal culinary training, degrees in the culinary arts or prior experience working in the culinary industry. Equipped with advanced culinary and industry knowledge, our sales professionals seek to establish a rapport with our customers&#8217; chefs, so that they can more fully understand and anticipate the needs of and offer cost-effective food product solutions to the chefs who own or operate these businesses. We believe that the specialized knowledge base of our sales professionals enables us to take a more collaborative and educational approach to selling our gourmet foods and ingredients and to further differentiate ourselves from our traditional broadline competitors.

&#160;

Expertise in Logistics and Distribution. We have built a first-class, scalable inventory management and logistics platform that enables us to efficiently fill our customers&#8217; orders and to profitably meet our customers&#8217; needs for varying drop sizes, high service levels and timely delivery. Our average distribution service level, or the percentage of in-stock items ordered by customers that are not part of our direct-to-consumer center-of-the-plate business that were delivered by the requested date, was in excess of 97% in 2015, which we believe is among the highest rates in the foodservice distribution industry. With 25 distribution centers located throughout the United States and Canada, we are able to leverage our geographic footprint and reduce our inbound freight costs. This scale enables us to maintain a portfolio of more than 34,000 SKUs, and through the operation of our sophisticated information technology, inventory management and logistics systems, we believe we provide our customers with some of the highest levels of customer service and responsiveness in our industry.

&#160;

Experienced and Proven Management Team. Our senior management team has demonstrated the ability to grow the business through various economic environments. With collective experience of more than 90 years at The Chefs&#8217; Warehouse, its predecessor and other foodservice distribution companies, our founders and senior management are experienced operators and are passionate about our future. Our senior management team is comprised of our founders, as well as experienced professionals with expertise in the foodservice distribution industry and in a wide range of functional areas, including finance and accounting, sales and marketing, operations, information technology, legal and human resources.

&#160;

Our Growth Strategies 

&#160;

We believe substantial organic growth opportunities exist in our current markets through increased penetration of our existing customers and the addition of new customers, and we have identified new markets that we believe also present opportunities for future expansion. Key elements of our growth strategy include the following:

&#160;

Increase Penetration with Existing Customers. We intend to sell more products to our existing customers by increasing the breadth and depth of our product selection and increasing the efficiency of our sales professionals, while at the same time continuing to provide excellent customer service. We are a data-driven and goal-oriented organization, and our management and sales professionals are highly focused on our weekly sales and gross profit contribution from each of our non-direct-to-consumer customers and increasing the number of unique products we distribute to such customers. We believe our acquisition activity since our initial public offering reflects this focus, as we have sought to complement our existing product offerings and enhance our product capabilities through our April 2015 acquisition of Del Monte, a supplier of high quality, USDA inspected beef, pork, lamb, veal, poultry and seafood products, our October 2014 acquisition of Euro Gourmet Inc. (&#8220;Euro Gourmet&#8221;), a wholesale specialty distributor of imported and domestic products, our December 2013 acquisition of Allen Brothers, a leading processor and distributor of premium quality meats, our May 2013 acquisition of Qzina Specialty Foods North America Inc. (&#8220;Qzina&#8221;), a leading supplier of gourmet chocolate, dessert and pastry products, and our August 2012 acquisition of Michael&#8217;s, a specialty protein distributor which specializes in custom cut beef, seafood and other center-of-the-plate products.

&#160;

Expand our Customer Base Within our Existing Markets. As of December 25, 2015, we served more than 26,000 customer locations, excluding our direct-to-consumer business, in the United States and Canada. We plan to expand our market share in the fragmented specialty food distribution industry by cultivating new customer relationships within our existing markets through the continued penetration of menu-driven independent restaurants, fine dining establishments, country clubs, hotels, caterers, culinary schools, bakeries, patisseries, chocolatiers, cruise lines, casinos and specialty food stores. We believe we have the opportunity to continue to gain market share in our existing markets by offering an extensive selection of specialty food products, as well as center-of-the-plate proteins and traditional broadline staple food products through our unique, collaborative and educational sales efforts and efficient, scalable distribution solution.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Improve our Operating Margins. As we continue to grow, we believe that the investments we are making in our inventory management and logistics platform, along with improved efficiencies that we are working to achieve in our general and administrative functions, should yield both improved customer service and profitability. Utilizing our fleet of delivery trucks, we usually fill customer orders within 12-24 hours of order placement. We intend to continue to offer our customers this high level of customer service, while maintaining our focus on realizing efficiencies and economies of scale in purchasing, warehousing, distribution and general and administrative functions which, when combined with incremental fixed-cost leverage, we believe will lead to continued improvements in our operating margin over time.

&#160;

Pursue Selective Acquisitions. Throughout our over 30-year history, we have successfully identified, consummated and integrated multiple strategic acquisitions, which were designed to increase our penetration in existing markets, expand our footprint into new markets and/or enhance our product capabilities. We believe that, over time, we will be able to improve the operations and overall profitability of each acquired company by leveraging our sourcing relationships to provide an expanded product portfolio, implementing our tested sales force training techniques and metrics and installing improved warehouse management and information systems. We believe we have the opportunity to capitalize on our existing infrastructure and expertise by continuing to selectively pursue opportunistic acquisitions in order to expand the breadth of our distribution network, increase our operating efficiency and add additional products and capabilities. Since our initial public offering (&#8220;IPO&#8221;), we have completed seven acquisitions which have increased our penetration in existing markets, expanded our footprint into new markets and enhanced our product capabilities. During fiscal 2014 we implemented an &#8220;integration team&#8221; that is dedicated to onboarding new acquisitions as quickly and efficiently as possible. We expect the integration team to help streamline the acquisition process and anticipate that it will enable us to achieve expected benefits and synergies more quickly. Having a team dedicated to integration will help us make sure the people, processes and products we add through acquisitions are consistent with the rest of our business and will allow our management team to focus its attention on our day-to-day operations.

&#160;

Our Markets and the Customers that We Serve 

&#160;

Excluding our direct-to-consumer business, we distribute our specialty food products to over 26,000 distinct customer locations from distribution centers located in our primary markets, which include New York, Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Miami, Portland, Seattle, Columbus, Cincinnati, Chicago, Vancouver, Edmonton and Toronto. We also serve customers in a number of other markets, including Philadelphia, Boston and Napa Valley. We believe that many of these markets set the culinary trends for the rest of the United States and Canada and provide us with valuable insight into the latest culinary and menu trends. We have established collaborative professional and educational relationships with some of the United States&#8217; and Canada&#8217;s most demanding chefs, which allows us to anticipate the needs of, and offer cost-effective food product solutions to, our customers while allowing our customers to locate ingredients that will enable them to create unique and differentiated menu items. Our target customers include menu-driven independent restaurants, fine dining establishments, country clubs, hotels, caterers, culinary schools, bakeries, patisseries, chocolatiers, cruise lines, casinos and specialty food stores. We have no meaningful customer concentration as our top ten customers accounted for less than 12% of total net sales for our 2015 fiscal year. 

&#160;

Additionally, as a result of our acquisition of Allen Brothers in December 2013, we have also begun to market certain of our center-of-the-plate proteins directly to consumers through a mail and e-commerce platform.

&#160;

Set forth below is a breakdown of the primary geographic markets we serve and the year we entered each market:

&#160;

MARKET NAME &#160; GEOGRAPHIES SERVED &#160; YEAR ENTERED New York &#160; Boston to Atlantic City &#160; 1985 Washington, D.C. &#160; Philadelphia to Richmond &#160; 1999 Los Angeles &#160; Santa Barbara to San Diego &#160; 2005 San Francisco &#160; Napa Valley to Monterey Bay &#160; 2005 Las Vegas &#160; Las Vegas &#160; 2005 Miami &#160; Miami &#160; 2010 Portland &#160; Bend, OR to Seattle, WA &#160; 2011 Columbus &#160; Midwest &#160; 2012 Cincinnati &#160; Dayton, OH to Lexington, KY &#160; 2013 Chicago &#160; Chicago &#160; 2013 Vancouver &#160; Vancouver and Western Canada &#160; 2013 Edmonton &#160; Edmonton and Calgary &#160; 2013 Toronto &#160; Toronto &#160; 2013 Seattle &#160; Seattle &#160; 2013 Sacramento &#160; Sacramento &#160; 2015 &#160;

We extend credit to virtually all of our non-direct-to-consumer customers on varying terms. Most of our customers have payment terms from 20-60 days. We complete a formal credit assessment of all new non-direct-to-consumer customers, and our Credit and Collections Department regularly evaluates credit terms for each such customer based upon several factors, including order frequency, average order size, the types of products purchased and the length of the relationship. We believe that we are skilled at managing customer credit.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Our Specialty Food Products 

&#160;

We strive to be the primary food source solution for our customers, and, to this end, we offer our customers a comprehensive product portfolio that ranges from basic ingredients and staples, such as milk and flour, to custom-cut steaks and seafood and pastries, as well as delicacies and specialty ingredients sourced from North America, Europe, Asia and South America. We carry more than 34,000 SKUs and we are fully committed to utilizing our sourcing relationships and industry insights to procure products that we do not regularly carry but that our customers specifically request as they seek to create unique and innovative menu items.

&#160;

The sales mix for the principal product categories for each of the 2015, 2014 and 2013 fiscal years is as follows (dollars in thousands):

&#160;

&#160; &#160; December 25, 2015 &#160; December 26, 2014 &#160; December 27, 2013 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Center of Plate &#160; $ 497,378 &#160; &#160; &#160; 47 % &#160; $ 311,336 &#160; &#160; &#160; 37 % &#160; $ 214,004 &#160; &#160; &#160; 32 % Dry Goods &#160; &#160; 186,119 &#160; &#160; &#160; 18 % &#160; &#160; 169,933 &#160; &#160; &#160; 20 % &#160; &#160; 144,591 &#160; &#160; &#160; 22 % Pastries and other Bakery Products &#160; &#160; 143,806 &#160; &#160; &#160; 14 % &#160; &#160; 140,865 &#160; &#160; &#160; 17 % &#160; &#160; 118,876 &#160; &#160; &#160; 18 % Cheeses &#160; &#160; 88,589 &#160; &#160; &#160; 8 % &#160; &#160; 83,065 &#160; &#160; &#160; 10 % &#160; &#160; 76,400 &#160; &#160; &#160; 11 % Dairy Products &#160; &#160; 67,530 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 % &#160; &#160; 58,148 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7 % &#160; &#160; 47,545 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7 % Oils and Vinegars &#160; &#160; 58,245 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 % &#160; &#160; 56,859 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7 % &#160; &#160; 55,736 &#160; &#160; &#160; 8 % Kitchen Supplies &#160; &#160; 17,329 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 % &#160; &#160; 16,419 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 % &#160; &#160; 16,393 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2 % Total &#160; $ 1,058,996 &#160; &#160; &#160; 100 % &#160; $ 836,625 &#160; &#160; &#160; 100 % &#160; $ 673,545 &#160; &#160; &#160; 100 % &#160;

We continuously evaluate potential additions to our product portfolio based on both existing and anticipated trends in the culinary industry. Our buyers have numerous contacts with suppliers throughout North America, Europe, Asia and South America and are always looking for new and interesting products that will aid our customers as they seek to keep up with the latest developments in the culinary industry. Our ability to successfully distribute a significant portion of the total production of smaller, regional and artisanal specialty food producers allows us the opportunity to be these producers&#8217; primary route-to-market in our markets without, in most cases, requiring us to make contractual commitments regarding guaranteed volume. We are also able to utilize our size and successful track record of distributing products sourced from outside the United States and Canada to resist efforts from many of our foreign suppliers to push importing costs off onto us.

&#160;

We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by offering a more extensive depth and breadth of specialty products. We carry a wide range of high-quality specialty food products, including artisan charcuterie, specialty cheeses, unique oils and vinegars, truffles, caviar, chocolate and pastry products across each of our markets, but we also offer a number of items in each of our respective markets that are tailored to meet the unique preferences of the individual chefs in that market. We regularly rotate our inventory to identify and bring to market new products that will continue to support our value proposition.

&#160;

Within our product offerings, we carry numerous gourmet brands, and at the same time, we seek to maximize product contribution through the sale of our proprietary brands, which we offer in a number of staple products, including bulk olive oil, Italian grating cheeses and butter. We believe that our ability to offer simultaneously high-quality specialty foods and ingredients, center-of-the-plate products and more traditional broadline staple food products provides our customers with foodservice distribution solutions that are efficient and cost effective.

&#160;

Our Sophisticated and Experienced Sales Professionals 

&#160;

We employ a sophisticated and experienced sales force of approximately 400 sales and customer service professionals focused on meeting our customers&#8217; goals and objectives, while concurrently educating them regarding our latest products and broader culinary trends. To ensure a high level of customer service, we seek to maintain a ratio of approximately one sales professional for every 67 of our customers, excluding our direct-to-consumer customers. Our sales force is composed of the following three distinct groups which are all focused on providing outstanding service to our customers:

&#160;

&#183; Outside Sales Associates: Responsible for identifying sales opportunities, educating customers and acting as our public representatives. &#160;

&#183; Inside Sales Associates: Responsible for processing customer orders and arranging for delivery and payment. &#160;

&#183; Product Specialists: Responsible for maintaining specialized product knowledge and educating our outside sales associates and customers regarding new products and general developments in several specific categories, including protein, seafood, pastry and cheese. &#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

A significant number of our sales professionals have formal culinary training, degrees in the culinary arts and/or prior experience working in the culinary industry. We strive to harness this culinary knowledge and passion for food and to concurrently promote an entrepreneurial working environment. Utilizing advanced pricing optimization software available to them on a real-time basis, our sales professionals are afforded flexibility to determine the pricing of individual items for our customers within a range of pricing options. The majority of our outside sales professionals are compensated on a commission basis, and their performance is measured primarily upon their gross profit dollars obtained. We have historically experienced low turnover among our seasoned sales professionals.

&#160;

Because we are highly focused on collaborating with our customers and educating them regarding our latest products and broader culinary trends, we view the ongoing education and training of our sales force as crucial to our continued success. To ensure that our sales professionals remain on the forefront of new culinary products and trends, we regularly hold &#8220;vendor shows&#8221; at our distribution centers, where our sales force is able to interact with vendors and learn more about the vendors&#8217; latest product offerings and the performance of these products relative to competitive offerings.

&#160;

Our Suppliers 

&#160;

We are committed to providing our customers with an unrivaled portfolio of specialty food products, as well as a comprehensive broadline product offering and center-of-the-plate products. To fulfill this commitment, we maintain strong sourcing relationships with numerous producers of high-quality artisan and regional specialty food products, as well as a wide range of broadline product suppliers and protein vendors. Our importing arm also provides us with access to exclusive items such as regional olive oils, truffles and charcuterie sourced from Italy, Spain, France and other Mediterranean countries.

&#160;

We constantly seek out and evaluate new products in order to satisfy our customers&#8217; desire to be at the forefront of the latest culinary and menu trends, and, as evidence of our commitment to aid our customers in creating unique and innovative menu items, we regularly utilize our sourcing relationships and industry insights to procure other products that we do not regularly carry but that our customers specifically request.

&#160;

We currently distribute products from more than 1,700 different suppliers. We carry multiple products and utilize multiple suppliers in all of our product categories, thereby eliminating our dependence upon any single supplier. Additionally, we seek to limit commodity risk by utilizing sophisticated forecasting and inventory management systems to minimize the inventory carrying time of commodity-oriented products and by leveraging the specialized product knowledge of our product specialists to manage purchasing and inventory levels when appropriate.

&#160;

Our Operations and Distribution Centers 

&#160;

Operating out of 25 distribution centers of varying size and providing service six days a week in many areas, we utilize our fleet of delivery trucks to fill customer orders, usually within 12-24 hours of order placement. Our average distribution service level, or the percentage of in-stock items ordered by customers that were delivered by the requested date, was in excess of 97% as of fiscal year ended December 25, 2015, which our management believes is among the highest in the foodservice distribution industry. To achieve these high service levels, we have invested significantly in sophisticated warehousing, inventory control and distribution systems, as described in more detail below.

&#160;

We have begun to implement pick-to-voice technology in each of our distribution facilities, which will enable our warehouse employees to fill orders with greater speed and accuracy.

&#160;

Products are delivered to our distribution centers primarily by contract carriers, the suppliers themselves and our fleet of trucks. We lease our trucks from national leasing companies and regional firms that offer competitive services. Customer orders are assembled in our distribution centers and then sorted, placed on pallets and loaded onto trucks and trailers in delivery sequence. The majority of our trucks and delivery trailers have multiple, temperature-controlled compartments that ensure all product is delivered to the customer at its optimal temperature.

&#160;

We employ advanced routing and logistics planning software, which maximizes the number of daily deliveries that each of our trucks can make, while also enabling us to typically make deliveries within each customer&#8217;s preferred 2-3 hour time window. For our direct-to-consumer business, we ship through nationally recognized couriers. We also use GPS and vehicle monitoring technology to regularly evaluate the condition of our delivery trucks and monitor the performance of our drivers, by tracking their progress relative to their delivery schedule and providing information regarding hard braking, idling and fast starts. Our use of this technology allows us to conduct proactive fleet maintenance, provide timely customer service and improve our risk management.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Our Technology Systems 

&#160;

We maintain an advanced information technology platform that enables us to manage our operations across our various markets, as we seek to drive our growth and profitability and ensure that the needs of our customers are met in an accurate and efficient manner. We have made significant investments in distribution, sales, information and warehouse management systems over the last seven years, and are in the process of implementing a fully-integrated ERP system. We are also in the process of implementing a fully integrated warehouse management system at some of our recently acquired distribution facilities. Our systems improvements include the implementation or enhancement of a web-based purchasing and advanced planning system that provides advanced forecasting and planning tools, vehicle monitoring and route optimization software and pick-to-voice and directed put-away systems. Over the last five years, we have also implemented an internally developed, web-based reporting tool which provides real-time sales, pricing and profitability analysis for our management and sales professionals. These improvements have been made in an effort to improve our efficiency, as we continue to grow our business. We believe that our current systems are scalable and can be leveraged to support our future growth.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Except for the Spoleto, Bel Aria, Grand Reserve, Provvista, Argonaut, Praml, Black Falls, Michael&#8217;s, Chocoa, Crescendo, Matisse, Qzina, Coccinelle, Allen Brothers, The Great Steakhouse Steaks, Del Monte and The Chefs&#8217; Warehouse trademarks, we do not own or have the right to use any patent, trademark, trade name, license, franchise or concession, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The foodservice distribution industry is highly competitive. We compete with numerous smaller distributors on a local level, as well as with a limited number of national broadline foodservice distributors. Certain of these distributors have greater financial and other resources than we do. Bidding for contracts or arrangements with customers, particularly larger hotels and caterers, is highly competitive and distributors may market their services to a particular customer over a long period of time before they are invited to bid. We believe that most purchasing decisions in the foodservice distribution industry are based upon the quality and price of the product distributed and the distributor&#8217;s ability to completely and accurately fill orders and deliver them in a timely manner.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 25, 2015, we had 1,693 full-time employees, 125 of whom currently operate under a collective bargaining agreement. This collective bargaining agreement expires in August 2017. We had 149, or 8.8%, of our employees (including the 125 who operate under a collective bargaining agreement) are represented by unions. We offer attractive compensation and benefit packages, and we believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory.

&#160;

Regulation 

&#160;

As a distributor of specialty food products and meat and seafood in the United States and Canada, we are subject to regulation by numerous international, federal, state, provincial and local regulatory agencies. For example, at the U.S. federal level, we are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Bioterrorism Act and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;). The FDA regulates manufacturing and holding requirements for foods, specifies the standards of identity for certain foods and prescribes the format and content of certain information required to appear on food product labels, among other responsibilities. For certain product lines, we are also subject to the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, the Country of Origin Labeling Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (&#8220;USDA&#8221;). The USDA imposes standards for product quality and sanitation, including the inspection and labeling of meat and poultry products and the grading and commercial acceptance of produce shipments from vendors. In January 2011, President Obama signed into law the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, which greatly expands the FDA&#8217;s authority over food safety, including giving the FDA power to order the recall of unsafe foods, increase inspections at food processing facilities, issue regulations regarding the sanitary transportation of food, enhance tracking and tracing requirements and order the detention of food that it has &#8220;reason to believe&#8221; is adulterated or misbranded, among other provisions. The products we distribute in Canada are also subject to regulation and inspection by Health Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Our suppliers are also subject to similar regulatory requirements and oversight. The failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in civil or criminal fines or penalties, product recalls, closure of facilities or operations, the loss or revocation of existing licenses, permits or approvals or the failure to obtain additional licenses, permits or approvals in new jurisdictions where we intend to do business.

&#160;

We are also subject to state and local regulation through such measures as the licensing of our facilities, enforcement by state and local health agencies of state and local standards for our products and facilities and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of products. Our facilities are generally inspected at least annually by federal and/or state authorities. These facilities are also subject to inspections and regulations issued pursuant to the Occupational Safety and Health Act by the U.S. Department of Labor, which require us to comply with certain manufacturing, health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents and to establish hazard communication programs to transmit information about the hazards of certain chemicals present in certain products that we distribute. Our Canadian warehouse, distribution facilities, repackaging activities and other operations also are subject to regulation and inspection by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and provincial health authorities.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Our trucking operations are regulated by the Surface Transportation Board, the Federal Highway Administration, Transport Canada and Canadian provincial transportation authorities. In addition, interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the U.S. Department of Transportation and other relevant federal and state agencies. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations. We believe that we are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements relating to our motor carrier operations. Our failure to comply with the applicable motor carrier regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits.

&#160;

Our operations are subject to a broad range of federal, state, provincial and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing discharges to air, soil and water, the handling and disposal of hazardous substances and the investigation and remediation of contamination resulting from releases of petroleum products and other hazardous substances.

&#160;

We believe that we are in material compliance with all international, federal, state, provincial and local regulations applicable to our operations, and management is unaware of any related issues that may have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.

&#160;

Litigation and Insurance 

&#160;

We may be subject to lawsuits, claims and assessments in the normal course of business. Our management does not believe that there are any suits, claims or unasserted claims or assessments pending which would have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition.

&#160;

We maintain comprehensive insurance packages with respect to our facilities, equipment, product liability, directors and officers, workers&#8217; compensation and employee matters in amounts which management believes to be prudent and customary within the foodservice distribution industry.

&#160;

Seasonality 

&#160;

Excluding our direct-to-consumer business, we generally do not experience any material seasonality. However, our sales and operating results may vary from quarter to quarter due to factors such as changes in our operating expenses, management&#8217;s ability to execute our operating and growth strategies, personnel changes, demand for our products, supply shortages, weather patterns and general economic conditions.

&#160;

Our direct-to-consumer business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, with direct-to-consumer center-of-the-plate protein sales typically higher during the holiday season in our fourth quarter; accordingly, a disproportionate amount of operating cash flows from this portion of our business is generated in the fourth quarter. Despite a significant portion of these sales occurring in the fourth quarter, there are operating expenses, principally advertising and promotional expenses, throughout the year.

&#160;

Inflation 

&#160;

Our profitability is dependent, among other things, on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources, including food and other raw materials, labor, energy and other supplies and services. Substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to our customers. The impact of inflation on food, labor, energy and occupancy costs can significantly affect the profitability of our operations.
