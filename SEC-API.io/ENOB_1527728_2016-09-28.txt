Overview of Our Business 

&#160; 

DanDrit a biotechnology company seeking to develop what we believe could be the world&#8217;s first vaccine approved for the treatment of colorectal cancer. For more than a decade we have developed and patented vaccines successfully used in initial clinical trials in Europe and Asia including: (i) MelCancerVac&#8482; (MCV) for treatment of cancer (one phase I/II trial in Denmark and two phase II trials in Denmark and Singapore), (ii) Tolerogenic (producing immunologic tolerance) dendritic cell (TDC) (pre-clinical stage in Denmark) and (iii) Melvaccine (MV) a melanoma cell lysate used as stand-alone vaccine (pre-clinical state in Denmark). We plan to continue our clinical development program in Europe and the United States. Springing from academic roots in Denmark, DanDrit has built upon its scientific and medical skills to advance candidate therapies, targeted initially at non-small-cell-lung-cancer (NSCLC) and colorectal cancer (sometimes referred to herein as CRC). In 2001, MCV was developed as a result of the combined efforts and research of DanDrit researchers and employees. On September 22, 2008, the Singapore government granted to DanDrit Denmark a named-patient compassionate use program of MCV. DanDrit&#8217;s dendritic cell vaccine, MCV, was evaluated in three single-arm Phase II clinical trials in cancer where MCV demonstrated potential efficacy. However, these three clinical trials generated data reported in published papers which indicated that the data needed to be confirmed in a larger, comparative randomized clinical trial. As a result, DanDrit, with the assistance of experienced practitioners in colorectal cancer treatment, designed a randomized trial with stage IV colorectal cancer patients and plans to conduct this randomized Phase III trial to assess the ability of MCV to prevent relapse of stage IV NED colorectal cancer patients with No Evidence of Disease (NED). Neither the US Federal Drug Administration (FDA) nor any other comparable governmental agency has reviewed MCV. Therefore, any assessment of its safety or efficacy only reflects the opinion of the Company. Furthermore, it does not indicate that MCV will achieve favorable results in any later stage trials or that the FDA or comparable agency will ultimately determine that MCV is safe and effective for purposes of granting marketing approval. 

&#160; 

In June 2015, DanDrit&#8217;s Board of Directors approved a change to DanDrit&#8217;s fiscal year end from December 31 to June 30.

&#160; 

Our Biotechnology 

&#160; 

We believe that DanDrit's next generation of dendritic cell vaccine technology may benefit of the following technological competitive advantages over other cancer vaccines, such as Dendreon&#8217;s FDA approved Provenge&#8482; cancer vaccine : 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; The vaccine is generated within eight days from a patient&#8217;s peripheral blood draw. We are able to generate the vaccine quickly because only 250ml of blood is required to be drawn. Leukapheresis, a medical technology in which the blood of a patient is passed through a dialysis machine that separates out one particular constituent and returns the remainder to the patient&#8217;s circulation is not needed. &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; The vaccine uses an allogenic (using cells, tissues, or organs, sourced from a genetically non-identical member of the same species as the recipient (&#8220;Allogenic&#8221;)) tumor lysate (a fluid containing the contents of lysed cells) as opposed to inconvenient autologous (from the patient) tumor lysate. Our cancer-specific antigens are off-the-shelf and therefore DanDrit does not need a patient&#8217;s tumor cells to manufacture the vaccine. &#160; 

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; The vaccine is polytopic (targets several cancer specific antigens). As a result, the risk of the tumor escaping is more limited and more T-cells can be activated than if the vaccine is targeting one antigen only. However, MCV has a focus on melanoma-associated antigen (&#8220;MAGE&#8221;)-A antigens that are only expressed by tumors and absent in normal tissues. 

&#160; 

MCV demonstrated efficacy in three separate Phase II clinical trials in colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer. Even if MCV can be used for various cancers, DanDrit has decided to focus MCV&#8217;s clinical development specifically on the treatment of advanced CRC. 

&#160; 

History 

&#160; 

DanDrit USA was originally incorporated in Delaware on January 18, 2011 under the name &#8220;Putnam Hills Corp.&#8221; as a vehicle to pursue a business combination through the acquisition of, or merger with, an operating business. We filed a Registration Statement on Form 10 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) on August 12, 2011. 

&#160; &#160; 

On February 12, 2014, in accordance with the terms and conditions of a Share Exchange Agreement (the &#8220;Share Exchange Agreement&#8221;), we completed the acquisition of approximately 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of DanDrit Denmark (the &#8220;Share Exchange&#8221;) and as a result became DanDrit Denmark&#8217;s parent company (the &#8220;Parent&#8221;). In connection with the Share Exchange, each outstanding share of common stock of DanDrit Denmark was exchanged for 1.498842 shares of DanDrit USA&#8217;s common stock, par value $.0001 per share (the &#8220;Common Stock&#8221;) for an aggregate of 6,000,000 shares, including 185,053 shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance, in accordance with Section 70 of the Danish Companies Act and the Articles of Association of DanDrit Denmark, to the DanDrit Denmark shareholders who did not consent to the Share Exchange and deemed issued and outstanding for accounting purposes. In addition, in connection with the Share Exchange (1) the sole shareholder prior to the Share Exchange agreed to cancel 4,400,000 shares of outstanding Common Stock owned by it and (2) the board of directors and executive management of DanDrit Denmark was appointed to serve as the Board of Directors and executive management of DanDrit USA effective upon the resignation of the sole officer and director of DanDrit USA prior to the closing of the Share Exchange. 

&#160; 

Emerging Growth Company 

&#160; 

As a company with less than $1.0 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, enacted in April 2012. An &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; No non-binding shareholder advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting; and &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Reduced disclosure of financial information in this prospectus, limited to two years of audited financial information and two years of selected financial information. &#160; 

As a smaller reporting company, each of the foregoing exemptions is currently available to us. We may take advantage of these exemptions until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, which such fifth anniversary will occur in 2018 or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenues as of the end of a fiscal year, if we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or if we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year-period. The JOBS Act permits an emerging growth company to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies; provided, however, that an emerging growth company may elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have not elected to opt out of the transition period. 

&#160; 

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Because we have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests. 

&#160; 

Our Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Our clinical development strategy is focused on conducting a Phase III clinical trial in advanced colorectal cancer. DanDrit intends to conduct a randomized multicenter Phase III clinical trial to determine the ability of MCV to prevent recidivism in stage IV colorectal patients with no evidence of disease (NED) after resection of metastasis and chemotherapy. This randomized trial is planned to be enrolled within two years. We believe that positive clinical data will be the catalyst to unlock commercial revenues for DanDrit through either MCV acquisition by a pharmaceutical partner or licensing arrangements that would yield upfront and milestone payments as well as royalties. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, parallel to the previously described clinical trial, DanDrit may pursue a registration trial to support potential approval of MCV in China. This trial would be conducted under China&#8217;s State Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;SFDA&#8221;) regulations with a Chinese oncology pharmaceutical partner. China has recently put in place a drug approval system. 

&#160; 

DanDrit is headquartered in the USA and also runs operations from its subsidiary in Denmark. 

&#160; 

Our Proposed Clinical Trial 

&#160; 

DanDrit intends to develop globally the use of MCV in the treatment of colorectal cancer, and to follow that expansion with the treatment of other types of cancer. DanDrit currently intends to focus its development program, a randomized multicenter Phase III clinical trial in stage IV colorectal cancer in Italy, known as VIVA (MelCancerVac vaccine in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer with no evidence of disease after standard of care, a randomized Phase III adjuvant study). 

&#160; 

The VIVA clinical trial with an adaptive design plans to first enroll 174 stage IV colorectal cancer patients after resection of metastases and chemotherapy. These patients have no evidence of disease but are not cured of cancer. Their Relapse Free Survival (an endpoint used to analyze the results of the treatment for the cancer which renders the patient apparently disease free, such as surgery plus adjuvant therapy, where, in the Relapse-Free Survival, the event is relapse rather than death) is only 24 to 26 months. The objective of the VIVA Phase III clinical study is to lengthen the survival of these patients. Treatment will be randomized against reference therapy. Patients will be included after resection of their primary tumor and metastases and after appropriate peri-operative or post-operative chemotherapy by random assignment to a non-vaccine control group or a vaccine group receiving five vaccinations with 14-day administration intervals followed by ten vaccines with two-month intervals. Inclusion will take place ten weeks after finishing the last round of chemotherapy (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) and after a negative tumor scan (head, thoracic and abdominal cavities) and normal carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) prior to inclusion in the vaccine or the control groups. The control group will receive standard therapy. In the event of disease progression, as verified by tumor scan and biomarker levels during the vaccination schedule, MCV vaccinations will be discontinued. 

&#160; 

Products 

&#160; 

DanDrit&#8217;s MCV demonstrated potential efficacy in three separate Phase II clinical trials in colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer. Even if MCV can be used for various cancers, DanDrit has decided to initiate MCV&#8217;s clinical development with advanced colorectal cancer. We believe that a maintenance therapy for advanced colorectal cancer represents a genuine commercial opportunity for MCV. &#160; A clear and unmet medical need for a safe maintenance therapy offers the opportunity to confirm the potential efficacy of MCV in a favorable setting. 

&#160; 

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The purpose of the VIVA trial will be to determine the ability of MCV to prevent recidivism in stage IV colorectal patients with no evidence of disease after resection of metastasis and chemotherapy. Using an Adaptive Design Clinical Study, which allows modification made to trial and/or statistical procedures of ongoing clinical trials based on accrued data, the VIVA trial will evaluate MCV with standard of care against standard of care alone in 174 colorectal cancer patients using as primary endpoints Relapse Free Survival (RFS) at 18 months and Overall Survival (OS). We anticipate that the first step of the VIVA trial can be completed within three years. 

&#160; 

DanDrit has learned how to manufacture dendritic cells, immune cells forming part of the mammalian immune system with the main function of processing antigen material and presenting it on the surface to other cells of the immune system, functioning as antigen-presenting cells, in vitro from monocyte (a type of white blood cell) precursor cells taken from patients eligible for DanDrit&#8217;s therapies. The preparation of tumor lysate containing selections of cancer-specific non-self-antigens allows DanDrit to sensitize patients&#8217; dendritic cells. The use of the patient&#8217;s own monocyte cells from peripheral blood (autologous cell therapy) overcomes the issues associated with non-self-allergic reactions to immune therapies. 

&#160; 

DanDrit&#8217;s intellectual property is protected with patents and trademarks. DanDrit&#8217;s candidate vaccines are based on the MCV platform that is protected by a family of issued or submitted patents. DanDrit&#8217;s lead product has completed Phase II clinical trials in Denmark and Singapore. Following the results of DanDrit&#8217;s Singapore Phase II clinical trials, Singapore authorities allowed the use of MCV for CRC on a humanitarian named patient basis. Named patient programs provide controlled, pre-approval access to drugs in response to requests by physicians on behalf of specific, or &#8220;named&#8221;, patients before those medicines are licensed in the patient&#8217;s home country. Governments worldwide, such as Singapore&#8217;s government, have created provisions for granting access to drugs prior to approval for patients who have exhausted all alternative treatment options and do not match clinical trial entry criteria. Often grouped under the labels of compassionate use, expanded access, or named patient supply, these programs are governed by rules which vary by country defining access criteria, data collection, promotion, and control of drug distribution. Through these programs, patients are able to access drugs in late-stage clinical trials or approved in other countries for a genuine, unmet medical need, before those drugs have been licensed in the patient&#8217;s home country. In September 2008, DanDrit Denmark and the National Cancer Centre of Singapore (NCC) entered into a collaboration agreement regarding a clinical named patient program conducted in Singapore at NCC with the dendritic cell vaccine MCV. NCC has established a GMP approved laboratory in which the manufacturing of MCV takes place. NCC has received approval from the relevant governmental authorities for the import of lysate necessary for production of MCV. The clinical and research and development activities of the named patient program relate to the Company&#8217;s product, MCV. The purpose for the Singapore named patient program is to provide patients with advanced colorectal cancer or other forms of cancer(s) with the presence of MAGE antigen expression an alternative treatment for the vaccination with MCV, where there is no further indication for surgery or treatment with chemotherapy. Patients are recruited on named patient basis according to the patient inclusion and exclusion criteria stated in the phase II study protocol. However, there may be some exceptional cases where treatment will be made based on a doctor&#8217;s discretion regarding the patient&#8217;s quality of life. 

&#160; 

To date, clinical trials of MCV have been targeted to patients in terminal stages of cancer with non-resectable bulky tumors who failed to respond to surgery and chemotherapy. Several patients showed extended overall survival with good quality of life. Several patients showed stable disease with no progression of tumors. There was evidence of tumor regression in some patients (see &#8220;Clinical Trials Data and Product Approvals&#8221;). 

&#160; 

These achievements have been built on a carefully executed R&#38;D program that generated practical solutions to scientific and medical challenges. Through this development program, DanDrit gained advanced understanding of the role of dendritic cells in immunoregulation and cancer. 

&#160; 

We believe that non-core applications of dendritic cell technologies mastered by DanDrit have applications in infectious diseases and auto-immune diseases such as diabetes (seventh leading cause of death in the US). We believe that these other applications may represent opportunities for potential out-licensing and cooperation. &#160;

DENDRITIC CELLS, THE THERAPEUTIC PLATFORM 

&#160; 

Summary 

&#160; 

Early academic work at the Danish Cancer Society was spun-out into DanDrit Denmark. None of the personnel at the Danish Cancer Society, or any other third-party, retains any rights to the intellectual property underlying the Company&#8217;s business, technology or product candidates, including MCV. The fundamental scientific postulate of DanDrit is the fact that key cells in the immune system can be sensitized to cancer cells that carry foreign (or non-self) antigens. These key antigen-presenting cells are the dendritic cells. Dendritic cells encounter and recognize foreign antigens. Dendritic cells can assimilate and process the cells expressing these antigens. The key components of these antigens (known as epitopes and several epitopes are known as polytopes) are subsequently presented on the cell surface of the dendritic cell. Dendritic cells travel to lymph nodes and other lymphatic tissues where the epitopes are presented to other immune cells, including cell-killing T lymphocytes. T lymphocytes sensitized by dendritic cells can then recognize and kill tumor cells carrying tumor-specific antigens recognized by the dendritic cells. The main aim is to kill tumor cells without killing normal body tissues. 

&#160; 

From DanDrit&#8217;s point of interest, this might represent a dendritic cell instructing a T-lymphocyte to kill tumor cells presents itself as a &#8220;Cancer Vaccine&#8221; company and its lead product, MelCancerVac&#174; (MCV), a polytopic vaccine, targets colorectal cancer in the first instance. In addition, DanDrit has developed several technologies relevant to dendritic cell production, including: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Generation of fast track dendritic cells &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Processing and presentation of protein antigen &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Characterization of DanDrit dendritic cells &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Analysis of lysate uptake by DanDrit dendritic cells &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; MicroRNA profiling of DanDrit dendritic cells &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Effect of Resiquimod (a drug that acts as an immune response modifier, and has antiviral and anti-tumoral activity) on production of Interleukin 12 (Il-12), a secreted protein factor that is naturally produced by dendritic cells in response to antigenic stimulation and Interleukin 10 (IL-10), a protein that inhibits the synthesis of a number of other signaling proteins. &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Generation of tolerogenic dendritic cells &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Development of Il-12 based potency assay &#160; 

DanDrit&#8217;s vaccine candidates are based on the MCV platform and are protected by a family of issued and submitted patents. DanDrit&#8217;s lead product has completed Phase II clinical trials in Denmark and Singapore. 

&#160; 

To date, clinical trials of MCV have been targeted to patients in terminal stages of disease who failed to respond to surgical resection and chemotherapies. Some patients showed extended overall survival with good quality of life. Many patients showed stable disease with no progression of tumor. There was evidence of tumor regression in some patients. (see &#8220;Clinical Trials Data and Product Approvals&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Some of this research in dendritic cells could have implications that reach beyond DanDrit&#8217;s cancer vaccine vision. 

&#160; 

Dendritic Cells and the immune response 

&#160; 

Dendritic cells were first recognized by Paul Langerhans in the late 19th century. For this reason such cells in the skin may still be referred to as Langerhans cells. The term &#8220;dendritic cell&#8221; was first used by Ralph Steinman and Zanvil Cohn in 1973. Steinman received the 2007 Lasker Award for this work and the 2011 Medicine Nobel Prize. 

&#160; 

Like macrophages, cells whose role is to phagocytose, or engulf and then digest, cellular debris and pathogens, either as stationary or as mobile cells, dendritic cells are involved in the processing of antigens and their presentation to the cells that directly carry out the immune response through antibody generation (B lymphocytes) or cell killing activity (T- lymphocytes). Like macrophages, dendritic cells are mobile and once stimulated by an antigen, activated macrophages and dendritic cells move from their host tissue (usually skin or epithelial tissue such as gut, mucous membranes, lung etc.) to lymphatic tissues where they encounter and stimulate cells that mediate the immune response. 

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Unsurprisingly, macrophages and dendritic cells are closely related. Both are derived from circulating blood cells known as monocytes, a type of white blood cell which constitutes roughly 10% of all white blood cells. Monocytes, macrophages and immature dendritic cells are all phagocytic cells, that is, they engulf and process foreign antigens. On activation by the uptake of antigen, dendritic cells mature and become mobile. The mobile mature dendritic cells are capable of stimulating T-lymphocytes through the expression of T-cell stimulatory antigens on their cell surfaces. 

&#160; 

It is possible to force monocytes to differentiate in vitro into immature dendritic cells. This is the basis of DanDrit&#8217;s proprietary dendritic cell production process. As in nature, DanDrit&#8217;s process involves a subtle communication between monocytes and cytokines (small proteins that important in the communication process that governs basic cellular activities and coordinates cell actions). Dendritic cells produced by DanDrit are functionally, morphologically and biochemically very similar &#8211; if not identical &#8211; to natural dendritic cells. 

&#160; 

Figure 1 Principle of Dendritic Cell cancer vaccines 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

DanDrit&#8217;s platform technology is based on isolating patient monocytes and transforming them into immature dendritic cells in vitro . This is achieved by exposing monocytes to cytokines (interleukin 4, IL-4; and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, GM-CSF). Still in vitro these immature dendritic cells are activated by exposure to a cancer cell line lysate. This cancer cell lysate contains many &#8220;non-self&#8221; antigens of the cancer/testis family. Although coded by the human genome, these antigens are not normally expressed in tissues other than cancer or testis (note that testis and immune system are isolated from each other). Once sensitized in vitro , the immature dendritic cells are matured by exposure to a DanDrit proprietary cytokine cocktail. The now mature dendritic cells can be re-injected to the patient via a simple 0.2 ml intra-dermal injection and they will find their way to the lymphatic tissues. There, they will stimulate multiple cell killing (T) lymphocytes which will become sensitized to the cancer-specific antigens present in the lysate.

&#160; 

The Platform Technology, MelCancerVac&#174; 

&#160; 

MelCancerVac&#174; (MCV) is a cellular immunotherapy for treatment of cancer. MCV has been studied in two cancers: Non-Small Cell Lung cancer (NSCLC) and colorectal cancer (CRC). 

DanDrit&#8217;s platform technology comprises two arms: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; autologous dendritic cells obtained by the activation of patient-derived monocytes; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; proprietary lysate from melanoma-derived cell line expressing a range of cancer/testis antigens, notably the MAGE-A family &#160; 

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The melanoma lysate component of MCV is manufactured from a melanoma cell line established by DanDrit scientists. This cell line was isolated from a melanoma tumor that expressed antigens found in a wide range of tumors but not in normal tissues (other than the testis). These antigens belong to a family of cancer/testis antigens (including mostly MAGE-A antigens) found in many tumors. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, by exposing DanDrit&#8217;s proprietary melanoma tumor cell to 5-aza-deoxycytadine (5-aza-CdR/Decitabine), which is an inhibitor of DNA methylation, DanDrit has shown that derived tumor lysates (MCV5AZA) express a far wider range of tumor-specific antigens. 

&#160; 

Antigen characterization 

&#160; 

For a patient to respond favorably to MCV, it is necessary that the antigens presented by the patient&#8217;s tumor show a significant match with the antigens in the lysate. The level of expression of antigens in each batch of lysate is determined by a procedure known as Reverse Transcriptase Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction or &#8220;RT-QPCR&#8221;. Clearly all patient cells will present many thousands of antigens, as will the lysate. MCV&#8217;s lysate component is isolated from a melanoma cell line that expresses a great many cancer/testis antigens at significant level. This broad spectrum of cancer/testis antigens is what makes MCV a good cancer vaccine. Figure 2 (below) shows how RT-QPCR can analyze levels of antigen expression as measured by messenger RNA. 

&#160; 

Figure 2 Comparison of tumor antigen expression in MCV with two patient biopsies 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In this example, TA-1 to TA-28 are 28 known tumor antigens (antigens that are only expressed by cancer cells and not by normal cells). We can see that 14 of these antigens are present in MCV. Twenty-one cancer-specific antigens are expressed by the tumor in patient two, which indicates a good chance of promoting a cancer killing response. In patient one there is not a strong overlap of MCV antigens and the five patient&#8217;s tumor antigens. The chances of promoting a strong immune response are less but still significant (TA-3, TA-9, TA-18, and TA-19 are shared). 

&#160; 

By analyzing patient&#8217;s tumors by RT-QPCR, it is possible to select patients that have the best chance of success with MCV. However, other uncharacterized antigens may also be present that might promote a response. 

&#160; 

Clinical Trials Data and product approvals 

&#160; 

Overall clinical results 

&#160; 

No dendritic cell-based vaccination has to date demonstrated life-threatening side effects. The only potential adverse events associated with dendritic cell vaccines to date are a flu-like symptom with fevers (up to 39-40 degrees Celsius), chills, and headaches in some patients. The occurrence of these adverse events did not require additional treatment or hospitalization. Some patients may also develop a vitiligo, a skin condition in which there is a loss of brown color (pigment) from areas of skin, resulting in irregular white patches that feel like normal skin, when melanocyte differentiation antigens are used as targets in immunotherapy. However, this has not occurred, to DanDrit&#8217;s knowledge, with MCV in clinical trials that have been conducted to date. 

&#160; 

MCV is produced according to the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) in facilities approved by the Danish Medicine Agency and EU regulation for the production of medicines from patient blood in aseptic conditions. No products of animal origin are used during vaccine preparation. Quality control is performed for each individual batch of the vaccine as well as for the lysate used in the loading of dendritic cells. 

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

MCV was originally developed in 2001 as a result of the combined research efforts of DanDrit researchers and employees and has been tested in clinical trials for the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 

&#160; 

CRC Clinical Trials 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Phase I/II at Gentofte Hospital, Denmark (investigator-sponsored trial)&#8211; Completed, November 2004 &#8211; April 2006 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Phase II at the National Cancer Centre, Singapore (investigator-sponsored trial) &#8211; Completed, November 2005 &#8211; March 2007 &#160; 

NSCLC Clinical Trials 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Phase II at Herlev Hospital, Denmark (Dandrit-sponsored trial) &#8211; Completed, January 2006 &#8211; September 2009 &#160; 

ColoRectal Cancer (CRC) in Denmark 

&#160; 

The clinical trial using MCV at the University Hospital of Copenhagen, Gentofte, in Denmark was an investigator sponsored trial. The principal investigator and sponsor of the trial was Dr. Anders Fischer, a recognized specialist in surgical oncology in Demark and the department head of the Dept. of Surgical Gastroenterology at Copenhagen University Hospital in Gentofte, who received a grant to fund the trials provided by the Aase &#38; Einar Danielsen Foundation. Dr. Jacob Rosenberg, a professor and surgeon, working in the Dept. of Surgical Gastroenterology at Copenhagen University and Dr. Mogen Claesson, a director of DanDrit designed the trial and proposed it to Dr. Fischer to act as sponsor and principal investigator. Enrollment of CRC patients started in October 2004 and the study ended in September 2006. Certain DanDrit staff, including Dr. Rosenberg and Dr. Claesson, as well as two other employees of DanDrit Denmark at the time of the study closely collaborated with the researchers at Gentofte Hospital responsible for the day to day work of the study with respect to the study design, analysis and interpretation of data obtained in the Denmark CRC Trial. In addition, the patents and proprietary knowledge of DanDrit and its employees were utilized in connection with the analysis and interpretation of the data that resulted from the study. The results and findings of the trial were published in established scientific journals (Phase I study: J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2006 Jun;25(2):201-6., Phase II study, clinical data: Oncol Rep. 2008 Dec;20(6):1305-11., Immunological data: Acta Oncol. 2009;48(8):1157-64.), which were co-authored by Dr. Rosenberg, Dr. Claesson and the two other DanDrit staff researchers. 

&#160; 

The data described in this prospectus with respect to the Copenhagen CRC trial have been obtained from the published papers issued in connection with the study. Twenty patients with advanced colorectal cancer (Dukes D - not curable by resection and no further conventional therapy options available) were included in the study (six patients in phase I and 14 in phase II). 

&#160; 

The purpose of this open phase I/II study was to study the tolerability and effect of MCV given as intradermal injections to patients with metastasizing colorectal cancer, where there was no indication for surgery or chemotherapy. The first part was a phase I study to investigate whether treatment with MCV is in any way toxic. No toxicity was observed and the study continued into phase II to study the effect and tolerability of MCV. At the completion of the study stable disease was observed in twenty percent of the enrolled patients. This data was achieved with DanDrit&#8217;s early MCV vaccine, which has since been replaced by an improved MCV. The MCV was improved subsequent to the completion of the clinical trials described in this prospectus, but included the addition of aza-cytidine to the DDM-1 culture to de-methylize the genome in order to optimize tumor specific antigen expression. The benefit was marginal and did not justify switching to a different product during the trials. As a result, all trials we will present to the FDA and EMEA will use the same cell line and the same manufacturing process.

Study design: dendritic cells were generated from autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In order to increase the level of circulating leukocytes, patients exercised five minutes on a treadmill before 200 ml of blood was drawn. Patients were scheduled for ten vaccinations consisting of 3-5x106 dendritic cells. Vaccinations were given bi-weekly intra-dermally on the proximal thigh with two injections each thigh. Adverse events were monitored and classified according to the National Cancer Institute&#8217;s Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI&#8217;s CTC). Evaluation of responses was made according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (&#8220;RECIST&#8221;) criteria and patients were CT scanned before entering the study, after five vaccinations and after ten vaccinations. Quality of life was monitored by questionnaires bi-weekly. The study was performed at the Department of Surgical Gastroenterology at Gentofte University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark according to ICH Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (European Directive on GCP 2001/20/EC). 

&#160; 

RECIST is a set of published rules that define when tumors in cancer patients improve (&#34;respond&#34;), stay the same (&#34;stabilize&#34;), or worsen (&#34;progress&#34;) during treatments. The criteria were published in February 2000 by an international collaboration including the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (&#8220;EORTC&#8221;), National Cancer Institute of the United States, and the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group. Today, the majority of clinical trials evaluating cancer treatments for objective response in solid tumors are using RECIST.

The aim of the phase II CRC study in Denmark was to evaluate the effect of treating patients with advanced colorectal cancer with a cancer vaccine based on dendritic cells pulsed with an allogenic tumor cell lysate. Twenty patients with advanced colorectal cancer were consecutively enrolled, with 17 completed the full study. Dendritic cells (DC) were generated from autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells and pulsed with allogenic tumor cell lysate containing high levels of cancer-testis antigens. Vaccines were biweekly administered intra-dermally with a total of 10 vaccines per patient. CT scans were performed and responses were graded according to the RECIST criteria. Quality of life was monitored with the SF-36 questionnaire. Four patients of the 17 were graded with stable disease, two of whom remained stable throughout the entire study period. Analysis of changes in the patients&#8217; quality of life revealed stability in the sub-groups: &#8220;physical function&#8221; (p=0.872), &#8220;physical role limitation&#8221; (p=0.965), &#8220;bodily pain&#8221; (p= 0.079), &#8220;social function&#8221; (p=0.649), &#8220;emotional role limitation&#8221; (p=0.252) and &#8220;mental health&#8221; (p=0.626). The median survival from inclusion was 5.3 months (range 0.2 - 29.2 months) with one patient still being alive almost 30 months after inclusion in the trial. Toxicity and adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute&#8217;s common Toxicity Criteria. At the first evaluating CT scan, four patients were categorized with stable disease and at the second evaluating CT scan two of these patients still had stable disease and one of them received additional monthly vaccines because of the remaining stability in the disease. DanDrit determined that treatment with this DC-based cancer vaccine was safe and non-toxic. Stable disease was found in 24% (4/17) of the patients participating in the full study. The quality of life remained stable for most categories stable throughout the study period. Stable disease is defined as a tumor that is neither growing nor shrinking. Stable disease also means that no new tumors have developed and that the cancer has not spread to any new regions of the body (the cancer is not getting better or worse) and quality of life, measured using a global health score, was at the baseline with no or minimal variation. Variations in the patients' self-reported quality of life during the study period, assessed by the SF-36 questionnaire, were estimated using Freidman's statistical analysis. There were no significant variation in the patients' &#8216;physical function&#8217; (p=0.872), &#8216;physical role limitation&#8217; (p=0.965), &#8216;bodily pain&#8217; (p=0.079), &#8216;social function&#8217; (p=0.649), &#8216;emotional role limitation&#8217; (p=0.252) and &#8216;mental health&#8217; (p=0.626). There was a significant variation concerning &#8216;general health perception&#8217; (p=0.006) and &#8216;vitality&#8217; (p=0.011). 

&#160; 

Primary endpoints of the study were tumor response according to RECIST criteria and quality of life (Burgdorf SK, Fischer A, Myschetzky PS, Munksgaard SB, Zocca MB, Claesson MH, Rosenberg J. Clinical responses in patients with advanced colorectal cancer to a dendritic cell based vaccine. Oncol Rep. 2008 Dec;20(6):1305-11. PubMed PMID:19020707) and secondary endpoints for the study were responses measured by immunological parameters (Burgdorf SK, Claesson MH, Nielsen HJ, Rosenberg J. Changes in cytokine and biomarker blood levels in patients with colorectal cancer during dendritic cell-based vaccination. Acta Oncol. 2009;48(8):1157-64. doi:10.3109/02841860903099964. PubMed PMID: 19863224). 

&#160; 

A measure of quality of life for the colorectal cancer trial in Denmark, DanDrit used the SF-36 Global Health Score questionnaire to evaluate the patients' quality of life throughout the study period. At the time of the trial, this questionnaire from the Medical Outcome Study (MOS), conducted by the RAND Corporation, was both recommended and validated. All patients in the trial independently filled in the questionnaire every two weeks. The SF-36 Global Health Score questionnaire consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score is the more disability is reported by the patient. Higher scores reflect less disability i.e. a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability. The eight different aspects of quality of life reflecting different aspects of the patient&#8217;s self-reported quality of life are: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; vitality &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; physical functioning &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; bodily pain &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; general health perceptions &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; physical role functioning &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; emotional role functioning &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; social role functioning &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; mental health &#160; 

The fact that patients' SF-36 Global Health Score was high signifies that when entering the study the patients&#8217; quality of life was comparable to the healthy background population. The fact that it remained stable signifies that there were no significant changes in the patients&#8217; quality of life during treatment. This correlates with the fact that the treatment was well tolerated by all patients and that investigators did not observe severe adverse effects from the treatment.

&#160; 

A more in depth analysis of the components of the patients&#8217; quality of life revealed a stability in certain parameters that measure quality of life. The &#8220;p&#8221; refers to the p-value. In a statistical test, the p-value is the probability of getting the same value for a model built around two hypotheses, one is the &#34;neutral&#34; hypothesis, and the other is the hypothesis under testing. In the Friedman analysis that was used for QOL testing in this study, a p-value below 0.05 means that the values varied throughout the observation period (but says nothing about increase or decrease). A p-value above 0.05 means that the QOL values were stable throughout the observation period. 

&#160; 

The graph below indicates the specific p-values of &#8220;general health perception&#8221; and &#8220;vitality&#8221; throughout the study: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Company does not believe that any significant information can be inferred from the variation observed, even if statistically significant, with respect to these two parameters as it would have been anticipated that these extremely sick patients with a progressive disease would have resulted in variations in QOL over the course of the study. For this same reason, it is, however, more significant that 6 of the 8 parameters showed stability as it can be inferred that the treatment had a positive impact on the QOL of patients.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Denmark 

&#160; 

DanDrit sponsored and funded this MCV clinical trial conducted at Herlev Hospital, University of Copenhagen, in Denmark by Quintiles A/S (&#8220;Quintiles&#8221;) and ACRO Nordic A/S (&#8220;ACRO&#8221;) as contract research organizations (CROs). The title of the study is: &#8220;Vaccination with Autologous Dendritic Cells Pulsed with Allogeneic Tumor Lysate (MelCancerVac) for the Treatment of Patients with Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer&#8221;. The principal investigator was Dr. Anders Mellemgaard, the head of the Department of Lung Medicine at Herlev Hospital. Dr. Claesson and three other DanDrit employees worked and collaborated with the researchers at the Herley Hospital with respect to study design and the analysis and interpretation of data obtained from the NSCLC Trial. The results of the trial were published in a recognized scientific journal (World Journal of Vaccines, 2013, 3, 68-76) in a paper that was co-authored by Dr. Claesson and the three other DanDrit employees that collaborated with the NSCLC Trial researchers. 

&#160; 

The NSCLC trial was designed as an open-label, phase II clinical study. Enrolled patients had disseminated, inoperable NSCLC after chemotherapy; the patients did not want further chemotherapy: and no other systemic treatments could be offered to them.

The primary objective was to measure the antigen specific immunological reaction between vaccine antigens and the patients&#8217; immune system in vivo and in vitro. The secondary objectives were to estimate the patients&#8217; survival time, the tumor response according to RECIST criteria, and the patients&#8217; quality of life during the study period. Primary endpoint was tumor response, assessed by clinical benefit rate, the percentage of patients with advanced or metastatic cancer who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease to a therapeutic intervention in clinical trials of anticancer agents (CBR), however the study also evaluated PFS and overall survival (OS) as secondary endpoints. Complete response (CR) is a figure representing the percentage of patients whose cancer disappears after treatment. Partial response (PR) is a figure representing the percentage of patients whose cancer shrinks after treatment. PR describes a tumor that has decreased in size by at least 30%. The term stable disease (SD) describes a tumor that is neither growing nor shrinking. SD also means that no new tumors have developed, and that the cancer has not spread to any new regions of the body (the cancer is not getting better or worse). The median overall survival was 7.4 months (95% confidence interval (CI), used to indicate the reliability of an estimate, 4.5-17.5 months). Two patients were still alive at the time of analysis. An exploratory analysis showed that patients with PR and SD had significantly better survival (median, 18.1 months) compared to those with progressive disease (median, 6.2 months; P = .007). Although the median time to tumor progression was short at 2.4 months (95% CI, 1.9-4.1 months), five patients experienced a prolonged PFS of more than 6 months; and two of them (reviewed below) continued to be progression-free at time of analysis (PFS &#62;27 and &#62;37 months). 

&#160; 

The first patient was included in January 2007. A total of 28 patients were included in the trial. Treatments prior to DC vaccinations, tumor histology, smoking status, number of vaccinations, age and gender were recorded. The median age was 58.5 years (46-74 years). All patients received systemic anti-cancer treatment prior to inclusion. At the time of inclusion, 15 patients were in performance status (PS) 0 and seven patients were in PS 1. Fifteen months after termination of the trial, 4 patients (patient number 1, 2, 12 and 13) were still alive. These four patients who remained in stable disease after more than 10 vaccinations had different histology subtypes: one broncho-alveolar carcinoma, one squamous cell carcinoma and two adenocarcinoma. In this Phase II trial a 43% CBR (the percentage of patients with advanced or metastatic cancer who have achieved CR, PR and SD to a therapeutic intervention in clinical trials of anticancer agents) was observed, with six patients showing stable disease. Five of these patients were immunologically responding to the vaccine (ELISPOT &#8211;IFN Gamma positive) while eight of nine patients with no clinical response had no IFN gamma response. Sixteen patients received at minimum six vaccines and were evaluated by CT scans. Of those, nine patients showed progression on the 1st evaluation CT scan three months after initiation of treatment, and seven patients had stable disease, representing a 43% CBR. For these 7 patients remaining in stable disease (SD) for a variable period of time, the overall survival curve showed a plateau after two years. 

&#160; 

In this NSCLC trial, quality of life was measured by self-administered questionnaire using EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 version 3 and QLQ-LC13. The QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status/quality of life scale, and six single items. Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus, a high score for a functional scale represents a high/healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status/quality of life represents a high quality of life, but a high score for a symptom scale/item represents a high level of symptomatology/problems. Version 3.0 is currently the standard version of the QLQ-C30, and should be used for all new studies. An essential component of the EORTC QLQ development strategy involves the use of cancer-specific supplementary questionnaire modules which, when employed in conjunction with the QLQ-C30, can provide more detailed information relevant to evaluating the quality of life in specific patient populations. The additional QLQ-LC13 questionnaire is specifically designed for lung cancer patients. The QLQ-LC13 includes questions assessing lung cancer-associated symptoms (cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea and site specific pain), treatment-related side effects (sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy and alopecia) and pain medication. The questionnaire was filled by the patients at baseline, and by the time of the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th vaccinations. The data from the quality of life questionnaires was collected and coded according to EORTC. An overall evaluation of general quality of life-score for the global question of &#8220;How do you rate your overall quality of life during the past week&#8221; remained stable throughout the study period. More specific factors such as anxiety and lung specific symptoms also remained unchanged during the study-period. 

&#160; 

The NSCLC trial in Denmark evaluated the clinical and immunological effects of dendritic cell (DC) vaccination in patients with NSCLC. Autologous DCs were pulsed with a MAGE containing allogenic melanoma cell lysate (MCV). Twenty-two patients initiated the vaccination program including a total of ten vaccinations. Seven patients remained in SD three months after the first vaccination. After 10 vaccinations, six months after vaccine initiation, four patients still showed SD and continued vaccinations on a monthly basis. These four patients received a total of 12, 16, 26 and 35 vaccinations, respectively. Five patients showed unexpectedly prolonged survival. The treatment was well tolerated and only minor adverse events were reported. Quality of life did not change during the study period. In four out of seven patients with SD, vaccine-specific T cells were detected by interferon gamma (IFNundefined) (a small protein that plays a role in immunity against infections and for tumor control mostly by activating microphages) Elispot assays, whereas only one patient with progressive disease (PD) showed vaccine-specific responses. This DC-based vaccine trial has indicated a correlation between vaccine-specific immunity and sustained SD. The finding of a significant correlation between prolonged disease stabilization and vaccine-specific cellular responses may support the latter notion and support the hypothesis that immune responses may play a role in disease control even long time after the actual treatment. This is in sharp contrast to the rapid effect of anti-cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Furthermore, the trial demonstrated an unexpectedly prolonged survival in some patients, which may indicate delayed effect of DC vaccination after completion of the treatment. In addition, the investigators reported that this kind of vaccine treatment was feasible and the logistics were manageable in this patient group. 

&#160; 

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

In conclusion, 7 out of 22 NSCLC patients vaccinated with autologous DC pulsed with an allogenic Clinical Trial Authorization (CTA) containing tumor cell lysate had prolonged disease stabilization. In the course of DC vaccination vaccine-specific IFNundefined responses were detected in peripheral blood of four of patients with SD and one patient with progressive disease. However, from this study it is not possible to conclude whether the vaccine treatment and the subsequent IFNundefined responses are involved in the clinical cause of these patients. To elucidate the full efficacy of vaccine treatment of patients with NSCLC, the investigators recommended that a randomized trial should be conducted.

Colorectal Cancer (CRC) in Singapore 

&#160; 

A single arm phase II clinical study was also sponsored and funded by the Singapore National Cancer Centre (NCC) to investigate the efficacy of intradermal vaccination with MCV in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. The principal investigator of the Singapore CRC Trial was Dr. Han Chong Toh, a recognized specialist in medical oncology in Singapore. While Dandrit Denmark was not sponsor of the trial, it assisted in the design and proposal of the trial to the SNCC and Dr. Toh. Dr. Claesson and two other DanDrit employees collaborated with the researchers at the Singapore National Cancer Center, with respect to the study design and the analysis and interpretation of data obtained from the Singapore CRC Trial. The results and findings of the Singapore CRC trial were published in recognized scientific journals (Clinical results: Clin. Cancer Res. 2009 Dec 15;15(24):7726-7736., Immunological data: Vaccine. 2009 Dec 11;28(2):542-7.) that was co-authored by Dr. Claesson and the two other employees of DanDrit Denmark that collaborated with the researchers at the NCC in Singapore. 

&#160; 

The study used DanDrit&#8217;s patented procedure for generating dendritic cells. All included patients had tumors which antigenically correlated with the vaccine, i.e. were MAGE-A positive. The purpose of the study was to investigate the objective efficacy and specific immunologic response of the MCV vaccination. The first patient was enrolled in June 2005, and by June 2007 a total of 20 patients had been treated and evaluated. 

&#160; 

The vaccine was given to advanced colorectal cancer patients pre-treated with chemotherapy, where there was no further indication for surgery or treatment with chemotherapy. 

&#160; 

Treatment with MCV did not appear to adversely affect the patient&#8217;s quality of life, measured based on a global health score of 68.3 prior to treatment with minimal variation through the course of the treatment. The health-related quality of life assessment quantifies how the individual's well-being may be affected over time by a disease, such as cancer. Health-related quality of life is assessed using patient questionnaires. These questionnaires are multidimensional and cover physical, social, emotional, cognitive, work- or role-related and spiritual aspects, as well as a wide variety of cancer related symptoms, therapy induced side effects, and the financial impact of cancer. The questionnaire from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) is most commonly used to evaluate the impact of cancer on sufferers. MCV induced objective responses in seven of 20 patients (six responses were stable disease and one response was partial regression of tumor mass). Significant immunological and clinical correlation was observed. Results from the trial were presented orally at the AACR meeting in Singapore in November 2007. 

&#160; 

The CRC trial in Singapore evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of MCV in advanced colorectal cancer patients expressing at least one of six MAGE-A antigens. Dendritic cells were cultured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and pulsed with allogenic lysate and matured using cytokines to achieve high CD83 and CCR7 expressing dendritic cells. Each patient received up to 10 intradermal vaccinations (3-5 x 106 cells/dose) at biweekly intervals. Twenty patients received a total of 161 vaccinations. Treatment was well-tolerated with minimal adverse events. Quality of life measurement using global health score was high at baseline and did not change during the duration of the trial. In this study, statistical testing was done with repeated t-tests comparing baseline with each time point. A &#8220;t-test&#8221; is a statistical analysis used to determine whether there is a statistical difference between averages or means of a group with a small sample size. The &#8220;baseline&#8221; is a starting point from which a comparison can be made and is typically established prior to the beginning of a study as a point of comparison for monitoring and evaluating data at various point in a study. The term &#8220; comparing baseline with each time point &#8221; refers to the comparison of data at a defined point in time against the originally established &#8220;baseline&#8221;. 

&#160; 

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Since the p-values did not change during the duration of the trial, we believe that there were no statistical differences regarding quality of life in this study in any of the parameters at any time points. 

&#160; 

The colorectal cancer patients who are eligible for the humanitarian program in Singapore must present a profile similar to the one of the patients who were recruited in the phase IIa clinical trial. However, there have been some exceptional cases where treatment has been based on a doctor&#8217;s discretion on the patient&#8217;s quality of life. Also, patients are monitored according to the previous phase II study protocol. To date we have not received a detailed report regarding the final outcomes for patients participating in the Singapore trials. 

&#160; 

MAGE-A-expressing metastatic colorectal cancer patients with prior progressive disease treated with MCV achieved a competitive Clinical Benefit Rate of 40%. While patients with single metastatic sites in either lung or nodal regions tended to have more durable responses (see patients 1, 2 and 9 in table below), Stable Disease was also attained in patients with bulky multiple metastases (see patient 6 in table below). Five patients notably remained progression-free for over six months and two patients with significant tumor burden (see patients 1 and 9 in table below) were still progression-free for over 27 and 37 months respectively. We recognize that adopting the primary endpoint of Clinical Benefit Rate using RECIST criteria has limitations. This study protocol was designed in 2005 where objective response rate (ORR) and Clinical Benefit Rate evaluation as primary endpoints in Phase II cancer vaccine trials were not uncommon. Nevertheless, the investigators did evaluate Progression Free Survival and Overall Survival as secondary endpoints, which may better reflect true vaccine efficacy. 

&#160; 

A meta-analysis of 32 cancer vaccine clinical studies in patients with advanced colorectal cancer reported a Clinical Benefit Rate in 11.2% of patients and an overall response rate (Complete Response and Partial Response) of 0.9%. The defined clinical benefit rate (Complete Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease) was observed in 17% (12/70) of colorectal cancer patients who received Dendritic Cell vaccines.

As of 2006, there were a total of eight clinical DC vaccination studies in patients with metastatic colon cancer, all with peptide-pulsed DC. To our knowledge, this study which adopted an allogenic tumor lysate-based DC vaccine achieves the highest Clinical Benefit Rate in advanced colorectal cancer patients compared to these previous Dendritic Cell vaccination clinical trials. The clinical activity of this present Dendritic Cell-based vaccine might reflect its polytopic nature, its allogenic adjuvant-like components, the quality of the Dendritic Cell preparation (i.e. high uniform expression of CD83, CD86, HLA class II, and CCR7), the intradermal route of vaccine injection securing optimal lymph drainage to regional lymph nodes, the presence of MAGE expression in both patients and vaccine and the increased frequency of delivery (ten injections). 

&#160; 

Quality of life measurement using global health score was high at baseline and did not vary much across time. In this study, statistical testing was done with repeated t-tests comparing baseline with each time point., Since the p. values did not vary across time, we believe that there were no statistical differences regarding quality of life in this study in any of the parameters at any time points.

&#160; 

Treatment with MCV did not appear to adversely affect the patient&#8217;s quality of life, measured based on a global health score of 68.3 prior to treatment with minimal variation through the course of the treatment. The health-related quality of life assessment quantifies how the individual's well-being may be affected over time by a disease, such as cancer. Health-related quality of life is assessed using patient questionnaires. These questionnaires are multidimensional and cover physical, social, emotional, cognitive, work- or role-related and spiritual aspects, as well as a wide variety of cancer related symptoms, therapy induced side effects, and the financial impact of cancer. The questionnaire from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) is most commonly used to evaluate the impact of cancer on sufferers. MCV induced objective responses in seven of 20 patients (six responses were stable disease and one response was partial regression of tumor mass). Significant immunological and clinical correlation was observed. 

&#160; 

Compassionate Use/Named Patient Approval 

&#160; 

Further to the data emerging from the Singapore CRC trial, the Singapore government requested and approved (22 September 2008) that named patients be offered MCV therapy at cost. This first compassionate use approval marked a significant milestone for the progress and acceptability of the MCV therapeutic model. This compassionate program could be used as a model to initiate sales of MCV in other countries of the ASEA such as Thailand or Malaysia. Outside the United States, named patient programs provide controlled, pre-approval access to drugs in response to requests by physicians on behalf of specific, or &#8220;named&#8221;, patients before those medicines are licensed in the patient&#8217;s home country. Governments worldwide, such as Singapore&#8217;s government, have created provisions for granting access to drugs prior to approval for patients who have exhausted all alternative treatment options and do not match clinical trial entry criteria. Often grouped under the labels of compassionate use, expanded access, or named patient supply, these programs are governed by rules which vary by country defining access criteria, data collection, promotion, and control of drug distribution. Through these programs, patients are able to access drugs in late-stage clinical trials or approved in other countries for a genuine, unmet medical need, before those drugs have been licensed in the patient&#8217;s home country. In September 2008, DanDrit Denmark and the National Cancer Centre of Singapore (NCC) entered a collaboration agreement regarding a clinical named patient program conducted in Singapore at NCC with the dendritic cell vaccine MCV. NCC has established a GMP approved laboratory in which the manufacturing of MCV takes place. NCC has received approval from the relevant governmental authorities for the import of lysate necessary for production of MCV. The clinical and research and development activities of the named patient program relate to the Company&#8217;s product, MCV. The purpose for the Singapore named patient program is to provide patients with advanced colorectal cancer or other forms of cancer(s) with the presence of MAGE antigen expression an alternative treatment for the vaccination with MCV, where there is no further indication for surgery or treatment with chemotherapy. Patients are recruited on named patient basis according to the patient inclusion and exclusion criteria stated in the phase II study protocol. However, there may be some exceptional cases where treatment will be made based on a doctor&#8217;s discretion regarding the patient&#8217;s quality of life. 

&#160; 

100% Off-the-Shelve Vaccines 

&#160; 

Autologous (from the patient) dendritic cells cancer vaccines are tailor made for each individual patient. This personalized medicine approach is appealing to the patients but may present several drawbacks to a pharmaceutical company. Creating a new, unique vaccine for each patient may be perceived as complex, time consuming, and expensive. Therefore, DanDrit developed MelVaxin&#8482;. This program presented below capitalizes on the knowledge and the expertise gained with DanDrit&#8217;s proprietary lysate used for MCV but is on hold now. 

&#160; 

Melvaxin&#8482; 

&#160; 

A second platform product, MelVaxin&#8482; has been also evaluated. MelVaxin&#8482; is similar to the lysate component of MCV. DanDrit proposed injecting MelVaxin&#8482; into the skin to promote natural dendritic cell responses that will attack the tumor expressing cancer/testis antigens. It is necessary to inject MelVaxin&#8482; with an immuno-stimulator such as GM-CSF, BCG or an adjuvant (such as 3M&#8217;s TLR7 and TLR8 agonists). A preclinical program could be performed in minipigs. These animals have immune response profiles, particularly of skin injection, that are very close to human. This program, currently on hold, can be reinitiated when staff is available to manage this program. This takes second place to the MCV2 program and illustrates DanDrit&#8217;s professional commitment to advancing lead clinical products.

Other Future Products 

&#160; 

Other cancers 

&#160; 

DanDrit has already made progress with clinical trials of NSCLC and CRC. DanDrit is now focusing its clinical development on advanced colorectal cancer, but DanDrit may if opportunity arises extend its range of cancer targets to answer the desperate need for effective new therapies. As an illustration, bladder cancers or esophageal cancers may be such opportunities. The two types of esophageal cancers the esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (EC) and the esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) expressed MAGE -A. Worldwide, EC is the most frequent malignant esophageal cancer accounting for at least 10,000 deaths per year. But in Western countries, EAC is the most rapidly increasing cancer compared with other malignancies. Surgical resection is currently the only potential cure with or without neo-adjuvant or adjuvant chemo-and/or radiotherapy, the five year survival rate is less than 20%. At first presentation, approximately 50-60% of patients with esophageal cancer are not eligible for surgery and have a very poor outcome. 

&#160; 

Tolerogenic Dendritic Cells 

&#160; 

Some dendritic cells seem to instruct cell-killing T cell clones to abandon their mission by self-destructing through an apoptotic pathway. This may offer the possibility of eliminating those T cells responsible for the manifestation of auto-immune disease. In MCV dendritic cells are derived in such a way that the resulting dendritic cells promote an immune reaction. However, dendritic cells may also be derived in such a way that they are tolerogenic, they promote immune tolerance. Promoting immune tolerance can be used to treat autoimmune diseases such as early stage type I diabetes (where insulin secreting cells are still present) or even to help prevent rejection of tissue transplantation. In this way the tolerogenic dendritic cells are used to turn off an undesirable immune reaction. DanDrit has established methods to derive tolerogenic dendritic cells from peripheral blood monocytes, similar to the approach used to generate immunogenic dendritic cells in MCV. Tolerogenic dendritic cells are easily distinguished by their function in vitro. DanDrit has filed patents to cover the generation of tolerogenic dendritic cells. 

&#160; 

Non-Core Products &#8211; Out-licensing 

&#160; 

Non-core patents are being developed for application in dendritic cell related applications that are not cancer-related. We believe that revenues from licensing such non-core products will support core product and core technology development. 

&#160; 

The principal non-core intellectual property relates to tolerogenic dendritic cells, their production and application in auto-immune diseases to include type 1 diabetes. DanDrit&#8217;s fast track production methods for dendritic cells might be out-licensed for non-competitive applications in areas other than cancer. 

&#160; 

Fast-track production of Dendritic Cells 

&#160; 

The generation of mature immunogenic dendritic cells from peripheral blood monocytes requires eight days of growth in culture. The efficiency of producing MCV could be improved if the time required to generate dendritic cells could be significantly reduced. DanDrit has tested many protocols for generating dendritic cells quickly. Two promising methods have emerged from intensive research activities to generate dendritic cells in either two days or five days. The fast track methods for generating dendritic cells produce immunogenic dendritic cells that are comparable to cells generated using DanDrit&#8217;s standard technique. These fast track methods are covered by DanDrit&#8217;s existing dendritic cell technology patent. 

&#160; 

This fast-track production technology could be of commercial interest for other companies working in non-competitive areas of dendritic cell technology. 

&#160; 

MicroRNAs for dendritic cell quality control 

&#160; 

DanDrit patented a method using microRNAs to characterize dendritic cells and establish a basis for quality control. To date there are few dendritic-cell specific antigens and those existing are covered by patents. DanDrit has patented its microRNA approach developed with Bioneer (note that patents are 100% owned by DanDrit).

Proposed Clinical Trial 

&#160; 

The proposed Phase III study with an adaptive design plans to enroll 174 stage IV colorectal cancer patients after resection of metastases and chemotherapy. Regulatory authorities in the United States and Europe have published guidance documents on the use and implementation of adaptive design trials. These documents include descriptions of adaptive trials and a requirement for prospectively written standard operating procedures and working processes for executing adaptive trials. 

&#160; 

The proposed patients in the trial will therefore have no evidence of disease. The clinical study is designed as a randomized, multicenter, Phase III clinical study. Patients will be included after resection of their primary tumor and metastases in liver and after appropriate peri- or post-operative chemotherapy by random assignment to a non-vaccine control group or a vaccine group receiving five vaccinations with 14-day administration intervals followed by ten vaccines with two-month intervals. Inclusion is planned to take place one month after finishing the last round of peri- or post-operative chemotherapy (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) and after a negative tumor scan (head, thoracic and abdominal cavities) and normal CarcinoEmbryogenic Antigen (CEA) blood levels prior to inclusion in the vaccine or the control groups. In the event of disease progression, as verified by tumor scan during the vaccination schedule, MCV vaccinations will be discontinued. The table below summarizes the key features of the proposed clinical study. 

&#160; 

Traditionally drug development has consisted of a sequence of independent trials organized in different phases. Full development typically involved (1) a learning phase II trial and (2) one or two confirmatory pivotal phase III trial(s). The new seamless phase II/III designs are aimed at interweaving the two phases of full development by combining them into one single, uninterrupted study conducted in two steps. Adaptive seamless clinical trial designs have proved to be effective in several clinical research areas, such as the development of Velcade&#8482; intended for multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 analog (dulaglutide) in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of overweight/obese patients with type 2 diabetes: the EGO study. Adaptive seamless phase II/III designs enable a clinical trial to be conducted in steps with the sample size calculation selected on the basis of data observed in the first step to continue along to the second step. The main statistical challenge in such a design is ensuring control of the type I error rate. Most methodology for such trials is based on the same endpoint being used for interim and final analyses. However, in some settings like our clinical trial, the primary endpoint, overall survival, can be observed only after long-term follow-up. In this case the design includes a shorter term endpoint data, in our case, relapse free survival at 18 months. If short-term data are available for some patients for whom the primary endpoint is not available, basing treatment selection on these data may lead to increase of the type I error rate (false positive).

Critical Success Factors 

&#160; 

The points below are a specific, focused list of critical factors and challenges that need to be considered for the project, during the critical start-up phase and throughout the project life cycle. In addition to the sections noted below, during the course of the study, DanDrit will be pro-active in discussing the Critical Factors with the investigators. 

&#160; 

Oncology studies by their nature have a degree of complexity not always encountered in other therapeutic areas. We believe success of the CRC study will be related to these Critical Success Factors. Our approach to each critical factor is detailed below. DanDrit identified the following key factors for success: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Patient accrual and site selection &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Assessment of patient response &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Study design and collection of patient data &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Vaccine supply &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Patient safety &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Multinational regulatory requirements &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; CRO previous experience &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Adaptive trial design experience &#160; 

Patient accrual and site selection 

&#160; 

The proposed VIVA clinical trial will enroll 174 patients at 35 GISCAD sites in Italy. Additional patients (number to be estimated based on interim data) will be enrolled from the US. 

&#160; 

The selected patient population will be easier to work with than the patients in Phase II. It is reasonable to expect the response rate to be greater for MCV, or for any immunotherapy, in a patient population with minimal residual disease). Consequently, in this Phase III trial, patients will have to be NED, raising the likelihood that the immune system can generate a response against cancer as it re-occurs. We believe this may ultimately lead to better data from the Phase III trial. Careful selection of study sites using evidence based feasibility research, discussion with colorectal key opinion leaders (KOLs), contact with investigators at key sites and our past clinical experience in this indication and with cancer vaccines will be required. The GISCAD Foundation for Research on Cancer (GISCAD) in Italy (Pr. Sobrero) is recognized as among the world&#8217;s premier cancer research and treatment facilities and leaders in colorectal cancer research. As an illustration GISCAD conducted recently the TOSCA trial, a clinical trial evaluating FOLFOX-4 3 months vs. 6 Months and Bevacizumab as adjuvant therapy for patients with Stage II/III CRC. The network of Italian hospitals enrolled 3,800 patients in the recent Thiazolidinediones or Sulfonylureas and Cardiovascular Accidents (TOSCA) trial. 

&#160; 

Accrual rates are estimates and can be further refined. Inadequate enrollment is one of the biggest drivers of wasted cost and time in clinical trials. Therefore, DanDrit has taken a very conservative position regarding site selection and patient enrollment. 

&#160; 

&#160; 19 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Assessment of patient response 

&#160; 

In general, in oncology vaccine studies, the relationship between clinical response, survival (and other measures of efficacy) and immune response may be unclear. Changes in patients&#8217; immunological profiles during vaccination protocols, their response to the vaccine components as measured by delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), used as the primary measure of the ability to immunize a patient to a tumor cell or specific tumor antigen; the enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT), a common method for monitoring immune responses In humans; cluster of differentiation (CD) antigen profiles, protocol used for the identification and investigation of cell surface molecules ; and other strategies to attempt to correlate treatment outcome with the results of vaccination are variable. The paper describing the Phase II study in CRC patients by Toh et al indicates that a plasma protein expression profile has been identified for responding patients. Continued evaluation of immunological profiles of the patients and the collection of these data and correlation with outcomes may be desirable but for this POC study will not be necessary. 

&#160; 

In a guidance document by the FDA, &#8220;Clinical Considerations for Therapeutic Cancer Vaccines&#8221; (September 2009), the agency recognizes that immunological approaches to tumor control may require significant time to develop, and that careful clinical assessment of patients must be performed as well as the use of methods that rely on radiological measurement of tumor size (e.g. RECIST). The guidance indicates that for cancer vaccines, patients may be observed to develop indications of progressive disease based on radiological measurement, but that these indications may also be transient and that tumor regression is still a possibility as the immunological response develops. Methods to incorporate such an approach will help avoid premature termination of study treatment for some patients. 

&#160; 

Tumor burden has also been a confounding problem for oncology vaccine development because of tumor-induced immune-suppression in some patients and because of progression prior to immune response. These issues may be obviated in this study of no-evident-disease subjects. 

&#160; 

Patient safety 

&#160; 

DanDrit believes that MCV appears to be safe and well tolerated in studies to date. Adverse events related to the vaccine appear to be Grade 1-2 and consist of mostly superficial toxicities as describe above. Patients in the proposed study will have recovered from previous treatments and will be apparently disease free: thus, at this time, only general safety precautions and observations related to the patient population are recommended. 

&#160; 

Injection site reactions and other toxicities expected in the class of DC vaccines will be included in site training. Some volume of Severe Adverse Events can be anticipated in a population of advanced CRC patients. Discrimination of events related to vaccine against a background of underlying disease and prior chemo or and/or radiotherapy will be necessary. 

&#160; 

In addition to reviewing assignment of causality, a independent Data and Safety management Co mittee will assist in the assessment for efficacy. 

&#160; 

Regulatory 

&#160; 

DanDrit will seek scientific advice from AIFA (Italian agency) and the the European Medicines Agency EMEA (ATMP) in connection with the Phase III trials in Italy. GISCAD provided preparation and assistance for the Scientific Advice process in EMEA including the following activities: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Regulatory review of pertinent data &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Discussions/kick off meeting with DanDrit contact(s), for background, pertinent issues, proposed questions, strategic discussion etc. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Prepare a briefing package for Scientific Advice includes QC using the existing information in the Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier (IMPD)/Investigator Brochure (IB) as the basis for the package &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Set up and attend meeting with EU regulatory agency and conduct all associated administrative tasks (letters, post meeting minutes, etc.) &#160; 

&#160; 20 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We are seeking a clinical trial authorization to commence a Phase III trial in Italy which we anticipate will run over a three year period. Ordinarily a drug requires two Phase III trials before it can apply for FDA approval. Consequently the first patient for Phase III could be considered commencement of &#8216;pivotal&#8217; trials for MCV. Also, DanDrit intends to move to a pivotal trial in China with a Chinese partner. Currently, the China Food and Drug Administration offers a low-cost clinical development pathway for cancer drugs developed, manufactured and commercialized in China. DanDrit intends to file an investigational new drug (IND) application with the FDA to initiate the process to permit manufacturing capability of MCV in the U.S. and to include U.S. patients in the Phase III trials initiated in Italy. Once an IND application has been filed in the U.S., we believe that we will be able to expand the Phase III trials initiated in Europe to the U.S., however we cannot estimate at this time when we will be able to begin enrolling U.S. patients in the trial. 

&#160; &#160; 

Our Competitive Strengths 

&#160; 

We believe our following strengths position us to increase our revenue and profitability: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Cutting Edge Technology. We believe immunotherapy is one of the waves of the future in cancer treatment. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Colorectal Market Potential. Colorectal cancer is a large market with a well identified unmet medical need for safe maintenance therapy. The clinical data for MCV to date gives the potential for the vaccine to eventually become the standard of care for maintenance therapy. We believe that MCV has the potential to alter the treatment paradigm by prolonging periods of remission after response to chemotherapy. If MCV works as expected in colorectal cancer, we believe it would likely prove beneficial in other tumors that over-express MAGE-A including lung, breast and esophageal cancer. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Regulatory Precedent. Dendreon with Provenge&#8482;, its prostate cancer vaccine, pioneered the regulatory pathway for MCV. Dendreon worked with the FDA to develop the protocols allowing a cellular therapy such as MCV to be approved for clinical use. DanDrit could be the next generation of dendritic cell vaccine with several improvements over its competition: stimulate a cellular immune response rather than just an antibody response, no need for leukapheresis to produce the vaccine, intradermal administration, convenience of an allogenic vaccine, polytopic approach but with a focus on the MAGE-A antigen family and reliable manufacturing. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Successful Use in Singapore. The Singapore National Cancer Center have provided MCV to colorectal cancer patients within an on-going compassionate use program in Singapore. Based on that experience, DanDrit is seeking a potential collaboration with a Chinese oncology pharma partner that may speed up large scale commercialization of MCV. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Strong IP Protection. The technology is patented with a long patent life. DanDrit owns 100% of the technology, without intellectual property issues. &#160; 

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

Our strategy is focused on conducting the VIVA clinical trial in advanced colorectal cancer that may trigger a partnership deal that, if successful, should bring a significant return on investment (based on analysis of past acquisitions of peer cancer vaccine companies). 

&#160; 

DanDrit intends to conduct a randomized multicenter clinical trial to determine the ability of MCV to prevent recidivism in stage IV colorectal patients with no evidence of disease after surgical resection of metastasis and chemotherapy. The same need for a safe effective maintenance therapy exists for stage III colorectal cancer patients with no evidence of disease after resection. 

&#160; 

&#160; 21 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

This VIVA trial is planned to be completed within three years in Italy. DanDrit&#8217;s management is confident that upcoming clinical data will be the catalyst to unlock commercial revenues for DanDrit through either acquisition by pharmaceutical partner or licensing deals that would yield upfront and milestone payments as well as royalties. 

&#160; 

We are also considering a registration trial to support potential approval of MCV in China. This trial would be conducted under China Food and Drug Administration regulations with a Chinese oncology pharmaceutical partner, such as the TASLY Group or 3S Bio. Contacts with 3S Bio and the TASLY Group have already been initiated. China has recently put in place a drug approval system that includes a low-cost first clinical approval pathway especially for Chinese biotechnology companies. The approval for local biotechnology players is advantageous, since costs for a pivotal clinical trial in China are estimated at one tenth of EU or U.S. costs. Therefore, we plan to collaborate with a Chinese company such as the TASLY Group to develop, manufacture and sell MCV in China. Several factors are also making a partnership with a Chinese pharmaceutical company attractive: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; For registration, the clinical trial can only be performed in sites approved by the China Food and Drug Administration. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Screening for MAGE-A could be attractive to the China Food and Drug Administration, but tumor samples could not be shipped outside of China for genomic testing. Therefore a partner who can perform MAGE-A screening in China is valuable. &#160; 

In addition, the China Food and Drug Administration relies more than other agencies on risk benefit assessment. Risk benefit assessment in China remains the &#8220;heart&#8221; of determining the value of products and is a more favorable assessment approach to MCV as the vaccine is, thus far, well tolerated with what DanDrit believes to be a strong safety profile (due to dendritic cell technology). 

&#160; 

Furthermore, due to high unmet medical need, the approval for cancer drugs is also more favorable than in other regions of the world. Because cancer is the first cause of mortality in China, the approval process for oncology drugs benefits from easier rules than those that govern drugs targeting other diseases. The State Food and Drug Administration (the predecessor of China Food and Drug Administration) granted 114 CTA approvals for oncology global/regional trials from 2005 to 2010. Generally, in order to approve a cancer drug in China: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Usually only one pivotal study is required &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; With only 100 to 800 patients (most likely 300 patients) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; An open-label study design is accepted (without placebo control) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The statistical consideration are also attractive as relatively low statistical significance (P value 0.03~0.05) is required &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Overall additional flexibility exists for oncology drugs, driven by the benefit/risk ratio &#160; 

Furthermore, a special review and approval procedure applies to oncology drugs. The review and approval procedure could shorten the review time and can enhance communication with the China Food and Drug Administration. By the end of 2010, 28 drugs obtained approval, and more than half were oncology drugs (ten chemical drugs, and five biologics). 

&#160; 

We believe that it is important to take advantage of this development opportunity quickly as the paradigm for oncology drug development is changing rapidly in China: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; There is an unprecedented number of anti-cancer therapies in development and the standard of care changes quickly &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The complexity of information concerning tumor genetics and signaling pathways is growing and will bring greater opportunities for personalized medicine &#160;

Industry 

&#160;

DanDrit&#8217;s lead products for NSCLC and CRC address about 40% of all cancer deaths. Other important cancers include Breast (8% of deaths), Prostate (6% of deaths) and Pancreas (6% of deaths). Together these top 5 cancers are responsible for 60% of all cancer deaths.

There were 14.1 million new cancer cases, 8.2 million cancer deaths and 32.6 million people living with cancer (within 5 years of diagnosis) in 2012 worldwide.. Cancer is still the main cause of death in developed countries &#8211; accounting for ~33% of death and remains an area of huge unmet medical need. The cancer market has a high growth potential for the coming years with an expected 7% annual growth rate for the years 2011- 2018. The American Cancer Society disclosed that there were 1,638,910 new cancer cases in the US for 2012 with 577,190 associated deaths.

&#160;

In Europe the number of new cancer cases for 2012 was estimated at 3.45 million with a 1.75 million deaths. The cancer market is the fastest growing pharmaceutical market with $83 billion expected growth of the cancer drug market by 2020.

&#160;

The per-treatment price of chemotherapy for CRC is approximately $30,000. We expect that, if our vaccine is approved for use in CRC patients, the cost per-treatment will be approximately equal to the per-treatment cost of chemotherapy.

&#160;

Due to its safety profile, MCV should fit easily into the treatment paradigm of most cancers. The initial label of adjuvant therapy for stage IV colorectal cancer with no evidence of disease after surgical resection of metastases could be a door opener for the larger colorectal cancer market. DanDrit&#8217;s pharmaceutical partner should be able to grow the label to the larger adjuvant for stage III colorectal cancer market.

&#160;

&#160; 23 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Colorectal Cancer 

&#160;

The figure below presents the market opportunity for MCV in advanced colorectal treatment.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Despite numerous therapeutic advances, colorectal cancer continues to be associated with one of the worst survival rates of all cancers. Metastatic liver disease is found in 10% to 25% of patients having surgery for primary colorectal cancer instead of liver metastasis are detected in 40-50% of patients with diagnosed colon cancer . Then, standard of care &#8220;treatment&#8221; for colorectal cancer patients after resection surgery and chemotherapy is only observation. When surgical resections of liver metastases are possible, as in 20% of the affected patients, five years survival may approach 35%. According to the most recent papers, the median RFS in patients receiving combined surgery and chemotherapy with No Evidence of Disease is 24-26 months. The same need for a safe effective maintenance therapy exists for stage III colorectal cancer patients with no evidence of disease after surgical resection and chemotherapy. 

&#160; 

&#160; We believe that it is of great importance for colorectal cancer patients receiving surgery alone or surgery combined with peri- or post-operative chemotherapy, that new and more effective therapies are developed and offered in the post-treatment period. The aim of the proposed trial is to study whether our lead vaccine can increase the progression-free survival for these patients. 

&#160; 

Licensing Potential and Cooperation Agreements 

&#160; 

The following discussion represents opportunities that we believe can expand the use of our technology. 

&#160; 

Alliance with Chinese Company 

&#160; 

In addition of the size of their national market, Chinese biotech firms currently benefit from a low cost first clinical development path. The Chinese approval process is favorable for local biotechnology companies. With a Chinese partner, we plan to conduct a Phase III trial in China for lower costs than in the U.S. and at a faster pace. A successful Phase III trial could result in large scale commercialization in China and Southeast Asia. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, the domestic market in China for cancer therapies is expected to grow due to a large aging population, expanded insurance coverage, higher government healthcare spending, rising disposable incomes and the high incidence of cancer among the population. In spite of recent price cuts, we believe that the market for cancer therapies in China represents a long-term opportunity based on the factors set forth above.

&#160;

It has been estimated that almost 4 million Chinese &#8212; out of a total population of 1.35 billion &#8212; develop cancer every year, and nearly 3 million die from the disease annually. In China, cancer is now the leading cause of mortality.

&#160;

Although China has less than 20% of the world&#8217;s population, it accounts for more than 25% of global cancer deaths. The majority of cancers in China are now caused by unhealthy diets, increased alcohol consumption, sedentary lifestyles, obesity, smoking and environmental pollution. A rapidly aging population will further increase China&#8217;s cancer burden.

&#160;

China&#8217;s population is becoming wealthier and more urbanized &#8212; meaning that more Chinese are looking for greater access to medical care and are demanding better quality medical products and services. By 2025, China&#8217;s urban middle class population is expected to represent almost 70% of the country&#8217;s total population.

&#160; 

&#160; 24 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Alliance Strategy 

&#160; 

In addition to its lead compound MCV, DanDrit has built a pipeline of dendritic cell based cancer therapies, currently addressing 40% of all cancer-related deaths. MCV can be indicated to cancers over-expressing MAGE-A. Cancers over-expressing MAGE-A include among others, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and esophageal cancers. DanDrit intends to work with strategic partners to strengthen the in-house pipeline. 

&#160; 

We control key technologies with relevance outside our core business area and these we may out-license or co-develop with suitable partners. 

&#160; 

MyTomorrows 

&#160; 

In December 2013, DanDrit entered an agreement with MyTomorrows (&#8220;MT&#8221;), a Dutch company, regarding a Patient Name Use Program (PNU) for MCV. This program will allow DanDrit to sell MCV for one year of treatment (10 vaccines) to cancer patients through MT. MT offers a worldwide online platform providing access to non-registered medicines for patients with life threatening diseases. 

&#160; 

MT is a turnkey solution and will be in charge of regulatory, recruitment, logistics, and pharmacovigilance. DanDrit&#8217;s potential liabilities are limited to quality control of cGMP manufacturing of MCV. DanDrit expects several benefits from this agreement. First,DanDrit anticipates minor short term revenue generation as MT will transfer payment as soon as a patient orders MCV. DanDrit also anticipates that this program may contribute to lowering the cost of manufacturing of the clinical lot through economy of scale. Finally, this program may also generate real life data for MCV. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

In 2012, DanDrit has out-sourced the GMP manufacturing of its lysate. We believe that proving that our technology transfer was possible was a key step in finding and working with a future pharmaceuticals partner. DanDrit evaluated several possible EU-based contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) and selected Cellin Technologies, a CMO based in Tallin, Estonia. The collaboration with Cellin Technologies in Estonia demonstrated that GMP production of lysate could not only be transferred but that the production could be scaled up. We consider that the potential economy of scale that can be expected in the cost of lysate production could become a competitive advantage versus other cancer vaccine companies using recombinant production of cancer-specific antigens (i.e. Mage-A3 from GSK). Also, the collaboration with the Estonian CMO is based on a pure fee-for-services basis and can be discontinued at any time without notice. 

&#160; 

DanDrit intends to establish a closed fully automatized manufacturing process. We learned from the Dendreon&#8217;s experience that an efficient manufacturing process should be in place before approval for commercialization. Cost saving should be expected from a fully automatized vaccine production. We also assume that a fully efficient manufacturing process may increase the value of a deal with a pharmaceutical partner. 

&#160; 

Cell Banking 

&#160; 

The melanoma cell lines used by DanDrit in the production of our lysate (MCL) are stored at ultra-low temperature in liquid nitrogen at Symbion Science Park, Copenhagen, Denmark. Both master- and working cell banks are stored this way and the contents of the cell banks (both master and working) are recorded in log books. Nitrogen levels are maintained by the staff of DanDrit Biotech at least once a week and any activity in regards to storage (shipment of cells, nitrogen levels etc.) are documented in the appropriate log book. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, for security reasons, samples of the master cell banks are also stored at specialized cell storage facilities in England. In addition, samples of one working cell bank from the DDM1.7 cell line are stored at Cellin technologies in Estonia for production purposes. 

&#160; 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 

&#160; 

The business model of DanDrit is to focus on early development of dendritic cell based vaccine. We have significantly reduced the fixed costs linked with our operation and do not intend to build an expensive marketing, sales and distribution organization. We will rely on pharmaceutical partners with demonstrated relevant experience in commercialization of cancer products to market, sell and distribute MCV. At completion of the comparative clinical trial, we plan to enter into a collaboration agreement with a pharmaceutical partner regarding the regulatory approval, marketing, sales and distribution of MCV.

&#160; 

&#160; 25 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

As a company primarily focused on pharmaceutical research, we expect that our most valuable assets are our intellectual property. This includes U.S. and foreign patents, patent applications, common-law trademarks, trade secrets and know-how. We are pursuing an aggressive intellectual property strategy. 

&#160; 

DanDrit intends to aggressively defend its patents through legal process if necessary. Where appropriate, DanDrit may in-license intellectual property that may add to the strength and defense of our core business. DanDrit&#8217;s intellectual property comprises patents, trademarks, copyright and secret know-how. 

&#160; 

DanDrit&#8217;s core business is cancer therapy. Where DanDrit&#8217;s patents and secret know-how are applicable to non-core business areas we will consider out-licensing for relevant non-core applications. 

&#160; 

DanDrit filed its first Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) patent application on November 29, 2002 with priority claimed from 2001 with the Danish application, shortly after our formation. 

&#160; 

DanDrit may continue to patent its innovations, such as novel dendritic cell production systems or dendritic cell quality control. To support potential income streams DanDrit may patent non-core applications of its dendritic cell technologies so as to secure future revenue streams from out-licensing activity. 

&#160; 

Patents 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Pharmaceutical composition for inducing an immune response in a human or animal (2001 Denmark (DK), 2002 PCT) &#160; &#160; This patent was first filed in November 2002. The patent covers and describes the usage of an allogenic melanoma cell lysate (MCL)-pulsed autologous DC vaccine expressing at least one of six MAGE-A antigens overexpressed by the cell line being the source of the lysate. The patent covers the antigen composition used in the generation of MelCancerVac and the claims for producing MelCancerVac. In this patent the antigens are specified to mainly belong to the cancer testis family. The family of antigens is expressed in a wide variety of cancer forms. In the International Preliminary Report on Patentability (IPRP) all claims were determined to be novel and inventive. The patent expiry date is November 29, 2022. This patent has been granted in: Europe, the USA, China, Australia, Singapore, Japan, Russia, Hong Kong. This patent is pending in: Israel and Norway. This patent is owned by the Company and was not licensed from third parties. The patent protection means that the cancer specific antigen-rich lysate obtained from our cell line cannot be commercially made, used, distributed or sold without DanDrit's consent. These patent rights can be usually enforced in a court, which, in most systems, holds the authority to stop patent infringement. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Protocol for generating dendritic cells (2005 DK, 2008 PCT) &#160; &#160; This patent covers the generation of dendritic cells based on a blood sample of 200 ml. The patent differs from other DC generating patents by the utilization of reduced temperature and a single blood sample. DCs exposed to tumor antigens followed by treatment with T(h)1-polarizing differentiation signals have paved the way for the development of DC-based cancer vaccines. Critical parameters for generation of optimal functional clinical grade DCs are a very competitive area. DanDrit has developed a method that covers the generation of immature dendritic cells under reduced temperature settings which by further activation has been shown to give a high yield of homogeneous and fully matured DCs. This patent was filed on December 7, 2006. In the International Preliminary Report on Patentability (IPRP) a large majority of claims were found to be novel and inventive. The patent expiry date is 2032. This patent was granted in 2012 in China, Eurasia, Russia, Europe, Israel, Mexico, Malaysia, New Zealand. This patent is owned by DanDrit and was not licensed from third parties. The patent protection means that the method that DanDrit use to generate dendritic cells cannot be commercially used, distributed or sold without DanDrit's consent. These patent &#160; rights can be usually enforced in a court, which, in most systems, holds the authority to stop patent infringement. &#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Method for generating tolerogenic dendritic cells employing decreased temperature (2007) &#160; &#160; DanDrit has expanded the method of development of mature dendritic cells to also include the generation of regulatory DCs. In addition to DCs used for cancer immunotherapy, DanDrit has developed an additional arm of DCs, namely regulatory/tolerogenic DCs to be used for treatment of various autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes and Multiple Sclerosis. This patent was filed on November 13, 2008. Patent pending: worldwide. 1st Office Action received in Europe August 25, 2010. This patent is owned by the Company and was not licensed from third parties. The patent protection means that the method that DanDrit use to produce tolerogenic dendritic cells cannot be commercially used, distributed or sold without DanDrit's consent. These patent &#160; rights can be usually enforced in a court, which, in most systems, holds the authority to stop patent infringement. &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Micro RNAs as markers of the functional state of a dendritic cell &#160; &#160; This patent covers and demonstrates that functionally different DCs carry unique microRNA signatures. By examining a handful of microRNA profiles one can analyze the function of DC vaccines. We believe this is a valuable addition to other vaccine quality control measures that are currently used in studies that involve DCs. Critical parameters for assessment of the optimal functional state of DCs and prediction of the vaccine potency of activated DCs have in the past been based on measurements of differentiation surface markers like HLA-DR, CD80, CD83, CD86, and CCR7 and the level of secreted cytokines like interleukin-12p70. However, the level of these markers does not provide a complete picture of the DC phenotype and may be insufficient for prediction of clinical outcome for DC-based therapy. We have identified additional biomarkers by investigating the differential expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in mature DCs relative to immature DCs. The patent was filed on November 14, 2008. In the International Preliminary Report on Patentability, a large majority of claims were found to be novel and inventive. Patent pending: Europe and USA. 1st Office Action received in Europe on August 18, 2010. Follow up action on election restriction received in the USA on October 21, 2010. This patent is owned by the Company and was not licensed from third parties. The patent protection means that the method that DanDrit use to test and release its dendritic cells cannot be commercially used, distributed or sold without DanDrit's consent. These patent rights can be usually enforced in a court, which, in most systems, holds the authority to stop patent infringement. &#160; 

All of the above patents are protected by relevant international extensions.

Governmental Regulation 

&#160; 

Orphan Drug status for MCV 

&#160; 

The United States and Europe may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process, but does make the product eligible for orphan drug exclusivity, reduced filing fees and specific tax credits. Generally, if a company receives the first marketing approval for a product with an orphan drug designation in the clinical indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA will not approve another application to market the same drug for the same indication, except in limited circumstances, for a period of seven years in the United States. This exclusivity, however, could block the approval of our proposed product candidates if a competitor obtains marketing approval before us. We plan to apply for orphan drug status for MCV to treat stage IV CRC with NED after surgical resection and chemotherapy if we meet the eligibility criteria. However, note that, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity MCV, we may not be able to maintain the status. For example, if a competitive product is shown to be clinically superior to our product, any orphan drug exclusivity we have will not block the approval of such competitive product. 

&#160; 

Fast Track designation for development of MCV 

&#160; 

We intend to request Fast Track designation for MCV. If a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, the drug sponsor may apply for FDA Fast Track designation for a particular indication. Marketing applications filed by sponsors of products in Fast Track development may qualify for priority review under the policies and procedures offered by the FDA, but the Fast Track designation does not assure any such qualification or ultimate marketing approval by the FDA. Receipt of Fast Track designation may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures. In addition, the FDA may withdraw any Fast Track designation at any time. We may seek Fast Track designation for our vaccine product candidates or any other product candidates, but the FDA may not grant this status to any of our proposed product candidates. 

&#160; 

Approval for Commercialization 

&#160; 

MCV and any future product candidates that we will be developing will require approval of the FDA before they can be marketed in the U.S. Although our focus at this time is primarily on the U.S. market, in the future similar approvals will need to be obtained from foreign regulatory agencies before we can market our current and proposed product candidates in other countries. 

&#160; 

The process for filing and obtaining FDA approval to market therapeutic products is both time-consuming and costly, with no certainty of a successful outcome. The historical failure rate for companies seeking to obtain FDA approval of therapeutic products is high and, with the exception of Dendreon Corp.&#8217;s dendritic cell vaccine for the treatment of prostate cancer, no cancer stem cell or dendritic cell-based cancer vaccine has to date been approved by the FDA. This process includes conducting extensive pre-clinical research and clinical testing, which may take longer and cost more than we initially anticipate due to numerous factors, including without limitation, difficulty in securing appropriate centers to conduct trials, difficulty in enrolling patients in conformity with required protocols in a timely manner, unexpected adverse reactions by patients in the trials to our proposed product candidates and changes in the FDA&#8217;s requirements for our testing during the course of that testing. 

&#160; 

&#160; 28 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The time required to obtain FDA and other approvals is unpredictable but often can exceed five years following the commencement of clinical trials, depending upon the complexity of the product and other factors. Any analysis we perform of data from preclinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We may also encounter unexpected delays or increased costs due to a variety of reasons, including new government regulations from future legislation or administrative actions or from changes in FDA policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and FDA regulatory review. 

&#160; 

Any delay or failure in our clinical trial program and in obtaining required approvals would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues from the particular product. Furthermore, any regulatory approval to market a product may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market the product. These limitations may limit the size of the market for the product. 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

We are subject to a broad range of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations which govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges and the handling, storage disposal and release of wastes and hazardous substances. It is our policy to comply with applicable environmental requirements at all of our facilities. We are also subject to laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), that may impose liability retroactively and without fault for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at on-site or off-site locations. We are subject to similar requirements in Denmark and other European countries. 

&#160; 

Research and Development &#160; 

&#160; 

Research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred and consist primarily of clinical trial costs for the Company&#8217;s VIVA Phase III clinical trial, related party manufacturing costs, consulting costs, contract research and development costs, and compensation costs. 

&#160; 

Discovery and preclinical research and development expenses include costs for substantial external scientific personnel, technical and regulatory advisers, and others, costs of laboratory supplies used in our internal research and development projects, travel, regulatory compliance, and expenditures for preclinical and clinical trial operation and management when we are actively engaged in clinical trials. Because we are pre-revenue company, we do not allocate research and development costs on a project basis. We adopted this policy, in part, due to the unreasonable cost burden associated with accounting at such a level of detail and our limited number of financial and personnel resources. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

There is extensive competition in the biopharmaceutical industry and the technology is developing rapidly. DanDrit is developing a vaccine for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer, where competing products may be introduced. If these newly developed products are more efficient, cheaper, more patient-friendly, safer, or better placed than DanDrit&#8217;s vaccine candidates, or if DanDrit&#8217;s competitors develop drugs that reduce or eliminate the need for DanDrit&#8217;s vaccine candidates, such competition could reduce or eliminate DanDrit&#8217;s commercial opportunities. Many of DanDrit&#8217;s competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than DanDrit and significantly more experience than DanDrit with preclinical and clinical research and development and in obtaining regulatory approval of pharmaceutical products. 

&#160; 

DanDrit&#8217;s drugs may face competition as a result of many factors, including the route of administration (e.g. oral administration vs. injection), the availability and cost of production, efficiency of DanDrit&#8217;s partners&#8217; marketing and sales efforts as well as the price of DanDrit&#8217;s products. DanDrit has limited or no previous experience in these areas. DanDrit&#8217;s inability to compete effectively would have a material adverse effect on DanDrit&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth opportunities. At this time, DanDrit does not represent a significant presence in the biopharmaceutical industry. 

&#160; 

Several companies are trying to capitalize on the growing interest for immunotherapy in the treatment of cancer.

Two Directly Competing Companies 

&#160; 

The figure below outlines the competitive landscape for MCV. Note that colorectal cancer, while providing a large market opportunity (it is the second most killer cancer after lung cancer), offers a more robust competitive landscape than other cancers. In the colorectal cancer space DanDrit faces two main competitors: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Bavarian Nordic (&#8220;BN&#8221;): CV-301, BN&#8217;s second compound, is in clinical development with advanced colorectal cancer patients &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Immatics: its second compound is in clinical development in early stage colorectal cancer patients &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Bavarian Nordic (BAVA.CO) and CV-301 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

With its lead vaccine Prostvac&#8482; from Therion Biologics and NCI, Bavarian Nordic (BN) also acquired Panvac&#8482; vaccine. This PANVAC&#8482; vaccine failed to prove efficacy in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who failed gemcitabine. BN is currently focusing its efforts on Prostvac&#8482; for treatment of prostate cancer, currently in Phase III. However, in 2012, BN re-initiated the clinical development of Panvac&#8482; (re-named CV-301). 

&#160; 

CV-301 is a cancer immunotherapy product candidate incorporating two antigens, CEA and MUC-1, in a viral vector. CV-301 is an off-the-shelf immunotherapy product candidate for the treatment of multiple cancers. It originates from the same poxvirus technology platform as PROSTVAC&#8482;. Both PROSTVAC&#8482; and CV-301 are prime-boost vaccines sequentially combining two different poxviruses (vaccinia and fowlpox). 

&#160; 

CV-301 had been studied in different cancers in clinical trials led by the National Cancer Institute. One study was a randomized Phase II trial in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The study enrolled 48 patients to receive CV-301 in combination with docetaxel or docetaxel alone. The primary study endpoint was PFS, while secondary endpoints included overall survival and immunologic correlative studies. A preliminary analysis of the study showed PFS of 6.6 months in the CV-301 group versus 3.8 months among those receiving docetaxel alone. Final study data are pending results from five patients that remained on study at the time of the analysis. Because of its size the study was not designed to reach statistical significance. 

&#160; 

More directly relevant to DanDrit was the colorectal Phase II study of CV-301 conducted by Morse at Duke University. The objective of the trial was to determine whether one of two vaccines based on dendritic cells and poxvectors encoding CEA and MUC1 would lengthen survival in patients with resected metastases of colorectal cancer. The studied patients were, disease-free after CRC metastasectomy and perioperative chemotherapy (n = 74). They were randomized to injections of autologous DCs modified with PANVAC (DC/PANVAC) or PANVAC with per injection GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor). Endpoints were recurrence-free survival overall survival, and rate of CEA-specific immune responses. Clinical outcome was compared with that of an unvaccinated, contemporary group of patients who had undergone CRC metastasectomy, received similar perioperative therapy, and would have otherwise been eligible for the study. 

&#160; 

&#160; 30 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The recurrence-free survival at two years was similar (47% and 55% for DC/PANVAC and PANVAC/GM-CSF, respectively). At a median follow-up of 35.7 months, there were two of 37 deaths in the DC/PANVAC arm and five of 37 deaths in the PANVAC/GM-CSF arm. The rate and magnitude of T-cell responses against CEA was statistically similar between study arms. 

&#160; 

As a group, vaccinated patients had superior survival compared with the contemporary unvaccinated group. Both DC and pox-vector vaccines had similar activity. Survival was longer for vaccinated patients than for a contemporary unvaccinated group. 

&#160; 

In 2013, Bavarian Nordic expanded its license with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for CV-301 to include colon cancer. The original collaboration agreement executed in 2011, involved multiple cancers including breast, lung, ovarian and other cancers. 

&#160; 

In 2016, BN announced that the future development of CV301 will focus on combination treatments with checkpoint inhibitors. 

&#160; 

Immatics Biotechnologies 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The second direct competitor is Immatics (previously known as Biomira), a German/ US biotech company who currently focuses its clinical efforts on a Phase III in Renal Cell Carinoma for its lead vaccine. However, Immatic also develops a vaccine in colorectal cancer (enter Phase I in 2012). Note that Immatic&#8217;s technology is peptide-based rather than a dendritic cell approach and that Immatics is targeting its vaccine toward early stage colorectal cancer rather than resected advanced colorectal cancer like Bavarian and DanDrit. This private German company only discovers and develops tumor-associated peptides for the immunotherapy of cancer. Immatics reported that they raised &#8364;53.8million in a Series C financing round to finance a Phase III pivotal trial of their lead product IMA901 which in data reported in June 2014 at ASCO demonstrated the potential to confer an overall survival benefit in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. In 2016, Immatics did not make any announcement regarding development in colorectal cancer patients.
