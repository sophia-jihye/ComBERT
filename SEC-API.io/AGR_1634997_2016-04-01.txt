 Item 1. Business 

Overview

AVANGRID, Inc., or AVANGRID, formerly Iberdrola USA, Inc., is a New York corporation headquartered in New Gloucester, Maine. We are a direct, majority owned subsidiary of Iberdrola, S.A., a corporation ( sociedad an&#243;nima ) organized under the laws of Spain, one of the world’s leading energy companies. Our primary business is ownership of our operating businesses, which are described below.

Our direct, wholly-owned subsidiaries include Avangrid Networks, Inc., or Networks, Avangrid Renewables Holdings, Inc., or ARHI, and UIL Holdings Corporation, or UIL. ARHI in turn holds subsidiaries including Avangrid Renewables LLC, or Renewables, and Enstor Gas, LLC, or Gas. Networks, along with UIL, owns and operates our regulated utility businesses, including electric transmission and distribution and natural gas distribution, transportation and sales. Renewables operates a portfolio of renewable energy generation facilities primarily using onshore wind power, and also solar, biomass and thermal power. Gas operates our natural gas storage facilities and gas trading businesses through Enstor Energy Services LLC (gas trading) and Enstor Inc. (gas storage). Avangrid Service Company, a subsidiary of Networks, provides corporate and back office services on a consolidated basis to our subsidiaries.

On December 16, 2015, we completed an acquisition, pursuant to which UIL merged with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary, Green Merger Sub, Inc., or Merger Sub, with Merger Sub surviving as our wholly-owned subsidiary. The acquisition was effected pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 25, 2015, or the Merger Agreement, by and among us, Merger Sub, and UIL. Following the completion of the acquisition, Merger Sub was renamed "UIL Holdings Corporation."

The primary business of UIL is the ownership of its operating regulated utility businesses. The utility businesses consist of the electric distribution and transmission operations of The United Illuminating Company, or UI, and the natural gas transportation, distribution and sales operations of The Southern Connecticut Gas Company, or SCG, Connecticut Natural Gas Corporation, or CNG, and The Berkshire Gas Company, or Berkshire. For purposes of this document, all references to "Networks" include UIL and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated.

After the acquisition UIL became a direct subsidiary of AVANGRID, which resulted in the following structure:

We currently anticipate that UIL and its subsidiaries will be moved under Networks in the first half of 2016. Through Networks, we own electric generation, transmission and distribution companies and natural gas distribution, transportation and sales companies in New York and Maine, and manage electric generation, transmission and distribution companies and natural gas distribution, transportation and sales companies in Connecticut and Massachusetts, delivering electricity to approximately 2.2 million electric utility customers and delivering natural gas to approximately 984,000 natural gas public utility customers as of December 31, 2015. The interstate transmission and wholesale sale of electricity by these regulated utilities is regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory 

Commission, or FERC, under the Federal Power Act, or FPA, including with respect to transmission rates. Further, Networks’ electric and gas distribution utilities in New York, Maine, Connecticut and Massachusetts are subject to regulation by the New York State Public Service Commission, or NYPSC, the Maine Public Utilities Commission, or MPUC, the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, or PURA, and the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, or DPU, respectively. Networks strives to be a leader in safety, reliability and quality of service to its utility customers. 

Through Renewables, we had a combined wind, solar and thermal installed capacity of 6,330 megawatts, or MW, as of December 31, 2015, including Renewables’ share of joint projects, of which 5,643 MW was installed wind capacity. Approximately 67% of the capacity was contracted for an average period of 9.7 years as of December 31, 2015. As the second largest wind operator in the United States based on installed capacity as of December 31, 2015, Renewables strives to lead the transformation of the U.S. energy industry to a competitive, clean energy future. Renewables currently operates 53 wind farms in 18 states across the United States. 

Through Gas, as of December 31, 2015 we own approximately 67.5 billion cubic feet, or Bcf, of net working gas storage capacity. Through Enstor Energy Services, LLC, Gas operates 53.25 Bcf of contracted or managed gas storage capacity in North America as of December 31, 2015.

Further information regarding the amount of revenues from external customers, including revenues by products and services, a measure of profit or loss and total assets for each segment for each of the last three fiscal years is provided in Note 23 of our audited combined and consolidated financial statements for the three years ended December 31, 2015, which is incorporated herein by reference.

History

We were incorporated in 1997 as a New York corporation under the name NGE Resources, Inc. and subsequently changed our name to Energy East Corporation. The stock of Energy East Corporation was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE. In 2007, Iberdrola, S.A. acquired Scottish Power Ltd., or Scottish Power, including ScottishPower Holdings, Inc., or SPHI, the parent company of Scottish Power’s U.S. subsidiaries. Through this acquisition, Iberdrola, S.A. acquired PPM Energy, a subsidiary that operated SPHI’s U.S. wind business, thermal generation operations and the gas storage and energy management businesses and changed PPM Energy’s name to Renewables. In 2008, Iberdrola, S.A. acquired Energy East Corporation and we changed our name to Iberdrola USA, Inc. in December 2009. In 2013, we completed an internal corporate reorganization to create a unified corporate presence for the Iberdrola brand in the United States, bringing all of its U.S. energy companies under one single holding company, Iberdrola USA. The internal reorganization, completed in November 2013, resulted in the concentration of our principal businesses in two major subsidiaries: Networks, which holds all of our regulated utilities; Renewables, which holds our renewable and thermal generation businesses, and gas storage and marketing businesses.

We were the corporate parent of SCG, CNG and Berkshire prior to UIL acquiring those companies in 2010.

On December 16, 2015, UIL became our wholly-owned subsidiary as a result of merging into Merger Sub, our wholly-owned subsidiary, with Merger Sub surviving as our wholly-owned subsidiary. Following the completion of the acquisition, Merger Sub was renamed "UIL Holdings Corporation" and we were renamed AVANGRID, Inc. On February 18, 2016, the following AVANGRID subsidiaries changed their names as set forth below:

"Rate base" means the net assets upon which a utility can receive a specified return, based on the value of such assets. The rate base is set by the relevant regulatory authority and typically represents the value of specified property, such as plants, facilities and other investments of the utility.

Over the last five years, Networks has invested nearly $6.0 billion in creating a delivery network with greater capacity and improved reliability, environmental security and sustainability, efficiency and automation. Networks continuously improves its grid to accommodate new requirements for advanced metering, demand response and enhanced outage management, while improving its 

flexibility for the integration and management of distributed energy resources, or DER. From 2009 to 2015, Networks increased capital expenditure investments in its New York and Maine regulated utilities by 131%, from $315.0 million to $727.0 million. 

New York

As of December 31, 2015, NYSEG served approximately 885,000 electricity customers and 265,000 natural gas customers across more than 40% of upstate New York’s geographic area, while RGE served approximately 375,000 electricity customers and 310,000 natural gas customers in a nine-county region centered around Rochester, in western New York.

In 2015, NYSEG and RGE’s nine hydroelectric plants generated nearly 366 million kilowatt-hours, or kWh, of clean hydropower, which is enough energy to power 51,000 homes across New York State, assuming an average electricity consumption of 600 kWh per month per customer. See "—Properties—Networks" for more information regarding Networks’ electric generation plants.

Networks also holds an approximate 20% ownership interest in the regulated New York TransCo, LLC, or New York TransCo. Through New York TransCo, Networks has formed a partnership along with Central Hudson Gas and Electric Corporation, Consolidated Edison, Inc., National Grid, plc and Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. to develop a portfolio of interconnected transmission lines and substations to fulfill the objectives of the New York energy highway initiative, a proposal to install up to 3,200 MW of new electric generation and transmission capacity in order to deliver more power generated from upstate New York power plants to downstate New York.

Maine

As of December 31, 2015, CMP delivered electricity to more than 616,000 customers in an 11,000 square-mile service area in central and southern Maine. CMP has completed a $1.4 billion investment plan for the construction of upgrades to the bulk power transmission grid in Maine, the largest transmission investment in the history of Maine, which includes the construction of five new 345-kilovolt, or kV, substations and related facilities linked by approximately 440 miles of new transmission lines (refers to the Maine Power Reliability Program, or MPRP). CMP in 2012 also completed a $200.0 million investment, one-half of which was funded by the Department of Energy, or DOE, in advanced meter infrastructure, which included the installation of more than 600,000 smart meters for all of its electric customers. Smart meters monitor and record a customer’s power consumption, eliminating the need for on-site meter reading.

CMP also owns 78% of the Maine Electric Power Corporation, or MEPCO, a single-asset 182 mile 345kV electric transmission line from Orrington, Maine to Wiscasset, Maine.

MNG delivers natural gas to 4,432 customers in central and southern Maine and recently completed construction of the first natural gas pipeline in Augusta, Maine. Through MNG, Networks provides these communities in southern Maine with access to natural gas for the first time, offering a competitive and clean energy option to homes and businesses.

Connecticut

As of December 31, 2015, UI served more than 331,000 residential, commercial and industrial customers in a service area of approximately 335 square miles in the southwestern part of Connecticut. The service area includes Bridgeport and New Haven and is home to a diverse array of business sectors including aerospace manufacturing, healthcare, biotech, financial services, precision manufacturing, retail and education. UI’s retail electric revenues vary by season, with the highest revenues typically in the third quarter of the year reflecting seasonal rates, hotter weather and air conditioning use.

UI is also a party to a joint venture with certain affiliates of NRG Energy, Inc., pursuant to which UI holds 50% of the membership interests in GCE Holding LLC, whose wholly owned subsidiary, GenConn Energy LLC, or GenConn, operates peaking generation plants in Devon, Connecticut, or GenConn Devon, and Middletown, Connecticut, or GenConn Middletown.

As of December 31, 2015, SCG and CNG provided local gas distribution services to approximately 364,000 customers in the greater Hartford-New Britain area, Greenwich and the southern Connecticut coast from Westport to Old Saybrook, including the cities of Bridgeport and New Haven.

Massachusetts 

As of December 31, 2015, Berkshire provided local gas distribution services to approximately 40,000 customers in a service area in western Massachusetts which includes the cities of Pittsfield, North Adams and Greenfield.

The rate base of Networks’ regulated utilities has increased significantly over the last three years, mainly due to the investments in regulated projects , such as the Maine Reliability Power Program, or MPRP, transmission project in Maine and increased replacement of aging infrastructure and investments in smart grid automation. The rate base of Networks’ regulated utilities for the years indicated below have been as follows:

Merger Settlement Agreement — Connecticut and Massachusetts 

As part of the process of seeking and obtaining regulatory approval of the acquisition in Connecticut and Massachusetts, AVANGRID and UIL reached settlement agreements with the Office of Consumer Counsel, or OCC, in Connecticut and with the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the Department of Energy Resources in Massachusetts, which settlement agreements included commitments of actions to be taken after the transaction closed. See Part II, Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Networks" for more information. 

In connection with the acquisition proceeding, UI signed a proposed partial consent order, or the consent order that, when approved by the Commissioner of DEEP, and pursuant to the terms and conditions in the consent order, would require UI to investigate and remediate certain environmental conditions within the perimeter of the English Station site. To the extent that the investigation and remediation is less than $30 million, UI would remit to the State of Connecticut the difference between such costs and $30 million for a public purpose as determined in the discretion of the Governor, the Attorney General of Connecticut and the Commissioner of DEEP. Pursuant to the consent order, upon its issuance and subject to its terms and conditions, UI would be obligated to comply with the consent order, even if the cost of such compliance exceeds $30 million. See Part I, Item 1, "Business — Environmental, Health and Safety - Management, Disposal and Remediation of Hazardous Substances" for more information.

Renewables

The Renewables business, based in Portland Oregon, is engaged primarily in the design, development, construction, management and operation of generation plants that produce electricity using renewable resources and, with more than 50 renewable energy projects, is one of the leaders in renewable energy production in the United States based on installed capacity. Renewables’ primary business is onshore wind energy generation, which represents approximately 89% of Renewables’ combined installed capacity as of December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Renewables produced approximately 14,135,000 MWh of energy through wind power generation. Renewables had a pipeline of approximately 5,900 MW of future renewable energy projects in various stages of development as of December 31, 2015.

Typically, Renewables enters into long-term lease agreements with property owners who lease their land for renewable projects. Electricity generated at a wind project is then transmitted to customers through long-term agreements with purchasers. There are a limited number of turbine suppliers in the market. Renewables’ largest turbine suppliers, Gamesa Wind US and GE Wind, in the aggregate supplied turbines which accounted for 67% of its installed capacity as of December 31, 2015.

Renewables currently operates 53 wind farms in 18 states across the United States. To monetize the tax benefits resulting from production tax credits and accelerated tax depreciation available to qualifying wind energy projects, Renewables has entered into "tax equity" financing structures with third party investors for a portion of its wind farms. Renewables holds 12 operating wind farms under these structures through limited liability companies jointly owned by one or more third party investors. These investors generally provide an up-front investment or, in some cases, enter into fixed and contingent notes for their membership interests in the financing structures. In return, the investors receive a majority or all of the cash flows and tax benefits generated by the wind farms until such benefits achieve a negotiated return on their investment. Upon attainment of this target return, the sharing of the cash flows and tax benefits flip, with Renewables receiving substantially all of these amounts thereafter. We also have an option to repurchase the investor’s interest within a certain timeframe after the target return is met. Renewables maintains operational and management control over the wind farm businesses, subject to investor approval of certain major decisions. See "—Properties—Renewables" for more information regarding Renewables’ wind power generation properties.

Additionally, as part of the Renewables portfolio, Renewables operates two thermal generation facilities in the United States, with 636 MW of combined capacity as of December 31, 2015. Renewables worked closely with the City of Klamath Falls, Oregon to develop the Klamath Plant, which has a current capacity of 536 MW, operating by creating two useful forms of energy, electricity and process steam, from a single fuel source of natural gas. In addition, Renewables operates a highly flexible 100 MW Klamath Peaking Plant adjacent to the Klamath Plant, providing customers of Renewables additional capability to meet their peak summer and winter power needs.

In addition to its wind assets, Renewables operates two solar photovoltaic facilities with an installed capacity of 50 MW. The solar photovoltaic facilities produced over 126,000 MWh of renewable energy for the year ended December 31, 2015. Solar accounted for 0.9% of the total renewable energy generation from Renewables in these same periods.

Renewables is pursuing the continued development of a large pipeline of wind energy projects in various regions across the United States. Each site features a range of different atmospheric characteristics that ultimately drive the selection of turbine technology for the proposed project. As part of Renewables’ wind resource assessment investigation, critical atmospheric parameters such as mean wind speed, extreme wind speed, turbulence intensity, and mean air density are characterized to represent long-term 

conditions, for over 20 years. The summary wind characteristics are then combined with a terrain, or orography, analysis to assess siting risks in order to mitigate any future operations and maintenance concerns that may arise due to improper turbine siting. 

Renewables maintains close relationships with key turbine suppliers, including Gamesa, GE, Vestas, Siemens, and others in order to identify the turbine technology that safely delivers the lowest cost of energy for each candidate project in its portfolio. Renewables has deployed the following mix of turbines under this strategy. See "—Properties—Renewables" for more information regarding Renewables’ turbine technology.

The Renewables meteorology team supports the commercial development of wind energy projects in Renewables’ pipeline by performing a wide variety of detailed investigations to characterize the expected wind energy production from a proposed wind farm in its pre-construction phase of development. These investigations include measuring the wind resource with several well-equipped meteorological masts, utilizing state of the art laser-based and acoustic-based remote sensing equipment, computational fluid dynamics modeling software, and energy modeling software packages that characterize wake losses from any upwind turbines that may be present. The Renewables fleet of measurement masts consists of over 160 towers that are currently in operation. Additionally, a total of 8 light detecting and ranging, and 6 sonic detecting and ranging, remote sensing devices are deployed at sites across the United States. These remote sensing devices allow hub-height wind speed measurement from a ground-based sensor that can be rapidly deployed and moved as the project matures or changes in nature. The resulting pre-construction energy production estimates that utilize these measurements have been shown to be accurate in a multi-year internal study that compares results to actual, operational data in a benchmarking analysis. This study provides a critical feedback loop that is used to define methodology requirements for future pre-construction energy production estimates to ensure confidence in project investment. Renewables’ commitment to obtaining robust atmospheric measurement is driven by a company culture that values business case confidence and understands the role that accurate meteorological data play in the pursuit of this goal.

Gas

The Gas business, based in Houston, Texas, operates a natural gas storage and natural gas trading business through its wholly-owned direct subsidiaries, Enstor, Inc., an Oregon corporation (natural gas storage) and Enstor Energy Services LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (natural gas trading). Gas owns and operates four natural gas storage facilities, with a total storage capacity of 88.5 Bcf and a net working gas storage capacity of 67.5 Bcf. Enstor Operating Company, LLC, a Texas limited liability company and wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Enstor, Inc., manages all four natural gas storage facilities. The demand for natural gas storage is dependent upon the seasonal differences in the weather. Since market prices and temporal price spreads for natural gas reflect the demand for these products and their availability at a given time, the overall operating results of Gas’ business may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. Severe weather, such as ice and snow storms, hurricanes and other natural disasters may cause outages, bodily injury or property damage, which may require Gas to incur additional costs, such as operation and maintenance expenses, which may not be recoverable from customers. See "—Properties—Gas" for more information regarding Gas’ natural gas storage facilities. Enstor Energy Services LLC also contracts and manages natural gas storage and pipeline capacity throughout the United States and parts of Canada. Gas operates 53.25 Bcf of contracted or managed natural gas storage capacity in North America through Enstor Energy Services, LLC, as of December 31, 2015.

Regulatory Environment and Principal Markets 

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

Among other things, FERC regulates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce and the transmission and sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce. Certain aspects of Networks’ businesses, Renewables’ competitive generation and Gas’ natural gas storage and energy trading businesses are subject to regulation by FERC.

Pursuant to the FPA, electric utilities must maintain tariffs and rate schedules on file with FERC which govern the rates, terms and conditions for the provision of FERC-jurisdictional wholesale power and transmission services. Unless otherwise exempt, any person that owns or operates facilities used for the wholesale sale or transmission of power in interstate commerce is a public utility subject to FERC’s jurisdiction. FERC regulates, among other things, the disposition of certain utility property, the issuance of securities by public utilities, the rates, the terms and conditions for the transmission or wholesale sale of power in interstate commerce, interlocking officer and director positions, and the uniform system of accounts and reporting requirements for public utilities.

With respect to Networks’ regulated electric utilities in Maine, New York and Connecticut, FERC governs the return on equity, or ROE, rates, terms and conditions of transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce, interconnection service in interstate commerce (which applies to independent power generators, for example), and the rates, terms and conditions of wholesale sales of electric energy in interstate commerce, which includes cost-based rates, market-based rates and the operations of regional capacity and electric energy markets in New England administered by an independent entity, ISO New England, Inc., or ISO-NE, and in New York, administered by another independent entity, the New York Independent System Operator, Inc., or NYISO. FERC approves the Networks’ regulated electric utilities’ transmission revenue requirements. Wholesale electric transmission revenues are recovered through formula rates that are approved by FERC. CMP’s, MEPCO’s and UI’s electric transmission revenues are recovered from New England customers through charges that recover costs of transmission and other transmission-related services provided by all regional transmission owners. NYSEG’s and RGE’s electric transmission revenues are recovered from New York customers through charges that recover the costs of transmission, and other transmission-related services provided by all transmission owners in New York. Several of our affiliates have been granted authority to engage in sales at market-based rates and blanket authority to issue securities, and have also been granted certain waivers of FERC reporting and accounting regulations available to non-traditional public utilities; however, we cannot be assured that such authorizations or waivers will not be revoked for these affiliates or will be granted in the future to other affiliates.

Pursuant to a series of orders involving the ROE for regionally planned New England electric transmission projects, the FERC established a base-level transmission ROE of 11.14%, as well as a 50 basis point ROE adder on Pool Transmission Facilities, or PTF, for participation in the RTO for New England and a 100 basis point ROE incentive for projects included in the ISO-NE Regional System Plan that were completed and on line as of December 31, 2008.

Beginning in 2011, several parties filed three separate complaints with the FERC against ISO-NE and several New England transmission owners, including UI and CMP, claiming that the current approved base ROE of 11.14% was not just and reasonable, seeking a reduction of the base ROE and a refund to customers for the 15-month refund periods beginning October 1, 2011, December 27, 2012 and July 31, 2014, respectively.

In 2014, the FERC determined that the base ROE should be set at 10.57% for the first complaint refund period and that a utility's total or maximum ROE should not exceed 11.74%. The FERC issued an order consolidating the second and third complaints and establishing hearing procedures. The administrative law judge issued an initial decision in the second and third complaints on March 22, 2016. The initial decision determined that, 1) for the 15 month refund period in the second complaint, the base ROE should be 9.59% and that the ROE Cap (base ROE plus incentive ROEs) should be 10.42% and 2) for the 15 month refund period in the third complaint and prospectively, the base ROE should be 10.90% and that the ROE Cap should be 12.19%. The initial decision is the administrative law judge’s recommendation to the FERC Commissioners. The FERC is expected to make its final decision in late 2016 or early 2017.

On March 3, 2015, the FERC issued an Order on Rehearing in the first complaint denying all rehearing requests from the complainants and the New England transmission owners. Appeals of the FERC’s decisions on the first complaint are currently pending before the D.C. Circuit.

On December 28, 2015, the FERC issued an order instituting section 206 proceedings and establishing hearing and settlement judge procedures. Pursuant to section 206 of the FPA, the FERC finds that ISO-NE Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff is unjust, unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory or preferential. FERC stated that ISO-NE’s Tariff lacks adequate transparency and challenge procedures with regard to the formula rates for ISO-NE Participating Transmission Owners, including UI, MEPCO and CMP. FERC also found that the current Regional Network Service, or RNS and Local Network Service, or LNS, formula rates appear to be unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, or otherwise unlawful as the formula rates appear to lack sufficient 

detail in order to determine how certain costs are derived and recovered in the formula rates. A settlement judge has been appointed and a settlement conference has convened. We are unable to predict the outcome of this proceeding at this time. 

FERC has the right to review books and records of "holding companies," as defined in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, or PUHCA 2005, that are determined by FERC to be relevant to the companies’ respective FERC-jurisdictional rates. We are a holding company, as defined in PUHCA 2005.

FERC has civil penalty authority over violations of any provision of Part II of the FPA, as well as any rule or order issued thereunder. FERC is authorized to assess a maximum civil penalty of $1.0 million per violation for each day that the violation continues. The FPA also provides for the assessment of criminal fines and imprisonment for violations under Part II of the FPA. Pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005, or EPAct 2005, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC, has been certified by FERC as the Electric Reliability Organization to develop and oversee the enforcement of electric system reliability standards applicable throughout the United States. FERC-approved reliability standards may be enforced by FERC independently, or, alternatively, by NERC and the regional reliability organizations with frontline responsibility for auditing, investigating and otherwise ensuring compliance with reliability standards, subject to FERC oversight.

Gas’ current natural gas storage operations in the United States are subject to the jurisdiction of FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, or NGA, as a Section 7(c) natural gas storage provider (i.e., Caledonia Energy Partners, L.L.C. and Freebird Gas Storage, LLC each with Enstor Operating Company, LLC as their manager) and by providing interstate storage and storage related services under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (i.e., Enstor Katy Storage and Transportation, L.P. and Enstor Grama Ridge Storage and Transportation, LLC with Enstor Operating Company, LLC as their general partner and manager, respectively), at market based rates. Gas’ interstate and intrastate high-deliverability multi-cycle natural gas storage service projects and operations are subject to FERC regulation under the NGA for rates and terms of service.

Furthermore, Gas’ natural gas trading operations in the United States are subject to the jurisdiction of FERC under EPAct 2005. FERC possesses regulatory oversight over gas markets, including the purchase, sale and transportation of gas by "any entity" in order to enforce the anti-market manipulation provisions in EPAct 2005. The gas distribution operations of NYSEG, RGE, SCG, CNG and Berkshire, similar to Gas, are also subject to FERC regulation with respect to their gas purchases/sales and contracted transportation/storage capacity. FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA to impose penalties for certain violations of up to $1.0 million per day for violations. FERC also has the authority to order the disgorgement of profits from transactions deemed to violate the NGA and EPAct 2005. Additionally, Gas’ current natural gas trading operations are also subject to FERC regulation with respect to matters such as market manipulation and capacity release rules.

Market Anti-Manipulation Regulation

The FERC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, monitor certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities market pursuant to the FPA and the Commodity Exchange Act, including our businesses’ energy transactions and operations in the United States. In July 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, which incorporated an expansion of the authority of the CFTC to prohibit market manipulation in the markets regulated by the CFTC. With regard to the physical purchases and sales of electricity and natural gas, the gathering storage, transmission and delivery of these energy commodities and any related trading or hedging transactions that some of our operating subsidiaries undertake, our operating subsidiaries are required to observe these anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by the FERC and CFTC. The FERC and CFTC hold substantial enforcement authority, including the ability to assess civil penalties of up to $1.0 million per day per violation, to order disgorgement of profits and to recommend criminal penalties.

State Regulation

Networks’ regulated utilities in New York, Maine, Connecticut and Massachusetts are subject to regulation by the applicable state public utility commissions, including with regard to their rates, terms and conditions of service, issuance of securities, purchase or sale of utility assets and other accounting and operational matters. NYSEG and RGE are subject to regulation by the NYPSC; CMP and MNG are subject to regulation by the MPUC; UI, SCG and CNG are subject to regulation by the PURA; and Berkshire is subject to regulation by the DPU. The NYPSC, MPUC and the Connecticut Siting Council, or CSC, exercise jurisdiction over the siting of electric transmission lines in their respective states, and each of the NYPSC, MPUC, PURA and DPU exercise jurisdiction over the approval of certain mergers or other business combinations involving Networks’ regulated utilities. In addition, each of the utility commissions has the authority to impose penalties on these regulated utilities, which could be substantial, for violating state utility laws and regulations and their orders.

Networks’ regulated distribution utilities deliver electricity and/or natural gas to all customers in their service territory at rates established under cost of service regulation. Under this regulatory structure, Networks’ regulated distribution utilities recover the cost of providing distribution service to their customers based on its costs, and earn a return on their capital investment in utility assets. 

The following provides a summary of Networks regulated utilities’ most recent rate cases:

- 

New York . NYSEG and RGE have each completed one distribution rate case decision since they were acquired by Iberdrola, S.A. in 2008. On September 17, 2009, NYSEG and RGE initiated a distribution rate case to allow the companies to recover past and future investments, provide safe and adequate service, and improve their credit ratings. On February 19, 2016, the NYSEG, RGE and other signatory parties filed a Joint Proposal, or the proposal, with the NYPSC for a three-year rate plan for electric and gas service at NYSEG and RGE commencing May 1, 2016. The proposal balances the varied interests of the signatory parties including but not limited to maintaining the companies’ credit quality and mitigating the rate impacts to customers. The proposal reflects many customer attributes including: acceleration of the companies’ natural gas leak prone main replacement programs and enhanced electric vegetation management to provide continued safe and reliable service. The allowed rate of return on common equity for NYSEG Electric, NYSEG Gas, RGE Electric and RGE Gas is 9.00%. The equity ratio for each company is 48%. The proposal includes an ESM applicable to each company. The customer share of earnings would increase at higher earnings levels, with customers receiving 50%, 75% and 90% of earnings over 9.5%, 10.0% and 10.5% of ROE, respectively, in the first year. Earnings thresholds would increase in subsequent years. The proposal reflects the recovery of deferred NYSEG Electric storm costs of approximately $262 million, of which $123 million will be amortized over ten years and the remaining $139 million will be amortized over five years. The proposal also continues reserve accounting for qualifying Major Storms ($21.4 million annually for NYSEG Electric and $2.5 million annually for RGE Electric). Incremental maintenance costs incurred to restore service in qualifying divisions will be chargeable to the Major Storm Reserve provided they meet certain thresholds. The administrative law judges assigned to the New York rate case will issue a procedural schedule establishing the remaining procedure for review and decision on the proposal. We expect hearings on the proposal to be held in April 2016 and a NYPSC decision to be made in May 2016. 

- 

Maine . On May 1, 2013, CMP filed a distribution service rate case in order to recover past and future investments and provide safe and adequate service. On August 25, 2014, MPUC approved a stipulation agreement which provided for a distribution rate increase of approximately $24.3 million effective July 1, 2014 with an allowed ROE of 9.45% and an allowed equity ratio of 50%. 

On March 5, 2015, MNG filed a rate case in order to recover future investments and provide safe and adequate service. MNG requested a 10.0% ROE and 50% equity ratio. The MPUC Staff has recommended a separate revenue requirement for MNG’s Augusta customers and MNG’s non-Augusta customers. Staff has recommended a $19.95 million disallowance of the Augusta Expansion investment based upon the Staff’s conclusion that MNG’s management of the Augusta Expansion Project was imprudent. On November 6, 2015, a stipulation was filed with the MPUC, which was executed by MNG, the Office of Public Advocate and the City of Augusta. The stipulation contained a combined revenue requirement for Augusta and Non-Augusta based on a 9.55% ROE and 50% equity ratio. The stipulation also provided for an initial Augusta investment disallowance of $6 million and an investment phase-in of $10 million. On December 22, 2015, MPUC rejected the proposed stipulation as not in the public interest. In January 2016, the administrative law judge established a new litigation schedule. The litigation was suspended at the end of January 2016 for settlement discussions. We cannot predict the outcome of the proceeding. 

- 

Connecticut . In August 2013, PURA approved distribution rate schedules for UI for two years that became effective at that time and which, among other things, increased the UI distribution allowed ROE from 8.75% to 9.15%, continued UI’s existing earnings sharing mechanism, continued the existing decoupling mechanism (under which the actual energy delivery revenues are compared on a periodic basis with the authorized delivery revenues and the difference accrued, with interest, for refund to or recovery from customers, as applicable), and approved the establishment of the requested storm reserve. In connection with the approval by PURA of the acquisition, UI agreed not to file a rate case for new rates effective before January 1, 2017. 

The allowed ROEs established by PURA for CNG and SCG, are 9.18% and 9.36%, respectively. SCG and CNG each have purchased gas adjustment clauses that enable them to pass their reasonably incurred cost of gas purchases through to customers. These clauses allow utilities to recover costs associated with changes in the market price of purchased natural gas, substantially eliminating exposure to natural gas price risk.

On January 22, 2014, PURA approved base delivery rates for CNG, with an effective date of January 10, 2014, which, among other things, approved an allowed ROE of 9.18%, continued the purchased gas adjustment clause, instituted a revenue decoupling mechanism, established two separate ratemaking mechanisms that reconcile actual revenue requirements related to CNG’s cast iron and bare steel replacement program and system expansion and an earnings sharing mechanism by which CNG and customers share on a 50/50 basis all earnings above the allowed ROE in a calendar year. In accordance with the approval by PURA of the acquisition, SCG and CNG agreed not to file rate cases for new rates effective before January 1, 2018. 

- 

Massachusetts . Berkshire’s rates are established by the DPU. Berkshire’s 10-year rate plan, which was approved by the DPU and included an approved ROE of 10.5%, expired on January 31, 2012. Berkshire continues to charge the rates that were in effect at the end of the rate plan. In accordance with the approval by the DPU of the acquisition, Berkshire agreed not to file a rate case for new rates effective before June 1, 2018. 

Further, as a result of a restructuring of the utility industry in New York, Maine, Connecticut and Massachusetts, most of Networks’ distribution utilities’ customers have the opportunity to purchase their electricity or natural gas supplies from third-party energy supply vendors. Most customers in New York, however, continue to purchase such supplies through the distribution utilities under regulated energy rates and tariffs. In Maine, CMP customers can also purchase electric supply from competitive providers but the majority receives baseline standard offer service that is provided through a MPUC procurement process. Networks’ regulated utilities in New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts and MNG purchase electricity or natural gas from unaffiliated wholesale suppliers and recover the actual approved costs of these supplies on a pass-through basis, as well as certain costs associated with industry restructuring, through reconciling rate mechanisms that are periodically adjusted.

In April 2014 the NYPSC instituted its Reforming the Energy Visions, or REV, proceeding, the goals of which are to improve electric system efficiency and reliability, encourage renewable energy resources, support DER, and empower customer choice. In this proceeding, the NYPSC is examining the establishment of a Distributed System Platform, or DSP, to manage and coordinate DER, and provide customers with market data and tools to manage their energy use. The NYPSC has determined distribution utilities should be the DSP providers. The NYPSC also is examining how its regulatory practices should be modified to incent utility practices to promote REV objectives. The proceeding is following a two-phased schedule with an order relating to policy determinations for DSP and related matters issued in February 2015 and an order for regulatory design and regulatory matters, expected in 2016. All electric utilities have been ordered to file an initial Distributed System Implementation Plan, or DSIP, by June 30, 2016. The DSIP will also include information regarding the potential deployment of Automated Metering Infrastructure, or AMI.

State public utility commissions may also have jurisdiction over certain aspects of Renewables’ competitive generation businesses. For example, in New York, certain Renewables’ generation subsidiaries are electric corporations subject to "lightened" regulation by the NYPSC. As such, the NYPSC exercises its jurisdictional authority over certain non-rate aspects of the facilities, including safety, retirements, and the issuance of debt secured by recourse to those generation assets located in New York. In Texas, Renewables’ operations within the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, footprint are not subject to regulation by FERC, as they are deemed to operate solely within the ERCOT market and not in interstate commerce. These operations are subject to regulation by the Public Utility Commission of Texas, or PUCT. In California, Renewables’ generation subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the California Public Utilities Commission with regard to certain non-rate aspects of the facilities, including health and safety, outage reporting and other aspects of the facilities’ operations. Furthermore, Gas’ natural gas storage operations are subject to certain state regulations, such as the Railroad Commission of Texas for its facilities located in Texas.

RTOs and ISOs

Networks’ regulated electric utilities in New York, Connecticut and Maine, as well as some of Renewables’ generation fleet, operate in or have access to organized energy markets, known as regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, or independent system operators, or ISOs, particularly NYISO and ISO-NE. Each organized market administers centralized bid-based energy, capacity and ancillary services markets pursuant to tariffs approved by FERC, or in the case of ERCOT, market rules approved by the PUCT. These tariffs and rules dictate how the energy, capacity and ancillary service markets operate, how market participants bid, clear, are dispatched, make bilateral sales with one another, and how entities with market-based rates are compensated. Certain of these markets set prices, referred to as Locational Marginal Prices that reflect the value of energy, capacity or certain ancillary services, based upon geographic locations, transmission constraints, and other factors. Each market is subject to market mitigation measures designed to limit the exercise of market power. Some markets limit the prices of the bidder based upon some level of cost justification. These market structures impact the bidding, operation, dispatch and sale of energy, capacity and ancillary services.

The RTOs and ISOs are also responsible for transmission planning and operations within their respective regions. Each of Networks’ transmission-owning subsidiaries in New York, Connecticut and Maine has transferred operational control over certain of its electric transmission facilities to its respective ISOs, such as ISO-NE and NYISO.

New Renewable Source Generation 

Under Connecticut law Public Act 11-80, or PA 11-80, Connecticut electric utilities are required to enter into long-term contracts to purchase Connecticut Class I Renewable Energy Certificates, or RECs, from renewable generators located on customer premises. Under this program, UI is required to enter into contracts totaling approximately $200 million in commitments over an approximate 21-year period. The obligations will phase in over a six-year solicitation period, and are expected to peak at an annual commitment level of about $13.6 million per year after all selected projects are online. Upon purchase, UI accounts for the RECs as inventory. UI expects to partially mitigate the cost of these contracts through the resale of the RECs. PA 11-80 provides that the remaining costs (and any benefits) of these contracts, including any gain or loss resulting from the resale of the RECs, are fully recoverable from (or credited to) customers through electric rates.

On October 23, 2013, PURA approved UI’s renewable connections program filed in accordance with PA 11-80, through which UI will develop up to 10 MW of renewable generation. The costs for this program will be recovered on a cost of service basis. PURA established a base ROE to be calculated as the greater of: (A) the current UI authorized distribution ROE (currently 9.15%) plus 25 basis points and (B) the current authorized distribution ROE for The Connecticut Light and Power Company, or CL&amp;P, (currently 9.17%), less target equivalent market revenues (reflected as 25 basis points). In addition, UI will retain a percentage of the market revenues from the project, which percentage is expected to equate to approximately 25 basis points on a levelized basis over the life of the project. UI expects the cost of this program, a planned 2.8 MW fuel cell facility in New Haven, solar photovoltaic and fuel cell facilities totaling 5 MW in Bridgeport, and a 2.2 MW fuel cell facility in Woodbridge, to be approximately $47 million.

Pursuant to Section 8 of Connecticut Public Act 13-303, "An Act Concerning Connecticut’s Clean Energy Goals," in January 2014, at DEEP’s direction, UI entered into three contracts for the purchase of RECs associated with an aggregate of 5.7 MW of energy production from biomass plants in New England. The costs of these agreements will be fully recoverable through electric rates.

Under Maine law 35-A M.R.S.A &#167;&#167; 3210-C, 3210-D, the MPUC is authorized to conduct periodic requests for proposals seeking long-term supplies of energy, capacity or RECs, from qualifying resources. The MPUC is further authorized to order Maine Transmission and Distribution Utilities to enter into contracts with sellers selected from the MPUC’s competitive solicitation process. Pursuant to a MPUC Order dated October 8, 2009, CMP entered into a 20-year agreement with Evergreen Wind Power III, LLC, on March 31, 2010, to purchase capacity and energy from Evergreen’s 60 MW Rollins wind farm in Penobscot County, Maine. CMP’s purchase obligations under the Rollins contract are approximately $7 million per year. In accordance with subsequent MPUC orders, CMP periodically auctions the purchased Rollins energy to wholesale buyers in the New England regional market. Under applicable law, CMP is assured recovery of any differences between power purchase costs and achieved market revenues through a reconcilable component of its retail distribution rates. Although the MPUC has conducted multiple requests for proposals under M.R.S.A &#167;3210-C and has tentatively accepted long-term proposals from other sellers, these selections have not yet resulted in additional currently effective contracts with CMP.

New England East-West Solution

Pursuant to an agreement with CL&amp;P, UI has the right to invest in, and own transmission assets associated with, the Connecticut portion of CL&amp;P’s, New England East West Solution, or NEEWS, projects to improve regional energy reliability. NEEWS originally consisted of four inter-related transmission projects being developed by subsidiaries of Northeast Utilities (doing business as Eversource Energy), the parent company of CL&amp;P, in collaboration with National Grid USA. Three of the original projects have portions located in Connecticut: (1) the Greater Springfield Reliability Project, which was fully energized in November 2013, (2) the Interstate Reliability Project, which was placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2015 and (3) the Central Connecticut Reliability Project, the need for which is now planned to be addressed by CL&amp;P’s Greater Hartford Central Connecticut solutions, in which UI does not anticipate making any investments. Under the agreement, as of December 31, 2015, UI had made aggregate deposits of approximately $45 million since its inception, with assets valued at approximately $44.6 million having been transferred to UI. UI does not anticipate making any additional investments in NEEWS under the agreement.

Environmental, Health and Safety

Permitting and Other Regulatory Requirements

Networks. Similar to Renewables and Gas, Networks’ distribution utilities in New York, Maine, Connecticut and Massachusetts are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in connection with the environmental, health and safety effects of its operations. The distribution utilities of Networks are subject to regulation by the applicable state public utility commission with respect to the siting and approval of electric transmission lines, with the exception of UI, the siting of whose transmission lines is subject to the jurisdiction of the CSC, and with respect to pipeline safety regulations for intrastate gas pipeline operators. 

The National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, requires that detailed statements of the environmental effect of Networks’ facilities be prepared in connection with the issuance of various federal permits and licenses. Federal agencies are required by NEPA to make an independent environmental evaluation of the facilities as part of their actions during proceedings with respect to these permits and licenses. 

Under the federal Toxic Substances Control Act, the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, has issued regulations that control the use and disposal of Polychlorinated Biphenyls, or PCBs. PCBs were widely used as insulating fluids in many electric utility transformers and capacitors manufactured before the federal Toxic Substances Control Act prohibited any further manufacture of such PCB equipment. Fluids with a concentration of PCBs higher than 500 parts per million and materials (such as electrical capacitors) that contain such fluids must be disposed of through burning in high temperature incinerators approved by the EPA. For our gas distribution companies, PCBs are sometimes found in the distribution system. Networks and UIL test any distribution piping being removed or repaired for the presence of PCBs and comply with relevant disposal procedures, as needed.

Under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes are subject to regulations adopted by the EPA. All of Networks’ and UIL’s subsidiaries have complied with the notification and application requirements of present regulations, and the procedures by which the subsidiaries handle, store, treat and dispose of hazardous waste products comply with these regulations.

Prior to the last quarter of the 20th century, when environmental best practices laws and regulations were implemented, utility companies, including Networks and UIL subsidiaries, often disposed of residues from operations by depositing or burying them on-site or disposing of them at off-site landfills or other facilities. Typical materials disposed of include coal gasification byproducts, fuel oils, ash, and other materials that might contain PCBs or that otherwise might be hazardous. In recent years it has been determined that such disposal practices, under certain circumstances, can cause groundwater contamination.

Renewables. Renewables’ projects are subject to a variety of state environmental review and permitting requirements. Many states where Renewables’ projects are located, or may in the future be located, have laws that require state agencies to evaluate a broad array of environmental impacts before granting state permits. State agencies evaluate similar issues as federal agencies, including the project’s impact on wildlife, historic sites, aesthetics, wetlands and water resources, agricultural operations and scenic areas. States may impose different or additional monitoring or mitigation requirements than federal agencies. Additional approvals may be required for specific aspects of a project, such as stream or wetland crossings, impacts to designated significant wildlife habitats, storm water management and highway department authorizations for oversize loads and state road closings during construction. Permitting requirements related to transmission lines may be required in certain cases. 

Renewables’ projects also are subject to local environmental and regulatory requirements, including county and municipal land use, zoning, building and transportation requirements. Permitting at the local municipal or county level often consists of obtaining a special use or conditional use permit under a land use ordinance or code, or, in some cases, rezoning in connection with the project. Obtaining a permit usually depends on Renewables demonstrating that the project will conform to development standards specified under the ordinance so that the project is compatible with existing land uses and protects natural and human environments. Local or state regulatory agencies may require modeling and measurement of permissible sound levels in connection with the permitting and approval of Renewables’ projects. Local or state agencies also may require Renewables to develop decommissioning plans for dismantling the project at the end of its functional life and establish financial assurances for carrying out the decommissioning plan.

In addition to permits required under state and local laws, Renewables’ projects may be subject to permitting and other regulatory requirements arising under federal law. For example, if a project is located near wetlands, a permit may be required from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or Army Corps, with respect to the discharge of dredged or fill material into the waters of the United States. The Army Corps may also require the mitigation of any loss of wetland functions and values that accompanies the project’s activities. In addition, Renewables may be required to obtain permits under the federal Clean Water Act for water discharges, such as storm water runoff associated with construction activities, and to follow a variety of best management practices to ensure that water quality is protected and impacts are minimized. Renewables’ projects also may be located, or partially located, on lands administered by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, or BLM. Therefore, Renewables may be required to obtain and maintain BLM right-of-way grants for access to, or operations on, such lands. To obtain and maintain a grant, there must be environmental reviews conducted, a plan of development implemented and a demonstration that there has been compliance with the plan to protect the environment, including measures to protect biological, archeological and cultural resources encountered on the grant.

Renewables’ projects may be subject to requirements pursuant to the Endangered Species Act, or ESA, and analogous state laws. For example, federal agencies granting permits for Renewables’ projects consider the impact on endangered and threatened species and their habitat under the ESA, which prohibits and imposes stringent penalties for harming endangered or threatened species and their habitats. Renewables’ projects also need to consider the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, or MBTA, and the Bald and Golden 

Eagle Protection Act, or BGEPA, which protect migratory birds and bald and golden eagles and are administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Criminal liability can result from violations of the MBTA and the BGEPA, even for incidental takings of migratory birds. For example, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, has recently entered into settlements with two large wind farm operators, pursuant to which those operators pled guilty to criminal violations of the MBTA and agreed to substantial penalties and mitigation measures. 

In addition to regulations, voluntary wind turbine siting guidelines established by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service set forth siting, monitoring and coordination protocols that are designed to support wind development in the United States while also protecting both birds and bats and their habitats. These guidelines include provisions for specific monitoring and study conditions which need to be met in order for projects to be in adherence with these voluntary guidelines. Most states also have similar laws. Because the operation of wind turbines may result in injury or fatalities to birds and bats, federal and state agencies often recommend or require that Renewables conduct avian and bat risk assessments prior to issuing permits for its projects. They may also require ongoing monitoring or mitigation activities as a condition to approving a project.

Gas. Gas’ natural gas storage operations are regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation Office of Pipeline Safety through the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA, under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, or NGPSA, as amended by Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, and the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, or HLPSA. PHMSA, through the NGPSA and HLPSA, regulates the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, maintenance, repair, inspection, replacement and management of interstate and certain intrastate natural gas pipeline facilities. PHMSA has also developed regulations that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain high risk areas along Gas’ natural gas pipelines and take additional measures to protect natural gas pipeline segments located in highly populated areas. 

Gas’ natural gas storage operations are also regulated by the EPA, and equivalent state environmental agencies, with respect to the environmental effects of its operations, including air and water quality control, solid and hazardous waste disposal, greenhouse gas emissions, noise and limitations on land use. 

Global Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emission Issues

Global climate change and greenhouse gas emission issues continue to receive an increased focus from state governments and the federal government. In November 2010, EPA published final rules for monitoring and reporting requirements for petroleum and natural gas systems that emit greenhouse gases under the authority of the Clean Air Act beginning in 2011. These regulations apply to facilities that emit greenhouse gases above the threshold level of 25,000 metric tons equivalent per year. SCG and CNG both exceed this threshold and are subject to reporting requirements. The LNG facilities owned and/or contracted by SCG and CNG are also subject to the monitoring and reporting requirements of the new regulations. Similarly, Networks and UIL are subject to reporting requirements under provisions of the greenhouse gases regulations, which regulate electric transmission and distribution equipment that emit sulfur hexafluoride.

We are continually evaluating the regulatory risks and regulatory uncertainty presented by climate change and greenhouse gas emission concerns. Such concerns could potentially lead to additional rules and regulations that impact how we operate our business. We expect that any costs of these rules and regulations would be recovered from customers.

OSHA and Certain Other Federal Safety Laws

Our operating subsidiaries are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or OSHA, and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees. In addition, OSHA’s hazard communication standard and standards administered by other federal as well as state agencies, including the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act and implementing regulations require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations of our subsidiaries and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.

Management, Disposal and Remediation of Hazardous Substances

Our operating subsidiaries own or lease real property and may be subject to federal, state and local requirements regarding the storage, use, transportation and disposal of petroleum products and toxic or hazardous substances, including spill prevention, control and counter-measure requirements. Project properties and materials stored or disposed thereon may be subject to the federal RCRA, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and analogous state laws. If any operating subsidiary’s owned or leased properties are contaminated, whether during or prior to their ownership or operation, the operating subsidiary could be responsible for the costs of investigation and cleanup and for any related liabilities, 

including claims for damage to property, persons or natural resources. Such responsibility may arise even if the operating subsidiary was not at fault and did not cause the contamination. In addition, waste generated by our operating subsidiaries is at times sent to third party disposal facilities. If such facilities become contaminated, the operating subsidiary and any other persons who arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances at those sites may be jointly and severally responsible for the costs of investigation and remediation, as well as for any claims of damages to third parties, their property or natural resources. 

On September 16, 2015, UI signed a proposed partial consent order that, when issued by the Commissioner of DEEP would require UI to investigate and remediate certain environmental conditions within the perimeter of a former generation site on the Mill River in New Haven, the English Station site, that UI sold to Quinnipiac Energy in 2000 and which is currently owned by Evergreen Power, LLC and Asnat Realty LLC. Under the proposed partial consent order, to the extent that the cost of this investigation and remediation is less than $30 million, UI will remit to the State of Connecticut the difference between such cost and $30 million to be used for a public purpose as determined in the discretion of the Governor of the State of Connecticut, the Attorney General of the State of Connecticut, and the Commissioner of DEEP. Pursuant to the proposed partial consent order, upon its issuance and subject to its terms and conditions, UI would be obligated to comply with the proposed partial consent order, even if the cost of such compliance exceeds $30 million. The State will discuss options with UI on recovering or funding any cost above $30 million such as through public funding or recovery from third parties, however it is not bound to agree to or support any means of recovery or funding. The State is continuing to discuss English Station site access with the current owners and the proposed partial consent order has not been filed.

Customers

Networks delivers natural gas and electricity to residential, commercial and institutional customers through its regulated utilities in New York, Maine, Connecticut and Massachusetts. As a result of the acquisition of UIL, we now deliver natural gas and electricity to approximately 735,000 additional customers through our regulated utilities in Connecticut and Massachusetts. Networks’ customer payment terms are regulated by the states of New York, with respect to NYSEG and RGE; Maine, with respect to CMP and MNG; Connecticut, with respect to UI, SCG and CNG; and Massachusetts, with respect to Berkshire, and each of the regulated utilities must provide extended payment arrangements to customers for past due balances. See "—Networks" for more information relating to the customers of Networks.

Renewables sells the majority of its output to large investor-owned utilities, public utilities and other credit-worthy entities. Additionally, Renewables generates and provides power, among other services, to federal and state agencies, institutional retail and joint action agencies. Offtakers typically purchase renewable energy from Renewables through long-term power purchase agreements, or PPAs, allowing Renewables to limit its exposure to market volatility. Approximately 67% of Renewables’ wind generating capacity is fully committed under PPAs with an average duration of 9.7 years. Renewables also delivers thermal output to wholesale customers in the Western United States.

Gas’ natural gas storage and management services customers include a diversified mix of natural gas distribution companies, power generators, natural gas marketers and producers, utilities using gas as fuel, gas storage customers, financial institutions and energy marketers.

Competition

Networks’ regulated public utilities in New York, Maine, Connecticut and Massachusetts do not generally face competition from other companies that transmit and distribute electricity and natural gas. However, demand for electricity and natural gas may be negatively impacted by federal and state legislation mandating that certain percentages of power delivered to end users be produced from renewable resources, such as wind, thermal and solar energy.

Networks faces competition from self-contained micro-grids that integrate renewable energy sources in the areas served by Networks. However, there has been limited development of these micro-grids in Networks’ service areas to date, and Networks expects that growth in distributed generation of renewable energy will continue due to financial incentives being provided by federal and state legislation. Networks has experienced significant growth in alternative distribution sources of generation on its network over the past ten years, with over 90% of the growth coming from solar photovoltaic facilities.

Renewables has competitive advantages, including a robust development pipeline, a management team with extensive experience, strong relationships with suppliers and clients, expert regulatory knowledge and brand awareness. However, Renewables faces competition throughout the life cycles of its energy facilities, including during the development phase, in the identification and procurement of suitable sites with high wind resource availability, grid connection capacity and land availability. Renewables also competes with other suppliers in securing long-term PPAs with power purchasers and participates in competitive bilateral and organized energy markets with other energy sources for power that is not sold under PPAs. Competitive conditions may be 

substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and regulation considered from time to time by federal, state and local legislatures and administrative agencies. 

Gas, through its subsidiaries, Enstor, Inc. and Enstor Energy Services LLC, faces competition from others in the natural gas market. Enstor, Inc. encounters regional competition, such as in the Gulf South region, from other independent natural gas storage providers, a combination of interstate and intrastate pipeline companies and local distribution companies. Furthermore, Enstor Energy Services LLC competes with various entities, ranging from natural gas marketing companies, to financial institutions and producer/marketers.

Infrastructure Protection and Cyber Security Measures

We have security measures in place designed to protect our facilities and assets, such as our transmission and distribution system. While we have not had any significant security breaches, a physical security intrusion could potentially lead to theft and the release of critical operating information. In addition to physical security intrusions, a cyber breach could potentially lead to theft and the release of critical operating information or confidential customer information. To manage these operational risks, in accordance with the Cybersecurity Risk Policy and with the Corporate Security Policy of Iberdrola, S.A. as adopted by us, we have implemented cyber and physical security measures and continue to strengthen our security posture by improving and expanding our physical and cyber security capabilities to protect critical assets.

In an effort to reduce our vulnerability to cyber attacks, we have established a dedicated Corporate Security Office, responsible for improving and coordinating security across the company and have adopted a comprehensive company-wide physical and cyber security program, which is supported by a company-wide governance policy to manage, oversee and assist us in meeting our corporate, legal, and regulatory responsibilities with regard to the protection of our cyber, physical and information assets. However, as threats evolve and grow increasingly more sophisticated, we cannot ensure that a potential security breach may not occur or quantify the potential impact of such an event. We continue to invest in technology, processes, security measures and services to detect, mitigate and protect our assets, both physical and cyber. These investments include upgrades to network architecture and physical security measures, regular intrusion detection monitoring and compliance with emerging industry regulation.

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 6,809 employees excluding 15 international assignees. Of these 6,809 employees, 47.7% are represented by a union. The following table provides an overview of the number of employees at each business segment as of December 31, 2015:
