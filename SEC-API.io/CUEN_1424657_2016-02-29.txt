&#160;

The Company commenced offering services in October 2005 through a subscription basis. During 2007 the Company changed directions by using an advertising model. The Company was unable to generate additional revenue streams by charging registered users for the use of enhanced functionality to be incorporated into the site, access to specialized content, and e-commerce of merchandise related to the video console industry. The inability to generate revenue led to the decision that the Company would have to explore other options regarding the development of a new business plan and direction.

&#160;

Additionally, pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, as consideration for the cancellation of 38,048,000 of the 39,111,136 shares of League Now common shares owned by James Pregiato (&#147;Pregiato&#148;), Pure Motion agreed to pay a total cash payment of $250,000 to Pregiato (the &#147;Cash Payment&#148;) of which $100,000 (the &#147;Initial Cash Payment&#148;) was paid on the closing date and $150,000 (the &#147;Final Cash Payment&#148;) was to be paid within twelve weeks of the closing date. The 38,048,000 shares were being held in escrow until receipt of the Final Cash Payment. Mr. Pregiato agreed to extinguish all outstanding debt and liabilities of League Now outstanding as of the closing date upon receipt of the Cash Payment. Upon closing, Pure Motion became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase by the Company of Pure Motion, Inc. Upon closing of the transaction, Mr. Pregiato resigned as an officer and director of the Company.

&#160;

In May, 2011, the transaction with Pure Motion, Inc. was rescinded and the TOMI golf product and the patents and technology of the Company were returned to the Shareholders of Pure Motion, in exchange for the cancellation of shares that were to have been issued to them. The shares outstanding, at the present time, reflect the absence of any shares ever being issued to the Pure Motion, Inc. Shareholders, by the Company, either upon or subsequent to the closing of the transaction on October 6, 2010, since no such shares were ever issued by the Board following the acquisition of control by Pure Motion&#146;s shareholders of the Company and its affairs. Simultaneously with the withdrawal and rescission of the acquisitive transaction of October 6, 2010, the Company entered into a license agreement (&#147;the License Agreement&#148;) with Pure Motion for the exclusive right to use and exploit its motion capture technology with respect to all medical applications (the Licensed Technology&#148;).

The Consulting Agreement and the Employment Agreement provide for no payment of any compensation to Mr. Barton, other than payments which may be due him based upon the successful marketing and deployment of the Licensed Technology.

&#160;

On January 20, 2012, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement and Share Exchange (the &#147;Agreement&#148;) with Infiniti Systems Group, Inc. (&#147;Infiniti&#148;). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company agreed to issue 30 million common shares of the Company&#146;s stock to the shareholders of Infiniti in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Infiniti.

Pleasant Kids is a Florida Corporation engaged in the business of producing, marketing and distributing naturally balanced alkalized water for children, including and not limited to organic natural juices.

Subsequent to the year ended September 30, 2015, on December 28, 2015, and effective as of August 15, 2015, the Company issued 177,539,180 shares of its restricted common stock and 8,600,000 shares of its Series B preferred stock for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Next Group Holdings, Inc. (NEXT). Based on the completion of the agreement NEXT will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The completion of the agreement is contingent on the successful financial audit of Next Group Holdings, Inc.

On December 31, 2015, we completed our merger with Next Group Holdings, Inc a Florida Corporation. Our name change and requested symbol change is currently pending with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. 

As a result of this merger, we adopted Next Group&#146;s corporate structure and began a transition into its business model. Through our newly acquired subsidiaries we began to engage in use of certain licensed technology to provide innovative telecommunications, mobility, and remittance solutions to unserved, unbanked, and emerging markets.

Our new subsidiaries are Next Mobile 360 LLC (100%), a limited liability company formed under the laws of Florida (&#147; Next Mobile &#148;), Meimoun &#38; Mammon, LLC (100%), a limited liability company formed under the laws of Florida (&#147; M&#38;M &#148;), NxtGn, Inc. (65%), a corporation formed under the laws of Florida (&#147; NxtGn &#148;), and Next CALA, Inc. (94%), a corporation formed under the laws of Florida (&#147; Next CALA &#148;).

This new corporate structure is illustrated below.

ITEM 2. BUSINESS DESCRIPTION 

Item 2.01. Business Description

Next Group Holdings through its operating subsidiaries, engages in the business of using proprietary technology and certain licensed technology to provide innovative telecommunications and telecommunications mobility and remittance solutions in emerging markets.

PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS 

&#160;

Until the merger we offered retail consumers naturally balanced alkalized spring bottled water for children in an 8oz. bottle through our brand &#147;Pleasant Kids&#148;.

&#160;

The Company sources our naturally balanced alkalized spring water, throughout the United States. The product requirements are to bottle naturally balanced alkalized spring water with a minimum of 8.0 of pH, without the use of any chemicals, or ionize machinery.

&#160;

The main reason parents and consumers drink the Company&#146;s product is for the perceived benefit that a proper pH balance helps fight disease and boosts the immune system and the perception that alkaline water helps to maintain a proper body pH and keeps cells young and hydrated.

&#160;

OPERATIONS 

&#160;

In connection with our transition into a new business model we discontinued our prior operations. In the future, the Company plans to engage in the business of using proprietary technology and certain licensed technology to provide innovative telecommunications and telecommunications mobility and remittance solutions in emerging markets.

Transitioning of operations

Prior to the merger, we operated primarily as a manufacturing, marketing and distribution company. These operations will be phased out over the coming months.

Sample production, market research and consumer product acceptance of our product began in mid2012. The Company has focused on pre-launch market evaluation of our product in California and Orlando/South Florida for year 2014. The product is currently at the introduction phase of its lifecycle. In April of 2013 Pleasant Kids did market research on the demand for naturally balance alkalized bottle water in Los Angeles, California. In June of 2013 the Company repeated the processes in Orlando, Florida. Pleasant Kids launched its online store in August of 2014 on Amazon.com.. When this model failed to produce profits we decided to seek a suitable merger candidate.
