 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Company Overview 

We are a biopharmaceutical company that currently supports the clinical stage development of a telomerase inhibitor, imetelstat, in hematologic myeloid malignancies, by Janssen Biotech, Inc., or Janssen. Early clinical data, including molecular responses in essential thrombocythemia, or ET, and remission responses, including reversal of bone marrow fibrosis, in myelofibrosis, or MF, suggest imetelstat may have disease-modifying activity by inhibiting the progenitor cells of the malignant clones for the underlying diseases. 

On November 13, 2014, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement, or the Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to which we granted Janssen the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize imetelstat worldwide for all indications in oncology, including hematologic myeloid malignancies, and all other human therapeutic uses. The Collaboration Agreement became effective on December 15, 2014, and we received $35 million from Janssen as an upfront payment. Additional consideration under the Collaboration Agreement includes payments up to a potential total of $900 million for the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as royalties on worldwide net sales. 

Under the Collaboration Agreement, Janssen is wholly responsible for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of, and seeking regulatory approval for imetelstat worldwide. To that end, Janssen is currently proceeding with the development of imetelstat with two clinical trials: a Phase 2 trial in MF, referred to as IMbark&#153;, and a Phase 2/3 trial in myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, referred to as IMerge&#153;. In July 2015, IMbark&#153; opened to patient enrollment, and the first patient was dosed in September 2015. In December 2015, IMerge&#153; opened to patient enrollment, and the first patient was dosed in January 2016. We are contributing 50% of the development costs for these clinical trials, which Janssen is solely conducting. Janssen may consider initiating additional clinical trials, such as possible registration studies in MF and MDS, and possible exploratory Phase 2 and potential follow on Phase 3 studies in acute myelogenous leukemia, or AML. The costs for such studies will be borne 100% by Janssen, unless and until Janssen elects to maintain its license rights and continues to advance the development of imetelstat in any indication, and we subsequently elect certain opt-in rights to share further U.S. development and promotion costs in exchange for higher tiered royalty rates and higher future development and regulatory milestone payments if imetelstat is successfully developed and approved (as described in the section below entitled "Future Development of Imetelstat in Collaboration with Janssen"). 

We expect Janssen to perform a data cut for IMbark&#153; in the second half of 2017, and for Janssen to thereafter initiate the protocol-specified primary analysis; however, the timing may vary based on numerous factors, including the pace of patient enrollment in the clinical trial. Following completion of the protocol-specified primary analysis of IMbark&#153; by Janssen or a certain time period after the initiation of the first Phase 3 MF study, if any, Janssen must notify us of their decision, or a Continuation Decision, as to whether they elect to maintain the license rights granted to them under the Collaboration Agreement and continue to advance the development of imetelstat in any indication. In the event that IMbark&#153; has been terminated early or suspended, Janssen must instead notify us of their Continuation Decision by the date that is the later of 24 months after the initiation of IMerge&#153; or 24 months after the termination of IMbark&#153; or commencement of the suspension period, as applicable. 

With projected reduced operational demands as a result of the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen, on March 3, 2015, we announced an organizational resizing to reduce our workforce from 39 to 21 positions, which was complete as of December 31, 2015. 

We had approximately $146.7 million in cash and investments as of December 31, 2015. We believe our current operational and financial resources may enable us to acquire one or more oncology products, product candidates, programs or companies to diversify our business. 

Telomeres and Telomerase in Normal Development 

In the human body, normal growth and maintenance of tissues occurs by cell division. However, most cells are only able to divide a limited number of times, and this number of divisions is regulated by telomere length. Telomeres are repetitions of a deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, sequence located at the ends of chromosomes. They act as protective caps to maintain stability and integrity of the chromosomes, which contain the cell's genetic material. Normally, every time a cell divides, the 

telomeres shorten. Eventually, they shrink to a critically short length, and as a result, the cell either dies by apoptosis or stops dividing and senesces. 

Telomerase is a naturally occurring enzyme that maintains telomeres and prevents them from shortening during cell division in cells, such as stem cells that must remain immortalized to support normal health. Telomerase consists of at least two essential components: a ribonucleic acid, or RNA, template (hTR), which binds to the telomere, and a catalytic subunit (hTERT) with reverse transcriptase activity, which adds a specific DNA sequence to the chromosome ends. The 2009 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine was awarded to Drs. Elizabeth H. Blackburn, Carol W. Greider and Jack Szostak, former Geron collaborators, for the discovery of how chromosomes are protected by both telomeres and telomerase. 

Telomerase is active during embryonic development, enabling the rapid cell division that supports normal growth. During the latter stages of human fetal development and in adulthood, telomerase is repressed in most cells, and telomere length gradually decreases during a lifetime. In tissues that have a high turnover throughout life, such as blood and gut, telomerase can be transiently upregulated in progenitor cells to enable controlled, self-limited proliferation to replace cells lost through natural cell aging processes. In proliferating progenitor cells, relatively long telomeres are maintained by upregulated telomerase. As the progeny of progenitor cells mature, telomerase is downregulated and telomeres shorten with cell division, preventing uncontrolled proliferation. 

Telomeres and Telomerase in Cancer 

Telomerase is upregulated in many tumor progenitor cells, which enables the continued and uncontrolled proliferation of the malignant cells that drive tumor growth and progression. Telomerase expression has been found to be present in approximately 90% of biopsies taken from a broad range of human cancers. Our nonclinical studies, in which the telomerase gene was artificially introduced and expressed in normal cells grown in culture, have suggested that telomerase does not itself cause a normal cell to become malignant. Instead, the sustained upregulation of telomerase enables tumor cells to maintain telomere length, providing them with the capacity for limitless proliferation. We believe that the sustained upregulation of telomerase is critical for tumor progression as it enables malignant progenitor cells to acquire cellular immortality and avoid apoptosis, or cell death. 

Telomerase Inhibition: Inducing Cancer Cell Death 

We believe that inhibiting telomerase may be an attractive approach to treating cancer because it may limit the proliferative capacity of malignant cells. We and others have observed in various in vitro and rodent tumor models that inhibiting telomerase results in telomere shortening and arrests uncontrolled malignant cell proliferation and tumor growth. In vitro studies have suggested that tumor cells with short telomeres may be especially sensitive to the anti-proliferative effects of inhibiting telomerase. Our nonclinical data also suggest that inhibiting telomerase is particularly effective at limiting the proliferation of malignant progenitor cells, which have high levels of telomerase and are believed to be important drivers of tumor growth and progression. 

Many hematologic malignancies, such as ET, MF, and polycythemia vera, or PV, are known to arise from malignant progenitor cells in the bone marrow that express higher telomerase activity and have shorter telomeres when compared to normal healthy cells. 

Imetelstat: The First Telomerase Inhibitor to Advance to Clinical Development 

Imetelstat is a lipid conjugated 13-mer oligonucleotide that we designed to be complementary to and bind with high affinity to the RNA template of telomerase, thereby directly inhibiting telomerase activity. The compound has a proprietary thio-phosphoramidate backbone, which is designed to provide resistance to the effect of cellular nucleases, thus conferring improved stability in plasma and tissues, as 

well as improved binding affinity to its target. To improve the ability of imetelstat to penetrate cellular membranes, we conjugated the oligonucleotide to a lipid group. Imetelstat's IC50, or half maximal inhibitory concentration, is 0.5-10 nM in cell free assays. The tissue half-life of imetelstat, or the time it takes for the concentration or amount of imetelstat to be reduced by half, in bone marrow, spleen, liver and tumor has been estimated to be 41 hours in humans, based on data from our animal studies and clinical trial data. The tissue half-life indicates how long a drug will remain present in the tissues, and a longer tissue half-life may enable a drug to remain at effective doses for a longer period of time. Imetelstat also has been shown in nonclinical studies to exhibit relatively preferential inhibition of the clonal proliferation of malignant progenitor cells compared to normal progenitors. For these reasons, imetelstat has been studied as a treatment for malignant diseases. 

Imetelstat is the first telomerase inhibitor to advance to clinical development. The Phase 1 trials that we completed evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of imetelstat. We established doses and dosing schedules that were tolerable and achieved target exposures in patients that were consistent with those required for efficacy in animal models. We believe adverse events were generally manageable and reversible. The dose-limiting toxicities were thrombocytopenia, or reduced platelet count, and neutropenia, or reduced neutrophil count. Following intravenous administration of imetelstat using tolerable dosing regimens, clinically relevant and significant inhibition of telomerase activity was observed in various types of tissue in which telomerase activity is measurable, including normal bone marrow hematopoietic cells, malignant plasma cells, hair follicle cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. 

Developing Imetelstat to Treat Hematologic Myeloid Malignancies 

Proof-of-Concept in Essential Thrombocythemia 

Myeloproliferative neoplasms, or MPNs, are hematologic myeloid malignancies that arise from malignant hematopoietic myeloid progenitor cells in the bone marrow, such as the precursor cells of red blood cells, platelets and granulocytes. Proliferation of malignant progenitor cells leads to an overproduction of any combination of myeloid white cells, red blood cells and/or platelets, depending on the disease. These overproduced cells may also be abnormal, leading to additional clinical complications. MPN diseases include PV, ET and MF. ET is an MPN characterized by a high platelet count, often accompanied by a high white cell count, and an increased risk of thrombosis, or bleeding, in higher risk patients. 

In January 2011, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of imetelstat in patients with ET. The Phase 2 ET trial was a multi-center, single arm, and open label trial that we designed to provide proof-of-concept for the potential use of imetelstat as a treatment for hematologic myeloid malignancies, such as MF, MDS or AML. The trial leveraged clinical observations from Phase 1 trials suggesting that imetelstat reduces platelet counts, as well as nonclinical observations that imetelstat distributes well to bone marrow in rodent models and selectively inhibits the proliferation of malignant progenitors ex vivo from patients with ET. Hematologic responses were measured by reductions in platelet counts, and molecular responses were measured by reductions in the JAK2 V617F mutant allele burden in circulating granulocytes as assessed by a reduction in the proportion of the abnormal Janus kinase 2, or JAK2, gene compared to the normal, or wild type JAK2 gene. Reductions in calreticulin, or CALR, and myeloproliferative leukemia protein, or MPL, mutant allele burdens were measured similarly. We believe that the observed reductions in JAK2, CALR and MPL allele burdens are consistent with selective inhibition of the malignant progenitor cells responsible for the disease, and suggest that imetelstat may exhibit disease-modifying activity. 

The primary efficacy analysis of the Phase 2 ET trial was conducted in October 2013 and the data were published in the September 3, 2015 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine : 

Patient Demographics: 

&#149; A total of 18 ET patients were enrolled in the study, and all had received one or more previous treatments. &#149; The median baseline platelet count was 787,500 per cubic millimeter (range: 521,000 to 1,359,000). &#149; The JAK2 V617F gene mutation was detected in eight patients, the CALR gene mutation was detected in five patients and MPL gene mutations were detected in two patients at baseline. Efficacy Data : 

&#149; Imetelstat induced platelet count reductions in all 18 patients in the trial (a 100.0% hematologic response rate) and normalizations in 16 out of 18 patients (an 88.9% complete response rate). &#149; The median time on therapy was 17.1 months (range: 6.9 months to 2.7 years). &#149; Seven out of the eight (87.5%) patients with a JAK2 V617F gene mutation achieved 72% to 96% reductions in JAK2 V617F allele burden that qualified as partial molecular responses. The median JAK2 V617F mutant allele burden was reduced by 71% at month 3 after the initiation of treatment and remained reduced by 59% at month 12 despite less frequent maintenance dosing. &#149; MPL and CALR mutant allele burdens were also reduced by 15% to 66%. Data from further mutational analyses of patient samples from the Phase 2 ET trial were presented in an oral session at the 57th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition in December 2015, and showed that imetelstat treatment suppressed allele burdens of multiple additional mutations. 

Collectively, these data suggest that imetelstat inhibits the progenitor cells of the malignant clone or clones believed to be responsible for the underlying disease in a relatively selective manner. 

Safety Data : 

The nature of adverse events reported in the Phase 2 ET trial have been similar to the adverse events reported in other imetelstat clinical trials, with fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms and cytopenias being the most frequently observed adverse events. Additional observations from the Phase 2 ET trial include: 

&#149; One patient experienced Grade 3 hepatic cirrhosis, which was initially assessed by the investigator to be related to imetelstat. The patient later experienced hepatic encephalopathy and died of bleeding esophageal varices after the primary analysis in October 2013. Both of these subsequent events were assessed after the patient's death by the investigator to be unrelated to imetelstat. &#149; Two patients experienced reversible Grade 3 alanine transaminase, which was assessed by the investigator to be possibly attributable to imetelstat. &#149; At least one abnormal liver function test, or LFT, was observed in laboratory findings in all patients in the trial, with some patients experiencing persistent low-grade LFT abnormalities with longer dosing. With longer dosing, Grade 1 increases in alkaline phosphatase were observed, associated with mostly Grade 1 to some Grade 2 unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The clinical significance and long-term consequences of such persistent low-grade LFT abnormalities is currently undetermined. 7 

On March 11, 2014, the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, issued a full clinical hold on our Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for imetelstat, citing a lack of evidence of reversibility of hepatotoxicity, concern regarding a risk of chronic liver injury, and a lack of adequate follow-up in patients who had hepatotoxic effects. All the patients who were still receiving imetelstat discontinued active treatment and were observed for safety. Follow-up safety data from those patients and the patients who had already discontinued prior to the clinical hold showed that LFT abnormalities resolved to normal or baseline during or after withdrawal of imetelstat treatment in most patients. We submitted a complete response to the FDA with follow-up information regarding reversibility of hepatotoxicity for all patients who received imetelstat in the ET and multiple myeloma studies, and the FDA lifted the clinical hold on October 31, 2014. 

Clinical Development in Myelofibrosis 

MF is a myeloproliferative neoplasm among related diseases, such as ET, and is characterized by clonal proliferation of malignant hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow that causes bone marrow fibrosis, increased bone density, known as osteosclerosis, and abnormal rapid proliferation of blood vessels, known as pathological angiogenesis. MF patients may exhibit abnormally low red blood cells/hemoglobin, known as progressive anemia, abnormally low white blood cells, known as leukopenia, abnormally high white blood cells, known as leukocytosis, abnormally low platelets, known as thrombocytopenia, abnormally high platelets, known as thrombocytosis, an abnormally high proportion of immature blood cells in the blood, known as peripheral blood leukoerythroblastosis, and abnormally high precursor white cells in the blood, known as excess circulating blasts. In addition, impaired blood production from the bone marrow causes blood production to shift to other organs such as the spleen and liver, known as extramedullary hematopoiesis, which leads to an enlarged spleen, known as splenomegaly, or an enlarged liver, known as hepatomegaly. MF patients can also suffer from debilitating constitutional symptoms, such as drenching night sweats, fatigue, severe itching, known as pruritus, fever and bone pain. The estimated prevalence of MF in the United States, or U.S., is approximately 13,000 patients, with an annual incidence of approximately 3,000 patients. Approximately 70% of MF patients are classified as having intermediate-2 or high risk disease, as defined by the Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System Plus, or DIPSS Plus, described in a 2011 Journal of Clinical Oncology article. These patients have a median survival of approximately one to three years, representing a significant unmet medical need. 

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, or allo-HCT, is the only current treatment approach for MF that can lead to complete remission of the disease with normalization of peripheral blood counts, regression of bone marrow fibrosis, disappearance of cytogenetic abnormalities, normalization of spleen size and resolution of constitutional symptoms. However, use of allo-HCT is limited to a very small number of eligible patients due to the lack of suitable donors, older age and/or comorbid conditions. In addition, graft vs. host disease and life-threatening infections are other limitations of allo-HCT treatment. 

Pilot Study in Myelofibrosis (MF Pilot Study) 

Based on the data from the Phase 2 ET trial, in November 2012, Dr. Ayalew Tefferi, or the investigator, at Mayo Clinic, initiated a clinical trial evaluating imetelstat in patients with MF. This trial, known as the MF Pilot Study, was designed to assess the effect of imetelstat in patients with MF. The MF Pilot Study is an open label trial in patients with primary MF, post-ET MF, or post-PV MF who are classified as intermediate-2 or high risk as defined by DIPSS Plus. In the MF Pilot Study, imetelstat is administered as a single agent over a two hour intravenous infusion to patients in multiple patient cohorts. In the first cohort, Cohort A, imetelstat is given once every three weeks. In the second cohort, Cohort B, imetelstat is given weekly for four weeks, followed by one dose every three weeks. The starting dose of imetelstat in Cohorts A and B was 9.4 mg/kg, with dose reductions and dose holds 

allowed for toxicity. The primary endpoint in the MF Pilot Study is overall response rate, which is defined by the proportion of patients who are classified as responders, which means that they have achieved either a clinical improvement, or CI, partial remission, or PR, or complete remission, or CR, consistent with the criteria of the 2013 International Working Group for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment, or IWG-MRT criteria, described in a 2013 Blood article. Secondary endpoints include reduction of spleen size by palpation, improvement in anemia or inducement of red blood cell transfusion independence, safety and tolerability. In January 2014, Mayo Clinic closed the MF Pilot Study to new patient enrollment. 

Following is a summary of the efficacy and safety data from Cohorts A and B (n=33) of the MF Pilot Study, using a December 2014 data cut-off date, as published in the September 3, 2015 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine . 

Patient Demographics: 

&#149; The patients enrolled were classified as having either intermediate-2 or high risk disease by DIPSS Plus. 16 patients were classified as intermediate-2 and 17 patients were classified as high risk. &#149; Of the 33 patients, 18 (54.5%) had primary MF, 10 (30.3%) had post-PV MF, and five (15.2%) had post-ET MF. &#149; 26 of 33 (78.8%) patients had received prior treatments, including sixteen patients (48.5%) with JAK inhibitors. &#149; 13 of 33 (39.4%) patients were dependent on red-cell transfusions, defined as requiring six units of packed red blood cells during the 12 week period prior to enrollment, including at least two units of red-cell transfusions in the last four weeks prior to study entry, for a hemoglobin level of less than 8.5 grams per deciliter. &#149; 23 of 33 (69.7%) patients had palpable splenomegaly (median: 15 centimeters below the left costal margin; range: five to 33 centimeters). Efficacy Data : 

&#149; Seven of 33 (21.2%) patients achieved remissions as defined by the IWG-MRT criteria, including a complete remission, or CR, in four patients and a partial remission, or PR, in three patients. &#149; The four patients with a CR had documented reversal of bone marrow fibrosis, and three of them also had molecular remissions. &#149; For the patients who achieved remissions, median duration was 18 months (range: 13 months to 20+ months) for CRs and 10 months (range: 7 months to 10+ months) for PRs. &#149; Eight of 23 (34.8%) patients with splenomegaly achieved spleen responses by palpation, which is defined as either greater than or equal to 50% decrease if the baseline is greater than or equal to 10 centimeters or becoming non palpable if baseline is five to less than 10 centimeters. Four of the eight patients who achieved a spleen response also achieved a remission. &#149; Four of 13 (30.8%) patients who were transfusion dependent at baseline became transfusion independent, which is defined as an absence of any packed red blood cell transfusions during any consecutive three month interval with a hemoglobin level of at least 8.5 grams per deciliter. Three of the four patients who became transfusion independent also achieved a remission and sustained a hemoglobin level of more than 10 grams per deciliter during imetelstat therapy. At the data-cutoff date, these three patients were still transfusion-independent. 9 

&#149; 17 of 21 (81.0%) patients with at least 1% circulating blasts, or immature white cells, at baseline achieved either complete resolution (n=14, 66.7%) or partial resolution (n=3, 14.3%), defined as 50% reduction from baseline. &#149; 22 of 27 (81.5%) patients with leukoerythroblastosis achieved either complete resolution (n=13, 48.1%) or partial resolution (n=9, 33.3%), defined as 50% reduction from baseline. &#149; Eight of 10 (80.0%) patients with marked leukocytosis achieved either complete resolution (n=3, 30.0%) or partial resolution (n=5, 50.0%), defined as 50% reduction from baseline. &#149; 11 of 11 (100.0%) patients with thrombocytosis achieved either complete resolution (n=10, 90.9%) or partial resolution (n=1, 9.1%), defined as 50% reduction from baseline. We believe that these efficacy data from the MF Pilot Study suggest that imetelstat may have disease-modifying activity in MF. Furthermore, we believe that the remissions reported as of the cut-off date may be characterized as durable. 

Safety Data: 

The nature of adverse events reported in the MF Pilot Study have been similar in nature to the adverse events reported in the Phase 2 ET trial, with fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms and cytopenias being the most frequently observed adverse events. Additional observations from the MF Pilot Study include: 

&#149; The dose-limiting and most clinically significant side effects were cytopenias (decreases in the counts of certain types of circulating blood cells), primarily thrombocytopenia (low level of platelets) and neutropenia (low level of neutrophils), which were the principal reason for the protocol-mandated dose reductions that occurred in 22 out of 33 patients (66.7%) in the study. One patient died due to intracranial hemorrhage that was attributed by the treating physician to drug-induced grade 4 thrombocytopenia after weekly dosing. &#149; To mitigate the risk of severe, persistent cytopenias, the protocol for the MF Pilot Study was amended to raise the hematologic threshold for retreatment and include more stringent monitoring and dose adjustment criteria. Since then, no further episodes of significant bleeding events associated with thrombocytopenia, or infections associated with neutropenia, or episodes of febrile neutropenia have been reported to us by the investigator or Janssen. As a result, we believe that the myelosuppressive effect of the drug may be manageable through dose hold rules and dose modifications. &#149; Low grade LFT abnormalities were observed in patients in the study. None of the LFT abnormalities were linked to clinically significant adverse events, and the LFT abnormalities reversed to baseline values in the majority of patients upon withdrawal of imetelstat treatment. In March 2014, we were informed by Mayo Clinic that the investigator's IND for the MF Pilot Study was placed on partial clinical hold by the FDA due to a safety signal of hepatotoxicity that was identified in Geron's Phase 2 clinical trials of imetelstat and that it was unknown if this hepatotoxicity was reversible. The investigator submitted a complete response to the FDA with follow-up information regarding reversibility of hepatotoxicity for all patients who received imetelstat in the MF Pilot Study, and the partial hold was removed by the FDA in June 2014. 

Status of the Study 

In March 2015, we transferred our investigational new drug application, or IND, for imetelstat to Janssen, as well as the IND that we received in September 2014 from Mayo Clinic for the MF Pilot Study. Upon transfer of the IND for the MF Pilot Study to Janssen, Janssen assumed responsibility as trial sponsor for the MF Pilot Study. The MF Pilot Study remains closed to new patient enrollment, but remaining enrolled patients continue to receive imetelstat treatment. Janssen continues to collect data and information principally related to safety from those patients who remain enrolled in the MF Pilot Study. In this regard, additional and updated safety data generated from the MF Pilot Study may be materially different from the data discussed above. Accordingly, the data discussed above should be considered carefully and with caution. Please refer to the risk factor entitled "Risks Related to Clinical and Commercialization Activities&#151;Success in early clinical trials may not be indicative of results in potential future clinical trials. Likewise, preliminary data from clinical trials we have reported should be considered with caution since the final data may be materially different from the preliminary data, particularly as more patient data becomes available" under Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors," of this annual report on Form 10-K. 

Clinical Development in Myelodysplastic Syndromes 

Myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, are a group of blood disorders that arise from the proliferation of malignant progenitor cell clones in the bone marrow, resulting in disordered and ineffective production of the myeloid lineage, which includes red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. In MDS, bone marrow and peripheral blood cells may have abnormal, or dysplastic, cell morphology. MDS is frequently characterized clinically by severe anemia, or low red cell counts and low hemoglobin. In addition, other peripheral cytopenias, or low numbers of white blood cells and platelets, may cause life-threatening infections and bleeding. Transformation to AML occurs in up to 30% of MDS cases and results in poorer overall survival. 

MDS is the most common of the myeloid malignancies. There are approximately 12,000 reported new cases of MDS in the United States every year and approximately 60,000 people living with the disease. MDS is primarily a disease of the elderly, with median age at diagnosis around 70 years. The majority of patients, approximately 70%, fall into what are considered to be the lower risk groups at diagnosis, according to the IPSS, or International Prognostic Scoring System, that takes into account the presence of a number of disease factors, such as cytopenias and cytogenetics to assign relative risk of progression to AML and overall survival. 

When initially diagnosed with MDS, approximately 80% of patients have anemia. Chronic anemia is the predominant clinical problem in lower risk disease. Many of these patients become dependent on red blood cell transfusions, which can lead to elevated levels of iron in the blood and other tissues that the body has no normal way to eliminate. Iron overload is a potentially dangerous condition. Studies in patients with MDS have shown that iron overload resulting from regular red blood cell transfusions is associated with a poorer overall survival and a higher risk of developing AML. 

Pilot Study Cohort in MDS 

Based on his preliminary observations in patients with MF, the investigator in the MF Pilot Study enrolled a cohort of nine patients with a form of MDS known as refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts, or RARS, in the MF Pilot Study. In this cohort, or the MDS-RARS Cohort, imetelstat is given once every four weeks, at a starting dose of 7.5 mg/kg, with dose reductions and dose holds allowed for toxicity. Under the protocol, patients may receive an increased dose after the first two cycles of treatment if certain safety and response criteria are met. Efficacy assessments in the MDS-RARS Cohort were according to the 2006 International Working Group criteria for MDS, described in a 2006 Blood article, and included the proportion of patients achieving red blood cell 

transfusion independence. The effect on spleen size by palpation, and on thrombocytosis and leukocytosis, as well as safety and tolerability were also assessed. 

Following is a summary of the efficacy and safety data from the MDS-RARS Cohort that were presented by the investigator in an oral session at the 57th ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition in December 2015. 

Patient Demographics: 

&#149; The patients enrolled were classified as having either intermediate-1 or intermediate-2 risk disease by IPSS. Seven patients were classified as intermediate-1 and two patients were classified as intermediate-2. &#149; Seven of nine patients had received prior treatments, including six with erythropoiesis stimulating agents, or ESAs. &#149; All patients enrolled were anemic, defined as having hemoglobin levels less than 10 grams per deciliter. &#149; Eight of nine patients were dependent on red blood cell transfusions, defined as requiring four units of packed red blood cells during the eight week period prior to study entry. Efficacy Data: 

&#149; Three of the eight (37.5%) patients who were transfusion dependent at study entry became transfusion independent, defined as not requiring transfusions for at least eight weeks. &#149; The median duration of transfusion independence was 28 weeks (range: nine weeks to 37 weeks). &#149; One patient had a &#62;50% decrease in palpable spleen size from 16 centimeters below the left costal margin at baseline and a decrease in red blood cell transfusion rate. &#149; In two patients, neutrophil and platelet counts normalized. &#149; One patient achieved an erythroid hematologic improvement, defined as an increase in hemoglobin levels by 1.5 grams per deciliter. Safety Data: 

The nature of adverse events presented by the investigator in the MDS-RARS Cohort have been similar to the adverse events reported in the MF Pilot Study, with fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms and cytopenias among the most frequently observed adverse events. Additional observations presented by the investigator in the MDS-RARS Cohort include: 

&#149; One patient with pre-existing cardiovascular disease history died of cardiac arrest, which was assessed by the investigator to be unrelated to imetelstat. &#149; No prolonged (defined as lasting four weeks or longer) Grade &#179; 3 hematological toxicities were observed. &#149; Low grade LFT abnormalities were observed in this cohort of patients. These LFT abnormalities reversed to baseline values in the majority of patients in the MDS-RARS Cohort upon withdrawal of imetelstat treatment. No patients in the MDS-RARS Cohort discontinued due to LFT abnormalities, and none of the LFT abnormalities were linked to clinically significant adverse events. 12 

We believe that these data suggest that imetelstat may have clinically meaningful activity in some patients with MDS-RARS that warrants further studies in patients with MDS. 

Future Development of Imetelstat in Collaboration with Janssen 

On November 13, 2014, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement, which gave Janssen the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize imetelstat worldwide for all indications in oncology, including hematologic myeloid malignancies, and all other human therapeutic uses. The Collaboration Agreement became effective on December 15, 2014, and we received $35 million from Janssen as an upfront payment. Additional consideration under the Collaboration Agreement includes payments up to a potential total of $900 million for the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as royalties on worldwide net sales. 

Under the Collaboration Agreement, Janssen is wholly responsible for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of, and seeking regulatory approval for imetelstat worldwide. To that end, Janssen is currently proceeding with the development of imetelstat with two clinical trials: IMbark&#153; and IMerge&#153;. In July 2015, IMbark&#153; opened to patient enrollment, and the first patient was dosed in September 2015. In December 2015, IMerge&#153; opened to patient enrollment, and the first patient was dosed in January 2016. We are contributing 50% of the development costs for these clinical trials, which Janssen is solely conducting. Janssen may consider initiating additional clinical trials, such as possible registration studies in MF and MDS, and possible exploratory Phase 2 and potential follow on Phase 3 studies in AML. The costs for such studies will be borne 100% by Janssen, unless and until they make an affirmative Continuation Decision and we elect our U.S. Opt-In Rights (as defined and described in further detail below). 

We expect Janssen to perform a data cut for IMbark&#153; in the second half of 2017, and for Janssen to thereafter initiate the protocol-specified primary analysis; however, the timing depends on numerous factors, including the pace of patient enrollment in IMbark&#153;. Following the protocol-specified primary analysis of IMbark&#153; or a certain time period after the initiation of the first Phase 3 MF study, if any, Janssen must notify us of their Continuation Decision. In the event that IMbark&#153; is terminated early or suspended, Janssen must instead notify us of their Continuation Decision by the date that is the later of 24 months after the initiation of IMerge&#153; or 24 months after the termination of IMbark&#153; or commencement of the suspension period, as applicable. 

In the event that Janssen notifies us of an affirmative Continuation Decision, we will then have an option to share further U.S. development and promotion costs, or the U.S. Opt-In Rights, in exchange for higher tiered royalty rates and higher future potential milestone payments if imetelstat is successfully developed and approved. If we exercise the U.S. Opt-In Rights, then we and Janssen will share U.S. development and promotion costs beyond IMbark&#153; and IMerge&#153; on a 20/80 basis (Geron 20%, Janssen 80%), we will receive a $65 million milestone payment at the time of the Continuation Decision, and will be eligible to receive additional potential payments of up to $470 million in development and regulatory milestones, up to $350 million in sales milestones, and tiered royalties ranging from a mid-teens up to a low twenties percentage rate on worldwide net sales of imetelstat in any countries where regulatory exclusivity exists or there are valid claims under the patent rights exclusively licensed to Janssen. In addition, if we exercise the U.S. Opt-In Rights, we will also have a separate co-promotion option, or the U.S. Co-Promotion Option, to provide 20% of the U.S. selling effort with our sales force personnel, in lieu of funding 20% of U.S. promotion costs, upon regulatory approval and commercial launch of imetelstat in the United States. Such co-promotion would be conducted under a Janssen prepared promotion plan, and in accordance with a co-promotion agreement to be agreed by us and Janssen at the time of our exercise of the U.S. Co-Promotion Option. We would be responsible for all costs associated with establishing and maintaining our sales force in any conduct of such co-promotion. All product sales would be booked by Janssen. If we do not exercise the U.S. Opt-In Rights upon an affirmative Continuation Decision by Janssen, then all further 

development and promotion costs beyond IMbark&#153; or IMerge&#153; will be borne by Janssen, we will receive a $65 million milestone payment at the time of the Continuation Decision plus a $70 million milestone payment for Janssen's retention of full U.S. rights, and will be eligible to receive additional potential payments of up to $415 million in development and regulatory milestones, up to $350 million in sales milestones, and tiered royalties ranging from a double-digit up to a mid-teens percentage rate on worldwide net sales in any countries where regulatory exclusivity exists or there are valid claims under the patent rights exclusively licensed to Janssen. 

Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, we and Janssen have created a joint governance structure, including joint development and steering committees and working groups, to oversee and manage worldwide regulatory, development and manufacturing work under the joint clinical development plan and promotional activities (assuming we exercise the U.S. Opt-In Rights) for imetelstat, with Janssen responsible for the operational execution of those activities. In addition, both we and Janssen may propose to the joint development committee imetelstat development for any new indications not then provided for in the joint clinical development plan and if we and Janssen agree such development should be conducted outside of the joint clinical development plan, both we and Janssen would be entitled to independently undertake such development at the developing party's own cost, subject to the other party's obligation to provide reimbursement for its specified portion of the development costs plus a premium following marketing approval of imetelstat in such newly proposed indication as a result of such independent development. In the event that we do not exercise the U.S. Opt-In Rights following Janssen's positive Continuation Decision, the joint governance structure under the Collaboration Agreement would be dissolved, a joint oversight committee would monitor the progress of the collaboration, and we would have no further rights to conduct any independent imetelstat development. 

After an affirmative Continuation Decision by Janssen, the Collaboration Agreement would remain in effect until the expiration of the last-to-expire patent or the royalty obligations on sales of imetelstat cease, unless terminated earlier. If Janssen does not effect an affirmative Continuation Decision, then the Collaboration Agreement would terminate and all rights to the imetelstat program would revert to us. Janssen may terminate the Collaboration Agreement at any time for convenience or due to a safety-related concern. If a notice of termination from Janssen occurs, we would be entitled to certain continued operational support from Janssen and cost-sharing under various circumstances and all rights to the imetelstat program would revert to us.

IMbark&#153; 

IMbark&#153; is designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of two dose levels of single-agent imetelstat in patients with MF. The trial is designed to enroll approximately 200 patients, including approximately 100 patients per dosing arm, with DIPSS intermediate-2 or high risk MF who have relapsed after or are refractory to JAK inhibitor treatment. At the time of enrollment, patients must have measurable splenomegaly and symptoms of MF. Patients will be assigned randomly on a blinded basis on a 1:1 ratio to one of two dosing arms&#151;9.4 mg/kg every three weeks or 4.7 mg/kg every three weeks. Dose reductions for adverse events are allowed and will follow protocol-specified algorithms. 

Multiple medical centers across North America, Europe and Asia are planned to participate in IMbark&#153;. Study design information for IMbark&#153;, including patient eligibility criteria, is posted on clinicaltrials.gov, and the list of participating clinical trial sites is expected to be updated on an ongoing basis. 

The co-primary efficacy endpoints for the trial are spleen response rate and symptom response rate. Spleen response rate is defined as the percentage of patients who achieve &#179; 35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline at the Week 24 visit, as measured by imaging scans and assessed at a central imaging facility and by an Independent Review Committee. Symptom response rate is defined as the percentage of patients who have &#179; 50% reduction in Total Symptom Scores from baseline at the 

Week 24 visit, based on patient-reported outcomes on a modified Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form version 2.0 electronic diary. The protocol-specified primary analysis of the co-primary endpoints will occur after all enrolled and treated patients have been followed for at least 24 weeks. We expect Janssen to perform a data cut for IMbark&#153; in the second half of 2017, and for Janssen to thereafter initiate the protocol-specified primary analysis; however, the timing may vary depending on numerous factors, including the pace of patient enrollment in IMbark&#153;. Secondary efficacy endpoints include the number of patients achieving CR or PR, CI, and anemia, spleen and symptom responses as assessed using the modified 2013 IWG-MRT criteria. These secondary endpoints will be assessed at the time of the primary efficacy analysis. Exploratory endpoints include cytogenetic and molecular responses, as well as leukemia-free survival. 

Safety outcomes will be monitored throughout the trial and will include enhanced data collection and reporting for adverse events of interest, including hepatobiliary-associated laboratory findings and hepatic adverse events. 

We expect Janssen to conduct an internal review of data for safety and efficacy from IMbark&#153; after 40 patients (20 patients per dosing arm) have been enrolled and treated for at least 12 weeks. We expect that this review, if conducted, would assess the adequacy of one or both of the initial dosing regimens. We expect IMbark&#153; enrollment to continue at the time of internal review. As a result of this internal review, one or both dosing arms could continue as planned, be stopped or modified, or alternative doses could be selected. It is also possible that Janssen would elect to not continue the study, and, potentially, to terminate the Collaboration Agreement. Depending on numerous factors, including the pace of patient enrollment in IMbark&#153;, we expect Janssen to conduct this internal data review in the second half of 2016. We expect full clinical data from IMbark&#153; to be presented at a medical conference to be determined in the future. 

IMerge&#153; 

IMerge&#153; is designed to evaluate imetelstat in transfusion dependent patients with IPSS low or intermediate-1 risk MDS who have relapsed after or are refractory to prior treatment with an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent. 

As designed, IMerge&#153; consists of two parts and a total of approximately 200 patients are expected to be enrolled. Part 1 of the trial is planned as a Phase 2, open-label, single-arm design to assess the efficacy and safety of imetelstat. Up to 30 patients are expected to be enrolled in Part 1, who will all receive imetelstat and be followed for safety, hematologic improvement and reduction in transfusion requirement. Before proceeding to Part 2, the data from Part 1 must support a positive assessment of the benefit-risk profile of imetelstat in these patients. Based on numerous factors, including the pace of patient enrollment in Part 1 of the trial, we expect Janssen to conduct an internal review of the data from Part 1 in the second half of 2016. During this internal review, no new patients will be enrolled into the study. Part 2 of the trial is planned as a Phase 3 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design to compare the efficacy of imetelstat against placebo. Approximately 170 patients are expected to be enrolled in Part 2, and such patients will be assigned randomly, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive either imetelstat or placebo. The inclusion criteria for both parts of the trial require that at the time of enrollment each patient must be red blood cell transfusion-dependent. Imetelstat in Parts 1 and 2, or placebo in Part 2, will be administered as an intravenous infusion. The planned starting dose of imetelstat will be 7.5 mg/kg every four weeks and may be escalated according to certain protocol-specified conditions. Dose reductions for adverse events may follow protocol-specified algorithms. All patients may receive supportive care, including transfusions or myeloid growth factors, as needed per investigator discretion and according to local standard practices. 

The primary efficacy endpoint is designed to be the rate of red blood cell transfusion-independence lasting at least eight weeks, defined as the proportion of patients without any red blood 

cell transfusion during any consecutive eight weeks since entry to the trial. A primary efficacy analysis is planned to occur 12 months after the last patient is enrolled. We expect full clinical data from IMerge&#153; to be presented at a medical conference to be determined in the future. 

Secondary efficacy endpoints include the proportion of patients achieving red blood cell transfusion-independence lasting at least 24 weeks, the time to and duration of red blood cell transfusion-independence, the proportion of patients achieving hematologic improvement, the proportion of patients achieving CR or PR according to the 2006 International Working Group, or IWG, criteria for MDS, the proportion of patients requiring red blood cell transfusions and the amount, the proportion of patients requiring the use of myeloid growth factors and the dose, as well as assessments of the change in the patients' quality of life using several different validated instruments. Patients are also planned to be followed for an assessment of overall survival and time to progression to AML. These secondary endpoints are expected to be assessed at the time of the primary efficacy analysis. 

Safety outcomes will be monitored throughout the trial and will include enhanced data collection and reporting for adverse events of interest, including hepatobiliary-associated laboratory findings and hepatic adverse events. 

Multiple medical centers across North and South America, Europe and Asia are planned to participate in the trial. Study design information for IMerge&#153;, including patient eligibility criteria, is posted on clinicaltrials.gov, and the list of participating clinical trial sites is expected to be updated on an ongoing basis. 

Research and Development 

Our research and development costs were $17.8 million, $20.7 million and $23.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#151;Research and Development Expenses" for additional detail regarding our research and development activities. 

Intellectual Property 

Intellectual property, including patent protection, is very important to our business. We file patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions, and we also rely on trade secret protection and contractual arrangements to protect aspects of our business. An enforceable patent with appropriate claim coverage can provide an advantage over competitors who may seek to employ similar approaches to develop therapeutics, and so the future commercial success of imetelstat, and therefore our future success, will be in part dependent on our intellectual property strategy. The information provided in this section should be reviewed in the context of the section entitled "Risks Related to Protecting Our Intellectual Property" under Item 1A, "Risk Factors". 

The development of biotechnology products, including imetelstat, typically includes the early development of a technology, followed by rounds of increasingly focused innovation around a product opportunity, including identification and definition of a specific product candidate and uses thereof, manufacturing processes, product formulation and administration methods. The result of this process is that biotechnology products are often protected by several families of patent filings that are filed at different times during product development and cover different aspects of the product. Consequently, earlier filed, broad technology patents will usually expire ahead of patents covering later developments such as product formulations, so that patent expirations on a product may span several years. Patent coverage may also vary from country to country based on the scope of available patent protection. There are also opportunities to obtain an extension of patent coverage for a product in certain countries, which adds further complexity to the determination of patent life. 

We endeavor to monitor worldwide patent filings by third parties that are relevant to our business. Based on this monitoring, we may determine that an action is appropriate to protect our business interests. Such actions may include negotiating patent licenses where appropriate, filing oppositions against a patent, filing a request for post grant review against a patent or filing a request for the declaration of an interference with a patent application or issued patent. 

Imetelstat 

We have issued patents in the United States, Europe and other countries related to imetelstat. Composition of matter patents generally provide the most material coverage, and therefore may convey competitive advantages. Because imetelstat is still under development, subsequent innovation and associated patent filings may provide additional patent coverage with later expiration dates. Examination of overseas patent applications typically lags behind U.S. examination particularly where cases are filed first in the United States. It may be possible to obtain patent term extensions of some patents in some countries for claims covering imetelstat which could further extend the patent term. 

Product Candidate 

&#160; U.S. Patent Status / Expiration Date &#160; Europe Patent Status / Expiration Date &#160; Japan Patent Status / Expiration Date Imetelstat (composition of matter) &#160; Issued / 2025 &#160; Issued / 2020* &#160; Issued / 2024 

* An additional composition of matter patent application for imetelstat has been filed that, if issued, would provide European patent protection until 2024. In addition, we have received patent coverage in Europe until 2029 for the use of imetelstat for the treatment of cancer utilizing certain dosing regimens. 

Our patent rights relating to imetelstat include those covering a method of inhibiting telomerase using the nucleic acid sequence complementary to hTR, (the RNA component of telomerase against which the oligonucleotide component of imetelstat is targeted); composition claims to the drug molecule and related nucleic acid telomerase inhibiting molecules; the amidate nucleic acid chemistry used in the oligonucleotide; as well as manufacturing processes for the drug, and method of treatment and kit claims, certain of which are co-owned by us. These patents have been exclusively licensed to Janssen for imetelstat and related products whose mechanism of action is telomerase inhibition, for all human disorders or medical conditions. In addition, certain of our patent rights for measuring the expression of telomerase activity or the length of telomeres in cells have been non-exclusively licensed to Janssen and other companies. 

Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen, we remain responsible for prosecuting, at Janssen's direction, the patents exclusively licensed to Janssen, with costs shared between us and Janssen on a 50/50 basis. For intellectual property developed under the Collaboration Agreement, the party having sole ownership interest in such intellectual property will be responsible for prosecuting any such patents, with Janssen bearing all of the patent costs for such intellectual property solely owned by Janssen and with patent costs for such intellectual property either jointly owned or solely owned by us shared between the parties on a 50/50 basis. 

Telomerase 

Our patent rights relating to telomerase that cover the cloned genes that encode the catalytic protein component (hTERT) of human telomerase and cells that are immortalized by expression of recombinant hTERT are co-owned with and in-licensed exclusively from the University of Colorado. Certain patents for identifying telomerase modulators or diagnosing cancer by measuring the expression of telomerase activity are co-owned and in-licensed from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and the University of California. 

Licensing 

In addition to the Collaboration Agreement with Janssen, we have also granted licenses to a number of other organizations in the ordinary course of our business to utilize aspects of our technologies to develop and commercialize products outside of the imetelstat program. These include: 

&#149; licenses to several biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to use or commercialize telomerase immortalized cells in drug discovery research; &#149; licenses to several companies to sell antibodies specific to telomerase for research purposes; &#149; licenses to several companies to develop and commercialize reagent kits, or to provide services, for the measurement of telomere length or telomerase activity for research purposes; &#149; a license to a company to develop and commercialize a particular telomerase-based technology for cancer detection; and &#149; a license to a company for the development of cancer immunotherapies for veterinary applications. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized revenues from license fees and royalties under various license agreements of $1.4 million, $1.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively. See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#151;Revenues" for additional detail regarding these revenues. 

Competition 

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive. Other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and research organizations currently engage in or have in the past engaged in efforts related to the biological mechanisms related to imetelstat, including the study of telomeres, telomerase, our proprietary oligonucleotide chemistry, and the research and development of therapies for the treatment of hematologic myeloid malignancies. In addition, other products and therapies that could directly compete with imetelstat currently exist or are being developed by pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies and by academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. 

Many companies are developing alternative therapies to treat hematologic myeloid malignancies. For example, if approved for commercial sale for the treatment of MF, imetelstat would compete against Incyte Corporation's ruxolitinib, or Jakafi&#174;, which is orally administered. In clinical trials, Jakafi&#174; reduced spleen size, abdominal discomfort, early satiety, bone pain, night sweats and itching in MF patients. Recently, there have also been reports of overall survival benefit as well as improvement in bone marrow fibrosis from Jakafi&#174; treatment. Other treatment modalities for MF include hydroxyurea for the management of splenomegaly, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis and constitutional symptoms; splenectomy and splenic irradiation for the management of splenomegaly and co-existing cytopenias, or low blood cell counts; chemotherapy and pegylated interferon. Drugs for the treatment of MF-associated anemia include erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, androgens, danazol, corticosteroids, thalidomide and lenalidomide. There are other investigational treatments for MF further along in development than imetelstat, such as pacritinib by CTI Biopharma Corporation, or CTI Biopharma, in collaboration with Baxalta Incorporated, or Baxalta, and momelotinib by Gilead Sciences, Inc., or Gilead, which is currently in a Phase 3 clinical trial, and other inhibitors of the JAK-STAT pathway, as well as several investigational treatments in early phase testing such as histone deacetylase inhibitors, inhibitors of heat shock protein 90, hypomethylating agents, PI3 Kinase and mTOR inhibitors, anti-fibrosis antibodies, hedgehog inhibitors, anti-LOX2 inhibitors, recombinant pentraxin 2 protein, KIP-1 activators, TGF-beta inhibitors, FLT inhibitors, and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 

If approved for commercial sale for the treatment of MDS, imetelstat would compete against a number of treatment options, including erythropoiesis stimulating agents and other hematopoietic growth factors; immunomodulators such as lenalidomide by Celgene Corporation, or Celgene; hypomethylating agents, such as azacitidine by Celgene and decitabine by Janssen; in addition to investigational treatments that may be further along in development than imetelstat, such as oral versions of azacitidine; histone deacetylase inhibitors; activin type IIA receptor inhibitors, such as sotatercept by Acceleron Pharma, Inc., or Acceleron; TGF-beta superfamily inhibitors, such as luspatercept by Acceleron in collaboration with Celgene; thrombopoietin receptor agonists, such as eltrombopag by Novartis, PI3 Kinase inhibitors, such as rigosertib by Onconova Therapeutics, Inc., or Onconova; Flt-3 inhibitors, such as quizartinib by Ambit Biosciences Corporation, or Ambit Biosciences; and JAK-STAT pathway inhibitors. 

Independently, Janssen is developing therapies for hematologic malignancies, including AML, MDS, multiple myeloma and ABC-subtype diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Molecular and cellular pathways of interest include: 

&#149; cell surface targets for immune-directed therapy; &#149; immune checkpoint inhibition; &#149; leukemia stem cells; &#149; pathway addiction (genetic alterations, cell-type specific pathways); &#149; conditional sensitivity (stress, protein-producing tumors); &#149; targeting of T-cells and natural killer "NK" cells to tumors; &#149; identification of novel tumor-specific antigens; and &#149; progression from early MDS to AML and cancer interception. Success by Janssen in any of these approaches may compete with imetelstat or render imetelstat obsolete or noncompetitive, which could lead to a decision by Janssen to discontinue the imetelstat program and terminate the Collaboration Agreement, which would materially and adversely affect our business and business prospects and might cause us to cease operations. 

Smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. We anticipate increased competition in the future as new companies explore treatments for hematologic myeloid malignancies, which may significantly impact the commercial viability of imetelstat. Academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, clinical development and marketing of products similar to imetelstat. These companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified development and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to the imetelstat program. 

In addition to the above factors, imetelstat will face competition based on: 

&#149; product efficacy and safety; &#149; convenience of product administration; &#149; cost of manufacturing; &#149; the timing and scope of regulatory consents; &#149; status of reimbursement coverage; &#149; price; and 20 

&#149; patent position, including potentially dominant patent positions of others. As a result of the foregoing, competitors may develop more commercially desirable or affordable products than imetelstat, or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than us or Janssen. Competitors have developed, or are in the process of developing, technologies that are, or in the future may be, competitive to imetelstat. Some of these products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing therapeutic effects similar or superior to those that may be demonstrated by imetelstat. Competitors may develop products that are safer, more effective, or less costly than imetelstat, or more convenient to administer to patients and, therefore, present a serious competitive threat to imetelstat. In addition, competitors may price their products below what Janssen may determine to be an acceptable price for imetelstat, may receive better third-party payor coverage and/or reimbursement, or may be more cost-effective than imetelstat. Such competitive products or activities by competitors may render imetelstat obsolete, which may cause Janssen to terminate the Collaboration Agreement, which would severely and adversely affect our business prospects and might cause us to cease operations. 

Government Regulation 

Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture and marketing of imetelstat, which is being developed in collaboration with Janssen. We anticipate that imetelstat will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, potential human therapeutic products, such as imetelstat, are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other approval procedures of the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in European and other countries. Various governmental statutes and regulations also govern or influence testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, import, export, distribution and recordkeeping related to such products and their marketing. In collaboration with Janssen, the process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and money, and there can be no guarantee that approvals will be granted. The information provided in this section should be reviewed in the context of the section entitled "Risks Related to Clinical and Commercialization Activities" under Item 1A, "Risk Factors". 

United States Food and Drug Administration Regulatory Approval Process 

Prior to commencement of clinical trials involving humans, preclinical testing of new pharmaceutical products is generally conducted on animals in the laboratory to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of a product candidate. The results of these trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application, which must become effective before clinical testing in humans can begin. The FDA can place an IND on clinical hold at any time, which prevents the conduct of clinical trials under the IND until safety concerns are addressed by the IND sponsor to the FDA's satisfaction. Typically, clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly three phase trial process. In Phase 1, clinical trials are conducted with a small number of healthy volunteers or patients afflicted with a specific disease to assess safety and to evaluate the pattern of drug distribution and metabolism within the body. In Phase 2, clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. The Phase 2 trials can be conducted comparing the investigational treatment to a comparator arm, or not. If used, a comparator usually includes standard of care therapy. Safety and efficacy data from Phase 2 clinical trials, even if favorable, may not provide sufficient rationale for proceeding to a Phase 3 clinical trial. In Phase 3, large scale, multi-center, comparative trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease to provide sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the FDA. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical testing and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the trials. Human clinical trials must be conducted 

in compliance with Good Clinical Practice regulations and applicable laws, with the oversight of Institutional Review Boards for the protection of human subjects. The manufacture of drug product candidates is subject to requirements that drugs be manufactured, packaged and labeled in conformity with current Good Manufacturing Practices and applicable laws. 

The results of the preclinical and clinical testing of drugs and complete manufacturing information are submitted to the FDA in the form of a New Drug Application, or NDA, for review and for approval prior to commencement of commercial sales. Submission of an NDA requires the payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA, which may be waived in certain cases. In responding to an NDA submission, the FDA may approve the drug for commercialization, impose limitations on its indications for use and labeling, including in the form of Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies or may issue a complete response letter. Even if an NDA is approved, its sponsor is subject to ongoing and pervasive regulatory compliance requirements. 

European and Other Regulatory Approval Process 

Prior to initiating clinical trials in a region outside of the United States, a clinical trial application must be submitted and reviewed by the appropriate regulatory authority regulating the country in which the trial will be conducted. Whether or not FDA clearance or approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities in Europe and other countries is necessary prior to commencement of marketing the product in such countries. The regulatory authorities in each country may impose their own requirements and may refuse to grant an approval, or may require additional data before granting it, even though the relevant product has been cleared or approved by the FDA or another authority. As with the FDA, the regulatory authorities in the European Union, or EU, and other developed countries have lengthy approval processes for pharmaceutical products. The process for gaining approval in particular countries varies, but generally follows a similar sequence to that described for FDA approval. In Europe, the European Medicine Agency, or EMA, and the European Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products, or CPMP, provide a mechanism for EU member states to exchange information on all aspects of product licensing. The EU has established the EMA for the evaluation of medical products, with both a centralized procedure with which the marketing authorization is recognized in all EU member states and a decentralized procedure, the latter being based on the principle of licensing within one member country followed by mutual recognition by the other member countries. 

Orphan Drug Designation 

For a drug to qualify for orphan drug designation by the FDA, both the drug and the disease or condition must meet certain criteria specified in the Orphan Drug Act, or ODA, and FDA's implementing regulations. Orphan drug designation is granted by the FDA's Office of Orphan Drug Products in order to support development of medicines for underserved or rare diseases and patient populations that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States or, if the disease or condition affects more than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States, if there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug would be recovered from sales in the United States. Orphan drug designation qualifies the sponsor of the drug for various development incentives of the ODA, including, if regulatory approval is received, the potential for seven years of market exclusivity with certain limited exceptions and certain tax credits for qualified clinical testing. A marketing application for a prescription drug product that has received orphan drug designation is not subject to a prescription drug user fee unless the application includes an indication for a disease or condition other than the rare disease or condition for which the drug was granted orphan drug designation. The granting of orphan drug designation does not alter the standard regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval. The safety and effectiveness of a drug must be established through adequate and well-controlled studies. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent 

the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. 

On June 11, 2015 and December 23, 2015, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to imetelstat for the treatment of MF and MDS, respectively. 

Orphan drug designation by the European Commission provides regulatory and financial incentives for companies to develop and market therapies that treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU, and where no satisfactory treatment is available. In the EU, orphan drug designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers, as well as protocol assistance from the EMA during the product development phase, and direct access to the centralized authorization procedure. In addition, ten years of market exclusivity is granted following drug product approval, meaning that another application for marketing authorization of a later similar medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication will generally not be approved in the EU. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable to not justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 

On November 15, 2015, the EMA granted orphan drug designation to imetelstat for the treatment of MF. 

Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security, and Transparency Laws and Regulations 

We may also be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, and physician payment sunshine laws. 

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term "remuneration" has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Several courts have interpreted the statute's intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. 

Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed. Entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to "cause" the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, promoting a product off-label, or for providing medically unnecessary services or items. 

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 

HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, require certain types of individuals and entities to protect the privacy, security, and electronic exchange of certain patient data. 

The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their immediate family members. 

Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers. Additionally, we may be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government. Further, we may be subject to state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, as well as state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, administrative or civil penalties, imprisonment, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 

Reimbursement and Health Reform 

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate that receives regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of imetelstat, if approved for commercial sale, will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for imetelstat. 

In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Further, third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Such payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Janssen may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of imetelstat, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Nonetheless, imetelstat may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. 

Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the drug product. A payor's decision 

to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor's determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable Janssen to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on Janssen's and our investment in imetelstat. 

The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted legislative and regulatory proposals to contain healthcare costs, as well as to improve quality and expand access. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively known as the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, was signed into law. Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to the biopharmaceutical industry are: 

&#149; an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; &#149; an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively; &#149; a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; &#149; extension of a manufacturer's Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; &#149; expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level; &#149; a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturer's outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and &#149; a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. We expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that may be charged for imetelstat. We cannot predict the entire impact of the ACA. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects thereof, and we expect that there will be additional challenges and amendments in the future. 

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and imaging centers. 

Manufacturing 

A typical sequence of steps in the manufacture of imetelstat drug product includes the following key components: 

&#149; starting materials, which are well-defined raw materials that are used to make bulk drug substance; &#149; bulk drug substance, which is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in a drug product that provides pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the treatment of disease; and &#149; final drug product, which is the finished dosage form that contains the drug substance that is shipped to the clinic for patient treatment. In accordance with the Collaboration Agreement, Janssen is now responsible for the manufacture and management of the supply of imetelstat on a global basis for clinical trials and, after any regulatory approval, all commercial activities. Consequently, we are, and expect to remain, dependent on Janssen to appropriately supply imetelstat and other clinical trial materials. Currently, third-party contractors perform certain process development and other technical and scientific work with respect to imetelstat, as well as supply starting materials and manufacturing drug substance and drug product. Janssen does not have direct control over third-party personnel or operations. These third-party contractors, and/or any other contractors that Janssen may rely upon for the manufacture and/or supply of imetelstat, typically complete their services on a proposal by proposal basis under master supply agreements and may need to make substantial investments to enable sufficient capacity increases and cost reductions, and to implement those regulatory and compliance standards necessary for successful Phase 3 clinical trials and commercial production. These third-party contractors, and/or any other contractors that Janssen may rely upon for the manufacture and/or supply of imetelstat, may not be able to achieve such capacity increases, cost reductions, or regulatory and compliance standards, and even if they do, such achievements may not be at a commercially reasonable cost. Neither we nor Janssen have any long-term commitments or commercial supply agreements with any of the third-party contractors for imetelstat. The information provided in this section should be reviewed in the context of the section entitled "Risks Related to Our Business" under Item 1A, "Risk Factors". 

Concentration of Revenues 

In 2015, we recognized revenue from the $35 million upfront payment we received from Janssen in December 2014 upon delivery of the imetelstat license rights and completion of our performance of the technology transfer-related activities to Janssen as outlined under the Collaboration Agreement. The upfront payment from Janssen represented 96% of our 2015 revenues. In 2014 and 2013, the majority of our revenues were from license fees and royalties under licenses granted to several biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to use telomerase immortalized cells in drug discovery research and for drug discovery applications. Two customers accounted for approximately 31% and 42% of our 2014 and 2013 revenues, respectively. We operate in one operating segment and have operations solely in the United States. All of our long-lived assets are maintained in the United States. Information regarding total revenues, net loss and total assets is set forth in our financial statements included in Item 8 of this annual report on Form 10-K. 

Consultants 

We have consulting agreements with a number of leading academic scientists, clinicians and regulatory experts. These individuals serve as key consultants or expert witnesses with respect to the imetelstat program or in legal proceedings. They also serve as important contacts for us throughout the broader scientific and clinical communities. They are distinguished individuals with expertise in 

numerous fields, including telomere and telomerase biology, cellular biology, molecular biology, oncology and drug regulations. 

We retain each consultant according to the terms of a consulting agreement. Under such agreements, we pay them a consulting fee and reimburse them for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in performing their services for us. In addition, some consultants hold options to purchase our common stock, subject to the vesting requirements contained in the consulting agreements. Our consultants may be employed by other entities and therefore may have commitments to their employer, or may have other consulting or advisory agreements that may limit their availability to us.
