 Item 1. Business 

Overview 

We are organized into two primary businesses: a performance-based technical products business and a premium fine paper and packaging business (formerly known as the fine paper business). On January 1, 2015, we changed the name of our fine paper business to fine paper and packaging. The name change better reflects the increasing importance, and plans for continued growth, of our premium packaging products. 

Our technical products business is a leading international producer of performance-based substrates such as filtration media for transportation, water and other filtration markets, and saturated and coated performance materials used for industrial backings, labels and a variety of other end markets. The business is focused on categories where we believe we are a market leader or have a competitive advantage, including, among others, transportation, water and other filter media, specialty tape, label, abrasive, image transfer and customer-specific applications used in durable print and other applications. Our customers are located in more than 70 countries. Our technical products manufacturing facilities are located in Munising, Michigan, Pittsfield, Massachusetts, Bolton, England and near Munich, Germany. In addition, certain products manufactured in shared facilities acquired in the FiberMark Acquisition (as defined below) support our technical products business. For a description of the shared facilities acquired in the FiberMark Acquisition, see Part I, Item 2 "Properties." 

We believe our fine paper and packaging business is the leading supplier of premium printing and other high end specialty papers in North America. We are also focused on increasing our presence in international markets. Our premium writing, text, cover and specialty papers are used in commercial offset and digital printing and imaging applications for corporate identity packages, invitations, personal stationery, premium labels and luxury packaging. Our bright papers are used in applications such as direct mail, advertising inserts, scrapbooks and marketing collateral. Our products include some of the most recognized and preferred fine paper brands and we enjoy leading market positions in many of our product categories. We sell our products primarily to authorized paper distributors, as well as through converters, specialty businesses and major retail customers. Our fine paper and packaging manufacturing facilities are located in Appleton, Neenah and Whiting, Wisconsin; and Canton, Ohio. In addition, certain products manufactured in shared facilities acquired in the FiberMark Acquisition support our fine paper and packaging business. For a description of the shared facilities acquired in the FiberMark Acquisition, see Part I, Item 2 "Properties."

History of the Businesses 

Neenah was incorporated in April 2004 in contemplation of the spin-off by Kimberly-Clark Corporation ("Kimberly-Clark") of its technical products and fine paper businesses in the United States and its Canadian pulp business (collectively, the "Pulp and Paper Business"). We had no material assets or activities until Kimberly-Clark's transfer to us of the Pulp and Paper business on November 30, 2004. On that date, Kimberly-Clark completed the distribution of all of the shares of our common stock to the stockholders of Kimberly-Clark (the "Spin-Off"). Following the Spin-Off, we are an independent public company and Kimberly-Clark has no ownership interest in us. 

Technical Products. In 1952, we purchased what is now our Munising, Michigan mill. Subsequent to the purchase, we converted the mill to produce durable, saturated and coated papers for sale and use in a variety of industrial applications for our technical products business. In October 2006, we purchased the outstanding interests of FiberMark Services GmbH &#38; Co. KG and the outstanding interests of FiberMark Beteiligungs GmbH (collectively "Neenah Germany"). At acquisition, the Neenah Germany assets consisted of two mills located near Munich, Germany and a third mill near Frankfurt, Germany, that produce a wide range of products, including transportation, beverage and other filter media, nonwoven wall coverings, masking and other tapes, abrasive backings, and specialized printing and coating substrates. 

In July 2014, we purchased all of the outstanding equity of Crane Technical Materials, Inc. from Crane &#38; Co., Inc. for approximately $72 million. The acquired technical materials business provides performance-oriented wet laid nonwoven media for water filtration end markets as well as environmental, energy and industrial uses. The technical materials business has two manufacturing facilities in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. 

On October 31, 2015, we sold our paper mill located near Frankfurt, Germany (the "Lahnstein Mill") to the Kajo Neukirchen Group (the "Buyer") for net cash proceeds of approximately $5.4 million. The Lahnstein Mill, which had annual sales of approximately &#8364;50 million, had been operating as a stand-alone business, manufacturing non-woven wallcoverings and various other specialty papers. See Note 12, "Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale." 

Fine Paper and Packaging. The fine paper and packaging business was incorporated in 1885 as Neenah Paper Company, which initially operated a single paper mill in Neenah, Wisconsin. We acquired the mill in 1956. In 1981, we purchased an additional mill located in Whiting, Wisconsin to increase the production capacity of the fine paper and packaging business. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, we expanded the capacity of the fine paper and packaging business by building two new paper machines at the Whiting mill, rebuilding two existing paper machines at the Whiting mill and completing a major expansion of the Neenah facility with the installation of a new paper machine, a new finishing center, a new customer service center and a distribution center expansion. 

In March 2007, we acquired Fox Valley Corporation (now named Neenah Paper FVC, Inc.), which owned Fox River Paper Company, LLC ("Fox River," now named Neenah Paper FR, LLC). The Fox River assets consisted of four U.S. paper mills and various related assets, producing premium fine papers with well-known brands including STARWHITE&#174;, SUNDANCE&#174;, ESSE&#174; and OXFORD&#174;. In integrating the operations of Fox River with those of our existing fine paper and packaging mills, we closed three of the Fox River paper mills. We closed the Housatonic mill, located near Great Barrington, Massachusetts in May 2007, the fine paper mill located in Urbana, Ohio during the second quarter of 2008 and the fine paper mill located in Ripon, California in May 2009. 

In January 2012, we purchased certain premium fine paper brands and other assets from Wausau Paper Mills, LLC, a subsidiary of Wausau Paper Corp. ("Wausau"). In January 2013, we purchased certain premium business paper brands from the Southworth Company ("Southworth"). 

FiberMark Acquisition. On August 1, 2015, we purchased all of the outstanding equity of ASP FiberMark, LLC ("FiberMark") from ASP FiberMark Holdings, LLC ("American Securities") for approximately $118 million (the "FiberMark Acquisition"). The purchase price was financed through $80 million of cash on hand and the balance from available borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility. FiberMark is a specialty coatings and finishing company with a strong presence in luxury packaging and technical products. In September 2015, we announced the planned closure of the acquired Fitchburg, Massachusetts mill (the "Fitchburg Mill") to consolidate our manufacturing footprint. Manufacturing operations at the Fitchburg Mill ceased in December 2015. See Note 3, "Acquisitions" and Note 12, "Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale." 

Former Pulp Operations. At the Spin-Off, our pulp operations consisted of mills located in Terrace Bay, Ontario and Pictou, Nova Scotia and approximately 975,000 acres of related woodlands. We disposed of these mills and woodlands in a series of transactions from 2006 to 2010. In March 2010, we sold approximately 475,000 acres of woodland assets in Nova Scotia, substantially completing our exit from pulp operations. 

Business Strategy 

Our mission is to create value by improving the image and performance of everything we touch. We expect to create value by growing in specialized niche markets that value performance or image and where we have competitive advantages. In managing our businesses, we believe that achieving and maintaining a leadership position in our markets, responding effectively to customer needs and competitive challenges, employing capital optimally, controlling costs and managing risks are important to our long-term success. Strategies to deliver value include: 

Leading in profitable, specialty niche markets &#151; We will increase our participation in niche markets that can provide us with leading positions and value our core competencies in performance-based fiber and non-woven media production, coating and saturating. Key markets include filtration, specialty backings and technical products, and premium fine paper and packaging. 

Increasing our size, growth rate and portfolio diversification &#151; We will invest and focus resources in higher growth specialty markets to grow with customers in new geographies and to enter into adjacent markets that are growing and profitable. We will do this both through organic initiatives that build on our technologies and capabilities, and through acquisitions that fit with our competencies and provide attractive financial returns. 

Delivering consistent, attractive returns to our shareholders with disciplined financial management &#151; We will continue to use Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") as a key metric to evaluate investment decisions, measure our performance, maintain a prudent capital structure and deploy cash flows in ways that can provide value, including direct cash returns to shareholders through a meaningful dividend. 

Products 

Technical Products. Our technical products business is a leading international producer of performance-based substrates such as filtration media for transportation, water and other filtration markets, and saturated and coated performance materials used for industrial backings, labels and a variety of other end markets. In general, our technical products are sold to other manufacturers as key components for their finished products. Several of our key market segments served, including filtration and specialty backings for tape and abrasives, are global in scope. JET-PRO&#174;SofStretch&#153;, KIMDURA&#174;, MUNISING LP&#174;, PREVAIL&#153;, NEENAH&#174;, and GESSNER&#174; are brands of our technical products business.

Specialty backings including a) saturated and unsaturated crepe and flat paper tapes sold to manufacturers to produce finished pressure sensitive products for sale in automotive, transportation, manufacturing, building construction, and industrial general purpose applications, including sales in the consumer-do-it-yourself retail channel and b) coated lightweight abrasive paper used in the automotive, construction, metal and woodworking industries for both waterproof and dry sanding applications. 

Label and tag products made from both saturated base label stock and purchased synthetic base label stock, with coatings applied to allow for high quality variable and digital printing. The synthetic label stock is recognized as a high quality, UV (ultra-violet) stable product used for outdoor applications. Label and tag stock is sold to pressure sensitive coaters, who in turn sell the coated label and tag stock to the label printing community. 

Other latex saturated and coated papers for use by a wide variety of manufacturers. Premask paper is used as a protective over wrap for products during the manufacturing process and for applying signs, labeling and other finished products. Medical packaging paper is a polymer impregnated base sheet that provides a breathable sterilization barrier that provides unique properties. Image transfer papers used to transfer an image from paper to tee shirts, hats, coffee mugs, and other surfaces using a proprietary imaging coating for use in digital printing applications. Publishing and security papers used to produce book covers, stationery, fancy packaging and passports. Other specialty products include clean room papers, durable printing papers, release papers and furniture backers. 

Fine Paper and Packaging. Our fine paper and packaging business manufactures and sells world-class branded premium writing, text, cover and specialty papers and envelopes used in corporate identity packages, advertising collateral, premium labels and packaging, and wide format applications. Often these papers are characterized by distinctive coating, finishing, colors, and textures. Our fine paper and packaging business had net sales of $443 million, $436 million and $428 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

Commercial printing papers include premium writing, text and cover papers, and envelopes. Uses include advertising collateral, stationery, corporate identity packages and brochures, pocket folders, annual reports, advertising inserts, direct mail, business cards, scrapbooks, and a variety of other uses where colors, texture, coating, unique finishes or heavier weight papers are desired. Our market leading brands in this category include CLASSIC&#174;, CLASSIC CREST&#174;, ESSE&#174;, ENVIRONMENT&#174;, CAPITOL BOND&#174;, ROYAL SUNDANCE&#174;, SOUTHWORTH&#174;, and TOUCHE&#174; trademarks. Our fine paper and packaging business has an exclusive agreement to manufacture, market and distribute Crane &#38; Co.'s CRANE'S CREST&#174;, CRANE'S BOND&#174;, and CRANE'S LETTRA&#174;, branded fine papers in the commercial print category. Our fine paper and packaging business has an exclusive agreement to market and distribute Gruppo Cordenons SpA's SO...SILK&#174;, PLIKE&#174; and STARDREAM&#174; branded fine papers in the U.S. and Canada. The fine paper and packaging business also sells private watermarked paper and other specialty writing, text, and cover papers. Additionally, the fine paper and packaging business provides leading solutions in the wide format arena, led by its Neenah Wide Format&#174; and CONVERD&#174; brands. 

Premium packaging and label papers are used for wine, spirits and beer labels, folding cartons, box wrap, bags, hang tags, and stored value cards servicing high-end retail, cosmetics, spirits, and electronics end-use markets. Our market leading brands in these categories include NEENAH&#174; Folding Board, "ESTATE LABEL&#174;, Neenah&#174; Box Wrap, PELLAQ&#174;, KIVAR&#174;, SKIVERTEX&#174;, ILLUSIO&#174;, and SENZO&#174;. 

Bright papers are used in applications such as direct mail, advertising inserts, scrapbooks and marketing collateral. Our brands in this category include ASTROBRIGHTS&#174; and CREATIVE COLLECTION&#153;. Additionally, business papers for professionals and small businesses are sold under our Southworth&#174; brand through major retailers. 

The fine paper and packaging business also produces and sells other specialty papers that address a consumer's need for enhanced image such as translucent papers, art papers, papers for optical scanning and other specialized applications. 

Markets and Customers 

Technical Products. The technical products business sells its products globally into product categories generally used as base materials in the following applications: filtration, component backing materials for manufactured products such as tape and abrasives, and other specialized product uses such as graphics and identification. 

Several products (filtration media, abrasives, specialty tapes, labels) are used in markets that are directly affected by economic business cycles. Other market segments such as image transfer papers used in small/home office and consumer applications are relatively stable. Most products are performance-based and require qualification at customers; however, certain categories may also be subject to price competition and the substitution of lower cost substrates in some less demanding applications. 

The technical products business relies on a team of direct sales representatives and customer service representatives to market and sell approximately 95 percent of its sales volume directly to customers and converters. 

The technical products business has more than 500 customers worldwide. The distribution of sales in 2015 was approximately 55 percent in Europe, 30 percent in North America and 15 percent in Latin America and Asia. Customers typically convert and transform base papers and film into finished rolls and sheets by adding adhesives, coatings, and finishes. These transformed products are then sold to end-users. 

Sales to the technical products business's three largest customers represented approximately 20 percent of total sales for the segment in 2015. Although a complete loss of any of these customers would cause a temporary decline in the business's sales volume, the decline could be partially offset by expanding sales to existing customers, and further offset over a several month period with the addition of new customers. 

Fine Paper and Packaging. We believe our fine paper and packaging business is the leading supplier of premium writing, text and cover papers, bright papers and specialty papers in North America. These products are used in high end collateral material, business and legal professions, and corporate identity products. Our premium packaging business includes products such as food and beverage labels and high-end packaging materials such as folding cartons and box wrap used for luxury retail goods. Bright papers are generally used by consumers for flyers, direct mail and packaging. 

The fine paper and packaging business sells its products in a variety of channels including authorized paper distributors, converters, retailers, and direct to end users. Sales to distributors, including distributor owned paper stores, account for approximately 60 percent of revenue in the fine paper and packaging business. During 2015, approximately eight percent of the sales of our fine paper and packaging business were exported to markets outside the United States. 

Sales to the largest customer of the fine paper and packaging business represented approximately 20 percent of its total sales in 2015. We practice limited sales distribution to improve our ability to control the marketing of our products. Although a complete loss of this customer would cause a temporary decline in the business's sales volume, the decline could be partially offset by expanding sales to existing customers, and further offset over a several month period with the addition of new customers. 

Concentration. In July 2014, Unisource Worldwide, Inc ("Unisource") and xpedx, formerly owned by International Paper ("xpedx") merged to form Veritiv Corporation ("Veritiv"). For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 sales to Unisource and xpedx (and as merged Veritiv) represented approximately 10 percent of our consolidated net sales and approximately 20 percent of net sales of the fine paper and packaging business. 

The following tables present further information about our businesses by geographic area (dollars in millions): 

&#160; &#160; Year Ended December 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; 2014 &#160; 2013 &#160; Net sales &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; United States &#160; $ 687.3 &#160; $ 612.0 &#160; $ 564.4 &#160; Europe &#160; &#160; 200.4 &#160; &#160; 227.7 &#160; &#160; 217.3 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Consolidated &#160; $ 887.7 &#160; $ 839.7 &#160; $ 781.7 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203;

Net sales and total assets are attributed to geographic areas based on the physical location of the selling entities and the physical location of the assets. See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements "Business Segment and Geographic Information" for information with respect to net sales, profits and total assets by business segment. 

Raw Materials 

Technical Products. Softwood pulp, specialty pulp and fibers, and latex are the primary raw materials consumed by our technical products business. The technical products business purchases softwood pulp, specialty pulp and fibers, and latex from various suppliers. The technical products business purchases substantially all of its raw material requirements externally. We believe that all of the raw materials for our technical products operations, except for certain specialty latex grades and specialty softwood pulp, are readily available from several sources and that the loss of a single supplier would not cause a shutdown of our manufacturing operations. 

Our technical products business acquires all of its specialized pulp requirements from two global suppliers and certain critical specialty latex grades from four suppliers. In general, these supply arrangements are not covered by formal contracts, but represent multi-year business relationships that have historically been sufficient to meet our needs. We expect these relationships to continue to operate in a satisfactory manner in the future. In the event of an interruption of production at any one supplier, we believe that each of these suppliers individually would be able to satisfy our short-term requirements for specialized pulp or specialty latex. In the event of a long-term disruption in our supply of specialized pulp or specialty latex, we believe we would be able to substitute other pulp grades or other latex grades that would allow us to meet required product performance characteristics and incur only a limited disruption in our production. As a result, we do not believe that the substitution of such alternative pulp or latex grades would have a material effect on our operations. 

Fine Paper and Packaging. Hardwood pulp is the primary fiber used to produce products of the fine paper and packaging business. Other significant raw material inputs in the production of fine paper and packaging products include softwood pulp, recycled fiber, cotton fiber, dyes and fillers. The fine paper and packaging business purchases all of its raw materials externally. We believe that all of the raw materials for our fine paper and packaging operations, except for certain cotton fiber which represent less than five percent of the total fiber requirements of our fine paper and packaging business, are readily available from several sources and that the loss of a single supplier would not cause a shutdown of our manufacturing operations. 

We believe that a partial or total disruption in the production of cotton fibers at our two primary suppliers would increase our reliance on "spot market" purchases with a likely corresponding increase in cost. Since we have the ability to source cotton fiber on the "spot market" if faced with a supply disruption, we would not expect cotton fiber supply issues to have a material effect on our operations. 

Energy and Water 

The equipment used to manufacture the products of our technical products and fine paper and packaging businesses use significant amounts of energy, primarily electricity, natural gas, oil and coal. We generate substantially all of our electrical energy at the Munising mill and approximately 25 of the electrical energy at our mills in Appleton, Wisconsin and Bruckm&#252;hl, Germany. We also purchase electrical energy from external sources, including electricity generated from renewable sources. 

Availability of energy is not expected to be a problem in the foreseeable future, but the purchase price of such energy can and likely will fluctuate significantly based on changes in demand and other factors. 

An adequate supply of water is needed to manufacture our products. We believe that there is an adequate supply of water for this purpose at each of our manufacturing locations. 

Working Capital 

Technical Products. The technical products business maintains approximately 25 to 30 days of raw materials and supplies inventories to support its manufacturing operations and approximately 25 to 35 days of finished goods and semi-finished goods inventory to support customer orders for its products. Sales terms in the technical products business vary depending on the type of product sold and customer category. Extended credit terms of up to 120 days are offered to customers located in certain international markets. In general, sales are collected in approximately 45 to 55 days and supplier invoices are paid within 20 to 30 days. 

Fine Paper and Packaging. The fine paper and packaging business maintains approximately 10 days of raw material inventories to support its paper making operations and about 55 days of finished goods inventory to fill customer orders. Fine paper and packaging sales terms range between 20 and 30 days with discounts of zero to two percent for customer payments, with discounts of one percent and 20-day terms used most often. Extended credit terms are offered to customers located in certain international markets. Supplier invoices are typically paid within 30 days. 

Competition 

Technical Products. Our technical products business competes in global markets with a number of large multinational competitors, including Ahlstrom Corporation, Munksj&#246;, ArjoWiggins SAS and Hollingsworth &#38; Vose Company. It also competes in some, but not all, of these segments with smaller regional manufacturers, such as Monadnock Paper Mills, Inc., Expera Specialty Solutions LLC., Potsdam Specialty Paper, Inc. and Paper Line S.p.A. We believe the bases of competition in most of these segments are the ability to design and develop customized product features to meet customer specifications while maintaining quality, customer service and price. We believe our research and development program gives us an advantage in customizing base papers to meet customer needs. 

Fine Paper and Packaging. We believe our fine paper and packaging business is the leading supplier of premium printing and other high end specialty papers in North America. Our fine paper and packaging business also competes globally in the premium segment of the uncoated free sheet market. The fine paper and packaging business competes directly in North America with Mohawk Fine Paper Inc. and other smaller companies. We believe the primary bases of competition for premium fine papers are brand recognition, product quality, customer service, product availability, promotional support and variety of colors and textures. Price also can be a factor particularly for lower quality printing needs that may compete with opaque and offset papers. We have and will continue to invest in advertising and other programs aimed at graphic designers, printers and corporate end-users in order to maintain a high level of brand awareness as well as communicate the advantages of using our products. 

Research and Development 

Our technical products business maintains research and development laboratories in Feldkirchen-Westerham, Germany, Munising, Michigan and Pittsfield, Massachusetts to support its strategy of developing new products and technologies, and to support growth in its existing product lines and other strategically important markets. In 2014, we consolidated our Roswell, Georgia and Munising, Michigan research and development laboratories at our manufacturing facility in Munising, Michigan to bring our research and development laboratories in closer proximity to our manufacturing operation. We have continually invested in product research and development with spending of $6.8 million in 2015, $5.7 million in 2014 and $5.5 million in 2013. 

Intellectual Property 

The KIMDURA&#174; and MUNISING LP&#174; trademarks have made a significant contribution to the marketing of synthetic film and clean room papers of the technical products business. The GESSNER&#174; and varitess&#174; trademarks have played an important role in the marketing of Neenah Germany product lines. 

We own more than 40 patents and have multiple pending patent applications in the United States, Canada, Western Europe and certain other countries covering image transfer paper, abrasives and medical packaging. We believe our image transfer patents have contributed to establishing the technical products business as a leading supplier of image transfer papers. 

We own more than 50 trademarks with registrations in approximately 50 countries. Our fine paper and packaging business has built its market leading reputation on trademarked brands that date back as far as 1908.

Backlog and Seasonality 

Technical Products. In general, sales and profits for the technical products business have been relatively stronger in the first half of the year with reductions in the third quarter due to reduced customer converting schedules and in the fourth quarter due to a reduction in year-end inventory levels by our customers. The order flow for the technical products business is subject to seasonal peaks for several of its products, such as the larger volume grades of specialty tape, abrasives, premask, and label stock used primarily in the downstream finished goods manufacturing process. To assure timely shipments during these seasonal peaks, the technical products business provides certain customers with finished goods inventory on consignment. Historically, consignment sales have represented approximately 15 percent of the technical products business's annual sales. Orders are typically shipped within six to eight weeks of receipt of the order. However, the technical products business periodically experiences periods where order entry levels surge, and order backlogs can increase substantially. Raw materials are purchased and manufacturing schedules are planned based on customer forecasts, current market conditions and individual orders for custom products. The order backlog in the technical products business on December 31, 2015 was approximately $103 million and represented approximately 25 percent of prior year sales. The order backlog in the technical products business on December 31, 2014 was approximately $110 million and represented approximately 25 percent of prior year sales. We previously filled the order backlog from December 31, 2014 and expect to fill the order backlog from December 31, 2015 within the respective following years. 

Fine Paper and Packaging. The fine paper and packaging business has historically experienced a steady flow of orders. Orders for stock products are typically shipped within two days, while custom orders are shipped within two to three weeks of receipt. Raw material purchases and manufacturing schedules are planned based on a combination of historical trends, customer forecasts and current market conditions. The order backlogs in the fine paper and packaging business on December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $19.2 million and $17.0 million, respectively, which represent approximately 15 days of sales. The order backlogs from December 31, 2015 and 2014 were filled in the respective following years. 

The operating results at each of our businesses are influenced by the timing of our annual maintenance downs, which are generally scheduled in the third quarter. 

Employee and Labor Relations 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately 2,340 regular full-time employees of whom 1,140 hourly and 540 salaried employees were located in the United States and 390 hourly and 270 salaried employees were located in Europe. 

Approximately 50 percent of salaried employees and 80 percent of hourly employees of Neenah Germany are eligible to be represented by the Mining, Chemicals and Energy Trade Union, Industriegewerkschaft Bergbau, Chemie and Energie (the "IG BCE"). In June 2015, the IG BCE and a national trade association representing all employers in the industry signed a collective bargaining agreement covering union employees of Neenah Germany that expires in June 2017. Under German law union membership is voluntary and does not need to be disclosed to the Company. As a result, the number of employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement with the IG BCE that expires in June 2017 cannot be determined. 

As of December 31, 2015, approximately 235 employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements that expire in the next 12-months. We believe we have satisfactory relations with our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements and do not expect the negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements to have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements "Contingencies and Legal Matters &#151; Employees and Labor Relations ." 

Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 

Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances relating to various environmental, health and safety matters. Our operations are in compliance with, or we are taking actions designed to ensure compliance with, these laws, regulations and ordinances. However, the nature of our operations exposes us to the risk of claims concerning non-compliance with environmental, health and safety laws or standards, and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with those claims. Except for certain orders issued by environmental, health and safety regulatory agencies with which we believe we are in compliance and which we believe are immaterial to our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, we are not currently named as a party in any judicial or administrative proceeding relating to environmental, health and safety matters. 

Greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions have increasingly become the subject of political and regulatory focus. Concern over potential climate change, including global warming, has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting GHG emissions. In addition to certain federal proposals in the United States to regulate GHG emissions, Germany, the United Kingdom and all the states in which we operate are currently considering GHG legislation or regulations, either individually and/or as part of regional initiatives. While not all are likely to become law it is reasonably possible that additional climate change related mandates will be forthcoming, and it is expected that they may adversely impact our costs by increasing energy costs and raw material prices, requiring operational or equipment modifications to reduce emissions and creating costs to comply with regulations or to mitigate the financial consequences of such compliance. 

While we have incurred in the past several years, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures in order to comply with environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and ordinances, we believe that our future cost of compliance with environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and ordinances, and our exposure to liability for environmental, health and safety claims will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, new legislation to limit GHG emissions or contamination of sites owned, operated or used for waste disposal by us (including currently unknown contamination and contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites or other waste generators) may give rise to additional costs which could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 

We have planned capital expenditures to comply with environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and ordinances during the period 2016 through 2018 of approximately $1 million to $2 million annually. Our anticipated capital expenditures for environmental projects are not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
