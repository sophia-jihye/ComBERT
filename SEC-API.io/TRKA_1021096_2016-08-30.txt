 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Background

M2 nGage Group, Inc. (formerly Roomlinx, Inc.) (the "Company", "Roomlinx" or "M2 Group") was formed in 1998 under the laws of the State of Nevada. On March 27, 2015, the Company entered into and completed (the "Closing") a Subsidiary Merger Agreement (the "SMA") by and among the Company, Signal Point Holdings Corp. ("SPHC"), SignalShare Infrastructure, Inc. ("SSI") and RMLX Merger Corp. Upon the terms and conditions of the SMA, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary RMLX Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation, was merged with and into SPHC, with SPHC and its operating subsidiaries surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the "Subsidiary Merger"). The existing business of Roomlinx was transferred into a newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary named SignalShare Infrastructure Inc. In connection with the Subsidiary Merger, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael S. Wasik, resigned from all positions with the parent Company and was named President and Chief Executive Officer of SSI. As a result of the Subsidiary Merger, the shareholders of SPHC, a privately-owned Delaware corporation, received an aggregate of approximately 85% of the Fully Diluted (as defined therein) common stock of the Company. The merger consideration was determined by the Company, after a thorough review of prospective acquisitions, the benefits of the proposed transaction, including access to capital, increased market opportunities and reach, perceived synergies, efficiencies and other financial considerations, as well as a strategic growth plan contemplated by management of the combined entity.

On May 11, 2016, SSI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company completed the Foreclosure Sale of substantially all assets of SSI (other than certain excluded agreements) pursuant to Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. SSI, which held the operations of the Company prior to the Subsidiary Merger, terminated all of its employees and ceased operations.

On October 1, 2010, the Company acquired 100% of the membership interests of Canadian Communications, LLC and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Cardinal Connect, LLC, a non-operating entity, Cardinal Broadband, LLC, and Cardinal Hospitality, Ltd, entity. The acquisition of Canadian Communications, LLC also included a 50% joint venture interest in Arista Communications, LLC. 

Cardinal Broadband, LLC was formed in 2005 as a Colorado Limited Liability Company. Pursuant to the acquisition of Canadian Communications, LLC on October 1, 2010, the Company became the 100% member of Cardinal Broadband, LLC. Subsequent to the acquisition, Cardinal Broadband became a division of the Company.

SPHC and Subsidiary Business

SPHC is a digital technology, media, communications holding company that, through its various subsidiaries, provides integrated solutions including high density Wi-Fi for sports stadiums, concert and festival venues and convention centers. These integrated solutions not only provide the full design and installation of the Wi-Fi networks, but also through the use of software, works with the venues on selling advertising and sponsorship opportunities on those networks. SPHC through its subsidiaries also provides broadband (wireless and wired) and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services to corporate customers primarily in the New York tri-state area.

SPHC was formed on October 3, 2012, pursuant to a reorganization when it acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock and became the parent company of Signal Point Corp., a New York corporation ("SP Corp.") and M2 nGage Communications, Inc. (formerly Signal Point Telecommunications Corp.), a New York corporation ("SPTC" or "M2 Communications")). On September 27, 2012, SP Corp. acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Wave2Wave Communications, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("W2W") in a Section 363 Asset Sale under the Bankruptcy Code. The portion of these assets that were associated with the W2W entity were transferred to SPTC by SP Corp., while those that were associated with other business lines remained with SP Corp. and subsequently the stock of SPTC and SP Corp. was acquired by SPHC in a corporate restructuring. SP Corp. expanded certain assets acquired in the W2W Acquisition while either reducing or eliminating other unprofitable assets. SP Corp. is no longer an operating subsidiary. M2 Communications is the subsidiary that provides broadband, VoIP services and Wi-Fi to corporate customers and all references to these services refer to M2 Communications.

&#160;

In January 2013, SPHC acquired SignalShare LLC ("SSLLC"), a Delaware limited liability company and diversified its products and services. SignalShare provides high density Wi-Fi solutions for sports stadiums, concert and festival venues and convention centers.

On December 9, 2014, SPHC and its wholly-owned subsidiary, M2 nGage, Inc. (formerly SignalShare Software Development Corp.) ("SSSD" or M2 nGage") and Incubite, Inc. ("Incubite") and its members entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization whereby Incubite exchanged the assets of Incubite for interest in SPHC that were distributed to the Incubite Members. M2 nGage is a software development company and provides Wi-Fi related services as part of its media offering to its customers provides data analytics for the networks they monitor allowing advertisers to better target their advertisement placements and providing additional revenue opportunities for M2 nGage.

The M2 Communications and M2 nGage subsidiaries of SPHC were transferred to a new holding company, Digital Media Acquisition Group Corp. (DMAG), and that entity now the 100% shareholder of both subsidiaries. The Company is the sole owner of DMAG.

Rebranding

On July 28, 2016, we changed the name of the Company to M2 nGage Group, Inc. Moreover, the names of the operating subsidiaries were changed to reflect the new branding of the Company. We believe that this streamlined branding will allow for better name recognition, as well as helping cross-sell our various services. As part of the rebranding process, services that where formerly offered by M2 Communications (e.g., Wi-Fi services) will be transitioned to M2 nGage.

Business Strategy

We continue to execute on all aspects of our business, including our Wi-Fi networking, digital technology and media business serving the sports, entertainment and convention center market and our business where we provide broadband, VoIP services, and value added hospitality services to the commercial market. We have found that truly successful businesses find ways of taking fixed assets and generating multiple revenue opportunities over those fixed, preferably on a contractual monthly recurring revenue model, thereby improving profitability.

Our communications business stems from the assets we purchased in 2012. Our goal is to provide our business customers with their basic broadband and VoIP services, and then as a trusted vendor to these customers, to provide them with additional value added services. Since we are paying for the infrastructure required to provide these services with the revenues generated from these customers, each additional valued added service we provide allows us to generate an increased profit margin and maximizing the infrastructure already in place.

In the same fashion of generating additional revenue from our customers utilizing the common infrastructure we already have in place to provide our basic services, we also utilize that same infrastructure to provide services for third parties. As an example, AT&#38;T provides many of the Parks in the New York City and surrounding boroughs with free Wi-Fi service. M2 Communications is the company that set up the Wi-Fi in the parks for AT&#38;T and is providing the broadband for these parks, utilizing antennas on the roofs of nearby buildings where we are already providing services to the business tenants of those buildings. Here again, we are generating additional revenue utilizing a fixed asset we already have in place, intended to increase our profit margin.

We consider our digital technology, media and Wi-Fi business to be our high growth business. The business started as a provider of High Density Wi-Fi networks for large audiences. Without disclosing proprietary technology we deploy, what we have figured out is a way to provide a high quality of service in extremely densely populated stadiums, arenas and convention centers.

We have taken steps over the past year to take this business and transform it into not only an installation revenue business, but a business that generates monthly recurring revenues. The way we have done this is two-fold:

First, is by adding a maintenance component to our service offerings so not only do we get installation revenue but the venues will pay us on a monthly basis for a maintenance fee for the network;

Second, and more importantly, we have taken advantage of access to the wireless network by collecting all of the data analytics of what happens on the network and utilizing these analytics to sell advertising sponsorship opportunities through our Fan/Guest nGage media products. M2 nGage is the branding we use for our data analytics and sponsorship software platform. We have tested both the technology and our ability to sell these sponsorship opportunities and we were extremely pleased with the results. This has given us the confidence to now go to existing customers, as well as all of the new stadiums and venues we are working with, and offer our advertising sponsorship services whereby we jointly sell with the venue and we have a revenue sharing agreement alongside our network installation agreement. In theory, we are acting as a partner to the teams, providing the teams and venues with a vehicle for a Return on Investment (ROI) to pay for their capital expense building their WiFi networks. Our software platform also serves as a Fan Engagement portal that allows the team to connect with the fans before, during and after the game, and we are working on plans to expand those fan engagement opportunities to the many fans not attending the games in-stadium, which is something teams have told us they are looking for but have not found the way to do.

The value of these networks really starts to shine when you look at how many potential eyeballs or users we have for the networks we install.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Through this unique approach of combining network infrastructure installation with media sales, we have started to gain momentum in the market and are building brand awareness.

We continue to aggressively push new sales and installation opportunities, and are in discussions with NHL teams, NBA teams, NFL teams, and several NCAA teams and convention centers. No assurance can be given, however, that we will conclude any of these potential contracts.

Another area we continue to focus on is our music festival and corporate events business. This utilizes the same technology we use in the large stadiums and arenas, but whereas those are permanent installations, theses music and corporate events are installed as temporary installations. What we do is build the temporary Wi-Fi networks capable of handling high density performance, and then again plan to sell sponsorship and advertising packages in conjunction with the event owners based on the data analytics that we collect.

Business Segments

&#160; DMAG operating subsidiaries are organized into three primary business units: (1) Wi-Fi; (2) enterprise broadband services, including voice, data and wireless / IT support; and (3) media content/data analytics and advertising, all of which together provides a comprehensive solution for business and media partners. 

Wi-Fi Networking 

DMAG's subsidiaries provide a wide variety of wireless offerings catering to specific vertical markets. The various Wi-Fi services provided include the following:

&#160;

Wi-Fi for Stadiums &#8211; We have installed Wi-Fi networks in major stadiums and arenas where high-density connectivity for massive audiences has been an issue. We are one of the few companies to have solved that problem. Once the networks are installed, we will have long-term contracts for maintenance of the network; data analytics of transactions processed on the networks and offers various media content services which will be described below.

&#160;

Wi-Fi Network Engineering &#8211; We provide installation services for enterprise corporate clients through M2 Communications. One such example is the rollout for AT&#38;T of Wi-Fi networks in the New York City Public Parks, for which AT&#38;T paid M2 Communications an initial fee and is continuing to pay a monthly recurring fee for the broadband connectivity. Existing and previous customers also include IBM, Google, NBC and Viacom.

&#160;

Wi-Fi for Events - We offer Wi-Fi based services for special events, such as concerts, music festivals, corporate gatherings and sporting events. The Company is paid by the organizers for the installation and maintenance of the network before and during the event, and for an additional fee provides analytical data to the customers, showing consumer trends. Our executive and sales team members have previously serviced and generated sales from customers including Austin City Limits, Live Nation, AEG, and iHeart Radio.

&#160;

Wi-Fi Offloading - M2 Communications leverages the wireless tower rights it currently has on the roofs of buildings in New York City in order to start building out our Wi-Fi Network. M2 Communications currently has many rooftop rights on buildings in New York and as funding and opportunity allows, has plans to acquire more. The concept is not to offer Wi-Fi services under M2 Communications' brand, but to offer access to the network to the major wireless cellular carriers. This access will allow the carriers to have their customers offload the data traffic onto M2 Communications' network, which in turn frees up the carriers network for more voice calls. With access to the rooftop locations on these buildings pursuant to various building services Agreements ("BSA"), the Company provides transmitters, wireless equipment and telecommunications transmission facilities necessary to service customers and providers. Our transmitters are programmed with the ability to accept transmissions from carrier networks, like AT&#38;T, and those carrier customers are allowed access to our network. These transmissions are then carried on dedicated high capacity telecommunications circuits to the desired destinations. M2 Communications has successfully completed a pilot with AT&#38;T in New York City for this service and has signed a definitive Wi-Fi roaming agreement, as well as other services. M2 Communications believes that it is the first and only company to have a signed carrier offloading agreement with AT&#38;T.

&#160;

M2 Communications intends to carry forward preliminary discussions with other major U.S. based cellular carriers to run similar trials in others cities as well. The potential revenue for this business is difficult to project as it is relying on the millions of customers the carriers have in any one market at any given time.

&#160;

Enterprise Broadband 

Enterprise Voice and Data - We offer Enterprise Corporate customers a complete package of integrated products that includes wired and wireless broadband Internet access services, VoIP telephone services, data and email hosting, point-to point connections, collocation services, VPNs, and web hosting. Existing customers include Rolex, Versace, Christian Louboutin, New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority (NJSEA) , amongst many others.

Media Content / Analytics 

Data Analytics - through the millions of potential users on our various networks, we accumulate consumer data analytics which can be monetized with owners, sponsors and major consumer brands. Based on existing events, DMAG has access to certain user data from over 30 million potential visitors over our networks.

&#160;

&#160; Media Content - DMAG, through its subsidiaries is able to provide improved and cutting edge fan engagement for all of its venues, as well as VIP hospitality guests, which will create marketing opportunities. This includes working with venues and owners on advertising sponsorship opportunities, as well as providing specific target market media content. In 2016 M2 nGage has started to roll this out and revenues are minimal at this time.

Market Opportunity

&#160;

&#160; We seek to capitalize on the convergence of wireless, broadband, and content-based service models. Growth in new applications in wireless voice and multimedia services, increasing demand for high quality mobile voice and high definition video entertainment services, and the desire of cellular carriers to efficiently manage valuable spectrum, drive the underlying demand for our wireless broadband products and systems. It is widely accepted that existing networks and technologies cannot fulfill this demand. 

DMAG Historical Business

The various businesses that DMAG acquired have provided communication services to small to mid-sized businesses in the Northeast and Midwest United States with a complete package of integrated products that includes wired and wireless broadband Internet access services, Voice over Internet Protocol, or VoIP, data, email hosting, point-to point connections, managed network services, collocation, virtual private networks, or VPNs, web hosting, Wi-Fi and wireless internet. These subsidiaries have successfully implemented and sold fixed wireless broadband solutions in the Northeast United States since our inception. Following SPHC's acquisition of the assets of Wave2Wave through the Section 363 auction, M2 Communications is selling services to businesses primarily through a direct sales force, channel partners and telemarketing. While M2 Communications markets these services to many customer segments, it focuses on selling to customers in multi-tenant office buildings (in-building) and to remote locations (stand-alone buildings). It currently has active Building Service Agreements, or BSAs, with building owners throughout New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Chicago. Under these BSAs, it either pays the building owners monthly rent or a revenue share to allow it to sell throughout their buildings. The term of these BSAs are typically multi-year in length, with automatic renewals. M2 Communications has found that revenue share agreements give the building owners an incentive to promote our services to new tenants, and will help it increase penetration rates in terms of the number of tenants per building. It also helps with the securing of roof top rights for our Wi-Fi network. This legacy now helps M2 Communications differentiates itself from its competition and creates a mutually beneficial relationship between it, the building owners and tenants.

&#160;

M2 Communications leverages the wireless towers it currently has on the roofs of buildings in New York City in order to start building out our Wi-Fi network. M2 Communications plans to acquire more rights to use buildings roofs providing that the funds and opportunity is available and prudent. The concept is not to offer Wi-Fi services under M2 Communications' brand, but to offer access to the network to the major wireless cellular carriers. This access will allow the carriers to have their customers offload the data traffic onto M2 Communications' network, which in turn frees up the carriers network for more voice calls. M2 Communications has successfully completed a pilot with AT&#38;T in New York City for this service and has signed a definitive Wi-Fi roaming agreement, as well as other services.

&#160;

M2 Communications is also doing Wi-Fi rollouts and maintenance for third parties through its IT services business. One such example is the build out in 2012/2013 for AT&#38;T of Wi-Fi networks in various New York public parks. It was paid for the rollout by AT&#38;T, and is paid a monthly recurring fee from them for the broadband connectivity. The M2 Communications and M2 nGage subsidiaries of SPHC were transferred to a new holding company, Digital Media Acquisition Group Corp. (DMAG), and DMAG is the 100% shareholder of both subsidiaries. The Company is the sole owner of DMAG.

SignalShare Operations

SignalShare was created to meet the demand for mobile Wi-Fi access as users increase their integration of digital technology into their daily lives. The proliferation of Wi-Fi enabled mobile devices has dramatically grown and will continue to expand. Signal Share offered new products and services designed to provide permanent and temporary Wi-Fi and data collection and analysis for live sporting and entertainment events. Signal Share provided all of the technology, infrastructure and resources necessary to construct a broadband wireless network for an event. Regardless of the location, event type or duration, Signal Share connected fans in a whole new way.

On July 5, 2016, SignalShare, LLC filed for bankruptcy voluntarily pursuant to Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. The case was filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of New Jersey and is captioned case no. 16-23003. 

Arista Communications, LLC

&#160;

Arista Communications, LLC is a joint venture between Cardinal Broadband and Wiens Real Estate Ventures, LLC, with each entity having a 50% membership interest. Wiens is the developer of the Arista residential/retail/office development in Broomfield, Colorado. The joint venture was formed to provide telecommunication services to the Arista community. Arista Communications provides telephone, television, and internet connectivity to the residents and businesses of the Arista development, including the 1st Bank Center, an 8,000-seat music and sports venue. The Company owned a 50% membership interest in Arista Communications through its Cardinal Broadband division. Cardinal Broadband manages the operations of Arista Communications.

The Company's interest in Arista Communications, LLC were sold as part of the Cardinal Broadband sale agreement effective May 1, 2016.

SignalShare Infrastructure

SignalShare Infrastructure ("SSI") conducted the existing business operations of Roomlinx following the merger with SPHC. On May 11, 2016, SSI completed the Foreclosure Sale of substantially all assets of SSI (other than certain excluded agreements) pursuant to Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. SSI terminated all of its employees and ceased operations. The Foreclosure Sale resulted from SSI's inability to pay $3,622,275 of indebtedness to SSI's senior lender, Cenfin, LLC. The winning bid was made by Single Digits, Inc., an unaffiliated New Hampshire corporation and accepted by Cenfin. There was no relationship between SSI or its affiliates and Single Digits prior to the transaction. The consideration was $700,000 plus SSI's cash on hand at Closing less $207,106.72, such amount representing 75% of deposits received by SSI prior to closing for future installations for which work had not been substantially completed for Hyatt (see below). The amount of accounts receivables included in the transferred assets was approximately $440,000 as of May 9, 2016 . 

The primary business of SSI focused on providing in-room media, entertainment, and HD television programming solutions along with wired networking solutions and Wireless Fidelity networking solutions, also known as Wi-Fi, for high speed Internet access to hotels, resorts, and time share properties. The Company also provided both wired and wireless Internet access, HD satellite television service, and telephone service both Plain Old Telephone Service ("POTS") and Voice over Internet Protocol ("VOIP"), to residential and business customers.

On May 3, 2016 at 10:00 A.M. (Local Time) Cenfin, the senior secured lender of SSI, sold all right, title and interest in substantially all personal property of SSI to the highest qualified bidder at a public auction pursuant to Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. The auction took place at the offices of DLA Piper LLP, 203 N. LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois 60601. There was one bidder and the transaction closed on May 11, 2016 and all employees of SSI were terminated and the operations of SSI ceased 

&#160;

Hyatt Master Services Agreement

&#160;

On March 12, 2012, the Company and Hyatt Corporation ("Hyatt") entered into a Master Services and Equipment Purchase Agreement (the "MSA") pursuant to which SSI agreed to provide in-room media and entertainment solutions, including its proprietary Interactive TV (or iTV) platform, high speed internet, free-to-guest, on-demand programming and related support services, to Hyatt-owned, managed or franchised hotels that are located in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean. Under the MSA, Hyatt will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its managed hotels to order the installation of the Company's iTV product in a minimum number of rooms in Hyatt hotels within certain time frames.

&#160;

On November 16, 2015, SSI entered into a Settlement, Mutual Release, and Indemnification Agreement (the "Settlement Agreement") with Hyatt which had claimed that the Company had breached the MSA and various Hotel Services and Equipment Purchase Agreements (the "HSAs"). Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the parties terminated various HSAs and SSI agreed to sell and assign iTV services for the remainder of the amended HSAs to third party providers and to provide Transition Services (as defined) for up to ninety (90) days after an HSA is terminated. All of such administrative costs for such services are capped at $250,000 and shall be deducted from the deposits currently on hand with SSI, for which Hyatt had demanded repayment.

Pursuant to the above described foreclosure sale, of SSI's operations, including the MSA, were sold to a non-affiliated third party.

Residential Media and Communications

&#160;

We provide residential and business customers telecommunication services including telephone, satellite television, and wired and wireless internet access. Telephone service is provided through traditional, analog "twisted pair" lines, as well as digital "VoIP". Analog phone service is typically provided via an interconnection agreement with CenturyLink, Inc., which allows the Company to resell CenturyLink service through their wholesale and retail accounts with CenturyLink. VoIP service is provided at properties where the Company maintains a broadband internet service to the end customer, allowing the Company to provide digital phone service (VoIP) over the same lines as their internet service.

&#160;

Television service is typically provided via the Company's agreements with DISH Network and DirecTV. Most television service is provided via a head-end distribution system, or an L-Band digital distribution system. Television service is offered in high definition whenever possible.

Internet service is provided via both wired and wireless network design. The Company provisions and manages broadband access to the residential customers through both wholesale and resale methods. Wholesale methods exist when the Company owns and controls the internet circuit and resale methods exist when the Company uses an affiliated third party to provide the internet circuit.

We generate revenue through:

&#9679; Network design and installation services

&#9679; Delivery of telephone service (billed monthly)

&#9679; Delivery of Internet service (billed monthly)

&#9679; Delivery of television service (billed by the satellite provider with monthly commissions paid to the Company)

&#160;

Many of our existing and potential competitors may have greater financial, technical, marketing and distribution resources than we do. Additionally, many of these companies may have greater name recognition and more established relationships with our target customers.

&#160;

Product Development

&#160;

We seek to continually enhance the features and performance of our existing products and services. In addition, we are continuing to evaluate new products to meet our customers' expectations of ongoing innovation and enhancements.

&#160;

Our ability to meet our customers' expectations depends on a number of factors, including our ability to identify and respond to emerging technological trends in our target markets, develop and maintain competitive products, enhance our existing products by adding features and functionality that differentiate them from those of our competitors and offering products on a timely basis and at competitive prices. Consequently, we have made, and we intend to continue to make, investments in product development.

&#160;

Customer Support Systems

We provide live support from our call centers 24 hours a day, seven days per week, and 365 days a year. Support representatives are specifically trained to enable them to offer customers customized support depending on the product or service at issue. We utilize industry standard coaching and employee development and training programs to help achieve high quality customer interactions. As such, most callers will reach a live representative in less than one minute and, when they do; trained agents work to address any concerns or issues on that very first call into the support system. Customer care operations strive to ensure first call resolutions are over 80% for customer issues and those issues escalated to a higher level are handled quickly by senior engineers. Customer care centers cater to the diverse needs and preferences of its customers.

&#160;

Network Architecture and Deployment

We offer an integrated voice and data network as an advanced and secure network, sophisticated voice and data applications, as well as outstanding, reliability, redundancy, and security. The diversity and resiliency of our network are designed to insulate customers from network failures by providing diverse network access points in each market and multiple private peering arrangements. All of this is supported by power backup and a self-healing high capacity fiber optic backbone. We are able to manage and control the entire network: equipment, points of presence, and fiber optic backbone&#8212;providing customers with reliability, high availability service, and security. We believe that such network deployment strategies will allow it to enter new markets rapidly and to offer customers flexible technological solutions tailored to their specific needs.

&#160;

Our network was built from the ground up by professionals with many years of combined engineering and design experience in voice and data technologies. This network infrastructure and operations support systems enable it to control the types of services that it offers, how these services are packaged and how they are integrated to serve customers. Through the installation of IP routers at its switch sites, we deploy packet-based technology to augment its traditional circuit-switching technology. Its customer-specific voice and data solutions are driven by customer preferences and priorities, as it strives to provide industry-leading packet delivery, latency, and backbone availability over its core IP network, enabling rapid, secure, and accurate transmissions. By providing the latest in IP technologies, we seek to maintain an advanced architecture that supports converged technologies. This allows it to deliver cutting-edge products, features and services to customers efficiently over a single, next-generation network&#8212;including unified messaging, IP video and trunking, presence management, and online feature management&#8212;allowing customers to combine voice and data services to increase efficiency and reduce costs.

We rely on various equipment vendors and integration partners to provide us with equipment and services to offer our services. We anticipate that these vendors have adequate supply and technology to meet our deployment and institutional needs. Moreover, SignalShare Software Development Corp. has its own development team associated with its products.

Network Operations Command Center (NOCC) .

&#160; We provide pro-active, real-time monitoring to protect customer services. Our Network Operations Command Center (NOCC) in Hackensack, New Jersey provides 24/7/365 surveillance of its network elements to support our customers' services. The NOCC is equipped with proactive monitoring tools to ensure quick identification and resolution of network issues. In addition to this constant surveillance of individual network elements, we will perform routine equipment audits to ensure reliability. The network is highly sectionalized, with remote access to all devices that allows us to communicate with devices such as modems and routers to speed detection and repair. We employ the latest telecommunications standards to ensure that we maintain the low mean-time-to-repair performance. In addition, it adheres to stringent "maintenance window" schedules, where repairs are done overnight to minimize or eliminate any impact on its customers. The NOCC provides advanced, "always-on" monitoring for latency, jitter, utilization and packet loss in real time. Customer Premise Equipment, local loops and backbone elements are constantly under surveillance with proactive monitoring systems for fast failure detection and recovery. Because of these capabilities, many problems are identified and rectified before customers are even aware there is an issue. Our highly trained staff is provided with the right tools, training and state-of-the-art equipment to maintain network reliability and keep the network and its customers up and running. 

Stringent Security Regulations .

&#160; We meet the most demanding security standards and regulations to safeguard customers' critical data and processes against disruption, and provide privacy protection. For example, M2 Communications complies with the FCC's stringent Customer Network Proprietary Information, or CPNI, standards that safeguard customer proprietary information and prevent "data mining."

Competition

&#160; The primary competitors in the marketplace include hardware manufacturers of access points and switches, Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers, or ILECs, such as Verizon and AT&#38;T, and other national and international providers such as Level 3 Communications, LLC, XO Communications and Cogent Communications, Inc. Additionally; regional and local providers such as Broadview Networks, Inc. and Paetec/Windstream, GuestTek and Sonifi also compete in some of our market offerings. Although many are much larger organizations, they may be less apt to handle the small to mid-size market that is SPHC's focus. The Company believes that it is able to compete effectively in the marketplace by solution oriented sales, personal and prompt client support and services, and competitive pricing. It further believes that its technology and offerings are well positioned to compete in this marketplace, provide a superior experience for end users, and provide for the most efficient use of network resources. While there are other companies offering such services, M2 Communications is one of a limited number of companies that has the ability to offer combined Wi-Fi services, broadband service and Media &#38; Content services to major corporations, consumer brands and sporting owners. 

&#160;

Regulatory Obligations

&#160; As a telecommunications carrier and under the FCC's recently adopted broadband rules, SPHC and its affiliates offering regulated services are subject to a variety of miscellaneous regulations at the federal and state level that can have cost or operational implications. The regulations, for instance, require the filing of periodic revenue and service quality reports, the provision of services to customers with hearing or speech disabilities and associated funding of telecommunications relay services, protection of Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI), the capability to associate a physical address with a calling party's telephone number (E-911) and cooperation with law enforcement officials engaged in lawful investigations. The FCC's stringent CPNI, standards safeguard customer proprietary information, including the services selected and call records, and prevent "data mining" by requiring customer authentication before disclosing CPNI which significantly curtails "data mining." Moreover, the CPNI rules require yearly certifications of compliance and immediate reports to the FCC and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in situations where CPNI is disclosed in violation of the rules. SPHC is required to file quarterly and yearly reports with the Universal Service Administration Company ("USAC") disclosing its telecommunications revenues. These filings are used for certain public interest assessments, e.g., USF and TRS, which support universal service and programs for persons with certain disabilities. The FCC has jurisdiction over the management and licensing of the electromagnetic spectrum for all commercial users. The FCC routinely reviews its spectrum policies and may change its position on spectrum use and allocations from time to time. We believe that the FCC is committed to allocating spectrum to support wireless broadband deployment throughout the United States and will continue to modify its regulations to foster such deployment, which will help us implement our existing and future business plans. SPHC primarily uses unlicensed spectrum in order to provide its Wi-Fi services and the Company must comply with equipment and transmission standards associated with use of the spectrum in order to avoid interference. Noncompliance with these and other provisions can result in administrative fines and penalties. 

In 2015, the FCC reversed its previous rulings that Internet services are interstate information services that are not subject to regulation as a telecommunications service under federal law or to state or local utility regulation. The FCC determined that broadband providers are common carriers subject to FCC regulation similar to telephone providers, but decided to forbear much of the more onerous regulations applicable to telephone providers. Accordingly, our broadband Internet services are, therefore, not subject to many of the regulatory requirements imposed on wireless and wireline telecommunications service providers. For example, we are not currently required to contribute a percentage of gross revenues from our Internet access services to the universal service funds used to support local telephone service and advanced telecommunications services for schools, libraries and rural health care facilities. Our wireless broadband Internet services are, however, subject to a number of federal regulatory requirements, including the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act ("CALEA") requirement that high-speed Internet service providers implement certain network capabilities to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of persons suspected of criminal activity and the FCC's CPNI rules.

With respect to services based on customer analytics raises privacy concerns that can impact state and federal law pertaining to personal information and data protection depending on if the data is personally identifiable or non-personally identifiable. Monitoring of programs to insure that personally identifiable information is not disclosed will be necessary to insure the company does not violate state and federal law. Moreover, data collection associated with minors may impose differing and more stringent obligations on our use of such data. Our terms of service with customers and users will require proper disclosure of our uses of the information in order to obtain proper consent from users and customers in order to avoid privacy concerns and potential consumer protection law violations.

Intellectual Property

&#160; To protect its proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, employment, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with its employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements and protective contractual provisions with our partners, licensees and other third parties. 

&#160; Trademarks. As of December 31, 2015, SPHC maintained the following trademarks: "SignalPoint Communications" and "SignalPoint". Roomlinx, Inc. maintains the following trademarks: "Roomlinx" and "SmartRoom." 

&#160; Copyrights. SPHC has not registered any copyrights. All works of original authorship fixed in a tangible form that may exist are unregistered. 

&#160; Patents. We maintain one patent for "Communications System and Call Forwarding Management" Patent No. US 8,036,362 B1. The Company's M2 nGage subsidiary has filed one provisional patent for " A One-Tap Operation on Mobile Device Touchscreens to Instantly Send a New Text Message Chosen From a User-Customizable Set of Phrases Displayed in a Keyboard-like Grid." 

&#160; Other Materials. From time to time, employees will report on potential intellectual property opportunities for the company. These opportunities may include new product and service offerings, and potential proprietary information association with such services which may warrant application for formal IP protection. Regarding potential patentable material, personnel will conduct interviews with the inventors, may perform initial prior art searches, and if a determination is made that the proprietary material is valuable enough to the company to warrant patent protection, such applications will be made with the assistance of third-party patent counsel with support of our own in-house counsel. In addition, the company will also seek to maintain certain intellectual property and proprietary know-how as trade secrets, and generally require our partners to execute non-disclosure agreements prior to any substantive discussions or disclosures of our technology. 

&#160;

We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, as applicable, to protect our intellectual proprietary rights. We have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property, and we currently hold a number of trademarks.

Employees

&#160; As of August 25, 2016, we had approximately 33 employees companywide; however, the number of employees may increase or decrease as we deem fit. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement or an employment agreement.
