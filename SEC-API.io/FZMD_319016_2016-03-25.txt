 ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

Historical Company Information 

&#160;

Golf Rounds was incorporated in 1968 as a Florida corporation. 

&#160;

Until the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1992, Golf Rounds was engaged in the wholesale distribution of aluminum alloys, steel and other specialty metals under the name American Metals Service, Inc. This entity liquidated its assets and ceased operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1992. Golf Rounds did not conduct any business operations from such time until May 1999. 

&#160;

In May 1999, Golf Rounds acquired the assets of PKG Design, Inc., the developer of two sports-related Internet websites: golfrounds.com and skiingusa.com. In July 1999, Golf Rounds redomesticated through the merger of Golf Rounds into a wholly owned Delaware subsidiary, with the Delaware subsidiary surviving. Also, in July 1999, in connection with the acquisition of these websites, Golf Rounds formally changed its name to Golf Rounds.com, Inc. In August 2001, Golf Rounds ceased operations of the golfrounds.com and skiingusa.com websites. 

&#160;

On December 18, 2013, Golf Rounds entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Fuse, Project Fuse LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("Merger Sub"), and D. Alan Meeker, solely in his capacity as the representative of the Fuse members (the "Representative"), which agreement was amended on March 3, 2014 and April 11, 2014 solely to extend the termination date set forth therein (as so amended, and as further amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Merger Agreement"). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Fuse, with Fuse surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Golf Rounds (the "Merger"). The Merger was effective as of May 28, 2014, upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. At the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), the legal existence of Merger Sub ceased and each membership interest unit of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was converted into and became one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable membership interest unit of Fuse, so that after the Effective Time, Golf Rounds became the holder of all of the issued and outstanding membership interest units of Fuse. 

&#160;

On May 28, 2014, as a result of the Merger, Golf Rounds acquired Fuse and the business of Fuse became our business. For more information on the Merger, see the Company's Form 8-K/A filed on August 29, 2014. 

&#160;

Fuse was formed in Delaware on July 18, 2012 to market, distribute and sell internal fixation, durable bone materials, biologics, tissues, surgical and other related surgical products for use in a variety of surgical procedures. Subsequent to the formation of Fuse, two physician partnerships were formed to operate separate businesses focusing on the distribution of medical devices. Fuse Medical V, LP, was formed on November 15, 2012 and is owned 59% by Fuse, 1% by Fuse Management V, LLC (the General Partner) and 40% by individual physicians. The second partnership, Fuse Medical VI, LP was formed on January 31, 2013. Fuse Medical VI, LP was owned 59% by Fuse, 1% by Fuse Management VI, LLC (the General Partner) and 40% by individual physicians. Fuse Medical V, LP and Fuse Medical VI, LP are limited partnerships. Prior to the Merger, the General Partners in Fuse Medical V, LP and Fuse Medical VI, LP agreed to surrender their interests and the individual physicians that owned limited partnership interests in Fuse Medical V, LP and Fuse Medical VI, LP agreed to exchange their interests to corresponding interests in Fuse, each becoming one of the Holders. Accordingly, the above companies became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Fuse immediately prior to the Merger. Certificates of Termination were filed for Fuse Medical V, LP, Fuse Medical VI, LP, Fuse Management V, LLC, and Fuse Management VI, LLC on February 12, 2015. A Certificate of Cancellation for Fuse Medical, LLC, was filed in Delaware on February 20, 2015 and a Certificate of Withdrawal was filed in Texas on August 5, 2015. 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

The Company's business is to market, distribute and sell internal fixation, durable bone materials, biologics, tissues, surgical and other related surgical products for use in a variety of surgical procedures in various types of facilities (ambulatory surgical centers, hospitals and physician offices and other medical facilities) where surgeons and doctors treat patients and operate. The Company markets, distributes and sells a variety of existing FDA-approved and/or state licensed products and services manufactured or produced by other organizations where the Company is considered a distributor and/or a stocking distributor. Currently, these products consist of plates and screws for recurring bone fractures, allografts for bone chips and tendons, and amniotics. The amniotic products are derived from the inner layer of the human amniotic tissue and then processed by the manufacturer which results in an FDA-approved allograft. Amniotics has historically made up over half of the Company's revenues. The Company utilizes its physician relationships, corporate partners, facility relationships and partnerships, as well as its knowledge of the healthcare industry, to further its business objectives. All sales are made in compliance with both the Stark Law and the federal anti-kickback statute, as further discussed below. &#160;

Product Distribution Channels and Customer Base 

&#160;

The Company utilizes multiple distribution models including representative networks and independent contractors. The Company's customers are physicians, orthopedic surgeons, hospitals, surgical facilities and physician practices. The Company distributes the products on behalf of manufacturers and, in some cases, receives a commission related to sales numbers. In most cases, the Company purchases products directly from manufactures and resells the products from existing inventory. Beginning with the inclusion of Dr. Pratt and Dr. Dei on the Company's management team and others of similar reputations, the Company is attempting to build a network of specialists in select clinical specialties, many of whom are leaders in their field, that the Company hopes will clinically utilize the Company's product lines through appropriate channels in a manner consistent with professional standards of practice. These network specialists may include heads of teaching hospitals, universities and clinical resident and fellowship programs at some of the most respected institutes in the nation. 

&#160;

For products sold on a commission basis, the Company receives payment from the manufacturer or distributor. For products sold from the Company's inventory, the Company receives payment directly from its customers. Currently, the Company has a limited number of customers that it sells products to. In the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company had a concentration of sales in a limited number of hospital and surgical facilities. Amniotics has historically made up the largest portion of the Company's business. The Company recognizes that the diversification and growth of its customer base will be instrumental to its long-term strategic and financial success. 

&#160;

Our principal supplier for our Amniotic products is SLR Medical Consulting, LLC ("SLR"). Fuse entered into a Distributor Agreement with SLR effective December 15, 2015, pursuant to which Fuse acts as a non-exclusive global distributor of certain amniotic membrane products. The term of the agreement is one year and renews on each annual anniversary date for successive one-year terms unless it is terminated in writing by either party. 

&#160;

On December 9, 2015, Fuse entered into a Sales Representative Agreement with Evologics, LLC in which Fuse receives a specified commission (depending on the specific product) of all of its sales of Evologics, LLC (and its affiliates) products, subject to certain adjustments set forth in the agreement. The term of the agreement expires on December 31, 2017 and renews on each annual anniversary date thereafter for successive one-year terms unless it is terminated in writing by either party. 

&#160;

On July 17, 2014, the Company entered into an Independent Representative Agreement with Vilex, Inc. ("Vilex") pursuant to which the Company was appointed as a representative of Vilex to promote and sell Vilex's products in the United States. The Vilex products include certain plates, screws, and related equipment. Under the terms of the agreement with Vilex, the Company is a non-exclusive representative of Vilex, except for certain specified customers. The term of the agreement with Vilex is five years, and will automatically renew for additional one-year periods at the expiration of the original term unless terminated as provided therein. The Company is paid a commission based on its net sales. In 2015, we generated approximately $46,000 from Vilex for commissions under this agreement. 

&#160;

On January 8, 2015, the Company entered into a Distribution and Supply Agreement with BioDlogics, LLC ("BioD"), pursuant to which the Company was appointed as a non-exclusive distributor of certain products of BioD and granted the right to promote and sell such products in the United States. The term of the agreement with BioD is from January 8, 2015, through December 31, 2016, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the agreement. The agreement sets forth a quota for the purchase of the products by the Company from BioD for the first year of the agreement, which the Company agreed to use its best efforts to meet or exceed. In 2015, we generated approximately $420,000 of revenues from this agreement . &#160;

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

For most of the products the Company offers there are a number of integrated competitors, several of which are publically traded, that not only manufacture and produce their own products but also have established distribution and sales networks and participate in large group purchasing organizations within the medical industry. Most of these competitors have linked physicians to their entities by engaging select physician and surgical specialties through consulting agreements, clinical trials remuneration and other compensation models. As mature companies, they also have extensive legacy systems and expensive administrative and sales commission cost structures. In addition, there are numerous independent medical distributorships primarily focused on limited geographic markets and products located across the United States. &#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

The Company holds no intellectual property, patents or trademarks. 

&#160;

Regulatory Issues 

&#160;

There are both federal and state regulations that may impact the Company's ability to fully implement its strategic plan. 

&#160;

FDA Regulations 

&#160;

The manufacturers and suppliers of the products we market are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations ("FDA"), other federal governmental agencies and by state authorities. These regulations govern the approval, clearance or license to commercialize medical devices, biological products and human cellular and tissue products; including compliance with the standards and requirements related to the design, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion and sales of the products, stringent record keeping requirements, tracking of devices, reporting of potential product defects and adverse events, conduct of corrections and recalls, and other matters. As a distributor and marketer of such FDA-regulated products, we are subject to independent requirements to register and list certain products, we may be required to obtain state licensure or certifications and we may be subject to inspections, in addition to complying with derivative requirements applicable to the manufacturers of the products we market. Failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in a wide variety of enforcement actions ranging from warning letters to more severe sanctions such as: fines and civil penalties, operating restrictions, injunctions and criminal prosecutions. 

&#160;

Fraud, Abuse and False Claims 

&#160;

We are directly and indirectly subject to certain federal and state laws governing relationships with healthcare providers and pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (the "AKS") is a criminal statute that prohibits the payment or receipt of remuneration, in cash or otherwise, in return for referrals of federal healthcare beneficiaries. The CMS has promulgated certain safe harbors that offer protection from liability for arrangements that fall within very specific parameters. The Company intends to utilize the "physician investment interest safe harbor" in the AKS as a business model. To reach the "Public Company Exception" (as defined below) to the AKS, the Company must possess undepreciated net tangible assets related to the furnishing of healthcare items and services of more than $50,000,000 in the previous fiscal year or 12-month period. As of December 31, 2015, our net tangible assets related to healthcare items and services was approximately $100,000 and, therefore, we will not meet this exception at any time in the near future. 

&#160;

The Stark Law prohibits physicians or their immediate family members from referring to entities that provide designated health services ("DHS") to federal program beneficiaries if the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship (either via a compensation arrangement or ownership interest) directly or indirectly in that entity. Similar to safe harbors for the AKS, the Stark Law regulations created a series of exceptions to provide protection for certain types of business arrangements that fall within their parameters. Many states have laws similar to the federal law. 

&#160;

The Company will not accept federal reimbursement for its products until it meets one of the exceptions under the Stark Law. In addition, there are various state statutes which may limit the Company's ability to fully implement our business model until such time as the Company achieves exempt status. It is the intent of the Company to not sell any product to an insured that would be reimbursed under any government payer system including, but not limited to, Medicare, Tricare or other national or state government beneficiary program. 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of March 25, 2016, the Company had four employees and two independent contractors. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relationships with our employees are good. &#160;
