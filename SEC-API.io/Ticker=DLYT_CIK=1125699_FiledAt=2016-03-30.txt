 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

&#160;

Dais Analytic Corporation is a nano-structured polymer technology materials company having developed and now commercializing applications using its family of nanomaterial called Aqualyte&#8482;. The first commercial product is called ConsERV&#8482;, a fixed plate energy recovery ventilator which we believe is useful in meeting building indoor fresh air requirements while saving energy and lowering emissions for most forms of Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) equipment. We are developing other nano-structured polymer technology applications including (i) "NanoClear", a water clean-up process useful in the creation of potable water from most forms of contaminated water including industrial process waste water (petrochemical, steel, etc.) sea, brackish or waste water and (ii) NanoAir, a water based no fluorocarbon based refrigerant dehumidification, humidification, heating and cooling system. We further believe our nano-structure polymer technology may be useful in developing a form of energy storage device capable of storing greater energy density and power per pound than traditional forms of energy storage such as capacitors or batteries. 

&#160;

Formation History 

&#160;

We were incorporated as a New York corporation on April 8, 1993 as Dais Corporation. We were formed to develop new, cost-effective polymer materials for various applications, including providing a lower cost membrane material for Polymer Electrolyte Membrane fuel cells. We believe our research on materials science has yielded technological advances in the field of selective ion transport polymer materials. In December 1999, we purchased the assets of Analytic Power Corporation, which was founded in 1984 to provide fuel cell and fuel processor design and consulting services, systems integration and analysis services to develop integrated fuel cell power systems. We subsequently changed our name to Dais Analytic Corporation on December 13, 1999. 

&#160;

In March 2002, we sold substantially all of our fuel cell assets to a large U.S. oil company for a combination of cash and the assumption by such company of certain of our obligations. After we sold a substantial portion of our fuel cell assets, we focused on expanding our nano-structured polymer platform, having already identified the Energy Recovery Ventilator ("ERV") application as our first commercial product. 

&#160;

Recent Developments 

&#160;

NanoClear&#8482; Funding to Continue - Research 

&#160;

In March 2015, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers approved our application for a $1,000,000 Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) award to continue developing NanoClear water cleaning technology for military use. The NanoClear&#8482; funding project entitled "Non-Fouling Water Reuse Technologies" uses our patented Aqualyte&#8482; membrane to produce potable water from grey-water sources. The potential product improvements from this award will widen NanoClear's applications in separating clean water from most types of contaminated waste streams potentially beginning as early as 2016. 

&#160;

Advances in NanoClear Product Development and Initial Product Commercialization 

&#160;

A NanoClear water cleaning system demonstration unit was built by us in June 2015 and is now functional in Beijing, China. The unit is designed to showcase our Aqualyte &#8482; based nanomaterial and engineered process to potential partners, key influencers, and consumers. This demonstration unit, with our other activities is building recognition and demand for NanoClear. In April 2015, we were prominently featured in an article in USA Today, emphasizing our commercialized nanotechnology as a potential solution for California's water crisis, and recent lead issues plaguing many U.S. cities, schools, and homes. We are working with companies in China using the NanoClear demonstration unit and in the U.S. using the pilot plant in Odessa, FL to begin commercial sales in the 2 nd quarter of 2016 of the first NanoClear product called M2 &#8211; a membrane evaporator. If we are successful, we believe that we begin to generate significant revenues from the sales of NanoClear products in China, the U.S., and then worldwide.

&#160; &#160;

Introduction of New Version of Aqualyte Membrane Technology 

&#160;

We are preparing to release Version 4 (V4) of our Aqualyte material by adding features and improving the manufacturability of the nano material. Key additions found in V4 include integrated web casting and the availability of material in wider roll widths. These and other improvements will allow Aqualyte to serve a wider variety of uses in the ConsERV or NanoClear target markets. Aqualyte is the underlying technology for our family of products, including ConsERV, fixed-plate Energy Recovery Ventilator (ERV), and NanoClear, a high performance contaminated water clearing process. Aqualyte represents the basis for a broad class of materials with unique features precisely managed by engineered processes. Features of the Aqualyte technology include the ability to create hermetic composite membranes possessing ion conduction, high moisture transfer and molecular selectivity. Our engineering process manages these features to offer differentiated products like ConsERV and NanoClear that are targeting worldwide needs in the clean air, energy efficiency and clean water markets. 

&#160;

Business and Infrastructure Development in China 

&#160;

We have qualified a Chinese manufacturing company to produce ConsERV&#8482; cores using Aqualyte&#8482; membrane made in the U.S. and guided by Dais qualified manufacturing practices to meet the growing demand for ConsERV&#8482; systems in Asia. Having cores manufactured in Asia supports our objective of expanding our distribution in the Asian market at projected lower costs and quicker order fulfillment. 

&#160;

In April 2015, we participated as a delegation member of the Official Presidential Business Development Trade Mission to China which has historically been sponsored jointly by the U.S. Department of Commerce and U.S. Department of Energy. We were selected along with major U.S.-based companies including Alcoa, General Electric, Honeywell, Lockheed Martin, and others, due to a commitment to developing and commercializing technologies focused on energy efficiency and sustainability. We continue to work on collaborative opportunities with a number of different sized private firms and Chinese state-owned enterprises interested in our energy and water products with an expectation that such collaboration will yield solid long-term revenue generating relationships, especially for NanoClear products. 

&#160;

In November 2015, along with the U.S. Department of Commerce, we held two one day seminars in key China cities to introduce targeted client to ConsERV. The clients ranged from local province government rule setting bodies to design institute leaders, to HVAC distributors, to sophisticated end users. We continue to work with the most interested parties from these two event to create relationships that generate product sales of ConsERV product. We believe these activities, those coming from participating in the Presidential Trade Mission, and the buildup of in-country manufacturing infrastructure will drive China ConsERV revenues to new heights in 2016 and beyond. 

&#160;

NanoAir&#8482; Funding to Build Full-Size Prototype 

&#160;

In May 2015, we were selected to receive additional funding from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to further commercialize the Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning ("HVAC") membrane technology for our NanoAir&#8482; product. The award is part of a total investment of nearly $8 million by the DOE to advance research and development of next-generation HVAC technologies. The total funding value is $1.5m of which we will receive $0.7m. The project will build and test a full size rooftop unit with 7.5 tons of refrigeration capacity. Project testing will take place at the renowned Oak Ridge National Laboratory, providing the HVAC industry with independently verified data demonstrating that our technology can improve rooftop unit energy efficiency by almost 90 percent over units installed today, reduce CO2 emissions, eliminate fluorocarbon refrigerants that accelerate climate change, and improve end-user comfort with independent management of temperature and humidity. 

&#160;

Securities Purchase Agreement with Strategic Investors 

&#160;

On December 15, 2014, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the "SPA") with two investors, Hong Kong SAGE Technology Investment Co., Limited and Hong Kong JHSE Technology Investment Co., Limited, both with principal offices in Hong Kong (the "Purchasers"). Pursuant to the SPA, we sold 18 million shares of our common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "Common Stock") for $2,750,000, at approximately $0.153 per share pursuant to Regulation S. The investors were issued 18 million shares after we received all funds in the first quarter of 2015. 

&#160;

&#160; 5 

&#160; &#160;

The SPA also provided for the issuance of 20,333,334 shares of our common stock to the Purchasers for 51% of the equity of an existing company in China (the "Operating Company") upon the completion of the following conditions: (1) the Purchasers shall have capitalized the Operating Company with $3,000,000 of registered capital or a valuation of assets at or above $3,000,000; (2) the Purchasers shall have completed the legal registration of shares of the Operating Company owned by the parties with us owning 51% of the Operating Company and the Purchasers jointly, and/or by and through their respective third party designees, owning a total of 49% of the Operating Company; and (3) the Operating Company, the Purchasers and we shall have executed an HVAC Services Agreement with $60,000,000 of revenues in greater China over a three year period with such HVAC Services Agreement having standard terms and conditions acceptable to us and the Purchasers. 

&#160;

On December 7, 2015, we amended the SPA to reduce the number of shares to be issued to the Purchasers. Pursuant to terms of the Amendment, the Purchasers will receive 10 million shares of our common stock over three years as they introduce orders for $60,000,000 to a subsidiary located in China, created or acquired by us. We will own greater than 51% of such subsidiary. 

&#160;

At the end of December 2015, we reported that we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the "Exchange Agreement"), dated as of December 24, 2015 but effective as of December 1, 2015, with Open Systems Control, a California corporation (the "Shareholder"), and Synpower Corporation. Ltd., a Hong Kong corporation ("Synpower"). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, we purchased from the Shareholder all of the equity ownership in Synpower. At the time of the Exchange Agreement, Synpower was the owner of 62% of Jixiun-Cast Ltd., an engineering company organized in the People's Republic of China ("Cast"). Our plan was to use Cast for our manufacturing and distribution operations in China. On March 7, 2016, we and Synpower rescinded the Exchange Agreement, as of December 1, 2015, as a result of the discovery of an undisclosed event, not discoverable by our due diligence, related to Cast's ability to function in China as an operating entity for us. As a result of the event, the Shareholder breached the representations, warranties and covenants made by the Shareholder in the Exchange Agreement. As a result of the rescission, which was agreed to by the Shareholder, the transaction will be unwound as of December 1, 2015, we will return the equity interest in Synpower to an entity identified by the Shareholder, and the shares issued to the Shareholder will be cancelled. 

&#160;

Distribution Agreement with SoEX 

&#160;

Effective June 12, 2015, our Board of Directors ratified the termination of the Distribution Agreement, dated April 24, 2014, with SoEX (Hong Kong) Industry &#38; Investment Co., Ltd. ("Soex") as a result of a breach of the Distribution Agreement by Soex. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, Soex was required to pay us $500,000, issue us 25% of the equity of a newly-created company, Soex (Beijing) Environmental Protection Technology Company Limited and pay us royalties. Soex only paid $50,000 of the $500,000 required payments, did not issue the required equity and did not pay any required royalties. There are no early termination penalties for the termination of the Distribution Agreement. We are pursuing legal action against Soex for breach of the Distribution Agreement (see Part II, Item I, Legal Proceedings). 

&#160;

Technology 

&#160;

We use proprietary nano-technology to reformulate thermoplastic materials called polymers. Nano-technology involves studying and working with matter on an ultra-small scale. One nanometer is one-millionth of a millimeter. A single human hair is around 80,000 nanometers in width. Polymers are chemical, plastic-like compounds used in diverse products such as Dacron, Teflon, and polyurethane. A thermoplastic is a material that is plastic or deformable, melts to a liquid when heated and to a brittle, glassy state when cooled sufficiently. 

&#160;

These reformulated polymers have properties that allow them to be used in unique ways. We transform polymers from a hard, water impermeable substance into a material which water and similar liquids can, under certain conditions, diffuse (although there are no openings in the material) as molecules as opposed to liquid water. Water and similar liquids penetrate the thermoplastic material at the molecular level without oxygen and other atmospheric gases penetrating the material. It is believed this selectivity is dependent on the size and type of a particular molecule. We call this specialized material Aqualyte &#8482;. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

Products 

&#160;

Aqualyte&#8482; Membrane 

&#160;

Aqualyte &#8482; membrane is the foundation of the Dais product line. It is made from commercially available polymer resin in flake form and industrial grade solvents which are mixed together using a proprietary process involving heat, industrial equipment, and solvents. The resin and the solvents are commercially available from any number of chemical supply houses, or firms such as Dow and Kraton (formerly Shell Elastomers then part of Royal Dutch Shell). Our process changes the molecular properties of the starting polymer resins such that in their final form they selectively allow molecules through the plastic, including water molecules. 

&#160;

Currently, one vendor creates the final membrane form of Aqualyte&#8482; used in ConsERV and NanoClear. We have not sought additional vendors for this component. However, we have identified other entities making similar types of products and believe such entities and products may provide alternatives should one be required. As noted above, we are working on this project to lower our exposure as well as our costs. 

&#160;

ConsERV&#8482; 

&#160;

We continue widening the channels of commercialization for the ConsERV&#8482; product. ConsERV&#8482; is an HVAC energy conservation product which should, according to various tests, save an average of up to 30% on HVAC ventilation air operating costs, lower CO 2 emissions and allow HVAC equipment to be up to 30% smaller, reducing peak energy usage by up to 20% while simultaneously improving indoor air quality. This product makes most forms of HVAC systems operate more efficiently and results, in many cases, in energy and cost savings. ConsERV&#8482; generally attaches onto existing HVAC systems, typically in commercial buildings, to provide improved ventilation air within the structure. ConsERV pre-conditions the incoming air by passing over our nano-technology polymer which has been formed into a full enthalpy heat exchanger core. The nano-technology heat exchanger uses the stale building air that must be simultaneously exhausted to transfer heat and moisture into or out of the incoming air. For summer air conditioning, the "core" removes some of the heat and humidity from the incoming air, transferring it to the exhaust air stream thereby, under certain conditions, saving energy. For winter heating, the "core" transfers a portion of the heat and humidity into the incoming air from the exhaust air stream thereby often saving energy. 

&#160;

In addition to applications in the residential, commercial, and industrial buildings market we have been working with a major European automotive firm to bring the benefits of ConsERV &#8482; to the transportation market. Initial testing has been very encouraging. 

&#160;

Our ConsERV&#8482; product has been the primary focus of our resources and commercialization efforts. When compared to similar competitive products, we believe based on test results conducted by the Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI), a leading industry association, ConsERV&#8482; maintains an industry leading position in the management of latent heat. 

&#160;

NanoClear&#8482; - Water treatment 

&#160;

We anticipate commercially introducing the first NanoClear application which will function to remove quantities of metals, acids, salt and other impurities from various contaminated water sources to produce potable water using an environmentally friendly, low maintenance design that is competitive with industry leaders in terms of electrical consumption in the second quarter of 2016. We constructed a pilot plant commissioned in May 2013 that is installed at a local county waste water treatment facility. This site has served as a showcase for potential commercial customers as well as a test-bed for newer materials and hardware readying for commercialization. The accumulated test data, analyzed by an independent 3 rd party firm, shows the water quality of the water being produced has not diminished since system start-up. Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) measurements are holding steady at less than 10 parts per million (ppm). The experience and generated data from the pilot facility combined with manufacturing techniques and improvements pioneered by us are forming the first next generation of Aqualyte&#8482; based membrane evaporators which we are targeting to be the initial commercial product for NanoClear targeting being introduced in the first quarter of 2016. 

&#160;

We worked with partners at Dais Beijing, China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC), and the China Research Academy for the Environmental Sciences (CRAES) to build and commission a sales demonstration tool for NanoClear located in Beijing. This self-contained unit entered operation in the second quarter of 2015 and allows us to bring potential customers in one of the largest water treatment markets in the world for a sales demonstration of a fully functional, aesthetically pleasing NanoClear system. Follow up activity is ongoing to build a larger pilot installation featuring the next-generation M2 membrane evaporator as it enters service in the second half of 2016. This system is expected to be located at an industrial partner's location in or near Beijing, where it will demonstrate continuous treatment of an actual customer's wastewater with a commercially viable product that will be offered for sale.

&#160; &#160;

NanoAir&#8482; - Water-based packaged HVAC system 

&#160;

When development is completed, we expect this application will function to dehumidify and cool air in warm weather, or humidify and heat in cold weather. This NanoAir application may be capable of replacing a traditional, refrigerant- based, vapor compression heating/cooling system. We have a small prototype showing fundamental heating, cooling, humidification, and dehumidification operation of this evolving product. The NanoAir product is in the middle stage of prototype development. Since May 1, 2013, we have been working with the Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy (ARPA-E) branch of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to develop an energy-efficient dehumidification system using Aqualyte&#8482; polymer membranes to selectively transfer moisture. The first award provided up to $800,000 in federal funding to us, provided we contributed a 20% cost share toward the proposed total project cost of $1,000,000. The second award provided up to $700,000 in federal funding to us from the Building Technology Office (BTO) of the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), provided we contributed a 30% cost share toward the proposed total project cost of $1,000,000. We successfully demonstrated our major technical goals of showing membrane dehumidifier which met project targets, and are currently working with select potential OEMs and the DOE to produce a 7.5 ton roof-top unit and moving NanoAir to commercialization and revenue generation. Independently, BTO engaged Navigant Consulting to evaluate 17 alternative HVAC technologies beyond the traditional vapor compression systems. The Navigant study, "Energy Savings Potential and RD&#38;D Opportunities for Non-Vapor-Compression HVAC Technologies", was released in March 2014 and ranked NanoAir membrane heat pump technology with a composite score of 4.35 on a scale of 0 &#8211; 5, one of only two technologies to exceed the 4.0 threshold marking the technology as "Most Promising". 

&#160;

PolyCool&#8482; 

&#160;

PolyCool&#8482; is a cooling tower system where initial testing has shown it has the potential to be an effective way to keep cooling systems from spreading harmful bacteria such as Legionella. The cooling water is separated from the air stream by a solid Aqualyte&#8482; nanotechnology membrane that establishes a selective barrier allowing evaporation of water molecules while preventing transmission of microbes and other contaminants. In effect, the process water is isolated in a largely closed system similar to dry cooling technology, reducing the likelihood of dangerous germs and viruses such as Legionella becoming airborne. PolyCool&#8482; systems use less energy than a conventional cooling tower, use less water, and create less of a risk for disease. 

&#160;

NanoCap 

&#160;

Based on initial material tests conducted by two third parties, we believe that by applying a combination of our nano-materials we may be able to construct a device which stores energy as electrical charge in a device with projected increases in energy density, endurance, and usefulness relative to traditional battery technology. We project the key applications for such a device would be in transportation and/or grid energy storage. We have focused our resources on revenue producing items or uses closer to producing revenue and have not invested significant resources to date in the development of this application beyond the prototype stage. We are seeking a strategic partner for this application who has the requisite skills to complement our nanomaterial expertise in addition to having access to distribution. 

&#160;

Other 

&#160;

We have identified other potential products for our materials and processes as well as accumulating basic data to support the needed functionality and market differentiation of these products based on using our nano-technology based inventions. These other products are based, in part, upon the known functionality of our materials and processes. 

&#160;

Patents 

&#160;

We own the rights to thirteen U.S. patents, three Chinese patents, one Hong Kong patent, three U.S. patent applications, and four Patent Cooperation Treaty ("PCT") applications. National stage applications based on one of the PCT applications have resulted in a patent being issued in the U.S., China, and Hong Kong with a further application pending in Europe. National stage applications based on a second PCT application have resulted in a patent being issued in both the U.S. and China. National stage applications based on a third PCT application have resulted in the issuance of a U.S. patent with a further application pending in Hong Kong. National stage applications based on the remaining two PCT applications have resulted in the issuance of two U.S. patents. Divisional applications based on two of the above mentioned PCT applications have been filed in China and Hong Kong. In addition, we co-own one PCT application with Aegis Biosciences LLC, a biomaterials drug delivery technology company. National stage applications based on the co-owned PCT application have resulted in one U.S. patent. These patents relate to, or are applications of, our nano-structured polymer materials that perform functions such as ion exchange and modification of surface properties. The polymers are selectively permeable to polar materials, such as water, in molecular form. Selective permeability allows these materials to function as a nano-filter in various transfer applications. These materials are made from base polymer resins available from a number of commercial firms worldwide and possess what we believe to be some unique and controllable properties, such as: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Selectivity: Based on our research, we believe that when the polymer is made there are small channels created that are 5 to 30 nanometers in diameter. There are two types of these channels: hydrophilic (water permeable), and hydrophobic (water impermeable). The channels can be chemically tuned to be selective for the ions or molecules they transfer. The selectivity of the polymer can be adjusted to efficiently transfer water molecules from one face to the other using these channels. 

&#183; 

High transfer rate: Based on in-house testing protocols and related results, we have found that the channels created when casting the materials into a nano-structured membrane have a transfer rate of water, or flux, greater than 90% of an equivalent area of an open tube. This feature is fundamental to the material's ability to transfer moisture at the molecular level while substantially allowing or disallowing the transfer of certain other substances at a molecular level. 

&#183; 

Unique surface characteristic: The materials offer a surface characteristic that we believe inhibits the growth of bacteria, fungus and algae and prevents adhesives from attaching. 

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

As stated above, we own twelve U.S. patents, three Chinese patents, one Hong Kong patent and co-own one additional U.S patent.

On April 24, 2014, we entered into a Distribution Agreement (the "Distribution Agreement") with SoEX (Hong Kong) Industry &#38; Investment Co., Ltd., a Hong Kong corporation ("Soex"). The Distribution Agreement was a covenant included in a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated January 21, 2014, between us and Soex, pursuant to which Soex purchased 37,500,000 shares of our common stock, equal to approximately 31% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2015. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, in exchange for $500,000 to be paid by October 20, 2014, royalty payments and a commitment from Soex to purchase nano-material membrane and other products from us, Soex obtained the right to distribute and market our products for incorporation in energy recovery ventilators sold and installed in commercial, industrial and residential buildings, transportation facilities and vehicles (the "Field") in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan (the "Territory"). Further, Soex received an exclusive license in the Territory to use our intellectual property in the manufacture and sale of our products in the Field and Territory and to purchase its requirements of nano-material membrane only from us, subject to terms and conditions of the Distribution Agreement. During 2014, $50,000 of the $500,000 license fee was received. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, Soex was required to pay us $500,000, issue us 25% of the equity of a newly-created company, Soex (Beijing) Environmental Protection Technology Company Limited and pay us royalties. Soex only paid us $50,000 of the required $500,000, did not issue the required equity and did not pay any required royalties. Effective June 12, 2015, our Board of Directors ratified the termination of the Distribution Agreement, dated April 24, 2014, with Soex as a result of a breach of the Distribution Agreement by Soex. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, Soex was required to pay us $500,000, issue us 25% of the equity of a newly-created company, Soex (Beijing) Environmental Protection Technology Company Limited and pay us royalties. Soex only paid $50,000 of the $500,000 required payments, did not issue the required equity and did not pay any required royalties. There are no early termination penalties for the termination of the Distribution Agreement as well as the Securities Purchase Agreement that we entered into in January 2014. We are pursuing legal action against Soex for breach of the Distribution Agreement (see Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings).

Customers and Suppliers 

&#160;

We are dependent on third parties to manufacture the key components needed for our nano-structured based materials and some portion of the value added products made with these materials. Accordingly, a supplier's failure to supply components in a timely manner, or to supply components that meet our quality, quantity and cost requirements or technical specifications, or the inability to obtain alternative sources of these components on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, would create delays in production of our products and/or increase the unit costs of production. Certain of the components or the processes of our suppliers are proprietary. If we were ever required to replace any of our suppliers, we should be able to obtain comparable components from alternative suppliers at comparable costs but this would create a delay in production. 

&#160;

On October 30, 2012, the Company and MG Energy LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("MG Energy"), entered into a License and Supply Agreement, effective October 26, 2012. MG Energy entered into a sublicense with Multistack, LLC. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Multistack LLC, accounted for approximately 96% of our sales revenue. At December 31, 2015, amounts due from MultiStack LLC were approximately 61% of total accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2014, two customers, Multistack LLC and Soex, accounted for approximately 60% and 27% of our revenue, respectively. At December 31, 2014, amounts due from these customers were approximately 67% and 0%, respectively, of total accounts receivable (see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9 for a discussion of Multistack and the licensing agreement with MG Energy LLC). MG Energy will take over the manufacturing of ConsERV products for sale in North America and South America in 2016, lowering our revenue but increasing our gross margin percentage. 

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

Expenditures for research, development and engineering of products are expensed as incurred. We incurred research and development costs of $978,526 and $763,107 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We account for proceeds received from government fundings for research as a reduction in research and development costs. We recorded proceeds against research and development expenses on the Statements of Operations of $234,788 and $354,988 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

&#160;

Key Relationships 

&#160;

We have strategic relationships with leaders in the energy industry who have entered into sales, marketing, distribution and product development arrangements with us and, in some cases, hold equity in Dais Analytic Corporation. These include the relationship with MGE Energy LLC described above. 

&#160;

Sales and Marketing Strategies 

&#160;

In October of 2012, we entered into a License and Supply agreement with MGE Energy LLC, discussed above. We also have secured and continue to discuss relationships with other leading industry HVAC manufacturers, HVAC product distributors, energy service companies and ERV manufacturers outside of North and South America. In addition, we are discussing relationships for use of our ConsERV&#8482; products in other applications outside of energy recovery ventilation world-wide. 

&#160;

Our unfolding sales and marketing strategy finds us focusing on creating alliances with companies having strong, existing channel presence or expertise in the target industries, notably for ConsERV and NanoClear's M2. We intend to bring industry seasoned talent into the company at the appropriate time to further drive market development, revenue growth and guide future product feature improvement needs

Competition and Barriers to Entry 

&#160;

We believe the efficacy of our value-added products and technology has the ability to decrease sales of competing products, thus taking business away from more established firms using older technology. We believe that our ConsERV&#8482; product may become a functional component of newer, more efficient OEM products. A key challenge is to educate channel decision makers of the benefits of products made using our materials and processes to overcome the strength of the current product sales. Armed with the growing base of operational and third party data this education process will become more routine. 

&#160;

There are a number of companies located in the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia that have been developing and selling technologies and products in the energy recovery industry as listed below. We will experience significant competition regarding our products because certain competing companies possess greater financial and personal resources than us. Future product competitors include, but are not limited to: 

&#160;

Products 

Current and Future Competitors 

ConsERV 

Semco, Greenheck, Venmar, Bry-Air, dPoint, Renewaire Holtop, Hoval, Klingenberg, Solar Palau, Kraton, Daikin and AirXchange. 

NanoClear 

Dow, Dupont, Siemens, GE, Mitsubishi, Kraton and many small and regional companies using existing technologies. 

NanoAir 

AAON, Trane, Carrier, York, Haier, Mitsubishi, LG, Electrolux, Samsung, Whirlpool, Kraton and Daikin. 

NanoCap

PolyCool 

Cooling Tower Systems, Inc., Whaley Products, Evapco, Baltimore Aircoil and Paltech. Some of the large Air Conditioner manufacturing companies also produce cooling tower systems i.e. Trane and Carrier. 

&#160;

We believe that the combination of our nano-material platform's characteristics (high selectivity, high flux rate, manufacturability, et al.) and growing patent position forms competitive advantages, which may allow us time to execute our business plan. The majority of our competitors may experience barriers to entry in these markets primarily related to the lack of similarly performing proprietary materials and processes. 

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

We do not believe the sale, installation or use of our current nano-structured products will be subject to any government regulation, other than perhaps adherence to building codes and water safety regulations. We do not believe that the cost of complying with such codes and regulations, to the extent applicable to our products, will be prohibitive. 

&#160;

We do not know the extent to which any existing or new regulations may affect our ability to distribute, install and service any of our products. Once our other products reach the commercialization stage and we begin distributing them to our target markets, federal, state or local governmental entities may seek to impose regulations. 

&#160;

We are also subject to various international, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to, among other things, land use, safe working conditions, and environmental regulations regarding handling and disposal of hazardous and potentially hazardous substances and emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere. Our business may expose us to the risk of harmful substances escaping into the environment, resulting in potential personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property and natural resource damage. Depending on the nature of any claim, our current insurance policies may not adequately reimburse us for costs incurred in settling environmental damage claims and, in some instances, we may not be reimbursed at all. To date, we are not aware of any claims or liabilities under these existing laws and regulations that would materially affect our results of operations or financial condition. 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 18 employees. None of the employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. 

&#160;

Principal Offices 

&#160;

Our principal office is located at 11552 Prosperous Drive, Odessa, FL 33556.
