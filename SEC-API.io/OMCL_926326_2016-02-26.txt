 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

We are a leading provider of comprehensive automation and business analytics software solutions for patient-centric medication and supply management across the entire healthcare continuum, from the acute care hospital setting to post-acute skilled nursing and long-term care facilities to the home. More than 3,200 customers worldwide have used our Omnicell Automation and Analytics supply chain and analytics solutions to help enable them to increase operational efficiency, reduce errors, deliver actionable intelligence and improve patient safety. The recent acquisition of Aesynt Holding, L.P., Aesynt, Ltd. and Aesynt Co&#246;peratief U.A. (collectively, &#8220;Aesynt&#8221;) discussed below will add distinct product capabilities, particularly in central pharmacy and IV robotics, creating the broadest medication management product portfolio in the industry. 

Omnicell Medication Adherence solutions, including our MTS Medication Technologies, SureMed and Surgichem brands, provide innovative medication adherence packaging solutions designed to help reduce costly hospital readmissions. In addition, these solutions help enable approximately 7,000 institutional and retail pharmacies worldwide to maintain high accuracy and quality standards in medication dispensing and administration while optimizing productivity and controlling costs. 

The Institute of Medicine, a non-profit, non-governmental arm of the National Academies, published a report in 2006 that estimated that 1.5 million medication errors are made each year in the United States. The healthcare industry has become increasingly aware that human factors inevitably create the risk of medication administration errors in the course of patient care. Acute care facilities are required to adhere to medication regulatory controls that we believe cannot be adequately supported by manual tracking systems or partially automated systems. Any nursing shortages would add an additional challenge to acute care facilities to meet regulatory controls and improve patient safety while still providing adequate patient care. Non-acute care facilities face similar safety challenges. In its 2003 "Adherence to Long-Term Therapies-Evidence for Action," the World Health Organization stated, &#8220;Across diseases, adherence is the single most important modifiable factor that compromises treatment outcome.&#8221; U.S. health system thought leaders see medication adherence as a key requirement for delivering better clinical outcomes and financial results. Medication non-adherence is described as a critical problem creating approximately $290 billion in extra costs per year and resulting in approximately 125,000 deaths per year, according to a 2009 report from the New England Healthcare Institute. In addition, the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services stated in 2012 that 11% of all hospital admissions were related to medication non-adherence. 

We provide solutions to help healthcare systems and caregivers address these aforementioned needs. We believe our solutions align us with the long-term trends of the healthcare market to manage the health of patients across the continuum of care, and that our patient-centric medication and supply management solutions help improve workflow efficiencies and patient outcomes. 

Operating Segments and Products 

Our business is organized into two operating segments distinguished by products based on customer needs. The two operating segments are Automation and Analytics, and Medication Adherence. 

Automation and Analytics 

The Automation and Analytics segment is organized around the design, manufacturing, selling and servicing of medication and supply dispensing systems, pharmacy inventory management systems, and related software. Our Automation and Analytics products are designed to enable our customers to enhance and improve the effectiveness of the medication-use process, the efficiency of the medical-surgical supply chain, overall patient care and clinical and financial outcomes of medical facilities. Through modular configuration and upgrades, our systems can be tailored to specific customer needs. 

Medication Adherence 

The Medication Adherence segment primarily includes the development, manufacturing and selling of consumable medication blister cards, packaging equipment and ancillary products and services. These products are used to manage medication administration outside of the hospital setting and include medication adherence products sold under the brand name MTS, Surgichem, SureMed and the Omnicell brand. MTS products consist of proprietary medication packaging systems and related products for use by institutional pharmacies servicing long-term care and correctional facilities or retail pharmacies serving patients in their local communities. Similarly, Surgichem is a provider of medication adherence packaging systems and solutions to the United Kingdom community and home care markets.

We have developed or acquired numerous technologies that provide long-term solutions for our customers. Our own product development activities have brought a number of innovative and proprietary products to the market. Our fourth-generation Omnicell G4 hardware solutions on the Unity platform decrease the risk of human error and save significant pharmacy time by eliminating the need for repetitive entry of drug formularies in multiple systems. The Unity G4 platform is designed to help our customers closely manage medication and supply inventory to reduce costs, comply with increasingly stringent regulatory requirements and safeguard the patient. 

Acquisitions 

In addition to our own development, we have acquired products that extend patient safety controls to a wider range of applications and departments in and out of the hospital. Our recent acquisitions include MTS Medication Technologies in 2012, Surgichem Limited, ("Surgichem") in 2014, and Mach4 Automatisierungstechnik GmbH (&#8220;Mach4&#8221;) and Avantec Healthcare Limited (&#8220;Avantec&#8221;) in 2015. MTS Medication Technologies extended our product line to include solutions for Medication Adherence customers, Surgichem is a provider of medication adherence products in the United Kingdom, Mach4 develops 

automated medication management systems to retail and hospital pharmacy customers primarily in Europe, with additional installations in China, the Middle East and Latin America, and Avantec is a distributor of medication and supply automation configurations of our products suited to the United Kingdom marketplace, and has been the exclusive United Kingdom distributor for our medication and supply automation solutions since 2005. 

On January 5, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Aesynt, a leader in central pharmacy robotics and IV compounding automation, which are two product areas where we had little or no market penetration prior to the acquisition. Adding these two solution sets to the Omnicell portfolio is intended to give the combined companies the one of the most complete medication management offering in the industry. We will now be able to support customers who desire a centralized cartfill or nurse server medication distribution model all the way to fully decentralized dispensing and hybrid combinations along that continuum. We will also be able to offer solutions for IV preparations, including oncology drugs, which is an area where our combined customers have expressed significant interest. In addition, Aesynt has an experienced and skilled workforce whose expertise complements our capabilities. Integrating our two product development groups is expected to lead to innovation and the opportunity to help accelerate innovation. Finally, Aesynt has over 1,200 hospital customers with limited overlap with the existing Omnicell installed base. 

Industry Background 

The delivery of healthcare in the United States still relies on a significant number of manual and paper-based processes. Most hospitals have deployed at least some automation solutions, but few have deployed them throughout the entire institution or system. The use of manual and paper-based systems in many hospital departments today results in highly complex and inefficient processes for tracking and delivering medications and supplies. In addition, many existing healthcare information systems are unable to support the modernization of healthcare delivery processes or address mandated patient safety initiatives. These factors contribute to medical errors and unnecessary process costs across the healthcare sector. 

Healthcare providers and facilities are affected by significant economic pressures. Rising costs of labor, prescription drugs and new medical technology all contribute to increased spending. Governmental pressures surrounding healthcare reform have led to increased scrutiny of the cost and efficiency with which healthcare providers deliver their services. These factors, combined with the continuing consolidation in the healthcare industry, have increased the need for the efficient delivery of healthcare in order to control costs. 

Our Automation and Analytics products are sold worldwide to a wide variety of healthcare institutions, but most of our sales are to acute care hospital customers in the United States. The U.S. acute care hospital market is comprised of approximately 6,500 hospitals and other facilities with a total capacity of approximately 953,000 acute care beds. We currently serve approximately 2,950 hospitals and other facilities with total capacity of more than approximately 478,000 beds. Our customers include single location community hospitals, government hospitals and regional and national hospital systems. 

We also sell our Automation and Analytics products directly to non-acute care providers, which include all healthcare facilities that are not hospitals, and to organizations that supply non-acute care providers. We estimate there are approximately 50,000 facilities in the United States that could use our Automation and Analytics products and few of them use our solutions at this time. 

Outside the United States, healthcare providers are increasingly aware of the benefits of automation. Many governmental and private entities look to the progress made over the last several years in the United States and are starting to invest significantly in information technology and automation. The 2014 BCC Research report states that worldwide inpatient pharmacy automation revenue growth in our industry is expected to be 8.5% between 2013 and 2018. We sell our Automation and Analytics products in a variety of countries, but to date we have focused our sales efforts in Canada, the United Kingdom, China, and the Middle East region. Our international customer base includes nearly 300 customers that utilize our automation and analytics products. 

We primarily sell our Medication Adherence products to institutional and retail pharmacies. In the United States, where approximately 67% of our Medication Adherence business occurs, the market is comprised of approximately 4,000 institutional pharmacies operated by approximately 1,500 companies that service over approximately 50,000 long-term care facilities. According to IMS Healthcare, Inc. ("IMS"), an independent third party provider of information to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry, pharmaceutical sales are expected to grow approximately 1% to 4% annually through 2016. IMS expects that certain sectors of the market, such as biotechnology and other specialty and generic pharmaceuticals, will grow faster than the overall market which suggests opportunities for the market in which we operate. In addition to medication control at long-term care facilities, our multi-medication products provide packaging that simplifies the process for individuals providing self-care to track and administer medications. 

Key Industry Events and Reports 

Reports by the Institute of Medicine, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and The Joint Commission have increased awareness of the adverse impacts of medication errors. Regulatory standards and industry guidelines, such as those published by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, as well as the desire of healthcare organizations to improve quality and avoid liability, have driven acute care facilities to prioritize investment in capital equipment, including automated medication dispensing cabinets, which are a standard of care, to improve patient safety. Such reports and regulatory standards include the following: 

&#8226; 

In 2012, The Joint Commission updated its medication management standards which includes the requirement that medication storage is designed to assist in maintaining medication integrity, promote the availability of medications when needed, minimize the risk of medication diversion, and reduce potential dispensing errors. 

&#8226; 

In 2010, the FDA updated its guidance that requires linear bar codes on most prescription drugs. Drug manufacturers, re-packagers, re-labelers and private label distributors are subject to the rule. The FDA estimated that the bar code rule, once implemented, would result in a 50% reduction in medication errors, 500,000 fewer adverse drug events over the subsequent 20 years, $93 billion in cost savings and other economic benefits. 

&#8226; 

In 2002, The Joint Commission established the National Patient Safety Goals ("NPSG") program. In 2010, NPSG 03.04.01, National Patient Safety Goal on Labeling Medications, required the labeling of all medications, medication containers (syringes, medicine cups, basins, etc.) and other solutions on and off the sterile field in perioperative and other procedural setting. 

Leading academic medical centers are among those customers benefiting from our technologies, and our customers include 10 of the 15 U.S. News &#38; World Report Honor Roll of Best Hospitals 2015-2016. 

Medication non-adherence is extremely common. According to research by Osterberg and Blaschke published in the New England Journal of Medicine, more than half of the 3.2 billion prescriptions dispensed annually in the United States are not taken as prescribed, and according to numerous studies, the same non-adherence rate exists for chronic disease medications. Poor adherence results in significant morbidity, mortality and avoidable healthcare costs. The New England Healthcare Institute estimated in 2010 that medication non-adherence was the major driver of $300 billion per year in avoidable healthcare costs, equivalent to 13% of total national health expenditures. 

Medication adherence can be improved through attitudinal and behavioral changes, which pharmacists can encourage and help facilitate by providing interventional support, including adherence tools, such as blister cards. A 2011 study by CVS Caremark published in Health Affairs concluded that the medical cost per patient with chronic vascular disease was $13,000 to $39,000, annually, and patients who take medications as directed by physicians experienced medical savings ranging from $1,900 to $8,900, annually. The study also found that these patients experienced fewer emergency room visits and inpatient hospital stays. 

Healthcare Reform 

The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act ("ARRA") which provides for, among other things, the funding of incentives for healthcare organizations to implement Electronic Healthcare Records ("EHR"). ARRA established minimal requirements for electronic healthcare record usage and provides incentives for electronic healthcare record adoption through 2015 and penalties for non-adoption after 2015. In 2010, the U.S. Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ("PPACA"), which prescribes broad-based measures designed to provide healthcare to a greater percentage of the population. We believe that both the ARRA and the PPACA will drive the need for increased efficiency in order to provide high-quality healthcare at the lowest possible cost. 

We believe our products assist healthcare organizations augment their investments in EHR implementation and integration by allowing them to reduce process steps, eliminate manual tracking and waste, enable population-level performance insights, track quality levels and reduce errors that result in unnecessary cost. Our Unity G4 platform includes an automated dispensing system that is Modular EHR stage 2 certified and works with all "hospital information system vendors," as defined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. Our Pandora Healthcare Data Analytics solution provides enterprise-level insights that can assist in monitoring hospital performance and quality of care. In addition, with our recent acquisition of Aesynt, the solutions provided by the Enterprise Medication Manager software products give the customer the power to optimize the pharmacy supply chain with tools that help manage their inventory and minimize the cost of expiring medications. 

Automation and Analytics Products and Services &#32; 

Our Automation and Analytics products are designed to enable our customers to enhance and improve the effectiveness of the medication-use process, the efficiency of the medical-surgical supply chain, overall patient care and clinical and financial outcomes of medical facilities. Through modular configuration and upgrades, our systems can be tailored to specific customer needs. From the point at which a medication arrives at the hospital receiving dock until the time it is administered to the patient, our systems are capable of storing, packaging, bar coding, ordering and issuing the medication, as well as providing information and controls on its use and reorder. Our medication-use product line includes systems for medication dispensing in acute care nursing departments, central pharmacy automation, physician order management and nursing workflow automation at the bedside. Our supply product lines provide healthcare facilities with cost data that enables detailed quantification of charges for payer reimbursement, inventory management, implant monitoring and the timely reordering of supplies.

Medication Adherence Products and Services &#32; 

We offer solutions to assist institutional and retail pharmacies in packaging medication for patient use in care environments where there is a caregiver present and for environments where the patient cares for him or herself. 

For environments where a caregiver is present, institutional and retail pharmacies use our solutions for packaging medications into adherence packages that contain a 14 to 90 day supply of a specific single medication. The blister cards may be pre-packaged ahead of time and placed into inventory until needed to fill a specific patient order, or on-demand, where individual patient medication orders are packaged and labeled by an automated robotic system. Our solutions range from manual sealers to fully automated packaging machines, embedded software, and the consumable packages used in these machines. We have packaging solutions to improve patient safety and economics for any size pharmacy operation by increasing pharmacy output and improving dispensing accuracy. 

For environments where a patient cares for him or herself, retail pharmacies use our solutions for packaging medications into adherence packages that contain all of the patient's medications into one seven-day package. These products are primarily used in community-based pharmacies to assist in organizing complex medication regimens into a simple-to-use solution that enhances medication adherence. Multi-medication packages are arranged so that all the medications for a single dosing time are contained in one blister, eliminating confusion for the patient and providing the caregivers increased assurance that medications are taken in the right sequence. Our solutions include automated packaging machines that package patient specific medications, the software that runs these machines and the consumable packages used in these machines. 

In addition to packaging solutions, we sell specially configured versions of our OmniRx medication dispensing machines to institutional pharmacies, which they place in long-term care facilities to manage narcotics, first doses and medications needed quickly. 

Single Medication Products For Use Where A Caregiver Is Present 

Pharmacy Sealers for Medication Packaging 

Our heat-sealed blister cards require a sealer to create an impermeable barrier. By using specially designed equipment to control heat, time and pressure, the institutional pharmacy serving the long-term care patients is able to create a quality seal on every package, providing a secure barrier to moisture and gases. Within this range of equipment is a sealing solution suited for almost any pharmacy, from a low volume manual blister card sealer to a high volume, all electric heat sealer with programmable computer logic. 

&#8226; 

The SureSeal &#32;is a programmable, manual sealer using heat and pressure. It is designed as a cost effective, entry level sealer for low volume sealing of medication blister cards. 

&#8226; 

The Autobond &#32;is a programmable, semi-automated heat and pressure sealer operating off of electricity and compressed air. Autobond provides temperature and time controls for a consistent quality sealing. 

&#8226; 

The AutoGen &#32;is a programmable, semi-automated heat and pressure sealer operating off of electricity only. 

&#8226; 

The Gemini &#32;is a compact all-electric heat and pressure sealer. 

Automated Fillers 

Our semi-automated filling equipment is designed specifically for the long-term care institutional pharmacy with enough order volume to warrant pre-packaging frequently-used medications into blister packs to keep in inventory awaiting a patient order. This packaging equipment elevates pre-packaging to a higher level of efficiency, resulting in higher accuracy and increased production levels. The systems combine both automated filling and sealing capabilities into one machine. 

&#8226; 

The MTS-350 &#32;is a tabletop machine capable of filling a wide range of medications and features an ergonomic design and easy-to-use controls. The MTS-350 provides a semi-automated mechanism for filling blister cards and a sealer using compressed air and heat. 

&#8226; 

The &#32;MTS-400 is &#32; ergonomically designed for high pre-pack volume for the medium to large pharmacy. The MTS-400 provides a portable workstation with built-in compressor and storage so as not to take up valuable counter space. Fully configured, the MTS-400 allows a single operator to perform the functions of filling, inspection, sealing and labeling simultaneously. 

&#8226; 

The &#32;MTS-500 &#32; is designed for high-volume to automate pre-packaging and labeling in the pharmacy and is capable of producing up to 960 pre-packaged blister cards per hour. It includes an integrated label applicator and conveyor to optimize output. 

Pharmacy Automation Systems 

Our OnDemand automated solutions are designed to meet the broad needs of pharmacies to package individual patient medication orders accurately and efficiently into multiple medication adherence packaging. These machines interface with pharmacy information systems to obtain prescription information to provide patient specific adherence packaging. Our current line of OnDemand machines includes the following products: 

&#8226; 

AccuFlex uses robotic technology to accurately and efficiently fill a variety of single-dose medication dispensing systems. 

&#8226; 

OnDemand Express II &#32; optimizes robotic technology for very high-speed and accurate fulfillment of single-dose blister cards and reclaimable packaging. 

Single Medication Blister Cards 

We offer a wide variety of heat seal and cold seal blister cards. Heat Seal Blister Cards come in a variety of formats that will fit various packaging requirements and require a heat sealer such as the MTS Autobond. Blister cards come in a variety of configurations, from 14 to 90 day doses. Heat seal cards provide a stronger seal than cold seal cards, helping pharmacists ensure consistency of the medication under nearly any environmental condition. Cold Seal Cards, also known as pressure sensitive cards, are both efficient and reliable and do not require heat sealing equipment to be sealed. They are ideal 

for emergency orders, for heat sensitive medications or when the use of a heat sealer is not practical. Cold seal blister cards come in a variety of configurations, from 14 to 90 day doses. 

Pharmacy Printing and Labeling Solutions 

Pharmacy labeling is an important part of the packaging process to ensure the right medication is packaged and delivered to the right facility and, ultimately, the right patient. Drug specific, bar code scannable labels are affixed on many different types of packages prior to them being dispensed. 

We provide a Windows-based computer program that uses an extensive drug image database to produce a wide variety of medication labels on multiple printers. We also provide printers and related consumables. 

MultiMedication Solutions For Use Where Patients Care For Themselves 

Pharmacy Automation Systems 

Our OnDemand and M-series automated solutions are designed to meet the broad needs of pharmacies to package individual patient medication orders accurately and efficiently into multimed adherence packaging. These machines interface with pharmacy information systems to obtain prescription information to provide patient-specific adherence packaging. Our current line of automation for multimedication includes the following products: 

&#8226; 

OnDemand 400 &#32; is an automation system for multi-medication adherence packaging. The OnDemand 400 receives patient prescriptions, constructs a filling map, fills multiple medication prescriptions into a single blister card from an on-line array of 40 medications stored in specially calibrated dispensing canisters, prints a label and provides an operator a sealing station. 

&#8226; 

M5000 is a fully automated system designed specifically for multi-medication adherence packaging. The M5000 receives patient prescriptions, constructs a filling map, then uses robotic technology that fills, seals and labels the package. The M5000 minimizes human activity in the multi-medication packaging process, thus reducing opportunity for errors. 

MultiMedication Blister Cards 

We offer a wide variety of heat seal and cold seal multi-medication blister cards, including products from our acquisition of Surgichem in August 2014. Multi-medication cards allow the packaging of multiple drugs into a single blister cavity representing a specific dosing time. Multi-medication cards are sold in a variety of formats to fit the needs of pharmacists and patients, with the most common format providing four dosing times for each of seven days in one package. Multi-medication adherence packages may be assembled by pharmacists by hand, or by using our pharmacy automation systems described above. 

Medication Management Solutions &#32; 

Medication management systems are becoming an integral part of long-term care facilities to manage narcotics, first doses and emergency medications. Currently, most facilities rely on manual systems that do not provide the level of security, accountability and efficiencies that are attainable with the use of automation. When automation is implemented, pharmacies benefit by helping their customer facilities meet regulatory requirements and improve the response time. Patients benefit by having access to medications immediately with minimized medication errors. We offer specialized versions of the OmniRx medication control solution that is used by institutional pharmacies to provide their customers with secure medication management of narcotics, emergency medication, and first doses. 

Sales and Distribution 

We sell our Automation and Analytics and Medication Adherence solutions primarily in the United States and Canada. Approximately 85% &#32;of our product revenue was generated in those markets for the year ended December 31, 2015. No single customer accounted for greater than 10% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Our sales force is organized by geographic region in the United States and Canada where our sales are primarily made direct to end user customers with the exception of some distribution of Medication Adherence consumables. Outside the United States and Canada, we field a direct sales force for Medication Adherence products in the United Kingdom and Germany. For other geographies we generally sell through distributors and resellers. Our foreign operations are discussed in Note 12, Segment and Geographical Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this annual report. Our combined direct, corporate and international distribution sales teams consisted of approximately 231 staff members as of December 31, 2015. Nearly all of our direct sales team members have hospital capital equipment or clinical systems experience. Our sales 

representatives are generally organized to sell either the Automation and Analytics or Medication Adherence product lines. Our corporate sales team focuses on large IDNs, group purchasing organizations ("GPOs"), and the U.S. government. 

The sales cycle for our automation systems is long and can take in excess of 12-24 months. This is due in part to the cost of our systems and the number of people within each healthcare facility involved in the purchasing decision. To initiate the selling process, the sales representative generally targets the director of pharmacy, the director of nursing, the director of materials management or other decision makers and is responsible for educating each group within the healthcare facility about the economic safety and compliance benefits of our solutions relative to competing methods of managing medications or medical and surgical supplies. 

We have contracts with GPOs that enable us to sell our automation systems to GPO&#8209;member healthcare facilities. The primary advantage to customers who buy our products pursuant to a GPO agreement is that they benefit from pre-negotiated contract terms and pricing. The benefit to the GPO is the fee earned as a percentage of sales, which is paid by us. These GPO contracts are typically for multiple years with options to renew or extend for up to two years and some of which can be terminated by either party at any time. Our current GPO contracts include Amerinet, Inc., Federal Supply Schedule, First Choice Management Services, Healthcare Purchasing Alliance, LLC, HealthTrust Purchasing Group, L.P., Magnet, MedAssets Performance Management Solutions, Novation LLC, Premier Healthcare Alliance, L.P. and Resource Optimization &#38; Innovation, LLC. We have also contracted with the U.S. General Services Administration, allowing the Department of Veteran Affairs, the Department of Defense and other Federal Government customers to purchase or lease our products. 

We offer multi-year, non-cancelable lease payment terms to assist healthcare organizations in purchasing our systems by reducing their cash flow requirements. We sell the majority of our multi-year lease receivables to third&#8209;party leasing finance companies, but we also maintain a certain portion of our leases in-house. 

Our field operations representatives support our sales force by providing operational and clinical expertise prior to the close of a sale and during installation of our automation systems. This group assists the customer with the technical implementation of our automation systems, including configuring our systems to address the specific needs of each individual customer. After the systems are installed, on-site support is provided by our field service team and technical support group. 

We offer telephone technical support through our technical support centers in Illinois and Florida. Our support centers are staffed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. We have found that a majority of our customers' service issues can be addressed either over the phone or by our support center personnel using their on-hand remote diagnostics tools. In addition, we use remote dial-in software that monitors customer conditions on a daily basis. We offer a suite of remote monitoring features, which proactively monitors system status and alerts service personnel to potential problems before they lead to system failure. 

In addition, our international sales team handles direct sales to non-acute healthcare facilities in the United Kingdom and Germany, and handles sales, installation and service to non-acute healthcare facilities through distribution partners in other parts of Europe, Asia, Australia, the Middle East, South Africa, and South America. Our international sales team handles sales, installation and service to all Automation and Analytics customers outside the U.S. and Canada through distribution partners. Our products are available in a variety of languages including Mandarin, French, Spanish and German. 

We have not sold and have no future plans to sell our products either directly or indirectly to customers located in countries that are identified as state sponsors of terrorism by the U.S. Department of State, or those subject to economic sanctions and export controls. 

Manufacturing and Inventory 

The manufacturing process for our Automation and Analytics products allows us to configure hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer needs. The Automation and Analytics product manufacturing process primarily consists of the final assembly of components and testing of the completed product. Many of the subassemblies and components we use are provided by third-party contract manufacturers or other suppliers. We and our partners test these subassemblies and perform inspections to assure the quality and reliability of our products. While many components of our systems are standardized and available from multiple sources, certain components or subsystems are fabricated by a sole supplier according to our specifications and schedule requirements. Our Medication Adherence product manufacturing process consists of fabrication and assembly of equipment and mechanized process manufacturing of consumables. 

Our arrangements with our contract manufacturers generally set forth quality, cost and delivery requirements, as well as manufacturing process terms, such as continuity of supply, inventory management, capacity flexibility, quality and cost management, oversight of manufacturing and conditions for the use of our intellectual property. 

Our manufacturing organization procures components and schedules production based on the backlog of customer orders. Installation of equipment and software typically occurs between two weeks and twelve months after the initial order is received, depending upon the customer's particular needs. We deploy a key operational strategy of operating with backlog levels that approximate the average installation cycle of our customers, which allows us to more efficiently manage our installation teams, improve production efficiencies, reduce inventory scrap and lower shipping costs. Shipment of consumables typically occurs between one and fourteen days after an order is received. 

Competition 

The medication management and supply chain solutions market is intensely competitive. We compete directly with a number of companies and are affected by evolving and new technologies, changes in industry standards and dynamic customer requirements. 

Our current direct competitors in the medication management and supply chain solutions market include Becton Dickinson/CareFusion Corporation, ARxIUM (through its acquisition of MedSelect, Inc. and Automed), Cerner Corporation, Talyst, Inc., Emerson Electronic Co. (through its acquisition of medDispense, L.P.), Swisslog Holding AG (which was acquired by KUKA), WaveMark Inc., ParExcellence Systems, Inc., Vanas N.V., Infor (formally Lawson Software, Inc.), Willach Pharmacy Solutions, DIH Technologies Co., Yuyama Co., Ltd, Robopharma B.V., Apostore GmbH, KlS Steuerungstechnik GmbH and Suzhou Iron Technology (China). Our current direct competitors in the medication packaging solutions market include Drug Package, Inc., AutoMed Technologies, Inc. (a subsidiary of ARxIUM), Manchac Technologies, LLC (through its Dosis product line) and RX Systems, Inc. in the United States, and Jones Packaging Ltd., Synergy Medical Systems, Manrex Ltd, Global Factories and WebsterCare outside the United States. 

We believe our products and services compare favorably with the offerings of our competitors, particularly with respect to proprietary technological advancements, system performance, system reliability, installation, applications training, service response time and service repair quality. 

Intellectual Property and Proprietary Technology 

We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights. 

We pursue patent protection in the United States and foreign jurisdictions for technology that we believe to be proprietary and that offers a potential competitive advantage for our products. Our issued patents relate to, among other things, the use of locking and sensing lids with pharmacy drawers and the methods of restocking these drawers, and the use of guiding lights in the open matrix, locking lid and sensing lid pharmacy drawers. These patents also apply to our unit-dose mechanism and methods, the single-dose dispensing mechanism, the methods for restocking the single-dose drawers using exchange liners, certain methods for loading and unloading mobile carts, the method of use of scanners with a mobile cart, and certain methods for using radio frequency tags with storage items. Our patents expire at various times between 2016 and 2033. 

All of our product system software is copyrighted and subject to the protection of applicable copyright laws. We intend to seek additional international and U.S. patents on our technology and to seek registration of our trademarks. We have obtained registration of Omnicell, the Omnicell logo, OmniRx, OmniCenter, OmniSupplier, OmniBuyer, SafetyStock, eMTS Medication Technologies, the MTS Medication Technologies logo, easy Blist, Medlocker, AccuFlex, Pandora, OnDemand, RxMap, Suremed and OnDemand400 for RxMap. Trade secrets and other confidential information are also important to our business. We protect our trade secrets through a combination of contractual restrictions and confidentiality and licensing agreements. 

Research and Development 

We use industry standard operating systems and databases, but generally develop our own application and interface software in our research and development facilities. New product development projects are prioritized based on customer input. Research and development takes place in Mountain View, California, Nashville, Tennessee, St. Petersburg, Florida and Bejing, China. Research and development expenses were $35.2 million , $27.8 million &#32;and $29.1 million &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

Employees 

We had a total of 1,451 &#32;employees as of December 31, 2015. We have rebalanced our staff as needed, at times eliminating some functional positions and at other times adding new functional&#8209;specific positions to meet the evolving needs of our marketplace while controlling costs. To our knowledge, none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, nor have we experienced any work stoppage. We believe that our employee relations are good. 

Business Under Government Contracts 

A number of our U.S. government&#8209;owned or government-run hospital customers sign five-year leases, with payment terms that are subject to one-year government budget funding cycles. Failure of any of our U.S. government customers to receive their annual funding could impair our ability to sell to these customers, or to collect payments on our existing unsold leases. For additional information regarding these leases, see the section entitled "Risk Factors" under Part I, Item 1A below. 

Financing Practices Relating to Working Capital 

We assist healthcare facilities in financing their cash outlay requirements for the purchase of our systems by offering multi-year, non-cancelable sales contracts. For additional information regarding these financing activities, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report. 

Product Backlog 

Product backlog is the dollar amount of medication and supply dispensing systems for which we have purchase orders from our customers and for which we believe we will install, bill and gain customer acceptance within one year. Due to industry practice that allows customers to change order configurations with limited advance notice prior to shipment and occasional customer changes in installation schedules, we do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is necessarily indicative of future sales. However, we do believe that backlog is an indication of a customer's willingness to install our solutions. Our backlog was $204.7 million &#32;and $187.7 million as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.
