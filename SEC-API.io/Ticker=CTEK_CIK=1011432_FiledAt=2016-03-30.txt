Background

&#160;

Auxilio, Inc., a Nevada corporation, was incorporated on August 29, 1995. On April 1, 2004, we acquired Alan Mayo and Associates, Inc. dba The Mayo Group ("TMG"), a managed print company. TMG provided outsourced print management services to healthcare facilities throughout California, which services we provide as the successor-in-interest to TMG. After we acquired TMG, we changed our name to "Auxilio, Inc." and changed the name of TMG's former subsidiary to "Auxilio Solutions, Inc." Effective July 1, 2014, we acquired Delphiis, Inc., a California corporation, which provides IT security consulting services. On April 7, 2015, we acquired certain assets of Redspin, Inc. which provides IT security consulting services. Our Common Stock currently trades on the OTCQB under the symbol "AUXO."

Principal Products and Services

&#160;

We are engaged in the business of providing fully-outsourced managed print services and IT security consulting services primarily to the healthcare industry, and also to financial institutions, gaming and other industries. Our business is operated throughout the United States.

&#160;

Our managed print service group provides workflow solutions, and is a risk-free program with guaranteed savings. We assume all costs related to print environments through customized streamlined and seamless integration of services at predictable fixed rates. Our on-site staff creates manageable, dependable print management programs by managing the back-office processes of our hospital clients. The process is initiated through a detailed proprietary assessment. The assessment is a strategic, operational and financial analysis that is performed at the customer's premises using a combination of proprietary processes and innovative technology for data collection and report generation. After the assessment and upon engagement, we charge the customer on a per print basis. This charge covers the entire print management process and includes placement of a highly trained on-site resident team.

&#160;

Our data security group is built on four pillars to serve the most common security needs in healthcare: Security Process and Program Development, Regulatory and Penetration Assessments, Incident and Breach Response and Delphiis&#8482; IT Risk Manager SaaS Solution. Through our proven and prescriptive methodology we help build the foundation needed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and security of patient health information (PHI). And our software application suite streamlines how hospitals and health systems perform annual and on-going risk assessments on their business associates, clinics, projects and hospitals.

&#160;

Competition

&#160;

We operate in a highly competitive market. The majority of the competition in the healthcare industry market for print management services comes from the large photocopy/multi-functional digital device manufacturers such as Xerox, Canon, Konica Minolta, Ricoh and Sharp. The competitive landscape also contains a number of regional and local equipment dealers and distributors that exist in the communities in which the hospitals serve. In addition, we compete with in-house departments performing the functions that we are seeking to have them outsource to us.

&#160;

The majority of the competition in the healthcare industry market for data security services comes from large or niche consulting and technology firms such as Accenture, Leidos Health, Dell Secureworks, Accuvant, and Coal Fire.

&#160;

Nevertheless, our analysis of the competitive landscape shows a very strong opportunity for fully-outsourced managed print services and data security services to the healthcare industry, and we believe that we have a strong competitive position in the marketplace due to a number of important factors:

&#160;

&#183; We are primarily focused on the healthcare industry. We are not aware of any other vendor/service provider which has a majority of its business dedicated to solving issues within the healthcare provider industry with the expertise and knowledge base that we have. This is unmatched in the market. 

&#160;

&#183; By focusing solely on the hospital campus, we enjoy much lower turn-around times for service, greater up-sell opportunities and a much deeper service relationship with the customer. 

&#160;

&#183; We have technology that is revolutionizing the way in which healthcare providers perform their annual HIPAA analysis, regulatory and on-going risk assessments, by making it fast, effective and affordable for both the assessor and responder. 

&#160;

&#183; We believe that we are the only provider offering a unique approach to managed security services. We can deploy a knowledgeable resource allocated 100% to perform a predefined security role on-site or virtually for a defined amount of time, which results in hospital gaining the staff with expertise they need. 

&#160;

&#183; We have a unique approach to providing fully-outsourced managed print service programs. Our program is completely outsourced and hospitals need only pay a single invoice. We operate the print management process as a department in the hospital with full-time staff on-site. In contrast, other print vendors and dealers in the majority of instances do not provide full-time staff on-site, which results in delays in providing service and supplies to the hospitals. 

&#160;

&#183; We are not restricted to any single equipment vendor, which allows us to bring the best printer and copier hardware and software solutions to our customers. Our approach is to use the most appropriate technology to provide a superior solution without any prejudice as to equipment. 

&#160;

&#183; We maintain a daily connection with the hospital, which allows us to provide a detailed strategy and plan on printer and copier equipment acquisitions saving the organization a great deal of time, effort and money in this process. 

&#160;

Customers

&#160;

The majority of our customers are hospitals and their related off-site facilities. The loss of any key customer could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, business, prospects and results of operation. During the year ended December 31, 2015, our three largest customers represented approximately 50% of our revenues.

&#160;

Intellectual Property

&#160;

We maintain a database that contains our managed print services customers' image and document outputs for certain periods of time, for each piece of machinery maintained at the customer's location and trends for each of the foregoing. Our database allows us to anticipate our customers' future needs and to meet those needs. In addition, we maintain a database that contains information related to our current security customers and their assigned responders who use our Delphiis&#8482; IT Risk Manager application suite.

&#160;

We have a patent pending for our Delphiis&#8482; IT Risk Manager and have not applied or been granted a patent with respect to any managed print service technology, or processes, as related to document and image management.

&#160;

Employees

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had 291 full-time employees and three part-time employees, including 252 employees engaged in providing services, 14 employees engaged in sales and marketing, and 22 employees engaged in general and administrative activities. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe our employee relations are good.
