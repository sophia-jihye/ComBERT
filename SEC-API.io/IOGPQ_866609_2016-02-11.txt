 Item 1. Business 

ION is a Delaware corporation. Our predecessor entity was incorporated in 1979. We are a global, technology-focused company that provides geoscience technology, services and solutions to the global oil and gas industry. Our offerings are designed to allow oil and gas exploration and production (&#8220;E&#38;P&#8221;) companies to obtain higher resolution images of the Earth&#8217;s subsurface during E&#38;P operations to reduce their risk in exploration and reservoir development. We acquire, process and interpret seismic data from seismic surveys in regional data programs, which then become part of our multi-client data library. The seismic surveys for our data library business are pre-funded, or underwritten, in part by our customers, and, with the exception of our ocean bottom seismic (&#8220;OBS&#8221;) data acquisition company, OceanGeo B.V. (&#8220;OceanGeo&#8221;), we contract with third party seismic data acquisition companies to shoot and acquire the seismic data, all of which is intended to minimize our risk exposure. We serve customers in most major energy producing regions of the world from strategically located offices in 27 &#32;cities on six &#32;continents. 

Seismic imaging plays a fundamental role in hydrocarbon exploration and reservoir development by delineating structures, rock types and fluid locations in the subsurface. Our technologies, services and solutions are used by E&#38;P companies to generate high-resolution images of the Earth&#8217;s subsurface to identify sources of hydrocarbons and pinpoint drilling locations for wells, which can be costly and involve high risk. 

We provide our services and products through four business segments &#8211; Solutions, Systems, Software and Ocean Bottom Services. Our Ocean Bottom Services segment is comprised of OceanGeo, in which we increased our ownership from 30% to 100% in 2014. In addition, we have a 49% ownership interest in our INOVA Geophysical Equipment Limited joint venture (&#8220;INOVA Geophysical,&#8221; or &#8220;INOVA&#8221;). 

For decades we have been engaged in providing innovative seismic data acquisition technology, such as multicomponent imaging with VectorSeis &#174; &#32;products, the ability to record seismic data from basins that underlie ice fields in polar regions, and cableless seismic techniques. The advanced technologies we currently offer include our Orca &#174; &#32;and Gator &#174; &#32;command and control software systems, WiBand &#174; &#32;broadband data processing technology, Calypso &#174; &#32;OBS acquisition system, Narwhal&#8482; (software system) for ice management, and other technologies, each of which is designed to deliver improvements in both image quality and productivity. In 2015, we completed field testing of our Marlin&#8482; solution for optimizing simultaneous operations during marine seismic data acquisition. We have over 500 patents and pending patent applications in various countries around the world. Approximately 50% &#32;of our employees are involved in technical roles and over 26% &#32;of our employees have advanced degrees. 

Solutions. Our Solutions business provides two distinct service activities that often work together. 

Our Ventures group (formerly known as our GeoVentures &#174; &#32;group) provides services designed to manage the entire seismic process, from survey planning and design to data acquisition and management, to final subsurface imaging and reservoir characterization. Our Ventures group focuses on the technologically intensive components of the image development process, such as survey planning and design, and data processing and interpretation, outsourcing the logistics components (such as field acquisition) to experienced seismic and other geophysical contractors. 

Our Imaging Services group (formerly known as our GX Technology (GXT) group) offers data processing and imaging services designed to help our E&#38;P customers reduce exploration and production risk, evaluate and develop reservoirs, and increase production. This group develops a series of subsurface images by applying its processing technology to data owned or licensed by its customers. We maintain more than 15 petabytes of seismic data digital information storage in 4 global data centers, including two core data centers located in Houston and in the U.K. 

&#32; 

Our Solutions business focuses on providing services and products for challenging environments, such as the Arctic frontier; complex and hard-to-image geologies, such as deepwater subsurface salt formations in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore East and West Africa and Brazil; unconventional reservoirs, such as those found in shale, tight gas and oil sands formations; and offshore basin-wide seismic data and imaging programs. Since 2002, our basin exploration seismic data programs have resulted in a substantial data library that covers significant portions of many of the frontier basins in the world, including offshore East and West Africa, India, South America, the Arctic, the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Australia. 

Our E&#38;P Advisors group partners with E&#38;P operators, energy industries and capital institutions to capture and monetize E&#38;P opportunities worldwide. This group provides technical, commercial and strategic advice across the exploration and production value chain, working at basin, prospect and field scales. 

Software. Our Software business provides command and control software systems, related software and services for towed marine streamer and ocean bottom seismic operations, as well as survey design. Our Orca software is installed on towed streamer marine vessels worldwide, and our Gator software is a component of many re-deployable and permanent ocean bottom seismic monitoring systems. 

In 2013, we introduced our Narwhal for ice management system, and in 2015, we completed field testing our Marlin solution for optimizing simultaneous operations during marine seismic data acquisition. Both of these systems are part of our E&#38;P software solutions for operations management. 

Systems. Our Systems business is engaged in the manufacture of (i) re-deployable ocean bottom cable seismic data acquisition systems (for OceanGeo&#8217;s use in OBS data acquisition); (ii) marine towed streamer positioning and control systems; and (iii) geophone sensors. 

Ocean Bottom Services (&#8220;OBS&#8221;). In 2014, we increased our ownership interest in OceanGeo from 30% to 100%. Through the addition of OceanGeo, ION offers a fully integrated OBS solution designed to maximize seismic image quality, operational efficiency and safety. The integrated OBS solution includes expert survey design, planning and optimization, superior data captured using multicomponent acquisition systems available exclusively to OceanGeo; data acquisition by the experienced team at OceanGeo; and data processing, interpretation and reservoir services, by our Imaging Services experts. For information regarding our acquisition of OceanGeo, see Footnote 14 &#32;&#8220; Acquisition of OceanGeo &#8221; of Footnotes to Consolidated &#32; Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

INOVA Geophysical. We conduct our land seismic equipment business through INOVA Geophysical, a joint venture with BGP Inc., which is a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation (&#8220;CNPC&#8221;). BGP is generally regarded as the world&#8217;s largest land geophysical service contractor. BGP owns a 51% equity interest in INOVA Geophysical, and we own the remaining 49% interest. INOVA manufactures cable-based and cableless seismic data acquisition systems, digital sensors, vibroseis vehicles (i.e., vibrator trucks), and source controllers for detonator and energy source business lines. We wrote our investment in INOVA down to zero as of December 31, 2014. For a discussion of the impairment of our equity method investment in INOVA, see Footnote 15 &#32;&#8220; Equity Method Investments &#8221; of Footnotes to Consolidated &#32; Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Seismic Industry Overview 

1930s &#8211; 1970s . Since the 1930s, oil and gas companies have sought to reduce exploration risk by using seismic data to create an image of the Earth&#8217;s subsurface. Seismic data is recorded when listening devices placed on the Earth&#8217;s surface or ocean bottom floor, or carried within the streamer cable of a towed streamer vessel, measure how long it takes for sound vibrations to echo off rock layers underground. For seismic data acquisition onshore, the acoustic energy producing the sound vibrations is generated by the detonation of small explosive charges or by large vibroseis (vibrator) vehicles. In marine acquisition, the energy is provided by a series of air guns that deliver compressed air into the water column. 

The acoustic energy propagates through the subsurface as a spherical wave front, or seismic wave. Interfaces between different types of rocks will both reflect and transmit this wave front. Onshore, the reflected signals return to the surface where they are measured by sensitive receivers that are analog coil-spring geophones. Offshore, the reflected signals are recorded by either hydrophones towed in an array behind a streamer acquisition vessel or by multicomponent geophones or MEMS sensors that are placed directly on the ocean floor. Once the recorded seismic energy is processed using advanced algorithms and workflows, images of the subsurface can be created to depict the structure, lithology (rock type), fracture patterns, and fluid content of subsurface horizons, highlighting the most promising places to drill for oil and natural gas. This processing also aids in engineering decisions, such as drilling and completion methods, as well as decisions affecting overall reservoir production as well as guiding economic decisions relating to drilling risk and reserves in place. 

&#32; 

Typically, an E&#38;P company engages the services of a geophysical acquisition contractor to prepare site locations, coordinate logistics, and acquire seismic data in a selected area. The E&#38;P company generally relies upon third parties, such as ION, to provide the contractor with equipment, navigation and data management software, and field support services necessary for data acquisition. After the data is collected, the same geophysical contractor, a third-party data processing company, our Imaging Services group or the E&#38;P company itself will process the data using proprietary algorithms and workflows to create a series of seismic images. Geoscientists then interpret the data by reviewing the images and integrating the geophysical data with other geological and production information such as well logs or core information. 

During the 1960s, digital seismic data acquisition systems (which converted the analog output from the geophones into digital data for recording) and computers for seismic data processing were introduced. Using the new systems and computers, the signals could be recorded on magnetic tape and sent to data processors where they could be adjusted and corrected for known distortions. The final processed data was displayed in a form known as &#8220;stacked&#8221; data. Computer filing, storage, database management, and algorithms used to process the raw data quickly grew more sophisticated, dramatically increasing the amount of subsurface seismic information. 

1980s . Until the early 1980s, the primary commercial seismic imaging technology was two-dimensional (&#8220;2-D&#8221;) technology. 2-D seismic data is recorded using lines of receivers crossing the surface of the Earth. Once processed, 2-D seismic data allows geoscientists to see only a thin vertical slice of the Earth, and that image may be corrupted by reflections originating out of the place of the receiver line. A geoscientist using 2-D seismic technology must speculate on the characteristics of the Earth between the slices and attempt to visualize the true three-dimensional (&#8220;3-D&#8221;) structure of the subsurface. 

The commercial development of 3-D imaging technology in the early 1980s was an important technological milestone for the seismic industry. Previously, the high cost of 3-D seismic data acquisition techniques and the lack of computing power necessary to process, display, and interpret 3-D data on a commercial basis had slowed its widespread adoption. Today&#8217;s 3-D seismic techniques record the reflected energy across a series of closely-spaced seismic lines that collectively provide a more holistic, spatially-sampled depiction of geological horizons and, in some cases, rock and fluid properties, within the Earth. 

3-D seismic data and the associated computer-based interpretation platforms are designed to allow geoscientists to generate more accurate subsurface maps than could be constructed on the basis of the more widely spaced 2-D seismic lines. In particular, 3-D seismic data provided more detailed information about and higher-quality images of subsurface structures, including the geometry of bedding layers, salt structures, and fault planes. The improved 3-D seismic images allowed the oil and gas industry to discover new reservoirs, reduce finding and development costs, and lower overall hydrocarbon exploration risk. Driven by faster computers and more sophisticated mathematical equations to process the data, the technology advanced quickly. 

1990s . As commodity prices decreased in the late 1990s and the pace of innovation in 3-D seismic imaging technology slowed, E&#38;P companies slowed the commissioning of new seismic surveys. Also, business practices employed by geophysical contractors impacted demand for seismic data. In an effort to sustain higher utilization of existing capital assets, geophysical contractors increasingly began to collect speculative seismic data for their own account in the hopes of selling it later to E&#38;P companies. These generic, speculative, multi-client surveys were not tailored to meet the unique imaging objectives of individual clients and caused an oversupply of seismic data in many regions. Additionally, since contractors incurred most of the costs of this speculative seismic data at the time of acquisition, contractors lowered prices to recover as much of their fixed investment as possible, which drove operating margins down. During the 1990&#8217;s, the accuracy of 3-D seismic surveys improved to the point that a survey acquired after significant oil production could be compared to a pre-production survey, and maps of the drainage pattern of the reservoir could be produced. This technique became known as time lapse, or 4-D seismic. 

2000s . The conditions from the 1990s continued to prevail until 2004-2005, when commodity prices began increasing and E&#38;P companies increased their capital spending programs, driving higher demand for our services and products. During this time, the use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing increased, as onshore North American production became economically viable with higher oil prices. These techniques, used to tap unconventional reservoirs, made once &#8220;hard to produce&#8221; oil and gas accessible and caused an upsurge in North American onshore oil and gas activity. 

The financial crisis that occurred in 2008 and the resulting economic downturn drove hydrocarbon prices down sharply; this had the effect of sharply reducing exploration activities in North America and in many parts of the world. Crude oil prices rebounded in 2013, and into 2014 with oil prices exceeding $100 per barrel, and U.S. oil production surged far beyond what even the most optimistic forecasts predicted. In the fourth quarter of 2014, however, oil prices began to decline significantly, as signs emerged that non-U.S. demand was weakening. The plunge accelerated in late November when OPEC decided to maintain production despite the lower demand and prices. Between September and December 2014, WTI and Brent crude oil prices dropped by approximately half. Between January 1, 2015 and December 31,2015, WTI and Brent crude oil prices dropped by approximately 30%. 

&#32; 

Throughout 2014, and 2015, and continuing into 2016, oil companies began prioritizing shareholder returns and cash flow generation over hydrocarbon resource growth, minimizing discretionary spending and shifting their focus from exploration to production. This shift, which has been magnified by the effect of very low global oil prices in 2015 and 2016, is causing a contraction in E&#38;P spending on seismic for exploration purposes. When spending on seismic for exploration purposes contracts, typically the seismic companies hardest hit are towed streamer contractors, who find themselves with excess vessel capacity. In addition, oil and gas companies tend to shift to reprocessing existing seismic data as a more cost-effective alternative to acquiring new data. 

Our Strategy 

The key elements of our business strategy are to: 

&#8226; 

Leverage our key technologies to provide integrated solutions to oil and gas companies, across the entire E&#38;P lifecycle . More of our customers are seeking fully integrated offerings from seismic companies, from survey planning and design, to leading technology differentiation in acquisition and processing. We have transformed our Company from an equipment provider to an integrated service provider, where leading equipment and software technologies underpin our solution offerings. The growth in our Solutions business over the past decade is a testament to our steadfast execution of this strategy. Whereas our solutions, including our BasinSPAN TM &#32;2-D seismic programs, were focused on the earlier, frontier exploration, phase of the E&#38;P lifecycle, our newest offering, OBS services through OceanGeo, is geared to the later, less volatile, production phase of the E&#38;P lifecycle leveraging our internally developed technology, including Calypso TM , our newest OBS data acquisition system. 

&#8226; 

Expand and globalize our Solutions business . We seek to expand and grow our Solutions business into new regions, with new customers and new offerings, including proprietary services for E&#38;P companies through our imaging services and Ventures multi-client businesses. Historically known for our 2-D programs, we entered the 3-D multi-client market in 2013 by acquiring and processing our first survey offshore Ireland. For the foreseeable future, we expect the majority of our future investments to be in research and development and computing infrastructure for our data processing business and to support our multi-client projects. We believe this focus better positions our company as a full-service technology company with an increasing proportion of revenues derived from E&#38;P customers. 

&#8226; 

Continue investing in advanced software and equipment technology to provide next generation services and products . We intend to continue investing in the development of new technologies for use by E&#38;P companies. In particular, we intend to focus on the development of the next generation of our OBS data imaging technology, our Narwhal ice management system, our Marlin simultaneous operations software, and derivative products, with the goal of obtaining technical and market leadership in what we continue to believe are important and expanding markets. In 2015 , our total investment in research and development and engineering was equal to approximately 12% &#32;of our total net revenue for the year. 

&#8226; 

Collaborate with our customers to provide products and solutions designed to meet their needs . A key element of our business strategy has been to understand the challenges faced by E&#38;P companies in seismic survey planning, seismic data acquisition, processing, and interpretation. We will continue to develop and offer technology and services that enable us to work with E&#38;P companies to solve their unique challenges, especially in the harshest and most extreme environments around the world. We have found that a collaborative relationship with E&#38;P companies, with a goal of better understanding their imaging challenges and then working with them to assure them that the right technologies are properly applied, is the most effective method for meeting their needs. Our goal of being a full solutions provider to solve the most difficult challenges for our customers is an important element of our long-term business strategy, and we are implementing this partnership approach globally through local personnel in our regional organizations who understand the unique challenges in their areas. We formed an E&#38;P Advisors group in 2015 designed to focus specifically on this element of our strategy. 

Our Strengths 

We believe that we are solidly positioned to successfully execute the key elements of our business strategy based on the following competitive strengths: 

&#8226; 

We are leveraging our key technologies to provide integrated solutions to oil and gas companies . More of our customers are seeking fully integrated offerings from seismic companies, from survey planning and design, to leading technology differentiation in acquisition and processing. ION has become an integrated service provider for both towed streamer and ocean bottom seismic services, through service offerings by our Solutions segment. 

&#32; 

&#8226; 

We are a broad-based seismic solutions provider, with offerings spanning the entire geophysical workflow . &#32;We are a technology-focused full-value-chain service provider, with offerings that span the entire seismic workflow, from survey planning and data acquisition to processing and interpretation. Our offerings include seismic data acquisition hardware, data acquisition services, command and control software, value-added services associated with seismic survey design, seismic data processing and interpretation, and seismic data libraries. 

&#8226; 

Our &#8220;asset light&#8221; strategy enables us to avoid significant fixed costs and to remain financially flexible. &#32;We do not own a fleet of marine vessels and, with the exception of OceanGeo, we do not provide our own seismic crews to acquire seismic data. We outsource a majority of our seismic data acquisition activity to third parties that operate their own fleets of seismic acquisition vessels and equipment. Doing so enables us to avoid the fixed costs associated with these assets and personnel and to manage our business in a manner designed to afford us the flexibility to quickly decrease our costs or capital investments in the event of a downturn, as we have experienced in 2014 and 2015. We actively manage the costs of developing our multi-client data library business by requiring our customers to partially pre-fund, or underwrite, the investment for any new project. Our target goal is to have a vast majority of the total cost of each new project&#8217;s data acquisition to be underwritten by our customers. We believe this conservative approach to data library investment is the most prudent way to reduce the impact of any sudden reduction in the demand for seismic data giving us the flexibility to aggressively reduce cash outflows as we have successfully implemented in the current industry downturn. 

&#8226; 

Our global footprint and ability to work in harsh conditions allow us to offset regional downturns. &#32;Our focus on conducting business around the world, even in the harshest and most extreme environments, has been and will continue to be a key component of our strategy. This global focus has been helpful in minimizing the impact of any one regional slowdown for short or extended periods of time. We believe that our customers prefer to work with companies that are capable of delivering high quality, safe, and environmentally sensitive service in those environments. For example, our operational expertise and equipment and software technologies enable us to operate in the harsh Arctic environment and to acquire seismic data in areas for which no modern seismic data previously existed. This expertise and these technologies permit us to extend the time window for data acquisition, facilitate our customers&#8217; drilling decisions, reducing exploration and production risk. 

&#8226; 

We have a diversified and blue chip customer base. We provide services and products to a diverse, global customer base that includes many of the largest oil and gas and geophysical companies in the world, including national oil companies (NOCs) and international oil companies (IOCs). Over the past decade, we have made significant progress in expanding our customer list and revenue sources. Whereas almost all of our revenues in 2003 were derived principally from seismic contracting companies, in 2015 &#32;E&#38;P companies accounted for approximately 70% &#32;of our total revenues. Even though we provide services and products to some of the largest companies in the world, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in 2013 , 2014 &#32;or 2015 . We focus our sales and marketing efforts on high-quality, historically creditworthy customers. 

Services and Products 

Solutions Segment 

Our Solutions segment includes the following: 

Ventures &#32;&#8212; Our Ventures group provides complete seismic data services, from survey planning and design through data acquisition to final subsurface imaging and reservoir characterization. We work backwards through the seismic workflow, with the final image in mind, to select the optimal survey design, acquisition technology, and processing techniques. 

We offer our services to customers on both a proprietary and multi-client (non-exclusive) basis. In both cases, the customers generally pre-fund a majority of the data acquisition costs. For proprietary services, the customer also pays for the imaging and processing but has exclusive ownership of the data after it has been processed. For multi-client surveys, we may assume some of the processing costs, but we retain ownership of the data and receive ongoing revenue from subsequent data license sales. 

Since 2002, we have acquired and processed a growing multi-client data library consisting of non-exclusive marine and ocean bottom data from around the world. The majority of the data licensed by ION consists of ultra-deep 2-D seismic data that E&#38;P companies use to evaluate petroleum reservoirs at the basin level, including insights into the character of source rocks and sediments, migration pathways, and reservoir trapping mechanisms. In many cases, we extend beyond seismic data to include magnetic, gravity, well log, and electromagnetic information, to provide a more comprehensive picture of the subsurface. Known as &#8220;BasinSPAN&#8221; programs, these geophysical surveys cover most major offshore basins worldwide and we&#8217;re continuing to build on them. In addition to our 2-D multi-client programs, in 2013 we acquired our first 3-D marine proprietary program and signed a strategic agreement with Polarcus Limited, a marine geophysical company, to jointly plan and execute 3-D marine multi-client surveys worldwide, and in 2013, we jointly acquired and processed our first 3-D survey offshore Ireland. 

&#32; 

For land applications, we also have a library of 3-D onshore reservoir imaging and characterization programs that provide E&#38;P companies with the ability to better understand unconventional reservoirs to maximize production. Known as &#8220;ResSCAN&#8482;&#8221; programs, these 3-D multicomponent seismic data programs were designed, acquired and depth-imaged using advanced geophysical technology and proprietary processing techniques, resulting in high-definition images of the subsurface. 

In 2014, we wrote down the value of our multi-client data library, primarily associated with Arctic and onshore North American programs by $100.1 million due to current market conditions. The decline in crude oil prices to 12-year lows negatively impacted the economic outlook of our E&#38;P customers. In response to the decline in crude oil prices, E&#38;P companies turned their focus to spending reductions, with exploration spending receiving the largest reductions and seismic spending being one of the most discretionary parts of their exploration budgets. These reductions in exploration spending have had an impact on our results of operations in 2014 and 2015. Sales of Arctic programs have been specifically impacted by events in Russia and the U.S. government canceling future license rounds in Alaska. The decline in crude oil prices as well as U.S. and European Union sanctions against Russia related to Russia&#8217;s actions in Ukraine, both contributed to the devaluation of the Russian ruble which placed significant pressure on our Russian-based customers and negatively impacted the appeal of seismic data located in Russia to potential non-Russian buyers. In 2015, further declines in oil prices caused in part by the oversupply of crude oil, including the Iran nuclear deal, which allows Iran to export more oil, has caused concerns about further increasing supply. These events have continued to impact North America. E&#38;P customer spending in the natural gas shale plays has been limited due to associated gas being produced from unconventional oil wells in North America increasing natural gas supplies and putting downward pressure on natural gas prices. The number of rigs working in North America has decreased by approximately 62% since late November 2014. 

Seismic Data Processing Services &#32;&#8212; Our Imaging Services group is a strong market participant in advanced marine, and land seismic data processing, imaging, and reservoir services. In addition to applying processing and imaging technologies to data owned or licensed by its customers, we also provide our customers with seismic data acquisition support services, such as data pre-conditioning for imaging and quality control of seismic data acquisition. 

We utilize a globally distributed network of Linux-cluster processing centers in combination with our major hubs in Houston and London to process seismic data using advanced, proprietary algorithms and workflows. 

Our Imaging team has pioneered several differentiated processing and imaging solutions for both offshore and onshore environments including: Reverse Time Migration, Surface Related Multiple Elimination, and WiBand broadband deghosting. In 2013, we commercially released our new Full Waveform Inversion and non-parametric picking tomography techniques to improve subsurface image resolution in areas with complex geologies. The advantages of these techniques are that they allow for the resolution of complex, small-scale velocity variations. In 2014, we introduced PrecisION&#8482;, an innovative compressed seismic inversion technique that is designed to build Earth reconstructions with improved accuracy and aid geoscientists in better quantifying exploration and development risk and uncertainty. In 2015, the focus of our Imaging team has been on the application of our differentiated technology, expertise and access to BasinSPAN data to work with key customers to deliver seismic velocity models and images consistent with geology. In 2015, we released our next generation data processing system, Perseus, which removes our dependence on third party software and has yielded improvements of over four times on our key processes. In a low oil price environment ION Imaging has increasingly adapted to meet the growing need to deliver high value information by reprocessing old data with the latest imaging technology. In addition to processing our own multi-client BasinSPAN 2-D programs and regionally calibrated 3-D programs, our proprietary processing and imaging business has been focused on key customers with complex 3-D imaging challenges predominantly in the marine environment - both towed streamer and seabed. Our focus on close collaboration with key customers has been rewarded by repeat business such as the recent award of a contract extension from PEMEX. 

Quantitative Interpretation &#32;&#8212; The Imaging Services group also offers solutions &#8220;downstream&#8221; of seismic data processing workflows that enable E&#38;P companies to develop their reservoirs and increase production. This is accomplished by integrating geophysical, geological, petrophysical and rock physics information to identify lithology, fluid or fracture within hydrocarbon reservoirs. Once understood, this information may be used for better well placement and more effective well completions. 

At December 31, 2015 , our Solutions segment backlog, which consists of commitments for (i) data processing work and (ii) both multi-client new venture and proprietary projects that have been underwritten, has declined to $19.2 million &#32;compared with $46.7 million &#32;at December 31, 2014 . Our Solutions segment&#8217;s fiscal-year-end backlog includes signed contracts that we can usually fulfill within approximately six months. Investments in our multi-client data library are dependent upon the timing of our new ventures projects and the availability of underwriting by our customers. Our asset light strategy enables us to scale our business to avoid significant fixed costs and to remain financially flexible as we manage the timing and levels of our capital expenditures. 

&#32; 

E&#38;P Advisory Services &#8212; &#32; Our E&#38;P Advisors group partners with E&#38;P operators, energy industries and capital institutions to capture and monetize E&#38;P opportunities worldwide. This group provides technical, commercial and strategic advice across the exploration and production value chain, working at basin, prospect and field scales. E&#38;P Advisors couple ION&#8217;s proven technical capabilities with the industry&#8217;s best commercial and strategic minds to deliver fit-for-purpose solutions, employing a variety of commercial models specific to our clients&#8217; needs. 

Software Segment 

Through this segment, we supply command and control software systems and related services for towed marine streamer and OBS operations. Software developed by our Software group is installed on towed streamer marine vessels worldwide and is a component of many re-deployable and permanent ocean bottom monitoring systems. An advantage of our underlying software platform is that it provides common components from which to build other applications. This enables the acceleration of development and commercialization of new products as market opportunities are identified. Our Narwhal for ice management system, which we released in 2013, is such an example, as is Marlin, our new software solution for optimizing simultaneous operations during marine seismic data acquisition. 

Products and services for our Software segment include the following: 

Towed Streamer Navigation System &#32;&#8212; Our command and control software for towed streamer acquisition, Orca, integrates acquisition, planning, positioning, source and quality control systems into a seamless operation. 

&#32; Ocean Bottom Navigation System &#32;&#8212; Gator II is our integrated navigation and data management system for multi-vessel OBS, electromagnetic and transition zone operations. 

Survey Planning and Optimization &#32;&#8212; We offer consulting services for planning and supervising complex surveys, including for 4-D (time lapse) and Wide Azimuth Towed Streamer survey operations. Our acquisition expertise and in-field software platforms are designed to allow clients, including both oil companies and seismic data acquisition contractors, to optimize these complex surveys, improving efficiencies, data quality and reducing costs. Our Orca and Gator systems are designed to integrate with our post-survey tools for processing, analysis and data quality control, including the use of our Reflex &#174; &#32;software for seismic coverage and attribute analysis. Our proprietary technology known as Optimiser&#8482; is designed to enable improved, safer acquisition through analysis and prediction of sea currents and integration of the information into the acquisition plan. 

Operations Management &#32;&#8212; In 2013, we introduced the first fully integrated ice management system designed to reduce risk and improve efficiency in seismic data acquisition and drilling operations in or near ice, such as in the Arctic. The patented Narwhal system enables operators to gather, monitor and analyze data from various sources, including satellite imagery, ice charts, radar, manual observations, and wind and ocean currents, to forecast and predict ice movements in these harsh environments. With this ability to track, forecast and monitor potential ice threats, operators can make informed, proactive decisions to ensure the safety of individuals, assets and the environment, while minimizing operational downtime. More importantly, we applied this technology to develop and commercialize our Marlin solution for managing simultaneous operations during marine seismic data acquisition. 

Systems Segment 

Our Systems segment products include the following: 

Marine Acquisition Systems &#32;&#8212; We believe that the market for ocean bottom seismic imaging is growing. E&#38;P companies have shown increased interest in ocean bottom seismic activities, consistent with their desire for higher-quality seismic imaging for complex geological formations and more detailed reservoir characteristics. Since introducing our first ocean bottom acquisition system, VSO, in 2004, we have continued to develop advanced ocean bottom systems, which we are putting to use through OceanGeo. 

We also manufacture marine acquisition systems, consisting of towed marine streamers and shipboard electronics that collect seismic data in water depths of greater than 30 meters. Marine streamers, which contain hydrophones, electronic modules and cabling, may measure up to 12,000 meters in length and are towed (up to 20 at a time) behind a seismic acquisition vessel. The hydrophones detect acoustical energy transmitted through water from the Earth&#8217;s subsurface structures. Our DigiSTREAMER&#8482; system uses solid streamer and integrated continuous acquisition technology for towed streamer operations. 

&#32; 

Marine Positioning Systems &#32;&#8212; Our manufactured marine streamer positioning system includes streamer cable depth control devices, lateral control devices, compasses, acoustic positioning systems and other auxiliary sensors. This equipment is designed to control the vertical and horizontal positioning of the streamer cables and provides acoustic, compass and depth measurements to allow processors to tie navigation and location data to geophysical data to determine the location of potential hydrocarbon reserves. DigiBIRD II &#174; &#32;are designed to maintain streamers at pre-defined target depths more safely, efficiently, and cost effectively than ever before by eliminating workboat operations for battery changes on the majority of seismic surveys. DigiFIN &#174; &#32;is an advanced lateral streamer control system that we commercialized in 2008. DigiFIN is designed to maintain tighter, more uniform marine streamer separation along the entire length of the streamer cable, which allows for better sampling of seismic data and improved subsurface images. We believe that DigiFIN also enables faster line changes and minimizes the requirements for in-fill seismic work. 

Geophones &#32;&#8212; Geophones are land sensor devices that measure acoustic energy reflected from rock layers in the Earth&#8217;s subsurface using a mechanical, coil-spring element. We manufacture and market a full suite of geophones and geophone test equipment that operate in most environments, including land surface, transition zone and downhole. Our geophones are used in other industries as well. 

Ocean Bottom Services Segment 

ION offers a fully-integrated OBS solution that includes expert survey design, planning and optimization, to maximize seismic image quality, safe, efficient data acquisition by the experienced team at OceanGeo; superior imaging via OceanGeo&#8217;s exclusive use of our VSO systems; and data processing, interpretation and reservoir services through ION. 

INOVA Geophysical Products 

INOVA manufactures cable-based (G3i &#174; &#32;and ARIES &#174; ) and cableless (Hawk &#174; ) seismic data acquisition systems, digital sensors (AccuSeis&#8482; and VectorSeis), vibroseis vehicles (i.e., vibrator trucks, known as AHV-IV&#8482; and UNIVIB &#174; ), and source controllers for detonator and energy source (Vib Pro&#8482; and Shot Pro&#8482; II) business lines. We wrote our investment in INOVA down to zero as of December 31, 2014. For a discussion of the impairment of our equity method investment in INOVA, see Footnote 15 &#32;&#8220; Equity Method Investments &#8221; of Footnotes to Consolidated &#32; Financial Statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Product Research and Development 

Our ability to compete effectively in the seismic imaging market depends principally upon continued technological innovation in our underlying technologies. As such, the overall focus of our research and development efforts has remained on improving both the quality of the subsurface images we generate and the economics of the seismic data acquisition that lies behind the imaging. In particular, we have concentrated on enhancing the nature and quality of the information that can be extracted from the subsurface images. 

During 2015, our research and development efforts were aimed at developing strategic key technologies across all business lines. A large part of this effort was focused on the final phases of development of our Calypso re-deployable ocean bottom acquisition system, which we plan to put into service through our Ocean Bottom Services segment. Within the seismic data processing business, we continued to invest in productivity enhancements and in technologies aimed at handling increasingly complex data acquisition environments and at areas with difficult-to-image subsurface geology. We invested in Marlin, a software system for managing simultaneous marine seismic operations. We also continued research and development into maximizing the value of full-wave seismic data, particularly the extraction of new and more accurate subsurface information with a special emphasis on marine ocean bottom imaging. 

As many of these new services and products are under development and, as the development cycles from initial conception through to commercial introduction can extend over a number of years, their commercial feasibility or degree of commercial acceptance may not yet be established. No assurance can be given concerning the successful development of any new service or product, any enhancements to them, the specific timing of their release or their level of acceptance in the marketplace. 

Markets and Customers 

Our primary customers are E&#38;P companies to whom we market and offer services, primarily imaging-related processing services from our Imaging Services group, multi-client seismic data programs from our Ventures group, and OBS data acquisition services through OceanGeo, as well as consulting services from our E&#38;P Advisors and Software group. Secondarily, seismic contractors purchase our towed streamer data acquisition systems and related equipment and software to collect data in accordance with their E&#38;P company customers&#8217; specifications or for their own seismic data libraries. 

&#32; 

A significant part of our marketing effort is focused on areas outside of the United States. Foreign sales are subject to special risks inherent in doing business outside of the United States, including the risk of political instability, armed conflict, civil disturbances, currency fluctuations, embargo and governmental activities, customer credit risks and risk of non-compliance with U.S. and foreign laws, including tariff regulations and import/export restrictions. 

We sell our services and products through a direct sales force consisting of employees and international third-party sales representatives responsible for key geographic areas. The majority of our foreign sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. During 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , sales to destinations outside of North America accounted for approximately 66% , 74% &#32;and 73% &#32;of our consolidated net revenues, respectively. Further, systems and equipment sold to domestic customers are frequently deployed internationally and, from time to time, certain foreign sales require export licenses. 

Traditionally, our business has been seasonal, with strongest demand typically in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. 

For information concerning the geographic breakdown of our net revenues, see Footnote 3 &#32;&#8220; Segment and Geographic Information &#8221; of Footnotes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#32;contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 

Competition 

Our Imaging Services group within our Solutions segment competes with more than a dozen companies that provide data processing services to E&#38;P companies. See &#8220; &#8211; Services and Products &#32;&#8211; Solutions Segment .&#8221; While the barriers to enter this market are relatively low, we believe the barriers to compete at the higher end of the market&#8211;the advanced pre-stack depth migration market where our efforts are focused&#8211;are significantly higher. At the higher end of this market, CGG (an integrated geophysical company) and Schlumberger (a large integrated oilfield services company), are our Solutions segment&#8217;s two primary competitors for advanced imaging services. Both of these companies are significantly larger than ION in terms of revenue, processing locations, and sales, marketing and financial resources. In addition, both CGG and Schlumberger possess an advantage in the data processing arena, as part of more vertically integrated seismic contractor companies; for example, when these companies acquire large 3-D multi-client surveys, the internal data processing organization will usually be awarded the data processing without any requirement to compete with external vendors. CGG and Schlumberger, along with other competitors, TGS-NOPEC Geophysical Company ASA and Spectrum ASA, also develop and sell data libraries that compete with our BasinSPAN data libraries. BGP also competes in this space by primarily partnering with other competitors to develop and sell data libraries. 

In the OBS market, OceanGeo competes with a number of companies, including WesternGeco, Fairfield Nodal, Seabed GeoSolutions (a joint venture of Fugro and CGG), Magseis and BGP. The OBS market primarily addresses the production end of the E&#38;P business. This market is primarily vertically integrated with a variety of proprietary technologies, comprising both cable and nodal systems. Most companies operate one to three crews, and there have been three new entrants in the last few years. 

The market for seismic services and products is highly competitive and characterized by frequent changes in technology. Our principal competitor for marine seismic equipment is Sercel (a manufacturing subsidiary of CGG). Sercel has the advantage of being able to sell its products and services to its parent company that operates both land and marine crews, providing it with a significant and stable internal market and a greater ability to test new technology in the field. The recent downturn in the industry has disrupted traditional buying patterns. We have seen a generally increasing trend of companies such as Petroleum GeoServices ASA (&#8220;PGS&#8221;) developing their own instrumentation to create a competitive advantage through products such as Geostreamer. We also compete with other seismic equipment companies on a product-by-product basis. Our ability to compete effectively in the manufacture and sale of seismic instruments and data acquisition systems depends principally upon continued technological innovation, as well as pricing, system reliability, reputation for quality and ability to deliver on schedule. 

Some seismic contractors design, engineer and manufacture seismic acquisition technology in-house (or through a network of third-party vendors) to differentiate themselves. Although this technology competes directly with our marine streamer, and ocean bottom equipment, it is not usually made available to other seismic acquisition contractors. However, the risk exists that other seismic contractors may decide to develop their own seismic technology, which would put additional pressure on the demand for our acquisition equipment. 

&#32; 

In addition, we expect continued reductions in the market for spare parts and service of existing equipment as a result of the fleet reductions currently occurring in the marine seismic market. By 2017, we expect the number of 2-D and 3-D marine streamer vessels, including those in operation, under construction, or announced additions to capacity, to decrease by six, to approximately 88 vessels total. This 2017 projection has decreased by 30 vessels from the projection one year ago. In addition, there has been an increase in recent years of consolidation within the sector, with the major vessel operators - CGG, WesternGeco and PGS - all acquiring new market entrants in the last several years. In 2013, CGG acquired the geoscience division of Fugro, an international energy infrastructure company. This acquisition has resulted in 50% of the high-end 3-D seismic capacity being concentrated among the largest three companies - CGG, WesternGeco and PGS. Those three companies are vertically integrated with technology that uniquely differentiates them from the rest of the players. This consolidation reduces the number of potential customers and vessel outfitting opportunities for us. During the downturn in the price of crude oil and the resulting reduction in capital expenditures by E&#38;P companies, we anticipate that older, smaller and less efficient vessels will drop out of the fleet to be replaced by newer vessels. 

In the land seismic equipment market, where INOVA competes, the principal competitors are Sercel and Geospace Technologies. INOVA is a joint venture with BGP as a majority stake owner. BGP purchases land seismic equipment from both INOVA and its competitors. 

Intellectual Property 

We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademark, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technologies. We have more than 500 patents and pending patent applications, including filings in international jurisdictions with respect to the same kinds of technologies. Although our portfolio of patents is considered important to our operations, and particular patents may be material to specific business lines, no one patent is considered essential to our consolidated business operations. 

Our patents, copyrights and trademarks offer us only limited protection. Our competitors may attempt to copy aspects of our products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, or may design around the proprietary features of our products. Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult, and we may be unable to determine the extent to which such use occurs. Our difficulties are compounded in certain foreign countries where the laws do not offer as much protection for proprietary rights as the laws of the United States. From time to time, third parties inquire and claim that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights and we make similar inquiries and claims to third parties. Material intellectual property litigation is discussed in detail in Item 3. &#8220; Legal Proceedings .&#8221;

Regulatory Matters 

Our operations are subject to various international conventions, laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to the importation of and operation of seismic equipment, currency conversions and repatriation, oil and gas exploration and development, taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel, environmental protection, the use of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors and duties on the importation and exportation of equipment. Our operations are subject to government policies and product certification requirements worldwide. Governments in some foreign countries have become increasingly active in regulating the companies holding concessions, the exploration for oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industries in their countries. In some areas of the world, this governmental activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work done by major oil and gas companies and may continue to do so. Operations in less developed countries can be subject to legal systems that are not as mature or predictable as those in more developed countries, which can lead to greater uncertainty in legal matters and proceedings. 

Changes in these conventions, regulations, policies or requirements could affect the demand for our services and products or result in the need to modify them, which may involve substantial costs or delays in sales and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results. Our export activities are subject to extensive and evolving trade regulations. Certain countries are subject to trade restrictions, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the U.S. government. These restrictions and sanctions prohibit or limit us from participating in certain business activities in those countries. 

&#32; 

Our operations are also subject to numerous local, state and federal laws and regulations in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous materials, the remediation of contaminated properties and the protection of the environment. While the industry has experienced an increase in general environmental regulation worldwide and laws and regulations protecting the environment have generally become more stringent, we do not believe compliance with these regulations has resulted in a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations, and we do not currently foresee the need for significant expenditures in order to be able to remain compliant in all material respects with current environmental protection laws. Regulations in this area are subject to change, and there can be no assurance that future laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us. 

Our customers&#8217; operations are also significantly impacted in other respects by laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment and endangered species. For instance, many of our marine contractors have been affected by regulations protecting marine mammals in the Gulf of Mexico. To the extent that our customers&#8217; operations are disrupted by future laws and regulations, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 560 &#32;regular, full-time employees, 362 &#32;of whom were located in the U.S. From time to time and on an as-needed basis, we supplement our regular workforce with individuals that we hire temporarily or retain as independent contractors in order to meet certain internal manufacturing or other business needs. Our U.S. employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a labor-related work stoppage. We believe that our employee relations are satisfactory.
