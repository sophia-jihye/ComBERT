 Item 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

INTRODUCTION TO OUR BUSINESS 

&#160; 

InnSuites Hospitality Trust (the &#8220;Trust&#8221;) is headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona and is an unincorporated Ohio real estate investment trust formed on June 21, 1979; however, the Trust is not a real estate investment trust for federal taxation purposes. The Trust, with its affiliates RRF Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership (the &#8220;Partnership&#8221;), and InnSuites&#174; Hotels, Inc., a Nevada corporation (&#8220;InnSuites Hotels&#8221;), owns interests in and operates four hotels, provides management services for a total of six hotels, and provides trademark license services for a total of seven hotels. At January 31, 2016, the Trust owned a 72.11% sole general partner interest in the Partnership, which controlled a 51.01% interest in one InnSuites hotel located in Tucson, Arizona, and controlled a 51.65% interest in one InnSuites hotel located in Ontario, California. We anticipate to sell one or more of our hotels by January 31, 2017. 

&#160; 

The Trust also owned a direct 50.93% interest in one InnSuites hotel located in Yuma, Arizona and owned a direct 50.91% interest in one InnSuites&#174; hotel located in Albuquerque, New Mexico (all four InnSuites hotels are hereinafter referred to as the &#8220;Hotels&#8221;). InnSuites Hotels, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Trust, provides management services for the Hotels and two hotels owned by affiliates of James F. Wirth, the Trust&#8217;s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. InnSuites Hotels also provides trademark and licensing services to the Hotels, two hotels owned by affiliates of Mr. Wirth and one unrelated hotel property. In addition, we provide additional services in our other business segment as reservations services for 6,300 unrelated hotel properties. The Trust has approximately 300 employees. 

&#160; 

The Hotels have an aggregate of 576 hotel suites and operate as moderate and full-service hotels that apply a value studio and two-room suite operating philosophy formulated in 1980 by Mr. Wirth. The Trust owns and operates hotels as studio and two-room suite hotels that offer services such as free hot breakfast buffets and complimentary afternoon social hours plus amenities, such as microwave ovens, refrigerators, free high-speed hard wired and wireless Internet access and coffee makers in each studio or two-room suite. 

&#160; 

The Trust believes that a significant opportunity for revenue growth and profitability will arise from the skillful management of the Trust&#8217;s Hotels or managed hotel properties for both increased occupancy and rates. The Trust&#8217;s primary business objective is to maximize returns to its shareholders through increases in asset value and long-term total returns to shareholders. The Trust seeks to achieve this objective through participation in increased revenues from the Hotels as a result of intensive management and marketing of the InnSuites&#174; hotels and the &#8220;InnSuites Boutique Hotel Collection&#8221; brands in the southwestern region of the United States. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Future Positioning&#8221; for a more detailed discussion of the Trust&#8217;s strategic objectives. 

&#160; 

The Trust has a single class of Shares of Beneficial Interest, without par value, that are traded on the NYSE MKT under the symbol &#8220;IHT.&#8221; The Partnership has two outstanding classes of limited partnership interests, Class A and Class B, which are identical in all respects. However, each Class A Partnership unit is convertible, at the option of the Class A holder, into one newly-issued Share of Beneficial Interest of the Trust and each Class B Partnership unit is convertible, upon approval of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, into one newly-issued Share of Beneficial Interest of the Trust. The Partnership Agreement of the Partnership subjects both general and limited partner units to certain restrictions on transfer. 

&#160; 

In furtherance of our strategic plan, we have significantly expanded InnDependent Boutique Collection (&#8220;IBC Hotels&#8221;), a wholly owned subsidiary of InnSuites Hospitality Trust, which has a network of approximately 6,300 members representing 170 countries and over 2,000,000 rooms and suites. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2014, IBC Hotels formed a marketing alliance with the Independent Lodging Industry Association (&#8220;ILIA&#8221;). We believe this new hotel network provides independent hotel owners a competitive advantage against traditional franchised brands in their markets. The network provides a booking system and loyalty program. IBC Hotels charges a 10% booking fee, which we believe increases the independent hotel profits. Competitors of IBC Hotels can charge anywhere from a 30% to 50% booking fee. InnDependent InnCentives, IBC&#8217;s loyalty program, allows hoteliers to benefit from guests who frequently stay at IBC independent hotels. IBC Hotels is dedicated to providing guests with a unique, non-cookie cutter hotel experience in addition to providing value-added amenities and resort locations to its guests. IBC Hotels has an InnDependent InnCentives travel rewards program that provides a free stay at any worldwide IBC Hotel of the guests&#8217; choice after booking 12 nights on IBC Hotels&#8217; website. In addition, on January 8, 2016, IBC Hotels purchased substantially all of the assets of International Vacation Hotels, a technology company located in Dallas, Texas, which provides reservation services to over 600 independent international hotels. For more information about the acquisition of International Vacation Hotels, see Note 27 of our Consolidated Financial Statements - &#8220;Acquisition of International Vacation Hotels&#8221;.

MANAGEMENT AND LICENSING CONTRACTS 

&#160; 

The Trust directly manages the Hotels through the Trust&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary, InnSuites Hotels. Under the management agreements, InnSuites Hotels manages the daily operations of the Hotels and the two hotels owned by affiliates of Mr. Wirth. All Trust managed Hotel expenses, revenues and reimbursements among the Trust, InnSuites Hotels and the Partnership have been eliminated in consolidation. The management fees for the Hotels and the two hotels owned by Mr. Wirth are 3% of room revenue and a monthly accounting fee of $2,000 per hotel. These agreements have no expiration date and may be cancelled by either party with 90-days written notice in the event the property changes ownership. 

&#160; 

The Trust also provides the use of the &#8220;InnSuites&#8221; trademark to the Hotels and the two hotels owned by affiliates of Mr. Wirth through the Trust&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary, InnSuites Hotels, at no additional charge. 

&#160; 

MEMBERSHIP AGREEMENTS 

&#160; 

InnSuites Hotels has entered into membership agreements with Best Western International, Inc. (&#8220;Best Western&#8221;) with respect to all of the Hotels. In exchange for use of the Best Western name, trademark and reservation system, the Hotels pay fees to Best Western based on reservations received through the use of the Best Western reservation system and the number of available suites at the Hotels. The agreements with Best Western have no specific expiration terms and may be cancelled by either party. Best Western requires that the Hotels meet certain requirements for room quality, and the Hotels are subject to removal from its reservation system if these requirements are not met. The Hotels with third-party membership agreements received significant reservations through the Best Western reservation system. Under these arrangements, fees paid for membership fees and reservations were approximately $331,000 and $342,000 for fiscal years ended January 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

&#160; 

COMPETITION IN THE HOTEL INDUSTRY 

&#160; 

The hotel industry is highly competitive. We expect the major challenge for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2017 (&#8220;fiscal year 2017&#8221;) to be the continuation of strong competition for corporate leisure group and government business in the markets in which we operate, which may affect our ability to increase room rates while maintaining market share. Each of the Hotels experiences competition primarily from other mid-market hotels located in its immediate vicinity, but also competes with hotel properties located in other geographic markets. While none of the Hotels&#8217; competitors dominate any of the Trust&#8217;s geographic markets, some of those competitors may have greater marketing and financial resources than the Trust. 

&#160; 

Certain additional hotel property developments and/or hotel refurbishments have recently been completed by competitors in a number of the Hotels&#8217; markets, and additional hotel property developments may be built in the future. Such hotel developments have had, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on the revenue of our Hotels in their respective markets. 

&#160; 

The Trust has chosen to focus its hotel investments in the southwest region of the United States. The Trust has a concentration of assets in the southern Arizona market. In the markets in which the Trust operates, in particular, the Yuma, Arizona and Ontario, California markets, supply has increased during the past several years. In the Yuma, Arizona market, demand has been steady but a recent increase in supply has added significant pressure to our ability to maintain our rates and occupancy in that market. Either an increase in supply or a decline in demand could result in increased competition, which could have an adverse effect on the revenue of our Hotels in their respective markets. 

&#160; 

IBC Hotels provides a variety of brand-like services without the cost or hassle of a brand for a month-to-month agreement to independent hotels, which make up approximately one-half of the worlds hotels (not including B&#38;Bs and rentals). These services include but are not limited to: web/mobile site presence, hotel app, booking engine, loyalty program along with strategic partnerships that provide metasite channels, fast-tracked financing, purchasing, IT services, training and education and integrations to a variety of service providers including rental cars and tours as well as property management and additional distribution. 

&#160; 

While the travel landscape is competitive in itself, each one of the services has provided by IBC Hotels its own competitive landscape. Online travel agencies (OTAs) continue to fight for the unwashed customer looking for the occasional booking and hotels to push excess inventory. Brands have historically had solid demand due to their loyalty programs and consistent product offerings along with powerful education and training programs. Technology and tourism companies have powerfully operated in their segment without much cross-over. Independent hotels have historically had trouble getting financing and purchasing power without a large brand or management contract. 

&#160; 

The Trust may also compete for investment opportunities with other entities that have greater financial resources. These entities also may generally accept more risk than the Trust can prudently manage. Competition may generally reduce the number of suitable future investment opportunities available to the Trust and increase the bargaining power of owners seeking to sell their properties.

&#160; 

REGULATION 

&#160; 

The Trust is subject to numerous federal, state and local government laws and regulations affecting the hospitality industry, including usage, building and zoning requirements and the laws and regulations related to the preparation and sale of food and beverage such as health and liquor license laws. A violation of any of those laws and regulations or increased government regulation could require the Trust to make unplanned expenditures which may result in higher operating costs. In addition, the Trust&#8217;s success in expanding our hotel operations depends upon its ability to obtain necessary building permits and zoning variances from local authorities. Compliance with these laws is time intensive and costly and may reduce the Trust&#8217;s revenues and operating income. 

&#160; 

Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the &#8220;ADA&#8221;), all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. In addition to ADA work completed to date, the Trust may be required to remove additional access barriers or make unplanned, substantial modifications to its Hotels to comply with the ADA or to comply with other changes in governmental rules and regulations, or become subject to claims, fines and damage awards, any of which could reduce the number of total available rooms, increase operating costs and have a negative impact on the Trust&#8217;s results of operations. 

&#160; 

Our hotel properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws that impose liability for contamination. Under these laws, governmental entities have the authority to require us, as the current or former owner of the property, to perform or pay for the clean-up of contamination (including swimming pool chemicals or hazardous substances or biological waste) at or emanating from the property and to pay for natural resource damage arising from contamination. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination. Such liability can be joint and several, so that each covered person can be responsible for all of the costs involved, even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination. We can also be liable to private parties for costs of remediation, personal injury death and/or property damage resulting from contamination at or emanating from our hotel properties. Moreover, environmental contamination can affect the value of a property and, therefore, an owners&#8217; ability to borrow funds using the property as collateral or to sell the property on favorable terms or at all. Furthermore, persons who sent waste to a waste disposal facility, such as a landfill or an incinerator, may be liable for costs associated with cleanup of that facility. 

&#160; 

The Trust is also subject to laws governing our relationship with employees, including minimum or living wage requirements, overtime, working conditions and work permit requirements. There are frequent proposals under consideration, at the federal and state levels, to increase the minimum wage. Additional increases to the state or federal minimum wage rate, and employee benefit costs including health care or other costs associated with employees could increase expenses and result in lower operating margins. 

&#160; 

Lastly, the Trust collects and maintains information relating to its guests for various business purposes, including maintaining guest preferences to enhance the Trust&#8217;s customer service and for marketing and promotional purposes. The collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations. Compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase the Trust&#8217;s operating costs and/or adversely impact its ability to service its guests and market its products, properties and services to its guests. In addition, non-compliance with applicable privacy regulations by the Trust (or in some circumstances non-compliance by third parties engaged by the Trust) could result in fines or restrictions on its use or transfer of data. 

&#160; 

SEASONALITY OF THE HOTEL BUSINESS 

&#160; 

The Hotels&#8217; operations historically have been somewhat seasonal. The two southern Arizona hotels experience their highest occupancy in the first fiscal quarter and, to a lesser extent, the fourth fiscal quarter. The second fiscal quarter tends to be the lowest occupancy period at the two southern Arizona hotels. This seasonality pattern can be expected to cause fluctuations in the Trust&#8217;s quarterly revenues. The two hotels located in California and New Mexico historically experience their most profitable periods during the second and third fiscal quarters (the summer season), providing some balance to the general seasonality of the Trust&#8217;s hotel business. 

&#160; 

The seasonal nature of the Trust&#8217;s business increases its vulnerability to risks such as labor force shortages and cash flow issues. Further, if an adverse event such as an actual or threatened terrorist attack, international conflict, data breach, regional economic downturn or poor weather conditions should occur during the first or fourth fiscal quarters, the adverse impact to the Trust&#8217;s revenues could likely be greater as a result of its southern Arizona seasonal business.
