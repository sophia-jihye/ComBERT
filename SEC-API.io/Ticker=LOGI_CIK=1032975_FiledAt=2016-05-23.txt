 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Company Overview 

Logitech is a world leader in designing products that have an everyday place in people's lives, connecting them to the digital experiences they care about. Over 30 years ago Logitech started connecting people through computers, and now it&#8217;s designing products that bring people together through music, gaming, video and computing. 

Logitech was founded in Switzerland in 1981, and Logitech International S.A. has been the parent holding company of Logitech since 1988. Logitech International S.A. is a Swiss holding company with its registered office in Apples, Switzerland, which conducts its business through subsidiaries in Americas (including North and South America), EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) and Asia Pacific (including, among other countries, China, Taiwan, Japan and Australia). Shares of Logitech International S.A. are listed on both the SIX Swiss Exchange, under the trading symbol LOGN, and the Nasdaq Global Select Market, under the trading symbol LOGI. References in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the "Company," "Logitech," "we," "our," and "us" refer to Logitech International S.A. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 

Logitech designs, manufactures and markets products that allow people to connect through music, gaming, video, computing, and other digital platforms. Our products participate in five large markets that all have growth potential: 

&#8226; 

Music: This market is comprised of both wired and wireless devices that capitalize on the rapid growth of streaming music. Products in this category include mobile speakers, wearables, and headsets connecting to all music services used on both PCs and mobile devices. 

&#8226; 

Gaming: The Gaming market includes products designed for the PCs and consoles as well as gaming devices designed to deliver experiences such as virtual and augmented reality. The rapid rise of eSports, and the promise of new implementations in virtual and augmented reality present growth opportunities in this market. Our products in Gaming include gaming mice and keyboards, gaming headsets, gamepads and steering wheels. 

&#8226; 

Video Collaboration: Video Collaboration is focused on delivering solutions that enable real-time video, audio and content sharing capability to businesses and individuals. With the rapid adoption of cloud-based solutions that can lower the cost of adoption, our devices and solutions enable the rapid deployment of these cloud-based services through our platform agnostic, and easy to use end points and peripherals. 

&#8226; 

Home: The connected home is a market in its early stages of formation and growth. The push to realize the vision of the internet-of-things is delivering more and more connected devices that populate our homes, from the more traditionally connected devices like set-top boxes and digital entertainment devices to things like appliances, lighting, door locks and thermostats. We have a foundation for growth in this market through our entertainment control capabilities in devices such as our Harmony products. 

&#8226; 

Creativity and Productivity: &#32; This market is defined by products that enhance the users&#8217; experiences associated with computing platforms. With ever increasing connectivity globally and the consistent growth in time spent by people on these computing platforms, we believe there are meaningful growth opportunities for our products. Our continued innovation in navigation, input and content creation on these platforms can drive growth in this market despite the secular decline of new PC sales. Pointing Devices, Keyboards &#38; Combos, Tablet &#38; Other Accessories, and PC Webcams comprise our product categories that address this market. 

We sell our products to a broad network of domestic and international customers, including direct sales to retailers, e-tailers, and indirect sales through distributors. Our worldwide retail network includes consumer electronics distributors, retailers, mass merchandisers, specialty electronics stores, computer and telecommunications stores, value-added resellers and online merchants. 

In fiscal years prior to fiscal year 2016, we had two segments: Peripherals, including retail and OEM products; and Lifesize Video Conferencing. During fiscal year 2016, we divested the Lifesize Video Conferencing segment, and exited the OEM business. Our financial results treat the Lifesize segment as discontinued operations for all the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result, sales of products through our retail channels represented 96% , 94% &#32;and 93% &#32;of our net sales for the fiscal years 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively.

Recent Developments 

&#160; 

On April 20, 2016, we acquired Jaybird LLC of Salt Lake City, Utah, ("Jaybird") for approximately $50 million in cash, with an additional earn-out of up to $45 million based on achievement of growth targets over two years. Jaybird is a leader in wireless audio wearables for sports and active lifestyles, and the acquisition of Jaybird expands our long-term growth potential in our Music market. 

On December 28, 2015, we and Lifesize, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Logitech that held the assets of our Lifesize video conferencing reportable segment ("Lifesize"), entered into a stock purchase agreement with entities associated with three venture capital firms, or the Venture Investors. Immediately following the December 28, 2015 closing of the transaction, the Venture Investors held 62.5% of the outstanding shares of Lifesize, which resulted in a divestiture of the Lifesize video conferencing business by us. The historical results of operations and the financial position of Lifesize are included in the consolidated financial statements of Logitech and are reported as discontinued operations within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We exited our OEM business during our fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2015. The results of our OEM business are included in our financial statements as part of continuing operations for the nine months ended December 31, 2015 and prior periods. There is no revenue or cost associated with our OEM business in the three months ended March 31, 2016 and we do not expect any such revenue or cost in future periods. 

Industry Overview 

Historically, Logitech's business has been driven by the same trends that drove the adoption of desktop and laptop PCs for consumers, businesses and institutional applications, including the growth in affordable processing power, communications bandwidth, the increased accessibility of digital content, and the growing and pervasive use of the Internet for productivity, communication and entertainment. These trends have created opportunities for new applications, new users and dramatically richer interaction between people and digital content. 

In the last several years, the PC market has changed dramatically and there continues to be weakness in the global market for new PCs. Traditionally, the trends in the PC market have dictated sales in our PC-related categories however the aging installed base is creating new opportunities for users to refresh their computing experience with new peripherals. The gaming platform continues to show strong growth as online gaming and multi-platform experiences gain greater popularity. Our Video Collaboration business shows growth with the proliferation of meeting rooms yet to be enabled with HD videoconferencing capabilities. 

The decline in shipments of new desktop PCs, combined with the increased interest in smaller, touch-interfaced mobile computing devices (such as smartphones and tablets) has rapidly changed the market for PC peripherals. The installed base of PC users is large in our traditional mature markets (the United States, Canada, Western and Nordic Europe, Japan and Australia), but we believe consumer demand for new PCs will continue to decline in future years. We do see nonetheless, some opportunities created by consumer desire to refresh their old PC with new peripherals and in new trends developing within the PC and mobile computing markets. 

&#32;As the PC market declined, there has been growth in the popularity of smaller, mobile computing devices, such as tablets and smartphones with touch interfaces, which have created new markets and usage models for mobile peripherals and accessories. Logitech offers peripherals and accessories to enhance the use of such digital platforms. For today's consumers, listening to music is a popular entertainment activity, fueled by the growth in smartphones, tablets, music services and internet radio. Consumers are optimizing their audio experiences on their tablets and smartphones with wireless mobile speakers that pair easily with their mobile devices and with in-ear and other headphones. Our mobile speakers and in-ear headphone products target a large and growing market that reflects the increasing popularity of mobile devices for accessing digital music. Additionally, within the music market, consumers are increasingly listening to wireless earphones while they undertake other activities such as athletics. Consumers are also enhancing their tablet experience with a range of keyboards and cases that enable them to create, consume and do more with their tablets conveniently and comfortably. 

The use of video across multiple platforms&#8212;PCs, laptops and mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones&#8212;is a continuing trend. The video communication industry continues to make progress towards a vision in which people can conduct a video call from any of these platforms to any other platform. The market opportunity to provide innovative, affordable, and easy to use video collaboration products to the millions of small to medium sized meeting rooms lacking video is substantial, and we are well-positioned to take advantage of it. 

Logitech International S.A. | Fiscal 2016 Form 10-K | 4 

The trend among businesses and institutions to embrace cloud video conferencing is driving our Video Collaboration category, and offers a long-term growth opportunity for Logitech. For businesses and institutions, video conferencing is increasingly substituted for travel, because of high travel costs as well as the productivity gain that can be achieved by a high-quality face-to-face meeting that does not require travel away from the office. Further, with the increased availability of higher Internet bandwidth, video conferencing is becoming a key component of Unified Communications, which is the integration of communications solutions such as voicemail, e-mail, chat, presentation sharing and live video meetings. 

The home is also an important place for technological development, particularly as increasing amounts of objects become connected smart home devices such as light bulbs, security locks, thermostats etc. Logitech&#8217;s line of universal remote controls control electronic devices around the home as well as these other smart devices. 

Finally, we believe that trends established in consumer technology, such as brand identity, affordability, ease of installation and use, customer support, and design, have become important aspects of the purchase decision when buying a consumer electronics product. These are strengths that we believe Logitech offers in both consumer and enterprise markets. 

Business Strategy 

Logitech's foundation for future growth is built on: 

&#8226; Powerful design &#32;- design experiences that transcend their functional value and are loved by people; 

&#8226; Revitalized product creation for existing and new categories; 

&#8226; Augment a winning, talented and passionate global team; 

&#8226; Outstanding execution and operational excellence; and 

&#8226; Delivering operating leverage to improve profitability and to create the capacity to invest in growth. 

We are focusing our investments in product categories with growth opportunities in which we can leverage our areas of expertise, competitive advantages and technology. 

Our product development process and responsiveness to consumers have become faster. We laid the foundation in fiscal year 2014 for building a design company that leverages technology, innovation and consumer insights. We are continuing to build on this foundation by making design a more integral part of our product development with the goals of creating fewer but more impactful products while increasing consumer satisfaction. 

We continually review our product offerings and our strategic direction in light of our profitability targets, competitive conditions, changing consumer trends, and the evolving nature of the interface between the consumer and the digital world. We continue to evaluate and phase out products as part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen our overall portfolio. 

Our turnaround strategy, which we originally outlined in May 2013, has been a success to date and we continue to transform Logitech into a simpler, faster, growing company. We are focused on design and innovation driving a diverse portfolio of brands and product categories that will deliver both growth and profitability. In addition to exiting our OEM business and divesting our Lifesize video conferencing business, we continue to streamline our overall cost structure through product, overhead and infrastructure cost reductions. The savings from all these actions will be used to offset currency headwinds and invest in future growth. 

Product Strategy 

To take advantage of the opportunities we anticipate in the growing digital marketplace, Logitech's product strategy focuses on enabling and enhancing the multiple interfaces for input, navigation, audio and video across the many digital devices used by today's consumers and enterprises in our five large market opportunities. 

Music 

Logitech has a solid foundation of audio solutions designed to satisfy consumers' needs for music consumption sourced from a variety of platforms. Our music solutions are focused primarily on Mobile Speakers, including our UE BOOM family of mobile wireless speakers, our Jaybird wireless audio wearables for sports and active lifestyles, and our custom in-ear headphones. We enhance our mobile speakers with related applications that 

Logitech International S.A. | Fiscal 2016 Form 10-K | 5 

allow consumers to control the speakers through their mobile devices, including features such as Double Up and Block Party to combine two or more speakers with double or stereo sound. 

Gaming 

Our Gaming strategy is to leverage our deep research and development (R&#38;D) expertise in the areas of PC peripherals and gaming devices to build the most advanced gaming gear on the market. We develop our software development kits, intelligent illumination, G-Key Macros and Arx Control application to better integrate our products with games and provide gamers with differentiated experiences that enhance gameplay. In addition, we sponsor and work closely with eSports athletes to enhance our brand and the quality and functionality of our gaming products. 

Video Collaboration 

The market opportunity to provide innovative, affordable, and easy to use video collaboration products to the millions of meeting rooms lacking video (especially so-called huddle rooms), is substantial, and we are well positioned to take advantage of it. Over the past year, we have built momentum with our award winning ConferenceCam family that provides all-in-one video and audio conferencing solutions, including Logitech GROUP, CONNECT, and the CC3000e. 

Home 

Logitech's Harmony brand is well recognized as the leader in programmable, performance remote controls for home entertainment, leveraging our proprietary database. We built on this expertise in remote controls and our Harmony brand to develop devices to control the digital home, and Harmony products are now being used by many consumers to control a broad range of their connected home devices. We believe this provides a strong foundation to expand beyond the remote control category and create entirely new product categories dedicated to the smart home. 

Creativity and Productivity 

PC/Mac Accessories 

Logitech continues to provide new, innovative, high-performance PC and Mac computer navigation devices and audio and video products for the large installed base of PC and Mac computers for the consumer and enterprise markets. 

Tablet &#38; Other Accessories 

We are focusing on innovating new features and products to provide excellent consumer experience, and on reducing product cycle time to address the evolving market demand and frequent introductions of new devices. We have developed a range of products for the tablet market, for both Apple and Android platforms. We believe there will be additional opportunities for complementary peripherals to enhance consumers' experiences with tablets and other mobile devices. 

Design and Technological Innovation 

Logitech seeks to fulfill the increasing demand for interfaces between people and the expanding digital world across multiple platforms and user environments. The interface evolves as platforms, user models and our target markets evolve. As access to digital information has expanded, we have extended our focus beyond the PC to other entry and control points to the internet and digital world, including mobile devices and the meeting room. All of these platforms require interfaces that are customized according to how the devices are used. We believe this expansion of access points provides additional attractive opportunities for Logitech because the relevance and importance of navigation, interaction, video and audio interfaces and applications remain substantially the same across platforms. 

We recognize that continued investment in product research and development is critical to facilitate innovation of new and improved products and technologies. These products have been earning prestigious design awards and enthusiastic reviews in the media - more than 70 design awards over the past three years. This is an important indication that Logitech&#8217;s strategic aim to become a design company is working. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 alone, we won five GOOD DESIGN awards, eight iF Design awards and a record for us, nine Red Dot awards. Our research and development expenses for fiscal years 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;were $113.6 million , $108.3 

Logitech International S.A. | Fiscal 2016 Form 10-K | 6 

million &#32;and $112.4 million , respectively. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to research and development, including devices for digital platforms, video communications, wireless technologies, power management, user interfaces and device database management to sustain our competitive position. 

Logitech is committed to meeting consumer needs for peripheral devices and other kinds of accessories, and believes that design, innovation, value and product quality are important elements in gaining market acceptance and strengthening our market position.

Sales and Distribution 

Our sales and marketing activities are organized into three geographic regions: Americas (North and South America), EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) and Asia Pacific (China, Japan, Australia, Taiwan, India and other countries). 

We primarily sell our products to a network of distributors and retailers. We support these channels with third-party distribution centers located in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. Some of these distribution centers perform product localization with local language manuals, packaging and power plugs. 

Logitech directly sells products to distributors and large retailers. Distributors in North America include Ingram Micro, Tech Data Corporation, D&#38;H Distributing, and Synnex Corporation. In Europe, pan-European distributors include Ingram Micro, Tech Data, and Gem Distribution. We also sell to many regional distributors such as Actebis GmbH in Germany and Copaco Dc B.V. in the Netherlands. In Asia, major distributors include Beijing Digital China Limited in China, Daiwabo in Japan, and the pan-Asian distributor, Ingram Micro. Our distributor customers typically resell products to retailers, value-added resellers, systems integrators and other distributors with whom Logitech does not have a direct relationship.

In fiscal years 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , Ingram Micro Inc. and its affiliated entities together accounted 14% , 15% &#32;and 15% &#32;of our net sales, respectively. In fiscal year 2016 &#32;Amazon Inc. and its affiliated entities together accounted for 10% &#32;of our net sales. No other customer individually accounted for more than 10% of our net sales during fiscal years 2016 , 2015 &#32;or 2014 . The material terms of our distribution agreements with Ingram Micro and its affiliated entities are summarized as follows: 

&#8226; 

The agreements are non-exclusive in the particular territory and contain no minimum purchase requirements. 

&#8226; 

Each agreement may be terminated for convenience at any time by either party. Most agreements provide for termination on 30 days written notice from either party, with two Ingram Micro agreements providing for termination on 90 days notice. 

&#8226; 

We generally offer an allowance for marketing activities equal to a negotiated percentage of sales and volume rebates related to purchase volumes or sales of specific products to specified retailers. These terms vary by agreement. 

&#8226; 

Most agreements allow price protection credits to be issued for on-hand or in-transit new inventory if we, in our sole discretion, lower the price of the product. 

&#8226; 

We grant limited stock rotation return rights, which vary by agreement. 

The material terms of our distribution agreements with Amazon and its affiliated entities are summarized as follows:

&#8226; 

We generally offer an allowance for marketing activities equal to a negotiated percentage of sales through transactions and additional rebates related to sales of specific products to end users. These terms vary by agreement. 

&#8226; 

Most agreements allow price protection credits to be issued for on-hand or in-transit new inventory if we, in our sole discretion, lower the price of the product.

Logitech's products can be purchased in most major retail chains, where we typically have access to significant shelf space. These chains in the U.S. include Best Buy, Wal-Mart, Staples, Office Depot and Target. In Europe, chains include Metro Group (Media-Saturn Group), Carrefour Group, Kesa Electricals, Fnac, and Dixons Stores Group PLC. Logitech products can also be purchased online either directly from Logitech.com or through e-tailers, such as Amazon.com, the websites of our major retail chains noted previously, and others. Logitech products are also carried by business-to-business direct market resellers such as CDW, Insight, Zones, PC Connection, and SHI. 

Through our operating subsidiaries, we maintain sales offices or sales representatives in approximately 43 countries. 

Backlog 

We typically have a relatively small amount of orders at the end of our fiscal periods that we have received but have not shipped, which is referred to as backlog. In our experience, the amount of backlog at any particular fiscal period-end is not a meaningful indication of our future business prospects. 

Customer Service and Technical Support 

Our customer service organization provides user technical support, support related to product inquiry, and order support. We support these customer service functions with an outsourced operation that has support centers located in the Philippines, Mexico, and Northern Ireland. 

Logitech maintains customer service and technical support capabilities in the United States, Canada, Europe, and the Asia Pacific region. Customer service and technical personnel provide support services to retail purchasers of products through telephone, e-mail, forums, chat, facsimile and the Logitech Web site. Logitech provides warranties on our branded products that range from one to three years. 

In Korea, India and China, there are multiple locations where consumers may obtain service for their Logitech products. These locations are managed by a third party logistics provider. Consumers who have purchased Logitech products can visit these locations for product inspection, and return or exchange of products. Within China, there is also a mail-in center to provide these services for more remote locations in China.

Manufacturing 

Logitech's manufacturing operations consist principally of final assembly and testing. Since 1994, we have had our own manufacturing operations in Suzhou, China, which currently handles approximately half of our total production of products. We continue to focus on ensuring the efficiency of the Suzhou facilities, through the implementation of quality management, automation, process improvements, and employee involvement programs. We outsource the remaining production to contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers located in Asia. Both our in-house and outsourced manufacturing operations are managed by our worldwide operations group. The worldwide operations group also supports the business units and marketing and sales organizations through management of distribution centers, the supply chain, and the provision of technical support, and other services. 

New product launches, process engineering, commodities management, logistics, quality assurance, operations management and management of Logitech's contract manufacturers occur in Hsinchu, Taiwan, Malaysia, Suzhou, China, Shenzhen, China and Hong Kong, China. Certain components are manufactured to Logitech's specifications by vendors in Asia, the United States and Europe. We also use contract manufacturers to supplement internal capacity and to reduce volatility in production volumes. In addition, some products, including most keyboards, certain gaming devices, certain audio products are manufactured by third-party suppliers to Logitech's specifications. Retail product localization with local language manuals, packaging, and power plugs may be performed at distribution centers in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. 

Our hybrid model of in-house manufacturing and third-party contract manufacturers allows us to effectively respond to rapidly changing demand and leverage economies of scale. Through our high-volume manufacturing operations located in Suzhou, China, we believe we have been able to maintain strong quality process controls and have realized significant cost efficiencies. Our Suzhou operation provides for increased production capacity, manufacturing know-how, IP protection and greater flexibility in responding to product demand. Further, by outsourcing the manufacturing of certain products, we seek to reduce volatility in production volumes as well as improve time to market. 

Competition 

Our product categories are characterized by large, well-financed competitors, short product life cycles, continual performance enhancements, and rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors in our retail markets. We have experienced aggressive price competition and other promotional activities from our primary competitors and from less-established brands, including brands owned by some retail customers known as house brands. We may also encounter more competition if any of our competitors in one or more categories decide to enter other categories in which we currently operate. 

As we target opportunities in new categories and markets, we are confronting new competitors, many of which may have more experience in the categories or markets and have greater marketing resources and brand name recognition than we have. In addition, because of the continuing convergence of the markets for computing devices and consumer electronics, we expect greater competition in the future from well-established consumer electronics companies in our developing categories, as well as future ones we might enter. Many of these companies have greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we have. 

We expect continued competitive pressure in our business, including in the terms and conditions that our competitors offer customers, which may be more favorable than our terms and conditions, and may require us to take actions to increase our customer incentive programs, which could impact our revenues and operating margins. 

Music &#160; 

Mobile Speakers: Our competitors for Bluetooth wireless speakers include Bose, JBL, Harman Kardon, and Beats. Bose is our largest competitor. Apple's ownership of Beats may impact our access to shelf space in Apple retail stores and adversely impact our ability to succeed in this important growth market. Personal assistance and other devices that offer music, such as Amazon's Echo, may also compete with our products. Amazon is also a significant distributor for our products. 

Audio-PC &#38; Wearables: In the PC speakers business, our competitors include Bose, Cyber Acoustics, Phillips and Creative Labs, Inc. In the PC headset business, our main competitors include Plantronics and Altec Lansing. In-ear headphones competitors include Skull Candy, Sennheiser, Sony, Beats, and others. 

Gaming &#160; 

Competitors for our Gaming products include Razer USA Ltd., SteelSeries, and Turtle Beach. 

Logitech International S.A. | Fiscal 2016 Form 10-K | 11 

Video Collaboration 

Our competitors for Video Collaboration products include Cisco Systems, Inc., Polycom, Inc., and Avaya, Inc. 

Home &#160; 

&#8226; 

Direct competitors in the remote control market include pro-installer-focused Universal Remote Control Inc., and new &#8220;DIY&#8221; entrants from Savant Systems and Ray Enterprises. Indirect competition exists in the form of low-end &#8220;replacement remotes&#8221; such as Sony, RCA, GE, pure app-based solutions such as Peel, as well as device and/or subscriber-specific solutions from TV makers such as Samsung and Vizio and multiple-system operator (MSOs) such as Comcast and DirecTV. 

&#8226; 

Competition in the home control market exists in form of home automation platforms such as Smart Things (owned by Samsung), Amazon with their Echo product, Nest (owned by Google), Wink and many other startups in the space. Many of these products and brands are partners with Logitech as well via integrations with Harmony remotes. 

Creativity and Productivity 

Pointing Devices: &#32;Microsoft Corporation and Hewlett Packard are our main competitors. We also experience competition and pricing pressure from less-established brands, including house brands, which we believe have impacted our market share in some sales geographies. 

Keyboards &#38; Combos: Microsoft Corporation, Hewlett Packard and Apple Inc. are our main competitors in our PC mice and keyboard product lines. We also experience competition and pricing pressure for corded and cordless mice and combos from less-established brands, including house brands. 

Tablet &#38; Other Accessories: Competitors in the tablet case market include Apple, Otter, Speck and a large number of small brands. Competitors in the tablet keyboard market are Zagg, Kensington, Belkin, Targus and other less-established brands. Although we are the leaders in the tablet keyboard market and continue to bring innovative offerings to the market, we expect the competition may increase. 

PC Webcams: Our primary competitors for PC webcams are Microsoft Corporation and Hewlett Packard. 

Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights 

Intellectual property rights that apply to Logitech's products and services include patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets. 

We hold various United States patents and pending applications, together with corresponding patents and pending applications from other countries. While we believe that patent protection is important, we also believe that patents are of less competitive significance than factors such as technological expertise and innovation, ease of use, and quality design. No single patent is in itself essential to Logitech as a whole. From time to time we receive claims that we may be infringing on patents or other intellectual property rights of others. As appropriate, claims are referred to counsel, and current claims are in various stages of evaluation and negotiation. If necessary or desirable, we may seek licenses for certain intellectual property rights. Refer also to the discussion in Item 1A, Risk Factors&#8212;"We may be unable to protect our proprietary rights. Unauthorized use of our technology may result in the development of products that compete with our products." and "Claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology could adversely affect our business." 

To distinguish genuine Logitech products from competing products and counterfeit products, Logitech has used, registered, or applied to register certain trademarks and trade names in the U.S. and in other countries and jurisdictions. Logitech enforces its trademark and trade name rights in the U.S. and in other countries. In addition, the software for Logitech's products and services is entitled to copyright protection, and we generally require our customers to obtain a software license before providing them with that software. We also protect details about our products and services as trade secrets through employee training, license and non-disclosure agreements, technical measures and other reasonable efforts to preserve confidentiality. 

Environmental Regulation 

We are subject to laws and regulations in many jurisdictions regulating the materials used in our products and, increasingly, product-related energy consumption, and the recycling of our products, batteries and packaging. 

Logitech International S.A. | Fiscal 2016 Form 10-K | 12 

Europe. In Europe we are subject to the European Union's (EU's) RoHS (Restriction of Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronics Equipment) Directive 2011/65/EU, or RoHS 2. This directive restricts the placement into the EU market of electrical and electronic equipment containing certain hazardous materials including lead, mercury, cadmium, chromium, and halogenated flame-retardants. All Logitech products are covered by the directive and have been modified, if necessary, to be RoHS 2 compliant. Logitech has an active program to ensure compliance with the RoHS 2 directive and to ensure RoHS 2 compliant components and manufacturing methods in order to comply with the requirements of the directive including issuing of a declaration of conformity and marking the product with the 'CE' mark. 

Logitech is also subject to the EU's ErP (Energy-related Products) Directive, which aims to encourage manufacturers and importers to produce products designed to minimize overall environmental impact. Under the Directive, manufacturers must ensure that their energy-related products comply with applicable requirements, issue a declaration of conformity and mark the product with the 'CE' mark. The Directive does not have binding requirements for specific products, but does define conditions and criteria for setting, through subsequent implementing measures, requirements regarding environmentally relevant product characteristics. To date the following implementing measures within the ErP Directive are active and applicable to Logitech products: 

&#8226; 

1275/2008: Eco-design requirements for standby and off mode electric power consumption of electrical and electronic household and office equipment. 

&#8226; 

278/2009: Eco-design requirements for no-load condition power consumption and average active efficiency of external power supplies. 

Logitech has assessed the applicability of implementing these measures on relevant product lines and has taken steps to ensure that our products meet the requirements. Adoption of the ErP Directive will be aligned in all EU member states, and we expect conformity will be demonstrated by Logitech in conjunction with current CE conformity marking requirements. Similar requirements exist in the four member states of the European Free Trade Association (Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland). Such requirements are substantially met by compliance with the ErP Directive. 

We are also subject to a number of EOL (End of Life) Stewardship directives including the EU's WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) Directive, the EU Packaging Directive and the EU Battery Directive, which require producers of electrical goods, packaging and batteries to be financially responsible for costs of specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of covered products. Where applicable, we have provided for the estimated costs, which are not material, of managing and recycling historical and future waste equipment, packaging and batteries. Logitech has also assessed the applicability of the European REACH Directive (Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006 for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restrictions of Chemicals). Logitech is not subject to aspects of this Directive which relate to chemical substance import and control due to our current manufacturing structure. The aspect of this Directive that relates to product content does impact Logitech, and we have taken steps to ensure that all substances of very high concern (on a list of candidate substances for authorization that is published on the EU Agency-Web site) present in products above a concentration limit are eliminated in subsequent product designs or notified per the Directive requirements. Additions to this list of candidate substances are reviewed on a regular basis to give consideration to any updates to the substances of very high concern (SVHC) list performed by the relevant EU agency. 

China. In China we are subject to China's law on Management Methods on the Control of Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products (China RoHS). This is substantially similar to the EU RoHS Directive, and as such, Logitech products are already compliant. China RoHS requires additional labeling of product that will be shipped in China and Logitech has taken steps to help ensure we comply with these requirements. 

United States and Canada. In the U.S., we are subject to, among other laws, Appliance Efficiency Regulations adopted via the U.S. Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The regulations set out standards for the energy consumption performance of products within the scope of the regulations, which includes some of Logitech's products. The standards apply to appliances sold or offered for sale throughout the U.S., and Logitech has redesigned or changed products to comply with these regulations. We are also subject to California's Proposition 65, which requires that clear and reasonable warnings be given to consumers who are exposed to certain chemicals deemed by the state of California to be dangerous. 

Logitech is also subject to the requirement as set out by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, specifically Section 1502, which addresses the use of "Conflict Minerals" in the supply chain. We have established systems which facilitate our compliance with the sourcing and traceability obligations and the reporting requirements of this Act aligned with guidelines published by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Logitech International S.A. | Fiscal 2016 Form 10-K | 13 

As an EICC (Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition) member, Logitech is participating in the industry-wide Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative and its Conflict Free Smelter Program by which these requirements will be met. 

In addition, the Transparency in Supply Chain Act of 2010 (S.B. 657) is effective from Logitech's fiscal year 2012. The law requires all retailers and manufacturers of tangible products who do business in California and have annual worldwide gross receipts exceeding $100 million to disclose on their company websites their efforts to combat forced labor and human trafficking in their own supply chains. Logitech's disclosure is posted on our Web site, www.logitech.com. 

In Canada and the United States, we are subject to laws in various Canadian provinces and U.S. states that impose fees to cover the cost of end of life responsible disposal and recycling of packaging, product and batteries. These laws require producers of electrical goods, packaging and batteries to be financially responsible for costs of specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of covered products. Where applicable, we have provided for the estimated costs, which are not material, of managing and recycling historical and future waste equipment, packaging and batteries. 

Australia and New Zealand. In Australia and New Zealand, we are subject to the MEPS (Minimum Energy Performance Standards) regulations. These regulations set out standards for the energy consumption performance of products within the scope of the regulations, which includes some of Logitech's products. We have taken steps to modify products to ensure they are in compliance with MEPS. 

We expect further laws governing product and packaging recycling to be introduced in other jurisdictions, many or most of which could impose fees to cover recycling costs, the cumulative impact of which could be significant. If such legislation is enacted in other countries, Logitech intends to develop compliance programs as necessary. However, until that time, we are not able to estimate any possible impact. 

The effects on Logitech's business of complying with other government regulations are limited to the cost of agency fees and testing, as well as the time required to obtain agency approvals. There are also stewardship costs associated with the end of life collection, recycling and recovery of Logitech products, packaging and batteries where Logitech is recognized as the steward and participates in relevant programs. The costs and schedule requirements are industry requirements and therefore do not represent an undue burden relative to Logitech's competitive position. As regulations change, we will modify our products or processes to address those changes. 

Seasonality 

Our product sales are typically seasonal. Sales are generally highest during our third fiscal quarter (October to December) primarily due to the increased demand for our products during the year-end holiday buying season. Due to the timing of our new product introductions, we believe that year-over-year comparisons are more indicative of variability in our results of operations than current quarter to prior quarter comparisons. 

Materials 

We purchase certain products and key components used in our products from a limited number of sources. If the supply of these products or key components, such as micro-controllers and optical sensors, were to be delayed or constrained, or if one or more of our single-source suppliers goes out of business, we might be unable to find a new supplier on acceptable terms, or at all, and our shipments to our customers could be delayed. In addition, lead times for materials, components and products ordered by us or by our contract manufacturers can vary significantly and depend on factors such as contract terms, demand for a component, our ability to forecast product demand, and supplier capacity. From time to time, we have experienced component shortages and extended lead times on semiconductors, such as micro-controllers and optical sensors, and base metals used in our products. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of components or subcontracted products, or our inability to procure these components or products from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could delay shipment of our products or increase our production costs. 

Employees 

As of March 31, 2016 &#32;we employed approximately 5,900 regular employees, of which approximately 3,250 employees are in our Suzhou manufacturing facility, and from the remaining 2,650 regular employees, approximately 600 are dedicated to research and development. None of Logitech's U.S. employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Certain other countries, such as China, provide by law for employee rights, which include requirements similar to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our employee relations are good.
