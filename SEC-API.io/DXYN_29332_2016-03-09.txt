BUSINESS 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Our business consists principally of marketing, manufacturing and selling carpet and rugs to high-end residential and commercial customers through our various sales forces and brands. A small portion of our manufacturing capacity is used to provide carpet and yarn related services to other manufacturers. 

From 1920 until 1993 we were exclusively in the textile business. We sold our textile assets and began acquiring floorcovering businesses in 1993. We focus exclusively on the upper-end of the soft floorcovering market where we believe we have strong brands and competitive advantages with our style and design capabilities and customer relationships. 

Our business is concentrated in areas of the soft floorcovering markets where innovative styling, design, color, quality and service, as well as limited distribution, are welcomed and rewarded. Our Fabrica, Masland, and Dixie Home brands have a significant presence in the high-end residential soft floorcovering markets. Our Atlas Carpet Mills, Masland Contract and Masland Hospitality brands, participate in the upper end specified commercial marketplace. Dixie International sells all of our brands outside of the North American market. Our brands are well known, highly regarded and complementary; by being differentiated, we offer meaningful alternatives to the discriminating customer. 

We have one line of business, carpet and rug manufacturing. 

Our Brands 

Fabrica &#32;markets and manufactures luxurious residential carpet and custom rugs, at selling prices that we believe are approximately five times the average for the residential soft floorcovering industry. Its primary customers are interior decorators and designers, selected retailers and furniture stores, luxury home builders and manufacturers of luxury motor coaches and yachts. Fabrica is among the leading premium brands in the domestic marketplace and is known for styling innovation and unique colors and patterns. Fabrica consists of made-to-order, hand-crafted, extremely high quality carpets and area rugs in both nylon and wool, with a wide variety of patterns and textures. Fabrica is viewed by the trade as the premier quality brand for very high-end carpet and enjoys an established reputation as a styling trendsetter and a market leader in providing both custom and designer products to the very high-end residential sector. 

Masland Residential , founded in 1866, markets and manufactures design-driven specialty carpets and rugs for the high-end residential marketplace. Its residential and commercial broadloom carpet products are marketed at selling prices that we believe are over three times the average for the residential soft floorcovering industry. Its products are marketed through the interior design community, as well as to consumers through specialty floorcovering retailers. Masland Residential has strong brand recognition within the upper-end residential market. Masland Residential competes through innovative styling, color, product design, quality and service with products made of both wool and nylon. 

Dixie Home &#32;provides stylishly designed, differentiated products that offer affordable fashion to residential consumers. Dixie Home markets an array of tufted broadloom residential and commercial carpet to selected retailers and home centers under the Dixie Home and private label brands. Its objective is to make the Dixie Home brand the choice for styling, service and quality in the more moderately priced sector of the high-end broadloom residential carpet market. Its products are marketed at selling prices which we believe average two times the soft floorcovering industry's average selling price. 

Atlas Carpet Mills , acquired in 2014, is our premium commercial brand. Atlas has long been known for superior style and design. Atlas&#8217; focus is the specified design community including architects and designers who serve the upper end commercial marketplace. The Atlas brand has unique styling, as evident in both its broadloom and modular carpet tile product offerings. Atlas&#8217; high quality offerings are manufactured utilizing just in time manufacturing techniques in our California operations. 

Masland Contract markets and manufactures broadloom and modular carpet tile for the specified commercial marketplace. Its commercial products are marketed to the architectural and specified design community and directly to commercial end users, as well as to consumers through specialty floorcovering retailers. Masland Contract has strong brand recognition within the upper-end contract market, and competes through innovative styling, color, patterns, quality and service. 

Masland Hospitality , &#32; a new commercial business launched in 2014, is designed to focus on the hospitality market with both custom designed and running line products. Utilizing the computerized yarn placement technology we acquired with our Burtco acquisition in 2014, as well as offerings utilizing our state of the art Infinity tufting technology, this brand provides excellent service and design flexibility to the hospitality market serving upper-end hotels, conference centers and senior living markets. Its broadloom and rug product offerings are designed for the interior designer in the upper-end of the hospitality market who appreciates sophisticated texture, color and patterns with excellent service.

Industry 

&#160; 

The carpet and rug industry has two primary markets, residential and commercial, with the residential market making up the largest portion of the industry's sales. A substantial portion of industry shipments is made in response to replacement demand. Residential products consist of broadloom carpets and rugs in a broad range of styles, colors and textures. Commercial products consist primarily of broadloom carpet and modular carpet tile for a variety of institutional applications such as office buildings, restaurant chains, schools and other commercial establishments. The carpet industry also manufactures carpet for the automotive, recreational vehicle, small boat and other industries. 

The Carpet and Rug Institute (the "CRI") is the national trade association representing carpet and rug manufacturers. Information compiled by the CRI suggests that the domestic carpet and rug industry is comprised of fewer than 100 manufacturers, with a significant majority of the industry's production concentrated in a limited number of manufacturers focused on the lower end of the price curve. We believe that this industry focus provides us with opportunities to capitalize on our competitive strengths in selected markets where innovative styling, design, product differentiation, focused service and limited distribution add value. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The floorcovering industry is highly competitive. We compete with other carpet and rug manufacturers and other types of floorcoverings. In addition, the industry provides multiple floorcovering surfaces such as wood, luxury vinyl tile and laminate. Though soft floorcovering is still the dominant floorcovering surface, it has gradually lost market share to hard floorcovering surfaces over the last 25 years. We believe our products are among the leaders in styling and design in the high-end residential and high-end commercial carpet markets. However, a number of manufacturers produce competitive products and some of these manufacturers have greater financial resources than we do. 

We believe the principal competitive factors in our primary soft floorcovering markets are styling, color, product design, quality and service. In the high-end residential and high-end commercial markets, carpet competes with various other types of floorcoverings. Nevertheless, we believe we have competitive advantages in several areas. We have an attractive portfolio of brands that we believe are well known, highly regarded by customers and complementary; by being differentiated, we offer meaningful alternatives to the discriminating customer. We believe our investment in new yarns, such as Stainmaster's&#174; TruSoft&#8482; and PetProtect&#8482;, and innovative tufting and dyeing technologies, strengthens our ability to offer product differentiation to our customers. In addition, we have established longstanding relationships with key suppliers in our industry and customers in most of our markets. Finally, our reputation for innovative design excellence and our experienced management team enhance our competitive position. See "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this report. 

&#160; 

Backlog 

&#160; 

Sales order backlog is not material to understanding our business, due to relatively short lead times for order fulfillment in the markets for the vast majority of our products. 

&#160; 

Trademarks 

&#160; 

Our floorcovering businesses own a variety of trademarks under which our products are marketed. Among such trademarks, the names "Fabrica", "Masland", "Dixie Home", &#8220;Atlas Carpet Mills&#8221;, &#8220;Masland Contract&#8221; and "Masland Hospitality" are of greatest importance to our business. We believe that we have taken adequate steps to protect our interest in all significant trademarks. 

&#160; 

Customer and Product Concentration 

&#160; 

As a percentage of our net sales, one customer, Lowe's, a mass merchant, accounted for approximately 9% in 2015, 9% in 2014 and 13% in 2013. No other customer was more than 10 percent of our sales during the periods presented. During 2015, sales to our top ten customers accounted for 15% percent of our sales and our top 20 customers accounted for 18% percent of our sales. We do not make a material amount of sales in foreign countries. 

We do not have any single class of products that accounts for more than 10 percent of our sales. However, sales of our floorcovering products may be classified by significant end-user markets into which we sell, and such information for the past three years is summarized as follows:

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Our sales historically have normally reached their lowest level in the first quarter (approximately 23% of our annual sales), with the remaining sales being distributed relatively equally among the second, third and fourth quarters. Working capital requirements have normally reached their highest levels in the third and fourth quarters of the year. 

Environmental 

&#160; 

Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment. The costs of complying with environmental protection laws and regulations have not had a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations in the past and are not expected to have a material adverse impact in the future. See "Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A of this report. 

Raw Materials 

&#160; 

Our primary raw material is yarn. Nylon is the primary yarn we utilize and, to a lesser extent, wool and polyester yarn is used. Additionally, we utilize polypropylene carpet backing, latex, dyes and chemicals, and man-made topical applications in the construction of our products. Our synthetic yarns are purchased primarily from domestic fiber suppliers and wool is purchased from a number of domestic and international sources. Our other raw materials are purchased primarily from domestic suppliers. Where possible, we pass raw material price increases through to our customers; however, there can be no assurance that price increases can be passed through to customers and that increases in raw material prices will not have an adverse effect on our profitability. See "Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A of this report. We purchase a significant portion of our primary raw material (nylon yarn) from one supplier. We believe there are other sources of nylon yarn; however, an unanticipated termination or interruption of our supply arrangements could adversely affect our supplies of raw materials and could have a material effect on our operations. See "Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A of this report. 

&#160; 

Utilities 

&#160; 

We use electricity as our principal energy source, with oil or natural gas used in some facilities for dyeing and finishing operations as well as heating. We have not experienced any material problem in obtaining adequate supplies of electricity, natural gas or oil. Energy shortages of extended duration could have an adverse effect on our operations, and price volatility could negatively impact future earnings. See "Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A of this report. 

&#160; 

Working Capital 

&#160; 

We are required to maintain significant levels of inventory in order to provide the enhanced service levels demanded by the nature of our business and our customers, and to ensure timely delivery of our products. Consistent and dependable sources of liquidity are required to maintain such inventory levels. Failure to maintain appropriate levels of inventory could materially adversely affect our relationships with our customers and adversely affect our business. See "Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A of this report. 

&#160; 

Employment Level 

&#160; 

At December 26, 2015, we employed 1,822 associates in our operations.
