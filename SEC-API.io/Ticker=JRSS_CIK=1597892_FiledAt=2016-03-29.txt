Corporate Structure 

&#160;

Our present corporate structure is as follows:

&#160;

&#160; 

Our Business 

&#160;

We operate Jiarun Hospital, a private hospital with 650 open beds. Jiarun Hospital offers patients care and sale of medicine in the areas of both Western and Chinese medical practices to the residents of Harbin. Jiarun specializes in the areas of Pediatrics, Dermatology, Ears, Nose and Throat (ENT), Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Ophthalmology, Internal Medicine Dentistry, General Surgery, Rehabilitation Science, Gynecology, General Medical Services, etc. Our ambulances are open 24 hours a day.

&#160;

As a hospital in China, we must register with and maintain an operating license from the local Administration of Health.

&#160;

As is common in China, we generate revenues from providing both patients services and the sale of medicine, these two areas respectively making up 54% and 46% of the total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, 51% and 49% of the total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014.

&#160;

We generate revenues from medicine revenue and patient services:

&#160;

Medicine 

Revenue from the sale of medicine is recognized when it is both earned and realized. The Company&#8217;s policy is to recognize the sale of medicine when the title of the medicine, ownership and risk of loss have transferred to the purchasers, and collection of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured, all of which generally occur when the patient receives the medicine.

&#160;

Given the nature of this revenue source of the Company&#8217;s business and the applicable rules guiding revenue recognition, the revenue recognition practices for the sale of medicine do not contain estimates that materially affect results of operations nor any policy for return of products.

&#160;

The Company is serving patients on both Western and Traditional Chinese medicines to the citizens of Harbin.

&#160; 

Patient Services 

In accordance with the medical licenses of Jiarun, the approved medical patient service scope of the Company include medical consulting, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, anesthesia, clinic laboratory, medical imaging, and traditional Chinese medicine, etc.

Patient service revenue is recognized when it is both earned and realized. The Company&#8217;s policy is to recognize patient service revenue when the medical service has been provided to the patient and collection of the revenue is reasonably assured.

The Company provides services to both patients covered by social insurance and patients who are not covered by social insurance. The Company charges the same rates for patient services regardless of the coverage by social insurance.

&#160;

&#160;

Item 1. Business - continued 

&#160;

Patients who are not covered by social insurance are liable for the total cost of medical treatment.

&#160;

l For out-patient medical services, revenue is recognized when the Company provides medical service to the patient. The Company collects payment when the patient checks out from the hospital, which is the same day the services are provided. &#160;

l For in-patient medical services, the Company estimates the approximate fee the patients will spend in the hospital based on patients&#8217; symptom. This is when the patients check in to the hospital. At that time, the Company collects the estimated fees from the patient and records the payment as deposits received. &#160;

During the in-patient services period, the Company recognizes revenue when the patient service is provided and deducts the cost of service from the deposit received. The Company records these transactions based on daily reports generated by the respective medical department. When medical services exceed patient deposits received the Company records revenue and accounts receivable when the patient services are provided.

&#160;

When patients check out from the hospital, the Company calculates and determines the remaining deposit, if any, and refunds the unused portion of the deposit to the patients. In the case where the patients have a balance in accounts receivable during the in-patient period, accounts receivable are required to be paid in full at checkout.

&#160;

Patients covered by social insurance will receive a portion or full medical services reimbursed or paid by the social insurance agencies via prepaid cards or insurance claim settlement process.

&#160;

For the recent two years, the company&#8217;s revenue has been growing at a compound rate of approximately 65% annually, we have secured a new, much larger location to allow for our fast organic growth. Our operations moved into the new building in December of 2014.

&#160;

The hospital building, which put into use in December 2014, is being constructed by Harbin Baiyi Real Estate Development Co., Ltd (&#8220;the Leasor&#8221;), which is owned by Junsheng Zhang, a related party. The Company was leased from the Leasor by financial leasing, the price of leasing agreement referred to the local market price and audited by the auditor. The Leasing terms consist of 30 payments. Each payment will be made on an annual basis when RMB7,000,000 per payment will be paid upfront for each leasing period. The first payment was made on September 1st, 2014. At the end of the leasing period, a final payment will be made to settle the total leasing amount. Both parties agreed for the leasee to pay 3 million RMB as deposit at the execution of the Leasing agreement, which will be deducted from the final rental settlement. The lending interest rate was calculated at 6.55%, which is the benchmark interest rate announced from The People&#8217;s Bank of China. After the completion of all payments, the ownership of the lease item will be transferred to Jiarun.

&#160;

After our operating move into the new hospital building in December 2014, JHCC has established an Intensive Care Unit and a Hemodialysis Center department.

&#160;

JHCC also plans to acquire other hospitals and companies involved in the healthcare industry in the PRC using cash and shares of our common stock. Substantial capital may be needed for these acquisitions and we may need to raise additional funds through the sale of our common stock, debt financing or other arrangements. We do not have any commitments or arrangements from any person to provide us with any additional capital. Additional capital may not be available to us, or if available, on acceptable terms, in which case we would not be able to acquire other hospitals or businesses in the healthcare industry.

&#160;

Regulations pertaining to our Business 

&#160;

According to the PRC Regulation of Healthcare Institutions, hospitals shall register with the Administration of Health of the local government to obtain the necessary business license for the provision of hospital services. We received our business license from Harbin City government in February of 2006. Other existing regulations having material effects on our business include those dealing with physician's licensing, usage of medicine and injection, public security in health and medical advertising.
