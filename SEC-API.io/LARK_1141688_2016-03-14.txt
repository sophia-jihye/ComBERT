 ITEM 1. BUSINESS

&#160; 

The Company 

&#160;

Landmark Bancorp, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a bank holding company which was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 2001. Currently, the Company&#8217;s business consists solely of the ownership of Landmark National Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had $878.4 million in consolidated total assets.

&#160;

The Company is headquartered in Manhattan, Kansas and has expanded its geographic presence through past acquisitions. Effective November 1, 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of Citizens Bank, National Association (&#8220;Citizens Bank&#8221;). Effective April 1, 2012, the Company completed the acquisition of The Wellsville Bank. In May 2009, the Company acquired an additional branch in Lawrence, Kansas. The Company completed several other mergers and acquisitions prior to 2009.

&#160;

The Bank has continued to focus on increasing its originations of commercial, commercial real estate and agricultural loans, which management believes will be more profitable and provide more growth for the Bank than traditional one-to-four family residential real estate lending. While the Bank has grown these portfolios, generally weak loan demand over the past few years as the economy has recovered has made it difficult to have meaningful growth while maintaining high credit standards. Additionally, greater emphasis has been placed on diversification of the deposit mix through expansion of core deposit accounts such as checking, savings, and money market accounts. The Bank has also diversified its geographical markets as a result of its acquisitions. The Company&#8217;s main office is in Manhattan, Kansas. The Company has 29 branch offices in 23 communities across the state of Kansas. The Company continues to explore opportunities to expand its banking markets through mergers and acquisitions, as well as branching opportunities.

&#160;

The results of operations of the Bank and the Company are dependent primarily upon net interest income and, to a lesser extent, upon other income derived from sales of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, loan servicing fees and customer deposit services. Additional expenses of the Bank include general and administrative expenses such as salaries, employee benefits, federal deposit insurance premiums, data processing, occupancy and related expenses.

&#160;

Deposits of the Bank are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (the &#8220;DIF&#8221;) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#8220;FDIC&#8221;) up to the maximum amount allowable under applicable federal law and regulation. The Bank is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the &#8220;OCC&#8221;), as the chartering authority for national banks, and the FDIC, as the administrator of the DIF. The Bank is also subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;) with respect to reserves required to be maintained against deposits and certain other matters. The Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and the Federal Home Loan Bank (the &#8220;FHLB&#8221;) of Topeka.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s executive office and the Bank&#8217;s main office are located at 701 Poyntz Avenue, Manhattan, Kansas 66502. The telephone number is (785) 565-2000.

&#160; 

Market Areas 

&#160;

The Bank&#8217;s primary deposit gathering and lending markets are geographically diversified with locations in central, eastern, southeast, and southwest Kansas. The primary industries within these respective markets are also diverse and dependent upon a wide array of industry and governmental activity for their economic base. The Bank&#8217;s markets have not been immune to the effects of the challenging economic conditions of recent years; however, the effect has not been as severe as those experienced in some areas of the United States. To varying degrees, the Bank&#8217;s markets generally have experienced flat commercial and residential real estate values, unemployment levels above historical norms and slow growth in consumer spending. A brief description of the four geographic areas and the communities which the Bank serves is set forth below.

&#160;

The central region of the Bank&#8217;s market area consists of the Bank&#8217;s locations in Auburn, Junction City, Manhattan, Osage City, Topeka and Wamego, Kansas and includes the counties of Riley, Geary, Osage, Pottawatomie and Shawnee. The economies are significantly impacted by employment at Fort Riley Military Base in Junction City and Kansas State University, the second largest university in Kansas, which is located in Manhattan. Topeka is the capital of Kansas and strongly influenced by the government of the State of Kansas. Topeka and Manhattan are regional destinations for retail shopping as well as home to regional hospitals. Manhattan was also selected as the site of the new National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility, which is expected to have a significant impact on the regional economy as the facility is constructed and begins operations. Construction of the facility began in 2013 and is expected to be completed in five to seven years. Additionally, manufacturing and service industries also play a key role within the central Kansas market.

&#160;

The Bank&#8217;s eastern Kansas branches are located in the communities of Lawrence, Lenexa, Louisburg, Osawatomie, Overland Park, Paola and Wellsville. The Bank&#8217;s Lawrence locations are located in Douglas County and are significantly impacted by the University of Kansas, the largest university in Kansas. The eastern region is strongly influenced by the Kansas City metropolitan market, which is the highest growth area in the State of Kansas. The region is influenced by public and private industries and businesses of all sizes. In addition, housing growth and commercial real estate are major drivers of the region&#8217;s economy. The Citizens Bank acquisition in 2013 expanded the Bank&#8217;s presence in the eastern Kansas market with branches in the Kansas City metropolitan suburbs of Lenexa and Overland Park.

&#160;

The southeast region of the Bank&#8217;s market area consists of the Bank&#8217;s locations in Fort Scott, Iola, Kincaid, Mound City and Pittsburg, Kansas. Agriculture, oil, and gas are the predominant industries in the southeast Kansas region. Both Fort Scott and Pittsburg are recognized as regional commercial centers within the southeast region of the state, which attracts small retail businesses to the region. Additionally, Pittsburg State University and Fort Scott Community College attract a number of individuals from the surrounding area to live within the communities to participate in educational programs and pursue a degree. Fort Scott is also home to a regional hospital. Additionally, manufacturing and service industries play a key role within the southeast Kansas market. This market area primarily consists of branches acquired in the Citizens Bank acquisition.

&#160;

The Bank&#8217;s southwest Kansas branches are located in the communities of Dodge City in Ford County, Garden City in Finney County, Great Bend and Hoisington in Barton County and LaCrosse in Rush County. Agriculture, oil, and gas are the predominant industries in the southwest Kansas region. Predominant activities involve crop production, feed lot operations, and food processing. Dodge City is known as the &#8220;Cowboy Capital of the World&#8221; and maintains a significant tourism industry. Both Dodge City and Garden City are recognized as regional commercial centers within the state with small businesses, manufacturing, retail, and service industries having a significant influence upon the local economies. Additionally, the Dodge City, Garden City and Great Bend communities each have a community college which attracts individuals from the surrounding areas.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The Company faces strong competition both in attracting deposits and making real estate, commercial and other loans. Its most direct competition for deposits comes from commercial banks and other savings institutions located in its principal market areas, including many larger financial institutions which have greater financial and marketing resources available to them. The ability of the Company to attract and retain deposits generally depends on its ability to provide a rate of return, service levels, liquidity and risk comparable to those offered by competing investment opportunities. The Company competes for loans principally through the interest rates and loan fees it charges and the efficiency and quality of services it provides borrowers.

&#160;

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, the Bank had a total of 291 employees (274 full time equivalent employees). The Company has no employees, although the Company is a party to several employment agreements with executives of the Bank. Employees are provided with a comprehensive benefits program, including basic and major medical insurance, life and disability insurance, sick leave, and a 401(k) profit sharing plan. Employees are not represented by any union or collective bargaining group, and the Bank considers its employee relations to be good.

&#160;

Lending Activities

&#160;

General . The Bank strives to provide a full range of financial products and services to small- and medium-sized businesses and to consumers in each market area it serves. The Bank targets owner-operated businesses and utilizes Small Business Administration lending as a part of its product mix. The Bank has a loan committee for each of its markets, which has authority to approve credits within established guidelines. Concentrations in excess of those guidelines must be approved by either a corporate loan committee comprised of the Bank&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer, the Credit Risk Manager, and other senior commercial lenders or the Bank&#8217;s board of directors. When lending to an entity, the Bank generally obtains a guaranty from the principals of the entity. The loan mix is subject to the discretion of the Bank&#8217;s board of directors and the demands of the local marketplace.

&#160;

The following is a brief description of each major category of the Bank&#8217;s lending activity.

&#160;

One-to-Four Family Residential Real Estate Lending . The Bank originates one-to-four family residential real estate loans with both fixed and variable rates. One-to-four family residential real estate loans are priced and originated following global underwriting standards that are consistent with guidelines established by the major buyers in the secondary market. Generally, residential real estate loans retained in the Bank&#8217;s loan portfolio have fixed or variable rates with adjustment periods of five years or less and amortization periods of typically either 15 or 30 years. A significant portion of these loans prepay prior to maturity. The Bank has no potential negative amortization loans. While the origination of fixed-rate, one-to-four family residential loans continues to be a key component of our business, the majority of these loans are sold in the secondary market. One-to-four family residential real estate loans that exceed 80% of the appraised value of the real estate generally are required, by policy, to be supported by private mortgage insurance, although on occasion the Bank will retain non-conforming residential loans to known customers at premium pricing. The Bank&#8217;s one-to-four family residential real estate loan portfolio increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of Citizens Bank during 2013; however, the Bank also retained some newly originated one-to-four family residential real estate loans that met internal criteria in addition to secondary market qualifications. These are typically loans with maturities of 15 years or less. While the Bank does not intend to increase its one-to-four family residential real estate loan portfolio, the Bank slowed the runoff of the portfolio by retaining some of the new loan originations to offset weak commercial loan demand. However, most of the new loan originations continue to be sold.

&#160; 

Construction and Land Lending. Loans in this category include loans to facilitate the development of both residential and commercial real estate. Construction and land loans generally have terms of less than 18 months, and the Bank will retain a security interest in the borrower&#8217;s real estate. Construction loans are generally limited, by policy, to 80% of the appraised value of the property. Land loans are generally limited, by policy, to 65% of the appraised value of the property. The Bank has generally been reducing its exposure to construction and land loans over the past few years as a strategy to reduce risk. However, recently loan demand has begun to increase slightly for this type of loan.

&#160;

Commercial Real Estate Lending . Commercial real estate loans, including multi-family loans, generally have amortization periods of 15 or 20 years. Commercial real estate and multi-family loans are generally limited, by policy, to 80% of the appraised value of the property. Commercial real estate loans are also supported by an analysis demonstrating the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay. The Bank&#8217;s commercial real estate loan portfolio increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of Citizens Bank during 2013 and the Bank continues to focus on generating additional commercial real estate loan relationships as well.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

Commercial Lending . Loans in this category include loans to service, retail, wholesale and light manufacturing businesses. Commercial loans are made based on the financial strength and repayment ability of the borrower, as well as the collateral securing the loans. The Bank targets owner-operated businesses as its customers and makes lending decisions based upon a cash flow analysis of the borrower as well as a collateral analysis. Accounts receivable loans and loans for inventory purchases are generally on a one-year renewable term and loans for equipment generally have a term of seven years or less. The Bank generally takes a blanket security interest in all assets of the borrower. Equipment loans are generally limited to 75% of the cost or appraised value of the equipment. Inventory loans are generally limited to 50% of the value of the inventory, and accounts receivable loans are generally limited to 75% of a predetermined eligible base. The Bank continues to focus its organic growth on generating additional commercial loan relationships.

&#160;

Municipal Lending. Loans to municipalities are generally related to equipment leasing or general fund loans. Terms are generally limited to 5 years. Equipment leases are generally made for the purchase of municipal assets and are secured by the leased asset. The Bank is generally not active in the origination of municipal loans and leases; however, the Bank may originate loans or leases for municipalities in its market area.

&#160; 

Agriculture Lending. Agricultural real estate loans generally have amortization periods of 20 years or less, during which time the Bank generally retains a security interest in the borrower&#8217;s real estate. The Bank also provides short-term credit for operating loans and intermediate-term loans for farm product, livestock and machinery purchases and other agricultural improvements. Farm product loans generally have a one-year term, and machinery, equipment and breeding livestock loans generally have five to seven year terms. Extension of credit is based upon the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay, as well as the existence of federal guarantees and crop insurance coverage. These loans are generally secured by a blanket lien on livestock, equipment, feed, hay, grain and growing crops. Equipment and breeding livestock loans are generally limited to 75% of appraised value. While the 95% increase in the Bank&#8217;s agriculture loan portfolio in 2013 was primarily a result of the acquisition of Citizens Bank, the Bank continues to focus on generating additional agriculture loan relationships in each of its market areas.

&#160;

Consumer and Other Lending . Loans classified as consumer and other loans include automobile, boat, home improvement and home equity loans. With the exception of home improvement loans and home equity loans, the Bank generally takes a purchase money security interest in collateral for which it provides the original financing. Home improvement loans and home equity loans are principally secured through second mortgages. The terms of the loans typically range from one to five years, depending upon the use of the proceeds, and generally range from 75% to 90% of the value of the collateral. The majority of these loans are installment loans with fixed interest rates. Home improvement and home equity loans are generally secured by a second mortgage on the borrower&#8217;s personal residence and, when combined with the first mortgage, limited to 80% of the value of the property unless further protected by private mortgage insurance. Home improvement loans are generally made for terms of five to seven years with fixed interest rates. Home equity loans are generally made for terms of ten years on a revolving basis with adjustable monthly interest rates tied to the national prime interest rate. While the Bank primarily provides consumer loans to its existing customers, consumer lending is not a category the Bank targets for organic growth.

&#160;

Loan Origination and Processing 

&#160;

Loan originations are derived from a number of sources. Residential loan originations result from real estate broker referrals, direct solicitation by the Bank&#8217;s loan officers, present depositors and borrowers, referrals from builders and attorneys, walk-in customers and, in some instances, other lenders. Consumer and commercial real estate loan originations generally emanate from many of the same sources.

&#160;

Residential loan applications are underwritten and closed based upon standards which generally meet secondary market guidelines. The loan underwriting procedures followed by the Bank conform to regulatory specifications and are designed to assess both the borrower&#8217;s ability to make principal and interest payments and the value of any assets or property serving as collateral for the loan. Generally, as part of the process, a loan officer meets with each applicant to obtain the appropriate employment and financial information as well as any other required loan information. The Bank then obtains reports with respect to the borrower&#8217;s credit record, and orders, on real estate loans, and reviews an appraisal of any collateral for the loan (prepared for the Bank by an independent appraiser).

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

Loan applicants are notified promptly of the decision of the Bank. Prior to closing any long-term loan, the borrower must provide proof of fire and casualty insurance on the property serving as collateral, and such insurance must be maintained during the full term of the loan. Title insurance is required on loans collateralized by real property.

&#160;

The Bank is focusing on the generation of commercial, commercial real estate and agriculture loans to grow and diversify the loan portfolio. However, the challenging economic environment has materially impacted loan origination as a result of decreased demand for loans that meet the Bank&#8217;s credit standards. In several of the Bank&#8217;s markets, there is an oversupply of newly constructed, speculative residential real estate properties and developed vacant lots. As a result of these issues, the Bank has curtailed land development and construction lending and does not expect this type of lending to increase significantly unless the economic outlook continues to improve and the supply and demand of residential housing and vacant developed lots is in balance. Economic conditions in recent years have also caused the Bank to increase underwriting requirements on other types of loans to ensure borrowers can meet repayment requirements.

&#160; 

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

&#160; 

General 

&#160;

FDIC-insured institutions, like the Bank, as well as their holding companies and their affiliates, are extensively regulated under federal and state law. As a result, the Company&#8217;s growth and earnings performance may be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the requirements of federal and state statutes and by the regulations and policies of various bank regulatory agencies, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the &#8220;OCC&#8221;), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#8220;FDIC&#8221;) and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;). Furthermore, taxation laws administered by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities, accounting rules developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, securities laws administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) and state securities authorities, and anti-money laundering laws enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the &#8220;Treasury&#8221;) have an impact on the business of the Company and the Bank. The effect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies and accounting rules are significant to the operations and results of the Company and the Bank, and the nature and extent of future legislative, regulatory or other changes affecting financial institutions are impossible to predict with any certainty.

&#160;

Federal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation and enforcement on the operations of FDIC-insured institutions, their holding companies and affiliates that is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC-insured deposits and depositors of banks, rather than shareholders. These federal and state laws, and the regulations of the bank regulatory agencies issued under them, affect, among other things, the scope of the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s business, the kinds and amounts of investments they may make, Bank reserve requirements, capital levels relative to assets, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, the Company&#8217;s ability to merge, consolidate and acquire, dealings with insiders and affiliates and the Bank&#8217;s payment of dividends. In the last several years, the Company and the Bank have experienced heightened regulatory requirements and scrutiny following the global financial crisis and as a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;). Although the reforms primarily targeted systemically important financial service providers, their influence filtered down in varying degrees to community banks over time, and the reforms have caused the Company&#8217;s compliance and risk management processes, and the costs thereof, to increase.

&#160;

This supervisory and regulatory framework subjects FDIC-insured institutions and their holding companies to regular examination by their respective regulatory agencies, which results in examination reports and ratings that are not publicly available and that can impact the conduct and growth of their business. These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. The regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies. 

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

The following is a summary of the material elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to the Company and the Bank, beginning with a discussion of the continuing regulatory emphasis on capital levels. It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply, nor does it restate all of the requirements of those that are described. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provision.

&#160; 

Regulatory Emphasis on Capital 

&#160;

Regulatory capital represents the net assets of a banking organization available to absorb losses. Because of the risks attendant to their business, FDIC-insured institutions are generally required to hold more capital than other businesses, which directly affects the Company&#8217;s earnings capabilities. Although capital has historically been one of the key measures of the financial health of banks, its role became fundamentally more important in the wake of the global financial crisis, as the banking regulators recognized that the amount and quality of capital held by banks prior to the crisis was insufficient to absorb losses during periods of severe stress. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III, discussed below, establish strengthened capital standards for banking organizations, require more capital to be held in the form of common stock and disallow certain funds from being included in capital determinations. These standards represent regulatory capital requirements that are meaningfully more stringent than those in place previously.

&#160; 

Minimum Required Capital Levels. Bank holding companies have historically had to comply with less stringent capital standards than their bank subsidiaries and have been able to raise capital with hybrid instruments such as trust preferred securities. The Dodd-Frank Act mandated that the Federal Reserve establish minimum capital levels for holding companies on a consolidated basis as stringent as those required for FDIC-insured institutions. As a consequence, the components of holding company permanent capital known as &#8220;Tier 1 Capital&#8221; were restricted to those capital instruments that were considered Tier 1 Capital for FDIC-insured institutions. A result of this change is that the proceeds of hybrid instruments, such as trust preferred securities, are being excluded from Tier 1 Capital over a phase-out period. However, if such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010 by bank holding companies with less than $15 billion of assets, they may be retained, subject to certain restrictions. Because the Company has assets of less than $15 billion, the Company is able to maintain its trust preferred proceeds as Tier 1 Capital but the Company has to comply with new capital mandates in other respects and will not be able to raise Tier 1 Capital in the future through the issuance of trust preferred securities.

&#160;

The capital standards for the Company and the Bank changed on January 1, 2015 to add the requirements of Basel III, discussed below. The minimum capital standards effective prior to and including December 31, 2014 are:

&#160;

&#183; A leverage requirement, consisting of a minimum ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total adjusted average quarterly assets of 3% for the most highly-rated banks with a minimum requirement of at least 4% for all others, and &#183; A risk-based capital requirement, consisting of a minimum ratio of Total Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 8% and a minimum ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 4%. &#160;

For these purposes, &#8220;Tier 1 Capital&#8221; consists primarily of common stock, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus less intangible assets (other than certain loan servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships). Total Capital consists primarily of Tier 1 Capital plus &#8220;Tier 2 Capital,&#8221; which includes other non-permanent capital items, such as certain other debt and equity instruments that do not qualify as Tier 1 Capital, and the Bank&#8217;s allowance for loan losses, subject to a limitation of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. Further, risk-weighted assets for the purpose of the risk-weighted ratio calculations are balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures to which required risk weightings of 0% to 100% are applied. 

&#160; 

The Basel International Capital Accords. The risk-based capital guidelines described above are based upon the 1988 capital accord known as &#8220;Basel I&#8221; adopted by the international Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a committee of central banks and bank supervisors, as implemented by the U.S. federal banking regulators on an interagency basis. In 2008, the banking agencies collaboratively began to phase-in capital standards based on a second capital accord, referred to as &#8220;Basel II,&#8221; for large or &#8220;core&#8221; international banks (generally defined for U.S. purposes as having total assets of $250 billion or more, or consolidated foreign exposures of $10 billion or more). On September 12, 2010, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, announced agreement on a strengthened set of capital requirements for banking organizations around the world, known as Basel III, to address deficiencies recognized in connection with the global financial crisis. Because of Dodd-Frank Act requirements, Basel III essentially layers a new set of capital standards on the previously existing Basel I standards.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

The Basel III Rule . In July 2013, the U.S. federal banking agencies approved the implementation of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms in pertinent part, and, at the same time, promulgated rules effecting certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act (the &#8220;Basel III Rule&#8221;). In contrast to capital requirements historically, which were in the form of guidelines, Basel III was released in the form of regulations by each of the regulatory agencies. The Basel III Rule is applicable to all banking organizations that are subject to minimum capital requirements, including federal and state banks and savings and loan associations, as well as to bank and savings and loan holding companies, other than &#8220;small bank holding companies&#8221; (generally bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $1 billion which are not publically traded companies).

&#160;

The Basel III Rule not only increased most of the required minimum capital ratios effective January 1, 2015, but it introduced the concept of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, which consists primarily of common stock, related surplus (net of treasury stock), retained earnings, and Common Equity Tier 1 minority interests subject to certain regulatory adjustments. The Basel III Rule also expanded the definition of capital by establishing more stringent criteria that instruments must meet to be considered Additional Tier 1 Capital (Tier 1 Capital in addition to Common Equity) and Tier 2 Capital. A number of instruments that qualified as Tier 1 Capital do not qualify, or their qualifications will change. For example, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, which qualified as simple Tier 1 Capital, does not qualify as Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, but qualifies as Additional Tier 1 Capital. The Basel III Rule also constrained the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, and deferred tax assets in capital and requires deductions from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital in the event that such assets exceed a certain percentage of a banking organization&#8217;s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital.

&#160;

The Basel III Rule requires minimum capital ratios beginning January 1, 2015, as follows:

&#160;

&#183; A new ratio of minimum Common Equity Tier 1 equal to 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; &#183; An increase in the minimum required amount of Tier 1 Capital to 6% of risk-weighted assets; &#183; A continuation of the current minimum required amount of Total Capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) at 8% of risk-weighted assets; and &#183; A minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total adjusted average quarterly assets equal to 4% in all circumstances. &#160;

Not only did the capital requirements change but the risk weightings (or their methodologies) for bank assets that are used to determine the capital ratios changed as well. For nearly every class of assets, the Basel III Rule requires a more complex, detailed and calibrated assessment of credit risk and calculation of risk weightings.

&#160;

Banking organizations (except for large, internationally active banking organizations) became subject to the new rules on January 1, 2015. However, there are separate phase-in/phase-out periods for: (i) the capital conservation buffer; (ii) regulatory capital adjustments and deductions; (iii) nonqualifying capital instruments; and (iv) changes to the prompt corrective action rules. The phase-in periods commenced on January 1, 2016 and extend until 2019.

&#160; 

Well-Capitalized Requirements . The ratios described above are minimum standards in order for banking organizations to be considered &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; under the Prompt Corrective Action rules discussed below. Bank regulatory agencies uniformly encourage banking organizations to hold more capital and be &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; and, to that end, federal law and regulations provide various incentives for such organizations to maintain regulatory capital at levels in excess of minimum regulatory requirements. For example, a banking organization that is well-capitalized may: (i) qualify for exemptions from prior notice or application requirements otherwise applicable to certain types of activities; (ii) qualify for expedited processing of other required notices or applications; and (iii) accept, roll-over or renew brokered deposits. Higher capital levels could also be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual banking organizations. Moreover, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s capital guidelines contemplate that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of, among other things, interest rate risk, or the risks posed by concentrations of credit, nontraditional activities or securities trading activities. Further, any banking organization experiencing or anticipating significant growth would be expected to maintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions ( i.e. , Tier 1 Capital less all intangible assets), well above the minimum levels.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

Under the capital regulations of the OCC and Federal Reserve, in order to be well-capitalized, a banking organization must maintain:

&#160;

&#183; A new Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio to risk-weighted assets of 6.5% or more; &#183; A minimum ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 8% (6% under Basel I); &#183; A minimum ratio of Total Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 10% (the same as Basel I); and &#183; A leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total adjusted average quarterly assets of 5% or greater. &#160;

In addition, banking organizations that seek the freedom to make capital distributions (including for dividends and repurchases of stock) and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers without restriction must also maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 attributable to a capital conservation buffer to be phased in over three years beginning in 2016. The purpose of the conservation buffer is to ensure that banking organizations maintain a buffer of capital that can be used to absorb losses during periods of financial and economic stress. Factoring in the fully phased-in conservation buffer increases the minimum ratios depicted above to:

&#160;

&#183; 7% for Common Equity Tier 1, &#183; 8.5% for Tier 1 Capital and &#183; 10.5% for Total Capital. &#160;

It is possible under the Basel III Rule to be well-capitalized while remaining out of compliance with the capital conservation buffer.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015: (i) the Bank was not subject to a directive from the OCC to increase its capital and (ii) the Bank was well-capitalized, as defined by OCC regulations. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had regulatory capital in excess of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s requirements and met the Basel III Rule requirements to be well-capitalized.

&#160; 

Prompt Corrective Action . An FDIC-insured institution&#8217;s capital plays an important role in connection with regulatory enforcement as well. This regime applies to FDIC-insured institutions, not holding companies, and provides escalating powers to bank regulatory agencies as a bank&#8217;s capital diminishes. Federal law provides the federal banking regulators with broad power to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. The extent of the regulators&#8217; powers depends on whether the institution in question is &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; or &#8220;critically undercapitalized,&#8221; in each case as defined by regulation. Depending upon the capital category to which an institution is assigned, the regulators&#8217; corrective powers include: (i) requiring the institution to submit a capital restoration plan; (ii) limiting the institution&#8217;s asset growth and restricting its activities; (iii) requiring the institution to issue additional capital stock (including additional voting stock) or to sell itself; (iv) restricting transactions between the institution and its affiliates; (v) restricting the interest rate that the institution may pay on deposits; (vi) ordering a new election of directors of the institution; (vii) requiring dismissal of senior executive officers or directors; (viii) prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; (ix) requiring the institution to divest certain subsidiaries; (x) prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt; and (xi) ultimately, appointing a receiver for the institution.

&#160; 

Regulation and Supervision of the Company 

&#160; 

General. The Company, as the sole shareholder of the Bank, is a bank holding company. As a bank holding company, the Company is registered with, and subject to regulation by, the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;BHCA&#8221;). The Company is legally obligated to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank in circumstances where it might not otherwise do so. The Company is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve and is required to file with the Federal Reserve periodic reports of its operations and such additional information regarding its operations as the Federal Reserve may require.

&#160; 

Acquisitions, Activities and Change in Control . The primary purpose of a bank holding company is to control and manage banks. The BHCA generally requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve for any merger involving a bank holding company or any acquisition by a bank holding company of another bank or bank holding company. Subject to certain conditions (including deposit concentration limits established by the BHCA), the Federal Reserve may allow a bank holding company to acquire banks located in any state of the United States. In approving interstate acquisitions, the Federal Reserve is required to give effect to applicable state law limitations on the aggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the acquiring bank holding company and its FDIC-insured institution affiliates in the state in which the target bank is located (provided that those limits do not discriminate against out-of-state institutions or their holding companies) and state laws that require that the target bank have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) before being acquired by an out-of-state bank holding company. Furthermore, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies must be well-capitalized and well-managed in order to effect interstate mergers or acquisitions. For a discussion of the capital requirements, see &#8220;Regulatory Emphasis on Capital&#8221; above.

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

The BHCA generally prohibits the Company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to banks and their subsidiaries. This general prohibition is subject to a number of exceptions. The principal exception allows bank holding companies to engage in, and to own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found by the Federal Reserve prior to November 11, 1999 to be &#8220;so closely related to banking ... as to be a proper incident thereto.&#8221; This authority would permit the Company to engage in a variety of banking-related businesses, including the ownership and operation of a savings association, or any entity engaged in consumer finance, equipment leasing, the operation of a computer service bureau (including software development) and mortgage banking and brokerage services. The BHCA does not place territorial restrictions on the domestic activities of nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies.

&#160;

Additionally, bank holding companies that meet certain eligibility requirements prescribed by the BHCA and elect to operate as financial holding companies may engage in, or own shares in companies engaged in, a wider range of nonbanking activities, including securities and insurance underwriting and sales, merchant banking and any other activity that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines by regulation or order is financial in nature or incidental to any such financial activity or that the Federal Reserve determines by order to be complementary to any such financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of FDIC-insured institutions or the financial system generally. The Company has not elected to operate as a financial holding company.

&#160;

Federal law also prohibits any person or company from acquiring &#8220;control&#8221; of an FDIC-insured depository institution or its holding company without prior notice to the appropriate federal bank regulator. &#8220;Control&#8221; is conclusively presumed to exist upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the outstanding voting securities of a bank or bank holding company, but may arise under certain circumstances between 10% and 24.99% ownership.

&#160; 

Capital Requirements. Bank holding companies are required to maintain capital in accordance with Federal Reserve capital adequacy requirements, as impacted by the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III. For a discussion of capital requirements, see &#8220;&#8212;Regulatory Emphasis on Capital&#8221; above.

&#160; 

Dividend Payments. The Company&#8217;s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders may be affected by both general corporate law considerations and policies of the Federal Reserve applicable to bank holding companies . As a Delaware corporation, the Company is subject to the limitations of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the &#8220;DGCL&#8221;). The DGCL allows the Company to pay dividends only out of its surplus (as defined and computed in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL) or if the Company has no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year.

&#160;

As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends to shareholders if: (i) its net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with its capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. The Federal Reserve also possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations. Among these powers is the ability to proscribe the payment of dividends by banks and bank holding companies. In addition, under the Basel III Rule, institutions that seek the freedom to pay dividends will have to maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 attributable to the capital conservation buffer to be phased in over three years beginning in 2016. See &#8220;&#8212;Regulatory Emphasis on Capital&#8221; above.

&#160;

Monetary Policy. The monetary policy of the Federal Reserve has a significant effect on the operating results of financial or bank holding companies and their subsidiaries. Among the tools available to the Federal Reserve to affect the money supply are open market transactions in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

Federal Securities Regulation. The Company&#8217;s common stock is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). Consequently, the Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading and other restrictions and requirements of the SEC under the Exchange Act.

&#160; 

Corporate Governance . The Dodd-Frank Act addressed many investor protection, corporate governance and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. The Dodd-Frank Act increased stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called &#8220;golden parachute&#8221; payments, and authorizing the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate and solicit voters for their own candidates using a company&#8217;s proxy materials. The legislation also directed the Federal Reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of bank holding companies, regardless of whether such companies are publicly traded.

&#160; 

Regulation and Supervision of the Bank 

&#160; 

General. The Bank is a national bank, chartered by the OCC under the National Bank Act. The deposit accounts of the Bank are insured by the FDIC&#8217;s Deposit Insurance Fund (the &#8220;DIF&#8221;) to the maximum extent provided under federal law and FDIC regulations, and the Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System. As a national bank, the Bank is subject to the examination, supervision, reporting and enforcement requirements of the OCC. The FDIC, as administrator of the DIF, also has regulatory authority over the Bank.

&#160; 

Deposit Insurance . As an FDIC-insured institution, the Bank is required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC. The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system whereby FDIC-insured institutions pay insurance premiums at rates based on their risk classification. An institution&#8217;s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to the regulators. For deposit insurance assessment purposes, an FDIC-insured institution is placed in one of four risk categories each quarter. An institution&#8217;s assessment is determined by multiplying its assessment rate by its assessment base. The total base assessment rates range from 2.5 basis points to 45 basis points. The assessment base is calculated using average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. At least semi-annually, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, will increase or decrease the assessment rates, following notice and comment on proposed rulemaking.

&#160;

Amendments to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act revised the assessment base against which an FDIC-insured institution&#8217;s deposit insurance premiums paid to the DIF are calculated to be its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity. This change shifted the burden of deposit insurance premiums toward those large depository institutions that rely on funding sources other than U.S. deposits. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act altered the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF, increasing the minimum from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits and eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to FDIC-insured institutions. In lieu of dividends, the FDIC has adopted progressively lower assessment rate schedules that will take effect when the reserve ratio exceeds 1.15%, 2%, and 2.5%. As a consequence, premiums will decrease once the 1.15% threshold is exceeded. The FDIC has until September 3, 2020 to meet the 1.35% reserve ratio target. Several of these provisions could increase the Bank&#8217;s FDIC deposit insurance premiums. 

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently established the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per insured depositor.

&#160; 

FICO Assessments . In addition to paying basic deposit insurance assessments, FDIC-insured institutions must pay Financing Corporation (&#8220;FICO&#8221;) assessments. FICO is a mixed-ownership governmental corporation chartered by the former Federal Home Loan Bank Board pursuant to the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 to function as a financing vehicle for the recapitalization of the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. FICO issued 30-year noncallable bonds of approximately $8.1 billion that mature in 2017 through 2019. FICO&#8217;s authority to issue bonds ended on December 12, 1991. Since 1996, federal legislation has required that all FDIC-insured institutions pay assessments to cover interest payments on FICO&#8217;s outstanding obligations. The FICO assessment rate is adjusted quarterly and for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 0.60 basis points (60 cents per $100 dollars of assessable deposits).

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

Supervisory Assessments . National banks are required to pay supervisory assessments to the OCC to fund the operations of the OCC. The amount of the assessment is calculated using a formula that takes into account the bank&#8217;s size and its supervisory condition. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Bank paid supervisory assessments to the OCC totaling $219,000.

&#160; 

Capital Requirements. Banks are generally required to maintain capital levels in excess of other businesses. For a discussion of capital requirements, see &#8220;&#8212;Regulatory Emphasis on Capital&#8221; above.

&#160; 

Liquidity Requirements. Liquidity is a measure of the ability and ease with which assets may be converted to cash. Liquid assets are those that can be converted to cash quickly if needed to meet financial obligations. To remain viable, FDIC-insured institutions must have enough liquid assets to meet their near-term obligations, such as withdrawals by depositors. Because the global financial crisis was in part a liquidity crisis, Basel III also includes a liquidity framework that requires FDIC-insured institutions to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests. One test, referred to as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (&#8220;LCR&#8221;), is designed to ensure that the institution has an adequate stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets that can be converted easily and immediately in private markets into cash to meet liquidity needs for a 30-calendar day liquidity stress scenario. The other test, known as the Net Stable Funding Ratio, is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of institutions over a one-year horizon. These tests provide an incentive for institutions to increase their holdings in Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets, increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source and rely on stable funding like core deposits (in lieu of brokered deposits).

&#160;

In addition to liquidity guidelines already in place, the U.S. bank regulatory agencies implemented the Basel III LCR in September 2014, which requires large financial firms to hold levels of liquid assets sufficient to protect against constraints on their funding during times of financial turmoil. While the LCR only applies to the largest banking organizations in the country, certain elements are expected to filter down to all FDIC-insured institutions. The Bank is reviewing its liquidity risk management policies in light of the LCR and NSFR.

&#160; 

Stress Testing . A stress test is an analysis or simulation designed to determine the ability of a given FDIC-insured institution to deal with an economic crisis. In October 2012, U.S. bank regulators unveiled new rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act that require the largest U.S. banks to undergo stress tests twice per year, once internally and once conducted by the regulators, and began recommending portfolio stress testing as a sound risk management practice for community banks. Although stress tests are not officially required for banks with less than $10 billion in assets, they have become part of annual regulatory exams even for banks small enough to be officially exempted from the process. The OCC now recommends stress testing as means to identify and quantify loan portfolio risk. The Bank has already implemented stress testing. 

&#160; 

Dividend Payments. The primary source of funds for the Company is dividends from the Bank. Under the National Bank Act, a national bank may pay dividends out of its undivided profits in such amounts and at such times as the bank&#8217;s board of directors deems prudent. Without prior OCC approval, however, a national bank may not pay dividends in any calendar year that, in the aggregate, exceed the bank&#8217;s year-to-date net income plus the bank&#8217;s retained net income for the two preceding years. In addition, under the Basel III Rule, institutions that seek the freedom to pay dividends will have to maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 attributable to the capital conservation buffer to be phased in over three years beginning in 2016. See &#8220;Regulatory Emphasis on Capital&#8221; above.

&#160; 

Insider Transactions. The Bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; between the Bank and its &#8220;affiliates.&#8221; The Company is an affiliate of the Bank for purposes of these restrictions, and covered transactions subject to the restrictions include extensions of credit to the Company, investments in the stock or other securities of the Company and the acceptance of the stock or other securities of the Company as collateral for loans made by the Bank. The Dodd-Frank Act enhanced the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates, including an expansion of the definition of &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained.

&#160;

Limitations and reporting requirements are also placed on extensions of credit by the Bank to its directors and officers, to directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries, to principal shareholders of the Company and to &#8220;related interests&#8221; of such directors, officers and principal shareholders. In addition, federal law and regulations may affect the terms upon which any person who is a director or officer of the Company or the Bank, or a principal shareholder of the Company, may obtain credit from banks with which the Bank maintains a correspondent relationship.

&#160;

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

Safety and Soundness Standards/Risk Management. The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines that establish operational and managerial standards to promote the safety and soundness of FDIC-insured institutions. The guidelines set forth standards for internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, asset quality and earnings.

&#160;

In general, the safety and soundness guidelines prescribe the goals to be achieved in each area, and each institution is responsible for establishing its own procedures to achieve those goals. If an institution fails to comply with any of the standards set forth in the guidelines, the FDIC-insured institution&#8217;s primary federal regulator may require the institution to submit a plan for achieving and maintaining compliance. If an FDIC-insured institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan, or fails in any material respect to implement a compliance plan that has been accepted by its primary federal regulator, the regulator is required to issue an order directing the institution to cure the deficiency. Until the deficiency cited in the regulator&#8217;s order is cured, the regulator may restrict the FDIC-insured institution&#8217;s rate of growth, require the FDIC-insured institution to increase its capital, restrict the rates the institution pays on deposits or require the institution to take any action the regulator deems appropriate under the circumstances. Noncompliance with the standards established by the safety and soundness guidelines may also constitute grounds for other enforcement action by the federal bank regulatory agencies, including cease and desist orders and civil money penalty assessments.

&#160;

During the past decade, the bank regulatory agencies have increasingly emphasized the importance of sound risk management processes and strong internal controls when evaluating the activities of the FDIC-insured institutions they supervise. Properly managing risks has been identified as critical to the conduct of safe and sound banking activities and has become even more important as new technologies, product innovation, and the size and speed of financial transactions have changed the nature of banking markets. The agencies have identified a spectrum of risks facing a banking institution including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal, and reputational risk. In particular, recent regulatory pronouncements have focused on operational risk, which arises from the potential that inadequate information systems, operational problems, breaches in internal controls, fraud, or unforeseen catastrophes will result in unexpected losses. New products and services, third-party risk management and cybersecurity are critical sources of operational risk that FDIC-insured institutions are expected to address in the current environment. The Bank is expected to have active board and senior management oversight; adequate policies, procedures, and limits; adequate risk measurement, monitoring, and management information systems; and comprehensive internal controls.

&#160; 

Branching Authority . National banks headquartered in Kansas, such as the Bank, have the same branching rights in Kansas as banks chartered under Kansas law, subject to OCC approval. Kansas law grants Kansas-chartered banks the authority to establish branches anywhere in the State of Kansas, subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals.

&#160;

Federal law permits state and national banks to merge with banks in other states subject to: (i) regulatory approval; (ii) federal and state deposit concentration limits; and (iii) state law limitations requiring the merging bank to have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) prior to the merger. The establishment of new interstate branches or the acquisition of individual branches of a bank in another state (rather than the acquisition of an out-of-state bank in its entirety) has historically been permitted only in those states the laws of which expressly authorize such expansion. However, the Dodd-Frank Act permits well-capitalized and well-managed banks to establish new branches across state lines without these impediments.

&#160; 

Financial Subsidiaries. Under federal law and OCC regulations, national banks are authorized to engage, through &#8220;financial subsidiaries,&#8221; in any activity that is permissible for a financial holding company and any activity that the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Federal Reserve, determines is financial in nature or incidental to any such financial activity, except (i) insurance underwriting, (ii) real estate development or real estate investment activities (unless otherwise permitted by law), (iii) insurance company portfolio investments and (iv) merchant banking. The authority of a national bank to invest in a financial subsidiary is subject to a number of conditions, including, among other things, requirements that the bank must be well-managed and well-capitalized (after deducting from capital the bank&#8217;s outstanding investments in financial subsidiaries). The Bank has not applied for approval to establish any financial subsidiaries.

&#160; 

Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Topeka, which serves as a central credit facility for its members. The FHLB is funded primarily from proceeds from the sale of obligations of the FHLB system. It makes loans to member banks in the form of FHLB advances. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully collateralized as determined by the FHLB.

&#160;

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

Transaction Account Reserves. Federal Reserve regulations require FDIC-insured institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). For 2016: the first $15.2 million of otherwise reservable balances are exempt from reserves and have a zero percent reserve requirement; for transaction accounts aggregating more than $15.2 million to $110.2 million, the reserve requirement is 3% of total transaction accounts; and for net transaction accounts in excess of $110.2 million, the reserve requirement is 3% up to $110.2 million plus 10% of the aggregate amount of total transaction accounts in excess of $110.2 million. These reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment by the Federal Reserve.

&#160; 

Community Reinvestment Act Requirements. The Community Reinvestment Act requires the Bank to have a continuing and affirmative obligation in a safe and sound manner to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Federal regulators regularly assess the Bank&#8217;s record of meeting the credit needs of its communities. Applications for additional acquisitions would be affected by the evaluation of the Bank&#8217;s effectiveness in meeting its Community Reinvestment Act requirements.

&#160; 

Anti-Money Laundering. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the &#8220;USA Patriot Act&#8221;), along with anti-money laundering and bank secrecy laws (&#8220;AML-BSA&#8221;), are designed to deny terrorists and criminals the ability to obtain access to the U.S. financial system and has significant implications for FDIC-insured institutions, brokers, dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The laws mandate financial services companies to have policies and procedures with respect to measures designed to address any or all of the following matters: (i) customer identification and ongoing due diligence programs; (ii) money laundering; (iii) terrorist financing; (iv) identifying and reporting suspicious activities and currency transactions; (v) currency crimes; and (vi) cooperation among FDIC-insured institutions and law enforcement authorities.

&#160; 

Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate. Concentration risk exists when FDIC-insured institutions deploy too many assets to any one industry or segment. A concentration in commercial real estate is one example of regulatory concern. The interagency Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices guidance (&#8220;CRE Guidance&#8221;) provides supervisory criteria, including the following numerical indicators, to assist bank examiners in identifying banks with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny: (i) commercial real estate loans exceeding 300% of capital and increasing 50% or more in the preceding three years; or (ii) construction and land development loans exceeding 100% of capital. The CRE Guidance does not limit banks&#8217; levels of commercial real estate lending activities, but rather guides institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their commercial real estate concentrations. On December 18, 2015, the federal banking agencies issued a statement to reinforce prudent risk-management practices related to CRE lending, having observed substantial growth in many CRE asset and lending markets, increased competitive pressures, rising CRE concentrations in banks, and an easing of CRE underwriting standards. The federal bank agencies reminded FDIC-insured institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise prudent risk-management practices to identify, measure, monitor, and manage the risks arising from CRE lending. In addition, FDIC-insured institutions must maintain capital commensurate with the level and nature of their CRE concentration risk.

&#160;

Based on the Bank&#8217;s loan portfolio as of December 31, 2015, the Bank does not exceed these guidelines.

&#160; 

Consumer Financial Services. The historical structure of federal consumer protection regulation applicable to all providers of consumer financial products and services changed significantly on July 21, 2011, when the CFPB commenced operations to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all providers of consumer products and services, including the Bank, as well as the authority to prohibit &#8220;unfair, deceptive or abusive&#8221; acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over providers with more than $10 billion in assets. FDIC-insured institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, like the Bank, continue to be examined by their applicable bank regulators.

&#160;

&#160; 15 &#160; 

&#160;

Because abuses in connection with residential mortgages were a significant factor contributing to the global financial crisis, many new rules issued by the CFPB and required by the Dodd-Frank Act address mortgage and mortgage-related products, their underwriting, origination, servicing and sales. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded underwriting requirements applicable to loans secured by 1-4 family residential real property and augmented federal law combating predatory lending practices. In addition to numerous disclosure requirements, the Dodd-Frank Act imposed new standards for mortgage loan originations on all lenders, including all FDIC-insured institutions, in an effort to strongly encourage lenders to verify a borrower&#8217;s &#8220;ability to repay,&#8221; while also establishing a presumption of compliance for certain &#8220;qualified mortgages.&#8221; In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act generally required lenders or securitizers to retain an economic interest in the credit risk relating to loans that the lender sells, and other asset-backed securities that the securitizer issues, if the loans have not complied with the ability-to-repay standards. The Bank does not currently expect the CFPB&#8217;s rules to have a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s operations, except for higher compliance costs

I. Distribution of Assets, Liabilities, and Stockholders&#8217; Equity; Interest Rates and Interest Differential 

&#160;

The following table describes the extent to which changes in tax equivalent interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities affected the Company&#8217;s interest income and expense during the periods indicated. The table distinguishes between (i) changes attributable to rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume), (ii) changes attributable to volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate), and (iii) net change (the sum of the previous columns).

The following table sets forth information relating to average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Average balances are derived from daily average balances. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances but have been reflected in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth in the table below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense. This table reflects the average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities for the periods indicated (derived by dividing income or expense by the monthly average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively) as well as the &#34;net interest margin&#34; (which reflects the effect of the net earnings balance) for the periods shown.

&#160; &#160; As of December 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 2012 &#160; &#160; 2011 &#160; &#160; &#160; (Dollars in thousands) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Non-accrual loans &#160; $ 2,168 &#160; &#160; $ 6,046 &#160; &#160; $ 9,836 &#160; &#160; $ 9,108 &#160; &#160; $ 1,419 &#160; Accruing loans over 90 days past due &#160; &#160; - &#160; &#160; &#160; - &#160; &#160; &#160; - &#160; &#160; &#160; - &#160; &#160; &#160; - &#160; Non-performing investments &#160; &#160; - &#160; &#160; &#160; - &#160; &#160; &#160; - &#160; &#160; &#160; - &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,104 &#160; Real estate owned, net &#160; &#160; 1,000 &#160; &#160; &#160; 255 &#160; &#160; &#160; 400 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,444 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,264 &#160; Non-performing assets &#160; $ 3,168 &#160; &#160; $ 6,301 &#160; &#160; $ 10,236 &#160; &#160; $ 11,552 &#160; &#160; $ 4,787 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Performing TDRs &#160; $ 4,669 &#160; &#160; $ 4,657 &#160; &#160; $ 6,920 &#160; &#160; $ 5,846 &#160; &#160; $ 1,071 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Non-performing loans to total gross loans &#160; &#160; 0.51 % &#160; &#160; 1.44 % &#160; &#160; 2.35 % &#160; &#160; 2.84 % &#160; &#160; 0.45 % Non-performing assets to total assets &#160; &#160; 0.36 % &#160; &#160; 0.73 % &#160; &#160; 1.24 % &#160; &#160; 1.88 % &#160; &#160; 0.80 % Allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans &#160; &#160; 273.15 % &#160; &#160; 87.99 % &#160; &#160; 56.32 % &#160; &#160; 50.30 % &#160; &#160; 331.71 % &#160;

The decrease in non-accrual loans during 2015 was primarily the result of a $2.0 million commercial real estate loan that returned to accrual status, the payoff of a $1.6 million land loan relationship and from transfers to other real estate. The decrease in non-accrual loans during 2014 was principally associated with a $4.0 million commercial loan relationship which was placed on non-accrual status in 2013 as the performance of the business deteriorated and the borrower agreed to sell the business. The business was liquidated in 2014 and resulted in a charge-off of $755,000, and the Bank received $3.2 million as a payoff for the credit. The increase in non-accrual loans during 2013 was primarily due to the $4.0 million commercial loan relationship which was partially offset by the return to accrual status of $1.5 million of a $2.2 million land loan that was subject to a troubled debt restructuring (&#8220;TDR&#8221;) in 2012 after a payment history was established based on the terms of the TDR. Also partially offsetting the increase in our non-accrual loan balances in 2013 was the pay down of a $1.1 million commercial loan with proceeds from the liquidation of the borrower&#8217;s assets in 2013. The remaining loan balance of $192,000 was charged off in 2013. The increase in non-accrual loans during 2012 was principally associated with the $2.2 million land loan and $1.1 million commercial loan discussed above as well as a commercial loan relationship consisting of $4.4 million in real estate and land loans, which was placed on non-accrual status after the borrower declared bankruptcy.

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, the $1.0 million of real estate owned primarily consisted of residential real estate properties. The increase in real estate owned during 2015 was principally associated with obtaining the collateral securing a non-performing loan relationship. The decline in real estate owned during 2014 was principally associated with the sale of residential real estate properties. The decline in real estate owned during 2013 was principally associated with the sale of a residential subdivision development, a commercial real estate building and land previously acquired by the Bank for expansion. The increase in real estate owned during 2012 was primarily associated with $587,000 of real estate owned acquired in The Wellsville Bank acquisition. Partially offsetting the increase in 2012 was a charge of $175,000 to reflect declines in the fair value of certain real estate owned and from the sales of residential properties.

&#160;

As part of the Company&#8217;s credit risk management, the Company continues to aggressively manage the loan portfolio to identify problem loans and has placed additional emphasis on its commercial real estate relationships. As discussed in more detail in the &#8220;Asset Quality and Distribution&#8221; section of Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; as of December 31, 2015, the Company concluded its allowance for loan losses was adequate based on the evaluation of the loan portfolio&#8217;s probable incurred losses.

&#160; 22 &#160; 

&#160;

The Company recorded net loan recoveries of $1.3 million during 2015, which were primarily associated with the recovery of $1.7 million on a $4.3 million construction loan which was fully charged-off during 2010 and 2011. As of December 31, 2015, the Company has recovered approximately $2.4 million of the loan and continues to pursue collection of the remaining amount. During 2014, we had net loan charge-offs of $820,000. The charge-offs were primarily associated with a previously identified and impaired $4.0 million commercial loan relationship. During 2013, we had net loan recoveries of $159,000, which were primarily associated with the $4.3 million construction loan noted above and recoveries on the payoff of a one-to-four family residential real estate loan which had been partially charged-off as part of a TDR in 2010. During 2012, we had net loan charge-offs of $2.0 million compared to $2.3 million during 2011. The net loan charge-offs in 2012 were primarily associated with two land loans that were the subject of TDRs, resulting in charge-offs to reduce the loans down to the market value of the collateral. In addition to the charge-off of a portion of the $4.3 million construction loan, the 2011 period also reflects a charge-off related to a previously identified and impaired commercial relationship consisting of $2.0 million in real estate and operating loans, which were charged down to market value after we acquired ownership of the property securing the loans during 2011. The commercial real estate property was sold during 2011 without incurring any further losses.

&#160;

The distribution of the Company&#8217;s allowance for losses on loans at the dates indicated and the percent of loans in each category to total loans is summarized in the following table. This allocation reflects management&#8217;s judgment as to risks inherent in the types of loans indicated, but in general the Company&#8217;s total allowance for loan losses included in the table is not restricted and is available to absorb all loan losses. The amount allocated in the following table to any category should not be interpreted as an indication of expected actual charge-offs in that category.

In 2015, the Company adjusted the historical loss analysis within the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses. The Company previously used a twelve quarter historical loss rate calculated by loan class. The updated historical loss analysis uses a migration analysis to track historical losses by loan class and risk categories over a longer period of time. In the opinion of management, the adjusted historical loss analysis more accurately allocates estimated losses. The adjustments resulted in reclassifications of the allocated allowance among various loan classes compared to December 31, 2014. The adjustments to the historical loss analysis did not have a significant impact on the total allowance for loan losses balance as of December 31, 2014.

&#160;

The increase in the allocation of the allowance for loan losses on our one-to-four family residential real estate loans during 2015, 2013 and 2012 was related to an increase in outstanding loan balances. The increase in the allocation of the allowance for loan losses on our one-to-four family residential real estate loans during 2014 was primarily related to the increase in specific allowances related to impaired loans. The allocation of the allowance for loan losses on construction and land decreased in 2015 due to lower outstanding loan balances. The allocation of the allowance for loan losses on construction and land loans decreased in 2014 primarily due to a decrease in the specific allowance related to an impaired land loan and a decrease in outstanding loan balances. The allocation of the allowance for loan losses on construction and land loans increased in 2013 and 2012 as a result of increases in loan balances and in the specific allowance related to an impaired land loan. The allocation of the allowance for loan losses on commercial real estate loans decreased in 2015 and 2014 primarily as a result of the decrease in specific allowances related to impaired loans. The allocation of the allowance for loan losses on commercial real estate loans increased in 2013 as a result of higher outstanding loan balances while the 2012 decline was the result of lower outstanding loan balances. The allocation of the allowance for loan losses on commercial loans during 2015, 2014, and 2013 was related primarily to increased historical charge-offs, specific allowances on impaired loans and management&#8217;s judgment to increase the risk factors. The increase in the allocation of the allowance for loan losses on agriculture loans during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was primarily due to specific allowances on impaired loans, higher loan balances and management&#8217;s judgment to increase the risk factors. The allowance for loan losses is discussed in more detail in the &#8220;Non-performing Assets&#8221; and &#8220;Asset Quality and Distribution&#8221; sections of Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; As of December 31, 2015, we believed the Company&#8217;s allowance for loan losses continued to be adequate based on the Company&#8217;s evaluation of the loan portfolio&#8217;s probable incurred losses.
