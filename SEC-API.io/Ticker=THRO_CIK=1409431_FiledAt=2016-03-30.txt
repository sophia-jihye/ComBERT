Overview 

We were incorporated in the State of Wyoming on April 11, 2006 as Theron Resource Group. Our statutory registered agent's office is located at 1620 Central Avenue, Suite 202, Cheyenne, Wyoming 82001 and our principal executive office is located at 17/F, Amtel Building, 144-148 Des Voeux Road Central, Hong Kong, telephone 852-2568 7518. There have been no material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations or purchases or sales of any significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business since the date of incorporation. 

On February 21, 2007, we optioned a property containing nine mineral claim blocks in southwestern British Columbia, Canada. Upon exercise of the option, we are required to pay, commencing May 31, 2013, $25,000 per annum, as royalty. The Company currently does not intend to exercise the option on the claim. 

On August 5, 2014, the Company entered into a Plan of Exchange (the &#147;Agreement&#148;) with the major stockholders of BG Global Phils., Inc (&#147;BG Global&#148;), a company incorporated in the Philippines, to acquire 91,395 shares or 99.99% of the issued and outstanding stock of BG Global at an aggregate consideration of 1,500,000 newly issued shares of stock of the Company and $1,500,000 in cash. BG Global is in the business of owning and leasing electronic gaming machines placed in venues in the Philippines. The Agreement was intended to be consummated upon written approval from the board of directors of each party and the exchange of the consideration.

To date, this transaction has not been consummated, and management believes that the Agreement has terminated pursuant to its own terms inasmuch as the conditions of closing were not met by September 30, 2014, although a written notice of termination was not given by either party thereto pursuant to Article 4 of the Agreement.

At present, we have no employees, other than Ms. Yung, our officer and director. She does not have an employment agreement with us. We presently do not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt such plans in the future.
