 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

CarCharging is a leading owner, operator, and provider of electric vehicle (&#8220;EV&#8221;) charging equipment and networked EV charging services. CarCharging offers both residential and commercial EV charging equipment, enabling EV drivers to easily recharge at various location types. 

&#160; 

Our principal line of products and services is our Blink EV charging network (the &#8220;Blink Network&#8221;) and EV charging equipment (also known as electric vehicle supply equipment - EVSE) and EV related services. Our Blink Network is proprietary cloud-based software that operates, maintains, and tracks all of the Blink EV charging stations and the associated charging data. The Blink Network provides property owners, managers, and parking companies, who we refer to as our Property Partners, with cloud-based services that enable the remote monitoring and management of EV charging stations, payment processing, and provides EV drivers with vital station information including station location, availability, and applicable fees. 

&#160; 

We offer our Property Partners with a flexible range of business models for EV charging equipment and services. In our comprehensive and turnkey business model, we own and operate the EV charging equipment, manage the installation, maintenance, and related services; and share a portion of the EV charging revenue with the property owner. Alternatively, Property Partners may share in the equipment and installation expenses, with CarCharging operating and managing the EV charging stations and providing connectivity to the Blink Network. For Property Partners interested in purchasing and owning EV charging stations, that they manage, we can also provide EV charging hardware, site recommendations, connectivity to the Blink Network, and service and maintenance services. 

&#160; 

We have strategic partnerships across numerous transit/destination locations, including airports, auto dealers, healthcare/medical, hotel, mixed-use, municipal locations, multifamily residential and condo, parks and recreation areas, parking lots, religious institution, restaurants, retailers, schools and universities, stadiums, supermarkets, transportation hubs, and workplace locations. We currently have approximately 4,880 Level 2 public charging units, 130 DC Fast Charging EV chargers and 2,800 residential charging units in service on the Blink Network. Additionally, we currently have approximately 370 Level 2 charging units on other networks and there are also approximately an additional 3,400 non-networked, residential Blink EV charging stations. 

&#160; 

Industry Overview 

&#160; 

The market for plug-in electric vehicles (EVs) has experienced significant growth in recent years in response to consumer demand for vehicles with greater fuel efficiency, greater performance, and with lower environmental emissions. The demand for EVs has been spurred in part by federal and state fuel economy standards and other state and local incentives and rebates for EVs. For example, the states of California, Oregon, Ney York, Maryland, Massachusetts and others have created mandates for EVs with the goal of 3.3 million EVs on the road by 2025. At the same time, oil and gas prices continue to experience spikes and fluctuations, while at the same time the cost of battery technology continues to fall as the battery industry achieves scale. In response, major automotive OEMs have accelerated the adoption of EV models, with more than 25 EV models currently available from Tesla, Nissan, Kia, GM, Ford, Fiat, BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Volkswagen, Toyota, Mitsubishi, Land Rover, Porsche, and many others. As a result, sales of EVs have risen to more than 400,000 vehicles in 2015 and, according to the Electric Drive Transportation Association, is expected to grow by a factor of 12 to 3.5 million in 2025. 

&#160; 

However, a major impediment to EV adoption has been the lack of EV charging infrastructure. We believe that a viable model for continued deployment of EV charging infrastructure continues to evolve. Examples of federal programs designed to stimulate development of EV charging infrastructure includes the recent White House announcement of, among other things, programs to release up to $4.5 billion in loan guarantees and invite applications to support the deployment of commercial EV charging facilities, and the launching of the Fixing America&#8217;s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act process to identify and develop corridors for zero emission and alternative fuel vehicles, which will include a network of EV fast charging stations. 

&#160; 

According to a report published by Navigant Research in the second quarter of 2016, sales of EV service equipment globally are expected to grow from approximately 0.425 million units in 2016 to 2.5 million units in 2025. Major utility companies are also working on upgrading their grid infrastructure in order to prepare for mass consumption of electricity by electric vehicles. 

&#160; 

While many believe that the majority of EV charging occurs at home, we believe the need for a robust, pervasive public EV charging infrastructure is required to eliminate range anxiety. In addition to providing strategic, public charging stations, we believe that it is necessary to provide EV charging solutions to those drivers that do not live in single-family homes, but share parking facilities, including multifamily residential apartment buildings and condominiums. While there are a few, leading competitors and various, smaller EV charging equipment or service providers that have emerged in the market, their products and services are limited. Typically, these companies offer EV charging equipment, an EV charging network, or EV charging services with third party equipment.

&#160; 

Our EV Charging Solutions 

&#160; 

We offer a broad range of EV charging products and services to property partners and EV drivers. 

&#160; 

EV Charging Products &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Level 2 . We offer Level 2 (AC) EV charging equipment, which is ideal for commercial and residential use, and has the standard J1772 connector, which is compatible with all major auto manufacturer electric vehicle models. Our commercial equipment is available in pedestal or wall mount configurations, with the ability to connect to our robust Blink Network. Our non-networked residential product, Blink HQ, is available in a wall-mount configuration and offers a delay start feature that allows users to optimize charging by utility rates. Level 2 charging stations typically provide a full charge in two to eight hours. Level 2 chargers are ideally suited for low-cost installations and frequently used parking locations, such as workplace, multifamily residential, retail and mixed-use, parking garages, municipalities, colleges/schools, hospitals, and airports. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; DCFC . Our DC Fast charging equipment (DFC) currently has the CHAdeMo connector, which is compatible with Nissan, Kia, and Tesla electric vehicle models (additional models may be potentially available in the future), and typically provides a full-charge in less than 30 minutes. Installation of DC Fast Charging stations and grid requirements are typically greater than Level 2 charging stations, and are ideally suited for transportation hubs and locations between travel destinations. &#160; 

We intend to enhance our current equipment offerings by developing and offering new generations of EV charging equipment. 

&#160; 

&#160; EV Charging Services &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Blink Network . Our proprietary, cloud-based Blink Network allows us to share convenient and advantageous station management features and pertinent data with property partners and EV drivers through user interfaces. These features include real-time station status, payment processing, detailed charging session information, monitoring and troubleshooting stations remotely, as well as standard and customized reporting capabilities (energy dispensed, greenhouse gases reduced, oil barrels saved, gallons of fuel saved, etc .). &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Blink Mobile application . Our proprietary mobile application, available for iOS and Android, provides EV drivers with vital station information, including the ability to locate EV charging stations on the Blink Network, view real-time station status information, pay and initiate EV charging sessions, become a Blink member, and manage their Blink account (billing information, RFID cards, SMS and email notifications). &#160; 

We believe that we are unique in our ability to provide various business models to property partners and leverage our technology to meet the needs of both property partners and EV drivers. Our property partner business model options include: 

&#160; 

&#160; 1. The property partner purchases our EV charging equipment for use by EV drivers and pays for connectivity to the Blink Network as well as payment transaction fees. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2. We provide EV charging equipment, which we own and maintain, and operate the EV charging services through our Blink Network and share a portion of the revenues generated from the stations with our property partner. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 3. We also offer customized business models that meet individual property partner needs. &#160; 

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

Our objective is to continue to be a leading provider of EV charging solutions by deploying mass scale EV charging infrastructure, and by doing so, enable the accelerated growth of EV adoption and the EV industry. Key elements of our strategy include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Relentless Focus on Customer Satisfaction . Increase overall customer satisfaction with new and existing property partners and EV drivers by upgrading and expanding the EV charging footprint throughout high demand, high density geographic areas. In addition, improve productivity and utilization of existing EV charging stations, as well as to continue to enhance the valuable features of our EV charging station hardware and the Blink Network. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Leverage Our Early Mover Advantage. We continue to leverage our large and defendable first mover advantage and the digital customer experience we have created for both drivers and property partners. We believe that there are tens of thousands of Blink driver registrants that appreciate the value of transacting charging sessions on a leading, established, and robust network experience. We have thousands of Blink chargers deployed across the United States and the tendency is to stay within one consistent network for expansion on any given property. 

&#160; 

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Expand Sales and Marketing Resources . Our intention is to invest in sales and marketing infrastructure to capitalize on the growth in the market as well as to expand our go-to-market strategy. Today, we use a direct sales force and intend to continue to expand our efforts as well as invest in a wholesale channel go-to-market strategy that may include wholesale electrical distributors, independent sales agents, utilities, solar distributors, contractors, automotive manufacturers, and auto dealers. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Continue to Invest in Technology Innovation . We will continue to enhance the product offerings available in our EV charging hardware, cloud-based software, and networking capability. This includes the design and launch of our next generation of EV charging solutions, including accelerating the charge currents currently available in EV charging hardware and new, robust Blink Network features in order to distance ourselves from the competition. The company&#8217;s key service solutions allow us to remain technology agnostic, and if market conditions shift, we have the option to leverage pure play hardware providers to augment our products. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Properly Capitalize Our Business . We continue to pursue and welcome new potential capital sources to deliver on key operational objectives and the necessary resources to execute our overall strategy. The EV charger industry as a whole is undercapitalized to deliver the full potential of the expected EV market growth in the near future. We expect to retain our leadership position with new capital. &#160; 

Our Customers and Partners 

&#160; 

CarCharging has strategic partnerships across numerous transit/destination locations, including airports, auto dealers, healthcare/medical, hotel, mixed-use, municipal locations, multifamily residential and condo, parks and recreation areas, parking lots, religious institution, restaurants, retailers, schools and universities, stadiums, supermarkets, transportation hubs, and workplace locations. CarCharging has hundreds of property partners that include well-recognized companies, large municipalities, and local businesses. Some examples are Caltrans, City of Azusa, City of Chula Vista, City of Springfield, City of Tucson, Cracker Barrel, Federal Realty, Fred Meyer Stores, Inc., Fry&#8217;s Food &#38; Drug, Inc., IKEA, JBG Associates, LLC, Kroger Company and Ralphs Grocery Company. CarCharging continues to establish contracts with property partners that previously had contracts with ECOtality, the former owner of the Blink related assets. 

&#160; 

We currently have approximately 11,600 charging stations deployed of which 4,880 are Level 2 public charging units, 130 DC Fast Charging EV chargers and 2,800 residential charging units in service on the Blink Network. Additionally, we currently have approximately 370 Level 2 charging units on other networks and there are also approximately an additional 3,400 non-networked, residential Blink EV charging stations. 

&#160; 

Our revenues are primarily derived from EV charging hardware sales to our property partners, fees from public EV charging services to EV drivers, government grants, and marketing incentives. EV charging fees to EV drivers are based either on an hourly rate, a per kilowatt-hour (&#8220;kWh&#8221;) rate, or by session, and are calculated based on a variety of factors, including associated station costs and local electricity tariffs. In addition, other sources of fees from EV charging services are network fees and payment processing fees paid by our property partners. 

&#160; 

We continue to invest in the improvement of the service and maintenance of our Company-owned stations, as well as those stations with a service and maintenance plans, and expanding our cloud-based network capabilities. We anticipate continuing to expand our revenues by selling our next generation of EV charging equipment, expanding our sales channels, and implementing EV charging station occupancy fees (after charging is completed, fees for remaining connected to the charging station beyond an allotted grace period), subscription plans for our Blink-owned public charging locations, and advertising fees. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

We currently maintain an in-house field sales force that maintains business relationships with our property partners and develops new sales opportunities through lead generation and marketing. We also sell our products and services through reseller partners, which then sell to property representatives and/or hosts. 

&#160; 

Marketing is performed by CarCharging&#8217;s in-house staff. To promote and sell the Company&#8217;s services to property owners and managers, parking companies, and EV drivers, CarCharging also utilizes marketing and communication channels including press releases, email marketing, websites ( www.CarCharging.com , www.BlinkNetwork.com , www.BlinkHQ.com ), Google AdWords, and social media. The information on the Company&#8217;s websites is not, and will not be deemed, a part of this Report or incorporated into any other filings the Company makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;).

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The EV charging equipment and service market is highly competitive and we expect the market to become increasingly competitive as new entrants enter this growing market. Our products and services compete on the basis of product performance and features, total cost of ownership, sales capabilities, financial stability, brand recognition, product reliability and size of installed base. Our existing competition currently includes ChargePoint, which manufactures EV charging equipment and operates the ChargePoint Network; and EVgo , which offers home and public charging with pay-as-you-go and subscription models. There are other entrants into the connected EV charging station equipment market, such as General Electric, SemaCharge, EVConnect, and Greenlots. These additional competitors struggle with gaining the necessary network traction but could gain momentum in the future. While Tesla does offer EV charging services, the connector type utilized currently restricts the chargers to Tesla vehicles. There are many other large and small EV charger companies that offer non-networked or &#8220;basic&#8221; chargers that have limited customer leverage, but could provide a low-cost solution for basic charger needs in commercial and home locations. 

&#160; 

Although we believe we have competitive advantages, such as our long-term contracts with property owners and managers, and our flexible business model where we are able to sell both EV charging stations as well provide access to a leading EV charging network, many of our current and expected future competitors have considerably greater financial and other resources than we do, and may leverage those resources to compete effectively. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation and Incentives 

&#160; 

Regulations 

&#160; 

State, regional, and local regulations for installation of EV charging stations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may include permitting requirements, inspection requirements, licensing of contractors, and certifications as examples. Compliance with such regulation(s) may cause installation delays. 

&#160; 

Currently, the Company applies charging fees by the kilowatt-hour for its services in states that permit this policy and hourly and by session for its services in states that do not permit per kilowatt-hour pricing. California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, Virginia, and Washington have determined that companies that sell EV charging services to the public will not be regulated as utilities, therefore, allowing CarCharging to charge fees based on kilowatt usage. These individual state determinations are not binding on any other regulator or jurisdiction; however, they demonstrate a trend in the way states view the industry. Other jurisdictions are in the process of adopting such reforms. 

&#160; 

Historically, the Company has secured and depended on incentives, and intends to continues to pursue incentives from various governmental jurisdictions. As an example, the Company recently endorsed the Obama Administration&#8217;s announcement of, among other things, programs to: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Release up to $4.5 billion in loan guarantees and invite applications to support the deployment of commercial EV charging facilities; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Launch the Fixing America&#8217;s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act process to identify and develop corridors for zero emission and alternative fuel vehicles, which will include a network of EV fast charging stations; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Host an &#8220;Electric Vehicle Hackathon&#8221; in order to determine insights and develop new EV charging solutions. &#160; 

We intend to continue to vigorously seek additional grants, loans, rebates, subsidies, and incentives as a cost effective means of reducing our capital investment in the promotion, purchase, and installation of charging stations where applicable. We expect that these incentives, rebates, and tax credits will be critical to our future growth. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, unfair competition and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights. Our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. 

&#160; 

As of April 28, 2016, we had 6 patents issued in the U.S., 4 patents issued in Canada, and 4 patents issued in South Korea. These patents relate to various aspects of battery charging and EV charging design. We intend to continue to regularly assess opportunities for seeking patent protection for those aspects of our technology, designs and methodologies that we believe provide a meaningful competitive advantage. However, our ability to do so may be limited until such time as we are able to generate cash flow from operations or otherwise raise sufficient capital to continue to invest in our intellectual property. If we are unable to do so, our ability to protect our intellectual property or prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights may be impaired. 

&#160; 

In addition, in March 2012, the Company entered into an exclusive Patent License Agreement with Michael D. Farkas, our Executive Chairman of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, and an affiliate of Mr. Farkas (the &#8220;Farkas License&#8221;), whereby the Company agreed to pay a royalty of 10% of the gross profits received by the Company from commercial sales and/or use of two provisional patent applications, one relating to an inductive charging parking bumper and one relating to a process which allows multiple EVs to plug into an EV charging station simultaneously and charge as the current becomes available. 

&#160; 

In March 2016, the Company and Mr. Farkas terminated the license agreement as to the pending patent application relating to the inductive charging parking bumper. The Company has not paid nor incurred any royalties to date under the Farkas License Agreement. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of July 27, 2016, we have 30 full-time and 7 part-time employees. Our full-time employees work in the following places: 10 are located at our headquarters in Miami Beach, Florida, 15 are located in Phoenix, Arizona, 1 is located in Los Gatos, California, 1 is located in San Francisco, California, 1 is located in Los Angeles, California, 1 is located in New York, New York and 1 is located in Oregon.
