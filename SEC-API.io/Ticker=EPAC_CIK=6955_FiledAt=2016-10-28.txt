 Item 1. Business 

General 

Actuant Corporation, headquartered in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, is a Wisconsin corporation incorporated in 1910. We are a global diversified company that designs, manufactures and distributes a broad range of industrial products and systems to various end markets. The Company is organized into three operating segments: Industrial, Energy and Engineered Solutions. The Industrial segment is primarily involved in the design, manufacture and distribution of branded hydraulic and mechanical tools to the maintenance, industrial, infrastructure and production automation markets. The Energy segment provides joint integrity products and services, customized offshore vessel mooring solutions, as well as rope and cable solutions to the global oil &#38; gas, power generation and other markets. The Engineered Solutions segment provides highly engineered position and motion control systems to original equipment manufacturers (&#8220;OEM&#8221;) in various on and off-highway vehicle markets, as well as a variety of other products to the industrial and agricultural markets. Financial information related to the Company's segments is included in Note 13, "Business Segment, Geographic and Customer Information" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 

Our business model, illustrated below, emphasizes cash flow generation. The model starts with core sales growth, (sales growth excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency rate changes) through customer intimacy, new products and emerging market penetration. We further increase sales and profits through capital deployment in business acquisitions and capital expenditures. The acquisitions add new capabilities, technologies, customers and geographic presence to make our businesses stronger. Operational excellence processes including effective product sourcing, lean manufacturing, acquisition integration and leadership development, along with other continuous improvement activities, are utilized to improve our businesses. When executed effectively, these actions generate strong earnings and cash flow, which we reinvest back into the business or return to shareholders via dividends and stock buybacks. 

Our long-term goal is to grow diluted earnings per share faster than most multi-industry peers. We intend to leverage our strong market positions to generate core sales growth that exceeds end-market growth rates. Core sales growth is accomplished through a combination of share capture, product innovation and market expansion into emerging industries and geographic regions. In addition to core sales growth, we are focused on acquiring complementary businesses. Following an acquisition, we seek to drive growth opportunities (additional cross-selling opportunities and customer relationships) and cost reductions via operational excellence. We also focus on profit margin expansion and cash flow generation to achieve our financial objectives. Our LEAD (&#8220;Lean Enterprise Across Disciplines&#8221;) Business System utilizes various continuous improvement techniques to reduce costs, improve efficiencies and drive operational excellence across all locations and functions worldwide, thereby expanding profit margins. Strong cash flow generation is achieved by maximizing returns on assets and minimizing primary working capital needs. Our LEAD efforts also support our core sales growth. The cash flow that results from efficient asset management and improved profitability is used to fund strategic acquisitions, common stock repurchases and internal growth opportunities. 

Our businesses provide an array of products and services across multiple end markets and geographies which results in significant diversification. The long-term sales growth and profitability of our business is dependent not only on increased demand in end markets and the overall economic environment, but also on our ability to identify, consummate and integrate strategic acquisitions, develop and market innovative new products, expand our business activity geographically and continuously improve operational excellence. Despite current challenges from weak end market demand, we remain focused on maintaining our financial position and flexibility by adjusting our cost structure to reflect changes in demand levels and by proactively managing working capital and cash flow generation.

International Business 

Our products and services are generally available globally, with our principal markets outside the United States being Europe and Asia. In fiscal 2016 &#32;we derived 42% &#32;of our net sales from the United States, 36% &#32;from Europe, 13% &#32;from Asia, 6% &#32;from the Middle East, and 3% &#32;from other geographic areas. We have operations around the world and this geographic diversity allows us to draw on the skills of a global workforce, provides flexibility to our operations, allows us to drive economies of scale, provides revenue streams that may help offset economic trends that are specific to individual countries and offers us an opportunity to access new markets. In addition, we believe that our future growth depends, in part, on our ability to develop products and sales opportunities that successfully target developing countries. Although international operations are subject to certain risks, we continue to believe that a global presence is key to maintaining strong relationships with many of our global customers. Financial information related to the Company's geographic areas is included in Note 10, "Income Taxes" and Note 13, "Business Segment, Geographic and Customer Information" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 

Product Development and Engineering 

We conduct research and development activities to develop new products, enhance the functionality, effectiveness, ease of use and reliability of our existing products and expand the applications for our products. We believe that our engineering and research and development efforts have been key drivers of our success in the marketplace. Our advanced design and engineering capabilities contribute to the development of innovative and highly engineered products, maintain our technological leadership in each segment and enhance our ability to provide customers with unique and customized solutions and products. While much research and development activity involves improvements to existing products, our engineering staff engages in research for new products and product enhancements. We anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development as we seek to provide innovative products to maintain and improve our competitive position. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred, and were $18 million in both fiscal 2016 and 2015 and $20 million &#32;in fiscal 2014 . We also incur significant costs in connection with fulfilling custom orders and developing unique solutions for unique customer needs, which are not included in these expense totals. 

Through our advanced proprietary processes, with over 300 &#32;patents, we create products that satisfy specific customer needs and make tasks easier and more efficient for customers. No individual patent or trademark is believed to be of such importance that its termination would have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Competition 

The markets for all of our products are highly competitive. We provide a diverse and broad range of industrial products and systems to numerous global end markets, many of which are highly fragmented. Although we face larger competitors in several served markets, much of our competition is comprised of smaller companies that often lack the global footprint or financial resources to serve global customers. We compete for business principally on the basis of customer service, product quality and availability, engineering, research and development expertise, and price. In addition, we believe that our competitive cost structure, strategic global sourcing capabilities and global distribution support our competitive position. 

Manufacturing and Operations 

While we do have extensive manufacturing capabilities including machining, stamping, injection molding and fabrication, our manufacturing consists primarily of light assembly of components we source from a network of global 

suppliers. We have implemented single piece flow methodology in most of our manufacturing plants, which reduces inventory levels, lowers &#8220;re-work&#8221; costs and shortens lead times to customers. Components are built to our highly engineered specifications by a variety of suppliers, including those in low cost countries such as China, Turkey, India and Mexico. We have built strong relationships with our key suppliers and, while we single source certain of our components, in most cases there are several qualified alternative sources. 

Raw Material Costs and Inflation 

We source a wide variety of materials and components from a network of global suppliers. These items are typically available from numerous suppliers. Raw materials that go into the components we source, such as steel and plastic resin, are subject to price fluctuations, which could have a negative impact on our results. We strive to offset such cost inflation with price increases to customers and by driving operational cost reductions. 

No meaningful measures of inflation are available because we have significant operations in countries with diverse rates of inflation and currency rate movements. However, we believe that the overall rate of inflation in recent years has been relatively low and has not had a significant effect on our results of operations, after factoring in offsetting price increases and other manufacturing cost reductions. 

Order Backlogs and Seasonality 

Our Industrial and Energy segments have relatively short order-to-ship cycles, while our OEM oriented Engineered Solutions segment has a longer cycle, and therefore typically has a larger backlog. We had order backlogs of $149 million &#32;and $193 million &#32;at August 31, 2016 &#32;and 2015 , respectively. Substantially all orders are expected to be filled within twelve months. While we typically enjoy a stronger second half of our fiscal year, our consolidated sales are not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations.

Employees 

At August 31, 2016 , we employed 5,200 &#32;individuals. Our employees are not subject to collective bargaining agreements, with the exception of 300 &#32;U.S. production employees, as well as certain international employees covered by government mandated collective labor agreements. We believe we have a good working relationship with our employees. 

Environmental Matters 

Our operations, like those of most industrial businesses, are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those regulating discharges of hazardous materials into the air and water, the storage and disposal of such materials and the clean-up of soil and groundwater contamination. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental regulations. Compliance with these laws has and will require expenditures on an ongoing basis. However, environmental expenditures over the last three years have not been material. Soil and groundwater contamination has been identified at certain facilities that we operate or formerly owned or operated. We are also a party to certain state and local environmental matters, have provided environmental indemnifications for certain divested businesses and retain responsibility for certain potential environmental liabilities. For further information, see Note 14, &#8220;Contingencies and Litigation&#8221; in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
