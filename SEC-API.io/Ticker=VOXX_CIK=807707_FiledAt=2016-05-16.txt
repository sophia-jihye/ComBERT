Acquisitions 

We have acquired and continue to integrate the following acquisitions, discussed below, into our existing business structure: 

Effective September 1, 2015 ("the Closing Date"), Voxx completed its acquisition of a majority voting interest in substantially all of the assets and certain specified liabilities of Eyelock, Inc. and Eyelock Corporation (collectively the &#8220;Seller&#8221;) through a newly-formed entity, Eyelock LLC, for a total purchase consideration of $31,880, which consisted of a cash payment of $15,504, assignment of the fair value of the indebtedness owed to the Company by the Seller of $,676 and the fair value of the non-controlling interest of $12,900, reduced by $1,200 for amounts owed to the LLC by the selling shareholders. EyeLock is a market leader of iris-based identity authentication solutions and this acquisition allows the Company to enter into the growing biometrics market. 

On March 14, 2012, Voxx International (Germany) GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of Voxx, acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Car Communication Holding GmbH and its worldwide subsidiaries ("Hirschmann") for a total purchase price of approximately $114,000 (based on the rate of exchange as of the close of business on the closing date) plus related transaction fees, expenses and working capital adjustments. Hirschmann is a recognized tier-1 supplier of communications and infotainment solutions and antenna solutions, primarily to the automotive industry, and counts among its global customers Audi, BMW, DAF, Daimler, PSA, Renault, Volkswagen Group and AT&#38;T, among others. Hirschmann delivers technologically advanced automotive antenna systems and automotive digital TV tuner systems and is recognized throughout the industry for its commitment to innovation, having developed the world's first hybrid (analog and digital) TV tuner and the first digital TV tuner for the Chinese automotive market. 

On March 1, 2011, Soundtech LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Voxx, acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Klipsch Group, Inc. and its worldwide subsidiaries ("Klipsch") for a total purchase price of $169,599 including contingent consideration of approximately $2,200 as a result of a contractual agreement with a former principal shareholder, plus related transaction fees and expenses. Klipsch is a global provider of high-end speakers for audio, multi-media and home theater applications. The acquisition of Klipsch added world-class brand names to Voxx's offerings, increased its distribution network, both domestically and abroad, and provided the Company with entry into the high-end installation market at both the residential and commercial installation market. In addition to the Klipsch&#174; brand, the Klipsch portfolio includes Jamo&#174;, Mirage&#174;, and Energy&#174;.

Strategy 

Our objective is to grow our business both organically and through strategic acquisitions. We will drive the business organically by continued product development in new and emerging technologies that should increase gross margins, and improve operating income. We are focused on expanding sales both domestically and internationally and broadening our customer and partner base as we bring these new products to our target markets. In addition, we plan to continue to acquire synergistic companies that would allow us to leverage our overhead, penetrate new markets and expand existing product categories. 

The key elements of our strategy are as follows: 

Continue to build and capitalize on the VOXX family of brands. &#32;&#32;We believe the "VOXX" portfolio of brands is one of our greatest strengths and offers us significant opportunity for increased market penetration. Today, VOXX International has over 30 global brands in its portfolio, which provides the Company with the ability to bring to market products under brands that consumers 

know to be quality. In addition, with such a wide brand portfolio, we can manage channels and sell into multiple outlets as well as leverage relationships with distributors, retailers, aftermarket car dealers and expeditors, and to global OEMs. Finally, we are open to opportunities to license some of the brands as an additional use of the brands and a growth strategy. 

Continue to maintain diversified, blue chip customer base. Voxx distributes products through a wide range of specialty and mass merchandise channels, and has arrangements with tier-1 auto OEMs. OEM products account for 37% of Fiscal 2016 &#32;sales. The top-five customers represented 31% of sales, and no single customer accounted for over 10% of 2016 &#32;sales. 

Capitalize on niche product and distribution opportunities in our target markets. &#32;&#32;Throughout our history, we have used our extensive distribution and supply networks to capitalize on niche product and distribution opportunities in the automotive, premium audio and consumer accessories categories. We will continue that focus as we remain committed to innovation, developing products internally and through our outsourced technology and manufacturing partners to provide our customers with products that are in demand by consumers. 

Combine new, internal manufacturing capabilities with our proven outsourced manufacturing with industry partners . For years, VOXX International employed an outsourced manufacturing strategy that enabled the Company to deliver the latest technological advances without the fixed costs associated with manufacturing. With recent acquisitions, the Company now has added manufacturing capabilities to produce select product lines, such as high-end speakers, rear-seat entertainment systems, digital TV tuners and antennas, and iris identification and security related products. This blend of internal and outsourced manufacturing enables the Company to drive innovation, control product quality and speed time-to-market. 

Use innovative technology generation capabilities to enable us to build a robust pipeline of new products. Voxx has invested significantly in R&#38;D, and has increased R&#38;D expenditures from $21,267 in Fiscal 2014 to $23,486 &#32;in Fiscal 2016, net of reimbursements. The Company saw increases in Fiscal 2016 due in part to the acquisition of a controlling interest in EyeLock on September 1, 2015. Voxx uses a mix of internal and external R&#38;D, internal and external manufacturing, and has a number of valuable trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names and other intellectual property. Through Voxx's increased focus on R&#38;D, the Company has built a pipeline of new products across all three segments, principally within the Automotive and Consumer Accessories segments. 

Leverage our domestic and international distribution network. &#32;&#32;We believe that today VOXX International Corporation has the most expansive distribution network. Our distribution network, which includes power retailers, mass merchandisers, distributors, online retailers, professional and commercial installation channels, drug stores, hardware and furniture chains, car dealers and OEM's will allow us to increase our market penetration. We intend to capitalize on new and existing distribution outlets to further grow our business across our three operating segments, both domestically and abroad. 

Grow our international presence. &#32;&#32;We continue to expand our international presence in Europe through our subsidiaries in Germany, as well as operations in Canada, Mexico, Hungary and Hong Kong. We also continue to export from our domestic operations in the United States. Through our acquisitions of Klipsch and Hirschmann, we have expanded our presence throughout Europe, the Asia Pacific region and in select emerging markets. Our strategy remains to diversify our exposure to any particular geography, while expanding our product offerings and distribution touch points across the world. 

Pursue strategic and complementary acquisitions. We continue to monitor economic and industry conditions in order to evaluate potential strategic and synergistic business acquisitions that are expected to allow us to leverage overhead, penetrate new markets and expand our existing business distribution. Over the past several years, the Company has employed an M&#38;A strategy to build its brand portfolio and enhance its product offering in higher margin product categories, while at the same time, exiting lower margin and commoditized product lines, resulting in improved bottom-line performance. The Company is focused on continuing to grow organically, but may pursue opportunistic acquisitions to augment our automotive segment (primarily with OEM accounts), consumer accessories and premium audio. 

Improve bottom-line performance and generate sustainable shareholder returns. &#32;&#32;The Company has instituted an aggressive strategy in recent years to shift its product mix to higher-margin product categories, while controlling costs and strategically investing in its infrastructure. These changes have resulted in higher gross profit margins. The Company remains focused on growing its business organically, continuing to enhance its gross profit margins and leveraging its fixed overhead structure to generate sustainable returns for its stockholders. 

Maintain disciplined acquisition criteria. Virtually all of our acquisitions over the past decade have been made to strengthen our product offerings, customer reach and growth potential across our operating business segments. Our strategy remains to acquire complimentary businesses, products and/or assets in our Automotive, Premium Audio and Consumer Accessories operating segments. Additionally, acquisitions should have a gross margin structure equal to or higher than our consolidated gross margins, 

and we will continue to look for acquisitions where we can leverage our corporate overhead and resources. Furthermore, it is important that management remains with Voxx as part of the acquisition, as their domain expertise, knowledge of both the inner workings of their respective companies and the end-markets they serve are paramount to successfully running operations and achieving growth. We also pursue acquisitions that will be accretive for the Company and its shareholders in the first year such acquisitions are made. 

Rapidly integrate acquired businesses. One of the more compelling factors as to why acquired businesses choose VOXX International Corporation is that we are perceived as both a financial and strategic partner. We are operators, and companies view their association with us as a positive for the future of their businesses in that we can provide resources and support that others in our sector, or in the Private Equity community, cannot. Our strategy upon acquisition, and in the years that follow, is to leverage our corporate strengths and integrate acquisitions into our operations. We provide accounting, MIS, warehouse and logistics support, as well as a host of value-added services that enable acquired companies to lower their cost basis and improve profitability. Over the past three years in particular, we have consolidated facilities in our German operations and in Indiana, where we brought our RCA&#174; and Klipsch operating groups together. We have also implemented an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) upgrade, which has brought many of our acquired businesses onto our corporate systems, and will provide future cost savings and improved efficiencies.

We participate in selected product categories in the automotive, premium audio and consumer accessories markets within the electronics industry. These markets are large and diverse, encompass a broad range of products and offer the ability to specialize in niche product groups.

Based on this, we continue to introduce new products across all segments, with an increased focus on niche product offerings.

Patents, Trademarks/Tradenames, Licensing and Royalties 

The Company regards its trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, and similar intellectual property as important to its operations. It relies on trademark, copyright and patent law, domain name regulations, and confidentiality or license agreements to protect its proprietary rights. The Company has registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of patents, trademarks, domain names and copyrights by U.S. and foreign governmental authorities. Additionally, the Company has filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of its proprietary technology. The Company renews its registrations, which vary in duration, as it deems appropriate from time to time. 

The Company has licensed in the past, and expects that it may license in the future, certain of its proprietary rights to third parties. Some of the Company's products are designed to include intellectual property licensed or otherwise obtained from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company's products, the Company believes, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially 

reasonable terms; however, there is no guarantee such licenses could be obtained at all. We intend to operate in a way that does not result in willful infringement of the patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights of other parties. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that a claim of infringement will not be asserted against us or that any such assertion will not result in a judgment or order requiring us to obtain a license in order to make, use, or sell our products. 

License and royalty programs offered to our manufacturers, customers and other electronic suppliers are structured using a fixed amount per unit or a percentage of net sales, depending on the terms of the agreement. Current license and royalty agreements have duration periods which range from 1 to 15 years or continue in perpetuity. Certain agreements may be renewed at termination of the agreement. The Company's license and royalty income is recorded upon sale and amounted to $1,463 , $1,610 &#32;and $2,072 &#32;for the years ended February 29, 2016 , February 28, 2015 &#32;and February 28, 2014 , respectively.

Product Development, Warranty and Customer Service 

Our product development cycle includes: 

&#8226; 

identifying consumer trends and potential demand, 

&#8226; 

responding to those trends through product design and feature integration, which includes software design, electrical engineering, industrial design and pre-production testing. In the case of OEM customers, the product development cycle may also include product validation to customer quality standards, and 

&#8226; 

evaluating and testing new products in our own facilities to ensure compliance with our design specifications and standards. 

Utilizing our company-owned and third party facilities in the United States, South America, Europe and Asia, we work closely with customers and suppliers throughout the product design, testing and development process in an effort to meet the expectations of consumer demand for technologically-advanced and high quality products. Our Troy, Michigan; Orlando, Florida; Neckartenzlingen, Germany; N&#252;rnberg, Germany; Fulda, Germany; Shanghai, China and B&#233;k&#233;scsaba, Hungary facilities are ISO/TS 16949:2009, ISO 14001:2004 and/or ISO 9001:2008 certified, which requires the monitoring of quality standards in all facets of business. 

We are committed to providing product warranties for all of our product lines, which generally range from 90 days up to seven years. The Company also provides warranties for certain vehicle security products for the life of the vehicle for the original owner. To support our warranties, we have independent warranty centers in the United States and Europe. Our customer service group, along with our Company websites, provides product information, answers questions and serves as a technical hotline for installation help for end-users and customers. 

Suppliers 

We work directly with our suppliers on industrial design, feature sets, product development and testing in order to ensure that our products and component parts meet our design specifications. 

We purchase our products and component parts from manufacturers principally located in several Pacific Rim countries, including China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, as well as the United States, Canada, Mexico and Europe. In selecting our manufacturers, we consider quality, price, service, reputation, financial stability, as well as labor practices, disruptions, or shortages. In order to provide coordination and supervision of supplier performance such as price negotiations, delivery and quality control, we maintain buying and inspection offices in China and Hong Kong. We consider relations with our suppliers to be good and alternative sources of supply are generally available within 120 days. We have few long-term contracts with our suppliers and we generally purchase our products under short-term purchase orders. Although we believe that alternative sources of supply are currently available, an unplanned shift to a new supplier could result in product delays and increased cost, which may have a material impact on our operations. 

Competition 

The electronics industry is highly competitive across all product categories, and we compete with a number of well-established companies that manufacture and sell similar products. Brand name, design, advancement of technology and features as well as price are the major competitive factors within the electronics industry. Our Automotive products compete against factory-supplied products, including those provided by, among others, Volkswagen, Audi, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, as well as against major companies in the automotive aftermarket, such as Sony, Panasonic, Kenwood, Directed Electronics, Autopage, Rosen, Myron and Davis, Phillips, Insignia, and Pioneer and other Tier 1 OEM's, such as Laird and Kathrein. Our Premium Audio products compete against major companies such as Polk, Definitive, Bose, Sonos, Sonance, and Bowers and Wilkins. Our Consumer Accessories product lines compete against major companies such as Sony, Phillips, Emerson Radio, Jasco, Belkin and GoPro.
