 Item 1. Business Introduction 

Our Core Business 

Before the year 2013, the Company had been mainly engaged in the design, production and distribution of the off-road vehicle products. Due to various market factors and the environment with positive government supports, starting from the year 2013, the Company gradually shifted its main focus towards the development on pure electric vehicles (&#147;EV&#148;) products and manufacturing electric vechicles parts. Also in the year 2013, the Company set up a Joint Venture with Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. (&#147;Geely&#148;) to focus on EV production, based on the agreement, EV production should be transferred to the Joint Venture. At the end of 2014, this transfer had been completed. Starting from 2015, the majority of the Company&#146;s revenue and profit were generated from the sale of EV parts. 

The Market for Electric Vehicles 

Business Environment and Policy 

Research and development of major EV technology projects in China began in 2001. Driven by two central government five-year plans for scientific and technological research as well as by the Olympics, World Expo and the &#8220;1000 cars in 10 cities&#8221; demonstration platform, the Chinese electric automobile sector was officially born, which brings a positive basis for EV business. 

With the growing consumer demand for motor vehicles in China, many cities are experiencing severe problems from environmental pollution. At the same time, with the lack of the efficient traffic planning, major Chinese cities are crippled by traffic congestion. Thus, major cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Guiyang, Shijiazhuang, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Shenzhen, have begun to implement various policies restricting the purchase and usage of traditional cars. We expect that more cities will have no choices but to adopt similar policies in the future. 

To improve the environment of the urban areas, the China Central Government, along with many municipalities, has been introducing numerous supporting policies that encouraged the usage and adoption of EVs, including subsidies, tax exemptions, special treatment of tag and license. Among these policies, the most significant development involved the availability of subsidies from central and local government for the sale of EVs. The process of receiving government subsidies is as follows: manufacturers receive central government subsidies through application and sell the EVs to local dealers at a discounted price, reflecting the deduction of the central government subsidy from the normal sale price. Local dealers then establish their retail price based upon the prevailing purchase price from the manufacturers, and then deduct the local government subsidy from the retail price before selling the EVs to consumers. Through these steps, consumers receive both subsidies from the central and local governments when they purchase EVs. 

Because the central and local government subsidies are disclosed to the public and all the subsidies are reviewed and verified by the respective governments, consumers know what subsidies they will receive along with the price they expect to pay for EVs. Therefore, even though dealers can sell vehicles at prices established at their discretion, programs are designed to assure that consumers receive the entire benefit from both subsidies. This allows full disclosure for consumers in the costs associated with purchasing EVs, along with the added benefits of the respective subsidies. 

Issues confronting the market 

Although the basis for the EV industry in China has already been established, the development of Chinese EV industry is still ongoing due to five major obstacles towards extensive commercialization of EVs and the full development of the EV market in China, these obstacles include the comparatively higher cost of EVs, compared with traditional automobiles, the shorter driving range between battery charges, long charging times for standard EV batteries, the limited infrastructure of EV charging facilities, and EV battery attenuation and maintenance. Among which, the main obstacle is the lack of the charging facilities. Now the government is driving to resolve this issue. In the State Council general meeting on September 23, 2015, the central government decided that the charging facilities needs to be 100% equipped with or available for the new residential areas and 10% for the public buildings and public parking places. On October 9, 2015, the central government issued the guidance of EV charging infrastructure development 2015-2020, and the target is to build up 12,000 stations for the centralized charging and quick exchange, 4.8 million more for the scrattered charging spots, to serve the needs of power charge for 5 million EVs all over the country. 

Our Solutions and Growth Strategy 

To resolve the key market issues as stated above, given the economic and population growth in China, we believe there is an opportunity for a new business model. Kandi has been advocating, and through the Service Company, as defined below, implemented the &#8220;Micro Public Transportation&#8221; (&#8220;MPT&#8221;) program, which provides a shared pure EV transportation platform to urban residents. While it is less expensive than standard taxis, the MPT is designed as a new business model for public transportation that maximizes the advantages of our existing EV products and technologies, and further stimulates the expansion of the EVs markets to urban communities. Since its inception, the MPT program has made impressive progress, and received great recognition and support from government officials, the end users, and our business partners throughout China. In order to smoothly move the MPT concept forward, Zhejiang Kandi Vehicles Co., Ltd., our 100% subsidery ,participated in the establishing of Zhejiang ZuoZhongYou Electric Vehicle Service Co., Ltd. (the &#8220;Service Company&#8221;), of which the Company has 9.5% of ownership interest. As of the end of 2015, the EV-Share Program had been launched, through the Service Company, in sixteen cities including Hangzhou, Shanghai, Chengdu, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Changsha, Changzhou, Rugao, Kunming, Jinhua, Tianjin, Chongqing, Haikou,Shenzhen, Xiangtan. 

Today, cities in China face four critical challenges in the traffic environment, including pollution, traffic congestion, insufficient parking space and growing scarcity of energy supplies, which are mainly the result of ever growing volume of gas-powered automobiles. One solution to solve these problems is to create cleaner and more affordable public transportation to urban residents. Currently, subway and bus are the most popular public transportation options available. In this regard, the Company advocates the MPT program to reduce the total number of private cars in use, which will improve environmental conditions, ease traffic congestion, alleviate parking availability, and reduce the reliance and use of fossil fuels. 

Besides the zero-emission benefit, the MPT program combines the advantages of city taxis, resident vehicular transport, rental cars and traditional mass transportation, along with the benefits of the availability of the vertical automatic charging/parking garage and the street-level service stations. It is a seamless transportation tool in all dimensions for urban public transportation, designed to greatly improve the efficiency of urban EV usage, while easing traffic congestion and allowing for greater parking resources. Additionally, it will likely promote the fast adoption of the pure EVs among Chinese consumers as the MPT enables consumers to rent pure EVs on a short-term hourly base or lease them on the long-term base, without concerns on the costs and issues associated with owning and maintaining EVs individually. 

The MPT program is supported by a network of charging/parking stations, which provides charging, maintenance and battery recycling facilities. The stations locate at airports, train stations, hotels, business centers, selected residential areas and other strategic locations close to city public transportation network. A centralized tracking system allows the service provider of EV-Share program to keep a close watch at the status and precise location of each vehicle. In addition to the short-term rental and long term leasing options to consumers described above, the Service Company also offers long-term leasing options to large enterprises, government entities and residential communities so they can use pure EVs for extended periods of time (the &#8220;Long-term Leasing Program&#8221;). In 2015, we have greatly benefited from the success of various MPT initiatives in China, especially the short-term hourly rental and the Long-term Leasing Program.

The Company has two main products: electric vehicle parts and off-road vehicles in year 2015 while it featured EV products before 2015. As the EV production was completely transferred to the JV Company at the end of 2014 according to the JV Agreement, Kandi focuses on the EV parts production and supply EV parts to the JV Company. Additionally, Kandi continues to produce and sell the off-road vehicles, which are our traditional products. 

Customers 

As of December 31, 2015, our major customers, in the aggregate, accounted for 97% of our sales. Currently, the Company is developing new business partners and clients for our products to reduce our dependence on existing customers and focusing the new business development efforts on our pure EV business. 

The Company's major customers, each of whom accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue, were as follows:

Sources of Supply 

All the raw materials are purchased from the suppliers. The major parts of our products are mainly manufactured by Kandi. Other components and parts that are needed are purchased from third-party suppliers. Kandi does not have, and does not anticipate having, any difficulty in obtaining required materials from its suppliers. 

The Company's material suppliers, each of whom accounted for more than 10% of our total purchases, were as follows: 

&#160; Purchases &#160; Accounts Payable &#160; Year &#160; Year Year &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Ended &#160; Ended Ended &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; December 31 &#160; December 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 Major Suppliers 2015 &#160; 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013 Dongguan Chuangming Battery Technology Co., Ltd. 26% &#160; - - 15% - - Zhejiang Tianneng Energy Technology Co., Ltd. 20% &#160; - - 24% - - Zhejiang New Energy Auto System Co., Ltd. 13% &#160; 31% 33% - 12% 12% Shandong Henyuan New Energy Tech Co., Ltd. 7% &#160; 25% - 14% 32% - Zhongju (Tianjin) New Energy Investment Co., Ltd. - &#160; 11% - - 29% - 

Competitors 

Our EV business faces the competition from two parts, one is the competition with traditional vehicles and the other is the competition from other EV manufacturers. 

In terms of the competition with the traditional vehicle manufacturers, many competitors are larger and having greater financial resources than us. But the traditional automobile companies face many urban traffic challenges, including urban pollution, traffic congestion, insufficient parking space and energy crisis, which give us great opportunities for EVs&#146; development. The government grants great support and issues favorable policies to promote EVs development, which is a clear evidence for EVs growth. We believe electric vehicle industry in China has many years of great potential growth ahead. 

Within the electric vehicle market, the competitions are fierce as we have to compete with many domestic and global EV manufactures with greater brand recognition and financial resources. However, being one of the earliest companies to engage in the research, production and distribution of electric vehicles, we believe we have the advantage on technology, innovation on the vehicle business operation and distribution channel. In particular, the innovative MPT program we have been advocated as being different from the offering of our competitors, and has been well accepted and praised by the government and the end users. This business model, along with our continuous efforts on research and development as well as strategic alliance, shall help us to build competitive advantages over other EV manufacturers. 

Intellectual Property and Licenses 

Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. We rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trademarks, copyrights and trade secret protection laws in China and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and our brand. As of December 31, 2015, we had 35 issued patents, 2 issued software copyrights and 13 pending patent applications with Chinese patent authority related to electrical vehicle products, electrical vehicle parts and off-road vehicle products. Under the PRC Patent Law, an invention patent is valid for a term of 20 years and a utility or design patent is valid for a term of 10 years. Our patents are valid for 10 years. In addition, we are authorized to use the trademark &#8220;Kandi&#8221; and we are the owner of the trademark &#8220;JASSCOL&#8221;. We intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, excluding the contractors, Kandi had a total of 557 full-time employees as compared to 516 full-time employees on December 31, 2014, of which 415 employees are production personnel, 23 employees are sales personnel, 48 employees are research and development personnel, and 71 employees are administrative personnel. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good. We also employ consultants on an as needed basis. 

Pure Electric Vehicles Subsidies 

Currently, there are two subsidies from central and local governments for the pure EV sales in China &#8211; one from each of the central and local governments. The ultimate beneficiary for these subsidies is the consumer and the actual prices that consumers pay reflect the deduction of both subsidies. 

a) The central government provides a subsidy to manufacturers paid in advance quarterly upon application and approval and settled annually. After selling product to dealers, manufacturers can submit subsidy payment applications with invoices and other supporting documents at the end of each quarter to the requisite central government agencies through their regional offices. After the review and approval by the agencies, the central government makes advance subsidy payments to the manufacturers. At the end of the year, the final subsidy amounts are verified, reconciled according to the number of vehicles actually sold to consumers and settled on an annual basis. 

b) Pursuant to the requirement of the central government, the local governments provide a subsidy to consumers who purchase EVs from the dealer. After the consumer purchases an EV at a reduced selling price provided by the dealer, the dealer submits a subsidy application to the local government, including a consumer authorization letter for subsidy application, consumer personal I.D., EV Vehicle License, EV purchase invoice and other required documents and requests of reimbursement (to the dealer) for the local government subsidy. 

Environmental and Safety Regulation 

Emissions 

Our products are all subject to international laws and emissions related regulations, including regulations and related standards established by China Environmental Protection Agency, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;), the California Air Resources Board (&#8220;CARB&#8221;), Europe and Canada. 

All Kandi's products comply with all applicable emission standards and regulations in China Environmental Protection Agency, the United States and internationally, the California Air Resources Board (&#8220;CARB&#8221;), Europe and Canada. However, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of standards and regulations adopted in the future or proposed regulations on Kandi and its business. 

Use regulation 

The sale and use of products must be subject to the "Traffic Law" and relevant laws &#38; regulations in China. National, State, and federal laws and regulations have been promulgated, or are under consideration, that impact the use or manner of use of Kandi's products. Certain states and local authorities have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, legislation and local ordinances which restrict the use of ATVs and off-road vehicles to specified hours and locations. The federal government also has restricted the use of ATVs and off-road vehicles in some national parks and federal lands. In several instances, the restriction has been a complete ban on the recreational use of these vehicles. Kandi is unable to predict the outcome of such actions or the possible effect on its business. Kandi believes that its off-road vehicle business would be no more adversely affected than those of its competitors by the adoption of any such pending laws or regulations. 

Product Safety and Regulation 

Safety Regulation 

The U.S. federal government and individual states have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, laws and regulations relating to the use and safety of Kandi's products. The federal government is the primary regulator of product safety. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (&#8220;CPSC&#8221;) has federal oversight over product safety issues related to ATVs and off-road vehicles. The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (&#8220;NHTSA&#8221;) has federal oversight over product safety issues related to on-road motorcycles. 

In August 2008, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was passed. The Act requires all manufacturers and distributors who import into or distribute ATVs within the United States to comply with the ANSI/SVIA safety standards, which were previously voluntary. The Act also requires the same manufacturers and distributors to have ATV action plans filed with the CPSC that are substantially similar to the voluntary action plans that were previously in effect. Kandi currently complies with the ANSI/SVIA standards. 

Kandi's motorcycles are subject to federal vehicle safety standards administered by NHTSA. Kandi's motorcycles are also subject to various state vehicle safety standards. Kandi believes that its motorcycles comply with safety standards applicable to motorcycles. 

Kandi's products are also subject to international safety standards in places where it sells its products outside the United States. Kandi believes that its motorcycles and EV products comply with applicable safety standards in the United States and internationally.
