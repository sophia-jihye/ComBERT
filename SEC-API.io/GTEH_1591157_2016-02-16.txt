Development continued and with the game being released August 2013, the exclusivity period ran out in September 2014.

Market 

&#160;

The video games industry continues to show very strong year on year growth. Worldwide, the gaming industry is due to be worth $103 billion in 2017 with 8.9% year on year growth 1 . Next generation consoles purchased by consumers is greater than previous projections, bucking the projected trend, with PlayStation4 sales at 7 million by April 2014. This was just five months after launch. Both the PlayStation3 &#38;the Xbox360 took 14 months to reach 7.7 million. 2 

&#160;

Digital sales on console are increasing year on year. These are sales where no physical media is provided and the game is downloaded directly to the unit from the manufacturer&#8217;s in-platform store. Revenue splits for console software in 2017 are project to be 61% from physical sales of media, 36% of digital downloading of a title and with 3% of revenue coming from advertising in and around the game. 3 

&#160;

Overall, taking both PC and Console platforms, US gaming revenue from physical product dropped to just above 30% in 2013 and is predicted to be less than 20% by end of 2015. 4 Contrary to previous predictions, PC games are now outselling console games in a market that is to be worth $25 billion by end of 2014 4 

&#160;

The number of gamers worldwide continues to rise at an unprecedented and impressive rate. The 1.6 billion gamers from 2013 is due to rise to more than 2 billion by 2016. 4 The Asian-Pacific region continues to be an important market and maintains its exponential growth pattern 82% of the last year&#8217;s $6 billion growth came from Asia Pacific and China will be the biggest gaming market ahead of the US by 2015. 4

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The mobile game market is highly competitive and rapidly changing. Our ability to compete depends upon many factors within and outside our control, including the timely development and introduction of our mobile game and its enhancements, its functionality, performance, reliability, customer service and support and marketing efforts. Due to the relatively low barriers to entry in the mobile game market, we expect additional competition from other emerging companies. Many of the Company&#8217;s existing and potential competitors are substantially larger than us and have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or to devote greater resources to the development and promotion of their mobile games. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

We have eleven (11) employees who are also our officers and sole director. Our chief executive officer, president and sole director, David Lovatt oversees our day to day operations and product development.

&#160;

None of our employees are employed under a collective bargaining agreement. We believe we have an excellent relationship with our employees and independent contractors.

&#160;

We intend to hire additional employees and independent contractors on an as needed basis.

&#160;

The loss of our CEO David Lovatt would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company. We intend to reduce this risk by obtaining key-man insurance after the Offering, in the event that affordable insurance coverage may be obtained. We cannot assure you that the Company will be able to obtain such insurance or that the Company will be successful in recruiting needed personnel.
