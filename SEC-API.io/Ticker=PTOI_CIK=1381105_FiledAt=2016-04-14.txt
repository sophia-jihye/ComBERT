 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We manufacture processors which produce fuel products mainly from unsorted, unwashed waste plastics for distribution across a number of markets. We continue to execute on our business strategy with the goal of becoming a leading manufacturer of processors and other related equipment that transform waste plastic into ultra-clean, ultra-low sulphur fuel. 

&#160; 

Our P2O business is a commercial manufacturing and production business. We plan to grow mainly from sale of processors, secondarily from the sale of fuel products. We provide environmentally-friendly solutions through our processors and technologies. Our primary offering is our Plastic2Oil&#174;, or P2O&#174;, solution, which is our proprietary process that converts waste plastic into fuel through a series of chemical reactions (our &#8220;P2O business&#8221;). We collect mainly mixed plastics from commercial and industrial enterprises that generate large amounts of waste plastic for use in our process. Generally, this waste plastic would otherwise be sent to landfills and its disposal potentially can be quite costly for companies. We use this waste plastic as feedstock to produce Fuel Oil No. 2, Naphtha, and Fuel Oil No. 6 for various uses by our customers. We own and operate our P2O processors and have the capability to produce and store the fuels at, and ship from, our facilities in Niagara Falls, NY. We sell the fuels we produce to customers through two main distribution channels, fuel wholesalers and directly to commercial and industrial end-users. 

&#160; 

At April 14, 2015, we had three fully-permitted operational P2O processors, one dedicated to research &#38; development and two dedicated to fuel production. All three processors are located at our Niagara Falls, NY facility, and our fourth and fifth processors were in process of assembly for sale. For the reasons described in Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the three operational P2O processors have been idle since late December 2013. 

&#160; 

For financial reporting purposes, we operate in two business segments, (i) our P2O solution, which manufactures and sells processors as well as sells the fuel produced through our processors (ii) data storage and recovery (the &#8220;Data Business&#8221;). As part of our P2O business segment, we began to offer for sale built-to-order P2O processors for use at a customer&#8217;s site. Previously, we operated a chemical processing and cleaning business, known as Pak-It and a retail and wholesale distribution business known as Javaco, Inc. As of December 31, 2012, we had exited both of these businesses and their results in all periods presented are classified as discontinued operations. As of this filing date of the report, our processors were idle and not producing fuel products. Our P2O business has been operating in a limited commercial capacity since December 2010 and we anticipate that this line of business will account for a majority of our revenues in 2016 and periods thereafter. Historically, however, our revenues have been partially derived from our other lines of business and products, Javaco and Pak-It, which are classified in this Annual Report as discontinued operations. In the year ended December 31, 2015, we had total sales of approximately $16,728, of which $0 were derived from our P2O business and $16,728 were derived from our Data Business. In the year ended December 31, 2014, we had total sales of $59,017 from our P2O business and $12,906 from our Data Business. 

&#160; 

We conduct our P2O business at our facilities located in Niagara Falls, New York. Our corporate address is 20 Iroquois Street, Niagara Falls, NY 14303.

Organizational History 

&#160; 

We were incorporated on April 20, 2006 under the laws of the State of Nevada under the name 310 Holdings Inc. (&#8220;310&#8221;). On April 24, 2009, the Company&#8217;s founder, former CEO and Chief of Technology, John Bordynuik, purchased 63% of the issued and outstanding shares of 310 and became our chairman and chief executive officer. On June 25, 2009, we purchased certain assets from John Bordynuik, Inc., a corporation founded by Mr. Bordynuik. The assets acquired included tape drives, computer hardware, servers and a mobile data recovery container to read and transfer data from magnetic tapes. From inception until August 2009, we were a shell company within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. On August 24, 2009, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Javaco, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Domark International, Inc. On September 30, 2009, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Pak-It, LLC. We formed JBI (Canada) Inc. on February 9, 2010 for purposes of distributing Pak-It products in Canada. We formed Plastic2Oil of NY, #1, LLC on May 4, 2010, for the development and commercialization of our Plastic2Oil business in Niagara Falls, NY. 

&#160; 

On October 5, 2009, we changed our corporate name to JBI, Inc. 

&#160; 

On August 24, 2009, the Company acquired Javaco, Inc. (&#8220;Javaco&#8221;), a distributor of electronic components, including home theater and audio video products. On July 9, 2012, we announced the closure of our Javaco operations and sold substantially all of its assets to an unrelated third party. In July 2012, the Company closed Javaco and sold substantially all its inventory and fixed assets. The operations of Javaco have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented (See Note 15). 

&#160; 

In September 2009, the Company acquired Pak-It, LLC (&#8220;Pak-It&#8221;). Pak-It operated a bulk chemical processing, mixing, and packaging facility. It also developed and patented a delivery system that packages condensed cleaners in small water-soluble packages. During 2011, the Company initiated a plan to sell certain operating assets of Pak-It and subsequently sold Pak-It in February 2012, with an effective date of January 1, 2012. On February 10, 2012, we sold substantially all the assets of Pak-It. The operations of Pak-It have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented (See Note 16). 

&#160; 

In December 2010, the Company entered into a twenty year lease for a recycling facility in Thorold, Ontario. During the period ended December 31, 2013, the Company determined that it would no longer operate the facility and shut down all operations. The assets and operations related to the recycling facility have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented (See Note 15). The property was vacated on November 10, 2015 and the lease was terminated on January 15, 2016 effective October 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

On July 31, 2014, we changed our corporate name to Plastic2Oil, Inc. On January 6, 2015, we changed the names of our two Canadian subsidiaries from JBI (Canada) Inc. to Plastic2Oil (Canada), Inc., and from JBI RE ONE, Inc. to Plastic2Oil RE ONE, Inc.

Our Primary Business - Plastic2Oil 

&#160; 

P2O Overview 

&#160; 

Our business focus is to manufacture and sell processors that produce fuel products mainly from unsorted, unwashed waste plastics for distribution across a number of markets. We plan to grow mainly from sale of processors, secondarily from the sale of fuel products. We continue to execute on our business strategy with the goal of becoming a leading North American company that sells procesors to transform waste plastic into ultra-clean, ultra-low sulphur fuel. We have years of operating data and have solved numerous challenges that vexed the plastics-to-oil industry. Since inception we have produced approximately 670,000 gallons of fuel. Our P2O processors have evolved into a modular solution with the completion of our third P2O processor in 2013. We use third party contract manufacturers to supply us with many of the key modular components of our processors, including the kilns, distillation towers and other key components that require specialized machining and fabrication. As of the filing date of this report, our processors were idle and not producing fuel products. Processors are being used only for customer visits and for maintenance activities. 

&#160; 

Our proprietary P2O process converts waste plastic into fuel through a series of chemical reactions. We developed this process in 2009 and began very limited commercial production in 2010 following our receipt of a consent order from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (&#8220;NYSDEC&#8221;) allowing us to commercially operate our first large-scale P2O processor at our Niagara Falls, New York facility. Currently, we have three fully-permitted P2O processors, which are capable of producing Naphtha, Fuel Oil No. 2 and Fuel Oil No. 6, all of which are fuels produced to the specifications published by ASTM. One fully-permitted P2O processor is dedicated to research and development activities. We have components for two additional processors at an outside vendor, which are included in the balance sheet as deposits. Our P2O process is capable of producing two by-products, an off-gas similar to natural gas and a petcoke carbon residue. In instances when wwe produce and sell fuel products, we primarily use our off-gas product in our operations to fuel the burners in our P2O processors. Historically, we have sold our fuel products through two main distribution channels comprised of fuel wholesalers and directly to commercial and industrial end-users. 

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We shut down our fuel production late in the fourth quarter of 2013 due to severe cold weather that caused damage to condensers and other components of our processors and we have not resumed fuel production due to the repair costs as well as our shift in strategy toward manufacturing processors for sale, as opposed to producing and selling fuel products. Management estimates that the repair of the processors will require the expenditure of between $175,000 and $200,000. An additional $300,000 of startup working capital will be required to resume operations mainly for hiring operational personnel and incremental overhead expenses. At March 30, 2016, we lacked the working capital or access to bank credit to make these repairs. We are reviewing our financing options, including the sale of shares of our common stock or other securities, in order to allow us to obtain sufficient funds to make the required repairs and resume pilot operation of our processors to support processor sales. These processors were idle for all of 2015.Management currently anticipates that the processors will remain idle at least until the third quarter of 2016 other than pilot,or demo ,runs to support processor sales. During the idle period, we significantly reduced our headcount by furloughing our operations personnel but retained a small team to perform general repairs and maintenance on the processors. Once the processors are fully operational, we expect a small increase in our headcount in order to resume fuel production. 

&#160; 

Our P2O process accepts mainly unsorted, unwashed waste plastics. We believe our P2O process offers a cost-effective solution for businesses that currently have to pay to dispose of these types of waste. Although many sources of plastic waste are available, we have focused our feedstock sources on primarily post-commercial and industrial waste plastic. Generally, we believe that this waste stream is more costly for companies to dispose of, making it more readily available in large quantities and cheaper for us to acquire than other potential types of feedstock. 

&#160; 

Currently, we understand that there are several plastic-to-oil processes operational globally. These other processes employ a wide range of technologies and yield varying purities of fuel output. We believe that our process has many advantages over many other commercially available processes in that our P2O solution requires a comparatively less initial capital investment and yields high-quality, ultra-low sulphur fuel, with no need for further refinement. Additionally, our process uses comparatively little energy and physical space, which, in our view, makes it well suited for high-volume production and expansion to multiple sites. 

&#160; 

P2O Process and Operations 

&#160; 

Our patent-pendingP2O conversion process involves the cracking of the plastic hydrocarbon chains at ambient pressure and comparatively low temperature using a catalyst. There are various processes in existence for converting plastic and other hydrocarbon materials into products for use in the production of fuels, chemicals and recycled items. These processes include: pyrolysis (conversion using dry materials at high pressure and temperature in the absence of oxygen), catalytic conversion (conversion using a catalyst for stimulating a chemical reaction), depolymerization (conversion using superheated water and high pressure and temperature) and gasification (conversion at high temperature using oxygen or steam). 

&#160; 

We have developed our Plastic2Oil processors with the ability to be continuously running, energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly while converting waste plastics into end-user ready, and ultra-clean, ultra-low sulfur fuels. The processors are periodically shut-down for maintenance and residue removal. The fuels produced can be used directly by our customers without further refining or processing. Over a three year period, we have scaled our processing operations from a one gallon processor to three processors, each permitted to feed up to 4,000 pounds of feedstock per hour. In prior years, some of the milestones that we have reached include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Manufacturing and operating multiple processors at our Niagara Falls, NY site; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; From inception, the processors were designed with safety and green emissions as top priorities; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Standardization and modularization of the components of our processors; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Ability to continuously feed waste plastic 24 hours a day; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Approximately 86% of waste plastic by weight is converted to liquid fuel conversion; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Approximately 8% of waste plastic by weight is converted to gas and is used to fuel the process; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Operating at atmospheric pressure, not susceptible to pinhole leaks and other problems with pressure and vacuum-based systems; &#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; No requirement for incinerators, thermal oxidizers or scrubbers and no stack monitoring is necessary; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Three stack tests (two on the initial processor and one on the second processor) conducted by Conestoga-Rovers &#38; Associates (&#8220;CRA&#8221;), prove emissions are extremely low; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Process validation by SAIC Energy, Environment &#38; Infrastructure, LLC and IsleChem, LLC; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Permitted to operate three processors commercially in New York by the NYSDEC. &#160; 

Processor Input 

&#160; 

Waste Plastics : We are able to feed mainly mixed unwashed waste plastics into the Plastic2Oil processors. Waste plastic is widely available and we are focused on maximizing the types and densities of the plastic we procure for optimal processor performance. 

&#160; 

Heat Transfer Fluid : We are also able to include hydrocarbon based transfer fluid as feed into the Platic2Oil processors. 

&#160; 

Processor Output 

&#160; 

We are currently permitted to feed two tons, or 4,000 pounds, of waste plastic per hour into each processor by a continuous conveyor belt where it is heated by a burner that mainly burns off-gases produced from the P2O process. Plastic hydrocarbons are cracked into various shorter hydrocarbon chains and exit in a gaseous state. Any residue, metals and or non-usable substances remain in the reactor and are periodically removed. Through our proprietary process, Fuel Oil No. 6, Fuel Oil No. 2, and Naphtha are condensed from the reactor through the remainder of the process. The fuel output is then transferred to storage tanks automatically by the system. Our process is mainly operated by an automated computer system that controls the conveyor feed rate, system temperatures, off-gas systems and the pumping out of newly created fuel to storage tanks. The plastic to liquid fuel conversion is approximately 86% by weight. Therefore, 20 tons of plastic can be processed into approximately 4,100 gallons of fuel. At March 30, 2016, we had three processors at our Niagara Falls, NY facility. One processor was dedicated to research and development and all three processors remained idle due to maintenance and repair issues. 

&#160; 

Fuel Produced : The fuel produced in our processors is ultra-low sulfur fuel and is ready for end-users without the need for further refinement. 

&#160; 

Off-gas : Approximately 8-10% of waste plastics fed into the processors are converted to a mixture of hydrogen, methane, ethane, butane and propane gas, which we call &#8220;off-gas&#8221;. Once our processors are in a state to begin the P2O process, they use their own off-gas to fuel the burners in the process. 

&#160; 

Residue : There is approximately 2-4% residue from our process, which is petroleum coke or carbon black (which we call &#8220;petcoke&#8221;) that needs to be removed on a periodic basis. 

&#160; 

Feedstock 

&#160; 

Our P2O process primarily uses post-commercial and industrial waste plastic that might otherwise be sent to a landfill by the commercial and industrial producers of such waste plastic. We believe that this can be costly for these producers due to the large volumes of plastic waste that they generate. As such, our business model is premised on the processor&#8217;s ability to accept numerous types of waste plastics from such sources at a relatively low cost. We believe that our processor ability to accept mainly mixed, unwashed waste plastics is a significant advantage of our P2O process compared to similar operations in our industry. 

&#160; 

Fuel Products 

&#160; 

Our P2O process makes both light and heavy fuel products which are Naphtha, Fuel Oil No. 2 and Fuel Oil No. 6, as defined by ASTM. Our process also generates two main by-products, a reusable off-gas similar to natural gas and a carbon residue known as petcoke. 

&#160; 

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Naphtha is a very light fuel product that is used as a cutting component for both high and regular grade gasoline. Fuel Oil No. 2 is a mid-range fuel commonly known as diesel and has numerous transportation, manufacturing and industrial uses. Fuel Oil No. 6 is a heavy fuel generally used in industrial boilers and ships. Our process produces high quality, ultra-low sulphur fuels, without the need for further refinement which enables fuel sales directly from the processors to the end-user. 

&#160; 

The reusable off-gas that is produced by the P2O process is used to fuel the burner that heats the entire processor. 

&#160; 

P2O Facilities 

&#160; 

We currently have one main facility (located in Niagara Falls, NY) that we use in our P2O business, as well as a second facility, our fuel blending site (located in Thorold, Canada), for use in the future. These are briefly described below. Additional information on our properties can be found in Item 2 of this report. 

&#160; 

Niagara Falls, NY facility: Our Niagara Falls, NY facility currently has two buildings, a 10,000 square foot building that currently houses one commercial-scale P2O processor and one P2O processor devoted to research and development activities, and a 7,200 square foot building housing the third commercial-scale P2O processor. Our Niagara Falls operations are situated on eight acres that can accommodate expansion of our operations. This facility also serves as the center of our research and development operations and our administrative offices. 

&#160; 

Blending Site: We own a 250,000 gallon fuel-blending facility in Thorold, Ontario, Canada, which, when in use, would allow us to blend and self-certify certain fuels that are produced from our process to meet government specifications. 

&#160; 

Sales and Distribution 

&#160; 

Our P2O business is a commercial manufacturing and production business. We plan to grow mainly from sale of processors first, and fuel seller second. 

&#160; 

We sell our fuel products through two main channels: fuel brokers and direct to end-users. We have no long-term contracts for fuel sales; rather, we sell our fuel through the issuance of routine purchase orders. 

&#160; 

During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, 100%, and 89% of total net revenues were generated from a single, and two customers, respectively. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, one and two customers, respectively, accounted for 100% of accounts receivable. 

&#160; 

Suppliers 

&#160; 

The principal goods that we require for our P2O business are the waste plastic that we use as feedstock for production of our fuels. We collect waste plastics from commercial and industrial businesses that generate large amounts of this waste stream. As of April 14, 2016, we had approximately 327,000 pounds of waste plastic and approximately 10,000 gallons of heat transfer fluid available in inventory as feedstock, to support the resumption of operations upon the repairs, as mentioned above. 

&#160; 

We also rely on third party manufacturers for the manufacture of many components of our processors including kilns and distillation towers. 

&#160; 

During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, five and four suppliers, respectively, accounted for 30.9% and 38.0% of accounts payable, respectively. 

&#160; 

Licenses, Permits and Testing 

&#160; 

We maintain the following permits and licenses in connection with the operation of our P2O business.

In 2010, our P2O process and processors were tested by IsleChem, LLC, an independent chemical firm providing contract research and development, manufacturing and scale-up services, using two small prototypes of our P2O processor. The IsleChem test results indicated that our process is both repeatable and scalable. Following this testing, we assembled a large-scale P2O processor capable of processing at least 20 metric tons of plastic per day. In September 2010, we had a Stack Test performed by Conestoga-Rovers &#38; Associates (&#8220;CRA&#8221;), an independent engineering and consulting firm, which concluded that, with a feed rate of 2,000 pounds of plastic per hour, our processor&#8217;s emissions were below the maximum emissions levels allowed by the NYSDEC simple air permit, which is needed to commercially operate the P2O processor at that location. We used the CRA test results to apply for the required operating permits and in June 2011 we received an Air State Facility Permit (&#8220;Air Permit&#8221;) and Solid Waste Management Permit (&#8220;Solid Waste Permit&#8221;) for up to three processors at the Niagara Falls, NY facility. In December 2011, we had a second stack test performed by CRA for an increased rate of 4,000 pounds per hour. In January 2012, we received a final emissions report from CRA confirming that emissions were considerably decreased with an increased feed rate. In December 2012, we had a stack test performed on the second processor. 

&#160; 

The emissions tests conducted by CRA on our processors are summarized in the following table:

&#160; 

Industry Background 

&#160; 

Alternative fuels are generally considered to be any substances that can be used as fuel, other than conventional fossil fuels such as naturally occurring oil, gas and coal. There have been many approaches taken to producing alternative fuels, including conversion of corn oil, vegetable oil and non-food-based materials. These approaches have demonstrated varying degrees of commercial potential. Some of the challenges that alternative fuel producers have faced include high feedstock supply costs, lower perceived value of fuel product, higher capital costs and dependence on government regulations for economic viabilities. We believe our company is distinguishable from other producers of alternative or renewable fuels because our P2O solution represents a process and product that is commercially viable and designed to provide immediate benefit for industries, communities and government organizations with waste plastic recycling challenges. Our business model is premised on the need for a more efficient and cost-effective. alternative to disposing of waste plastic in jurisdictions where the cost of transporting and landfilling large amounts of plastic is quite costly. 

&#160; 

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Our P2O business has elements of both a recycling business and a fuel refiner/ production business, which makes it difficult to identify and make direct comparisons to competitors. Both the recycling and energy sectors are characterized by rapid technological change. Our future success will depend on our ability to achieve and maintain a competitive position with respect to technological advances in both of these sectors. We believe that our business currently faces competition in the plastics-to-energy market, including competition from PK Clean, Vadxx Energy, Green Envirotec Holdings LLC, Agilyx and RES polyflow, each of which has developed alternative methods for obtaining and generating fuel from plastics. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business&#8221;. Because P2O solution end products include a variety of fuels, we also face competition from the broader petroleum industry. 

&#160; 

Business Model 

&#160; 

We believe that our business model provides a unique proposition for both the &#8220;supply side&#8221; and the &#8220;end-user&#8221; side of the waste-to-fuel value chain. Our P2O technology is positioned to link these two sides by offering economic incentives in both directions. We believe P2O offers value to suppliers of waste plastic by saving transport and landfill tipping fees, and value to fuel end-users by providing ultra-low sulphur green fuel. Given these incentives, we believe that our business will be sought after by those industries that can benefit from the added value that we provide, thus allowing the potential for our company&#8217;s growth through sale of processors. 

&#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Our long-term strategy is to become the leading plastic-to-oil processor manufacturer. Our processor buyer are private and municipalities in the recycling industry who can operate on a commercial scale. Our fuels consumers are fuel distributors. Our processors are to demonstrate our technology and processor capabilities, for process improvement, for research and development activities and to test potential customer feedstock. The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are as follows: 

&#160; 

Marketing Strategy 

&#160; 

We target post-commercial and industrial waste plastic partners. We believe this allows us to identify sources of large plastic waste streams, such as industrial sites and material recovery facilities and recycling centers. We also seek to partner with businesses and municipalities that collect waste plastics. Our vision is to help redirect these waste plastic streams, preventing them from entering landfills. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing and Procurement Strategy 

&#160; 

Our P2O business model allows us to simultaneously pursue sales to multiple commercial opportunities (partners) across the waste plastic and fuel markets. Our P2O processors have evolved to be modular solutions with the completion of processor #3 in 2013. We use third party contract manufacturers for the manufacture of many of the key modular components of our processors, including the kilns, distillation towers as well as other key components that require specialized machining and fabrication. We will license our P2O technology, including construction operation and maintenance of processors for operation at our partners&#8217; sites. Our strategy is to have our partners construct clusters of P2O processors at sources of large plastic waste streams, such as industrial sites, material recovery facilities and recycling centers. 

&#160; 

Feedstock Procurement Strategy 

&#160; 

Our feedstock strategy is as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Get the Right Material to Maximize Throughput . Although the P2O processor can process many different types of plastic and create consistent fuels, we will focus on the types of plastic that will maximize the machine&#8217;s productivity. This is typically high density material. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Contract for Long-Term Consistent Feedstock Supply . By contracting with our suppliers, we are able to gain commitments for consistent flows of feedstock. This also allows us to more accurately forecast our feedstock supply and fuel outputs. An additional benefit of contracting with suppliers is that we are able to rely on this material flow as it relates to our continued growth planning. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Cost to the Processor . We look at all feedstock opportunities considering the &#8220;cost to the processor&#8221;. This means we consider including the cost is the price we pay to the supplier, the cost of transportation or our costs to pre-process the feedstock material, the critical thing is the total cost incurred for &#8220;ready to process&#8221; material. &#160; 

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Competitive Strengths 

&#160; 

We believe that our competitive strengths are as follows: 

&#160; 

Our processors convert unwashed waste plastics into &#8220;in specification fuels&#8221; ready for use by the end-user customer. Our process does not generate any waste water. The fuel is Halide-free and there is no further need for refinement. The process does not produce any hazardous waste. 

&#160; 

In addition to producing fuel, our P2O solution simultaneously addresses the problem of disposing of waste plastic. We offer an alternative to disposing of waste plastic in a landfill. Our processors can accept mainly mixed, unwashed plastic feedstock. In the United States and Canada, a substantial amount of plastic is currently considered waste and is disposed of in landfills, resulting in tipping fees levied by the landfill or other waste disposal facility fees. We believe that the current low landfill diversion rates for waste plastic in the United States and Canada, together with the costs of transporting and disposing of plastic in bulk, present a significant opportunity to provide an alternative to conventional recycling and waste disposal. 

&#160; 

The P2O process provides a highly efficient means of converting plastic into fuel. Our proprietary P2O process and catalyst provide a highly efficient means of converting plastic into fuel. Our business model depends on us being able to provide both a cost-competitive means of disposing of waste plastic and an efficient and non-energy intensive means of producing fuel. Our process requires comparatively minimal electricity to operate, and the energy balance of the process is positive, meaning that more energy can be produced than is consumed by the process. 

&#160; 

Low capital costs and small footprint. We have designed the processors with a modular design with standardized components, making construction of our processors relatively simple and cost effective. We have designed our processors to take up approximately 3,000 square feet of space, giving the processors a relatively small footprint. We believe that this design facilitates the construction and operation of multiple processors on a single site. We estimate that the costs of constructing our processors on industrial partner sites will be substantially less than the cost of constructing waste-to-fuel facilities offered by our competitors. 

&#160; 

Lower emissions 

&#160; 

In the United States, businesses and other producers of emissions are subject to various regulatory requirements, including the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, or &#8220;NESHAP.&#8221; These emission standards may be established according to Maximum Achievable Control Technology requirements set by the EPA, often referred to as &#8220;MACT standards&#8221;. MACT standards apply to a number of sources of emissions, including operators of boilers, process heaters and certain solid waste incinerators. Because our P2O fuel products have ultra-low sulphur content, we believe that our P2O fuel can assist industrial partners with meeting MACT requirements through reduced hazardous emissions. 

&#160; 

Our processors produce fuels that have very low sulphur content, which allows the end-user to potentially lower the emissions generated by its operations while using our fuels. These lower emissions potentially could save the end-user from expensive environmental compliance costs, stemming from such initiatives as the NESHAP regulations and more specifically the MACT standards for each pollution source. 

&#160; 

Validation of repeatability and scalability of P2O processors. 

&#160; 

Our P2O business has been validated for repeatability and scalability by extensive testing by our customers and multiple independent tests by outside consultants and third party laboratories.

Other Businesses 

&#160; 

Data Recovery &#38; Migration 

&#160; 

In June 2009, we purchased certain assets from John Bordynuik, Inc., a corporation founded by John Bordynuik, our former Chief Executive Officer and former Chief of Technology and who now serves as a consultant to the company.. The assets acquired from John Bordynuik, Inc. included tape drives, computer hardware, servers and a mobile data recovery lab to read and transfer data from magnetic tapes and these assets are used in our Data Recovery &#38; Migration business. 

&#160; 

Magnetic tapes were previously a primary media for data storage. Because of its cost effectiveness, magnetic tape was widely used by government, scientific, educational and commercial organizations for decades. Over time, these tapes can become vulnerable to deterioration when exposed to natural elements, which can render the tapes difficult to read or unreadable using the original tape-reading equipment. Our Data Business involves reading old magnetic tapes, interpreting and restoring the data where necessary and transferring the recovered data to storage formats used in current systems. The recovered data is verified for accuracy and returned to customers in the media storage format of their choice. Our process gives customers the ability to conveniently catalogue and safely archive difficult-to-retrieve data on readily accessible, contemporary storage media. Users of these services generally include businesses or organizations that have historically stored information on magnetic tape, such as government agencies, oil and gas companies and academic institutions. 

&#160; 

The process for data recovery was developed and is very highly dependent on the services of Mr. Bordynuik. The Data Business&#8217;s reliance on Mr. Bordynuik was a key driver to achieving revenue in 2015 and 2014. In light of our business strategy focus on our P2O business, we anticipate that revenues and profits generated from our Data Business operations will represent a decreasing share, if any, of our total revenues and profits in future reporting periods. Due to these factors, all related to the assets of the Data Business was recorded as impaired in 2012. 

&#160; 

Pak-It 

&#160; 

From September 2009 until February 2012, through Pak-It, we were engaged in the manufacture of cleaning chemicals. As previously reported, we sold substantially all of the assets of this business in February 2012 because management felt that Pak-It&#8217;s business was no longer aligned with our strategic focus on our P2O business. For all years reported, the results of operations of Pak-It have been recorded as discontinued operation, as recorded in Footnote 17 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

Javaco 

&#160; 

From August 2009 until July 2012, through Javaco, we were a retailer and wholesale distributor of equipment, hardware and tools for the safety, maintenance and construction industries. As previously reported, in July 2012, we closed Javaco and liquidated substantially all of the fixed assets and inventory because management felt that Javaco&#8217;s business was no longer aligned with our strategic focus on our P2O business. For all years reported, the results of operations of Javaco have been recorded as discontinued operations, as recorded in Footnote 17 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

To ensure the protection of our proprietary technology, we have applied for patent protection for both the P2O process and P2O processor. As of March 30, 2016, no patents have been issued. (The application was published on January 1, 2015 under Publication No. US2015/0001061 and is available on the USPTO website at http://patft.uspto.gov/). Management anticipates filing additional patent applications for various aspects of our P2O process in the near future. A lack of patent protection could have a material adverse effect on our ability to gain a competitive advantage for our process and processors, since it is possible that our competitors may be able to duplicate the P2O process for their own purposes. We also rely on our trade secrets to provide protection from portions of our process and proprietary catalyst. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business&#8221;. 

&#160; 

We also hold a U.S. patent relating to our Data Business for the recovery of tape information.

&#160;

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Given our strategic focus on developing our P2O business, we anticipate that our research and development activities related to our P2O processors and the construction, operation and systems management of those processors will decrease. Specifically, we will seek to increase the operational capabilities and performance of our P2O processors as opportunities arise. Research and development expenditures were $1,653, and $20,999 in 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of April 14,, 2016, we employed four persons on a full-time basis, of which one is were executive management, two were in finance and administration, one were in operations. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our labor relations are good. 

&#160; 

Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters 

&#160; 

As we further develop and commercialize our P2O business, we will be subject to extensive and frequently developing federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations, including, but not limited to those relating to emissions requirements, fuel production, fuel transportation, fuel storage, waste management, waste storage, composition of fuels and permitting. Compliance with current and future regulations could increase our operational costs. Management believes that the company is currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental regulations and permitting. 

&#160; 

Our operations require various governmental permits and approvals. We believe that we have obtained, or are in the process of obtaining, all necessary permits and approvals for the operations of our P2O business; however, any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. Failure to obtain or comply with the conditions of permits and approvals or to have the necessary approvals in place may adversely affect our operations and may subject us to penalties.
