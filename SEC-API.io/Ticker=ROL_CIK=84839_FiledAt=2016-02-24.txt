&#160;

Rollins Australia (&#8220;Rollins Australia&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired Allpest WA (&#8220;Allpest&#8221;), in February 2014.

The business is currently 100% franchised with operations in 40 states and 2 Canadian provinces.

&#160;

The Company has several smaller wholly-owned subsidiaries that in total make up less than 5% of the Company&#8217;s total revenues.

Orkin Franchises 

&#160;

The Company continues to expand its growth through Orkin&#8217;s franchise program. This program is primarily used in smaller markets where it is currently not economically feasible to locate a conventional Orkin branch. Domestic franchisees are subject to a contractual buyback provision at Orkin&#8217;s option with a pre-determined purchase price using a formula applied to revenues of the franchise. International franchise agreements also contain an optional buyback provision; however, the franchisee has the prior right of renewal of agreement. The Company through its wholly-owned Orkin subsidiary began its Orkin franchise program in the U.S. in 1994, and established its first international franchise in 2000 and since has expanded to Central America, South America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, Africa, and Mexico.

Seasonality

The business of the Company is affected by the seasonal nature of the Company&#8217;s pest and termite control services. The increase in pest presence and activity, as well as the metamorphosis of termites in the spring and summer (the occurrence of which is determined by the timing of the change in seasons), has historically resulted in an increase in the revenue of the Company&#8217;s pest and termite control operations during such periods as evidenced by the following chart.

&#160;

&#160; &#160; Total Net Revenues (in thousands) &#160; 2015 &#160; 2014 &#160; 2013 First Quarter &#160; $ 330,909 &#160; &#160; $ 313,388 &#160; &#160; $ 299,714 &#160; Second Quarter &#160; &#160; 392,150 &#160; &#160; &#160; 369,357 &#160; &#160; &#160; 350,798 &#160; Third Quarter &#160; &#160; 399,746 &#160; &#160; &#160; 384,870 &#160; &#160; &#160; 362,155 &#160; Fourth Quarter &#160; &#160; 362,500 &#160; &#160; &#160; 343,951 &#160; &#160; &#160; 324,707 &#160; Years ended December 31, &#160; $ 1,485,305 &#160; &#160; $ 1,411,566 &#160; &#160; $ 1,337,374 &#160; &#160;

Inventories

&#160;

The Company has relationships with a national pest control product distributor and other vendors for pest and termite control treatment products. The Company maintains a sufficient level of chemicals, materials and other supplies to fulfill its immediate servicing needs and to alleviate any potential short-term shortage in availability from its national network of suppliers.

&#160;

Competition

&#160;

The Company believes that Rollins, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries Orkin, Orkin Canada, HomeTeam Pest Defense, Western Pest Services, The Industrial Fumigant Company, Crane Pest Control, Waltham Services, Trutech, Permatreat, Rollins Australia and Critter Control, competes favorably with competitors as the world&#8217;s largest pest and termite control company. The Company&#8217;s competitors include Terminix, Ecolab and Rentokil.

&#160;

The principal methods of competition in the Company&#8217;s pest and termite control markets are quality of service, customer proximity and guarantee terms, reputation for safety, technical proficiency, and price.

&#160;

Research and Development

&#160;

Expenditures by the Company on research activities relating to the development of new products or services are not significant. Some of the new and improved service methods and products are researched, developed and produced by unaffiliated universities and companies. Also, a portion of these methods and products are produced to the specifications provided by the Company.

&#160;

The Company maintains a close relationship with several universities for research and validation of treatment procedures and material selection. 

&#160;

The Company conducts tests of new products with the specific manufacturers of such products. The Company also works closely with leading scientists, educators, industry consultants and suppliers to improve service protocols and materials.

&#160;

Environmental and Regulatory Considerations

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s pest control business is subject to various legislative and regulatory enactments that are designed to protect the environment, public health and consumers. Compliance with these requirements has not had a material negative impact on the Company&#8217;s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

&#160;

Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodentcide Act (&#8220;FIFRA&#8221;)

&#160;

This federal law (as amended) grants to the states the responsibility to be the primary agent in enforcement and conditions under which pest control companies operate. Each state must meet certain guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency in regulating the following: licensing, record keeping, contracts, standards of application, training and registration of products. This allows each state to institute certain features that set their regulatory programs in keeping with special interests of the citizens&#8217; wishes in each state. The pest control industry is impacted by these federal and state regulations.

&#160;

Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 (&#8220;FQPA&#8221;)

&#160;

The FQPA governs the manufacture, labeling, handling and use of pesticides and does not have a direct impact on how the Company conducts its business.

&#160;

Environmental Remediation

&#160;

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), also known as Superfund, is the primary Federal statute regulating the cleanup of inactive hazardous substance sites and imposing liability for cleanup on the responsible parties. Responsibilities governed by this statute include the management of hazardous substances, reporting releases of hazardous substances, and establishing the necessary contracts and agreements to conduct cleanup. Customarily, the parties involved will work with the EPA and under the direction of the responsible state agency to agree and implement a plan for site remediation. Consistent with the Company&#8217;s responsibilities under these regulations, the Company undertakes environmental assessments and remediation of hazardous substances from time to time as the Company determines its responsibilities for these purposes. As these situations arise, the Company accrues management&#8217;s best estimate of future costs for these activities. Based on management&#8217;s current estimates of these costs, management does not believe these costs are material to the Company&#8217;s financial condition or operating results.

&#160;

Employees

&#160;

The number of persons employed by the Company as of January 31, 2016 was approximately 11,000.
