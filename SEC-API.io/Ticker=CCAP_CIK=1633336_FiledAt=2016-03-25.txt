 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Crescent Capital BDC, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) was formed on February 5, 2015 (&#147;Inception&#148;) as a Delaware corporation structured as an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. The Company commenced investment operations on June 26, 2015 (&#147;Commencement&#148;). The Company has elected to be treated as a business development company (&#147;BDC&#148;) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#147;1940 Act&#148;). In addition, the Company has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company (a &#147;RIC&#148;) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;). As a RIC, the Company will not be taxed on its income to the extent that it distributes such income each year and satisfies other applicable income tax requirements. 

&#160; 

The Company is managed by CBDC Advisors, LLC (the &#147;Advisor&#148;), an investment adviser that is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;) under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the &#147;Advisers Act&#148;). CBDC Administration, LLC (the &#147;Administrator&#148;) provides the administrative services necessary for the Company to operate. Company management consists of investment and administrative professionals from the Advisor and Administrator along with the Company&#146;s Board of Directors (the &#147;Board&#148;). The Advisor directs and executes the investment operations and capital raising activities of the Company subject to oversight from the Board, which sets the broad policies of the Company. The Board has delegated investment management of the Company&#146;s investment assets to the Advisor. The Board consists of five directors, three of whom are independent. 

&#160; 

A portion of the outstanding shares of the Company&#146;s common stock are owned by Crescent Capital Group LP (&#147;CCG LP&#148;). CCG LP is also the majority member of the Advisor and sole member of the Administrator. The Company has entered into a license agreement with CCG LP under which CCG LP granted the Company a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name &#147;Crescent Capital&#148;. The Advisor has entered into a resource sharing agreement with CCG LP. 

&#160; 

The Company&#146;s primary investment objective is to maximize the total return to the Company&#146;s stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation through debt and related equity investments. The Company will seek to achieve its investment objectives by investing primarily in secured debt (including senior secured, unitranche and second lien debt) and unsecured debt (including senior unsecured and subordinated debt), as well as related equity securities of private U.S. middle-market companies. By &#147;middle-market companies,&#148; we mean companies that have annual earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (&#147;EBITDA&#148;), which we believe is a useful proxy for cash flow, of $10 million to $250 million. We may on occasion invest in larger or smaller companies. Our investments may include non-cash income features, including payment-in-kind (&#147;PIK&#148;) interest and original issue discount (&#147;OID&#148;). We may also invest in securities that are rated below investment grade ( e.g. , junk bonds) by rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. As a BDC, we may also invest up to 30% of our portfolio opportunistically in &#147;non-qualifying&#148; portfolio investments. See &#147; Item 1(c). Description of Business&#151;Regulation as a Business Development Company&#151;Qualifying Assets .&#148; 

&#160; 

The Company&#146;s investment objective is to maximize the total return to our stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation by: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; accessing the origination channels that have been developed and established by CCG LP;

&#183; &#160; originating investments in what we believe to be companies with strong business fundamentals, generally within our core middle-market company focus;

&#183; &#160; working with private equity firms and other financial intermediaries (i.e., commercial banks, investment banks and other financial services firms), including those with whom CCG LP has invested in the past to source investment opportunities;

&#183; &#160; applying the underwriting standards of CCG LP; and

&#183; &#160; leveraging the experience and resources of CCG LP to monitor our investments.

&#160; 

&#160; 

We may purchase interests in loans or make other debt investments, directly from our target companies as primary market or directly originated investments or through secondary market transactions in the &#147;over-the-counter&#148; market. Although our focus is to invest in directly originated transactions, in certain circumstances we will also invest in the broadly syndicated loan and high yield markets. Broadly syndicated loans and bonds are generally more liquid than our directly originated investments and provide a complement to our less liquid strategies. In addition, and because we often receive more attractive financing terms on these positions than we do on our less liquid assets, we are able to leverage the broadly syndicated portion of our portfolio in such a way that can maximize the levered return potential of our portfolio. 

&#160; 

Our investment philosophy emphasizes capital preservation through credit selection and risk mitigation. We expect our targeted portfolio to provide downside protection through conservative cash flow and asset coverage requirements, priority in the capital structure and information requirements. 

&#160; 

As a BDC under the Act and a RIC under the Code, our portfolio is subject to diversification and other requirements. See &#147;&#151; Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences .&#148; 

&#160; 

Our operations comprise only a single reportable segment. On July 23, 2015, the Company formed CBDC Universal Equity, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary. This subsidiary allows the Company to hold equity securities of a portfolio company organized as pass-through entities while continuing to satisfy the requirements of a RIC under the Code. The financial statements of this entity are consolidated into the financial statements of the Company. 

&#160; 

We may borrow money from time to time within the levels permitted by the 1940 Act (which generally allows us to incur leverage for up to one-half of our assets). In determining whether to borrow money, we will analyze the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings as well as the risks of such borrowings compared to our investment outlook. The use of borrowed funds or the proceeds of preferred stock offerings to make investments would have its own specific set of benefits and risks, and all of the costs of borrowing funds or issuing preferred stock would be borne by holders of our common stock. See &#147; Item 1A. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure&#151; Financing Investments With Borrowed Money .&#148; 

&#160; 

The Investment Advisor 

&#160; 

The Advisor, a Delaware limited liability company and an affiliate of CCG LP, will act as our investment adviser. The Advisor is a registered investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Our investment activities are managed by the Advisor, which is responsible for originating prospective investments, conducting research and due diligence investigations on potential investments, analyzing investment opportunities, negotiating and structuring our investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. The Advisor has entered into a Resource Sharing Agreement (the &#147;Resource Sharing Agreement&#148;) with CCG LP, pursuant to which CCG LP provides the Advisor with experienced investment professionals (including the members of the Advisor&#146;s investment committee) and access to the resources of CCG LP so as to enable the Advisor to fulfill its obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement. Through the Resource Sharing Agreement, the Advisor capitalizes on the deal origination, credit underwriting, due diligence, investment structuring, execution, portfolio management and monitoring experience of CCG LP&#146;s investment professionals. 

&#160; 

About CCG LP 

&#160; 

Crescent Capital Corporation, a predecessor to the business of CCG LP, was formed in 1991 by Mark Attanasio and Jean-Marc Chapus as an asset management firm specializing in below-investment grade debt securities. In 1995, Crescent Capital Corporation was acquired by The TCW Group, Inc. (&#147;TCW&#148;) and rebranded as TCW&#146;s Leveraged Finance Group. On January 1, 2011, Messrs. Attanasio and Chapus, along with the entire investment team, spun out of TCW and formed CCG LP, an employee-owned, registered investment adviser. With its headquarters in Los Angeles, CCG LP has approximately 140 employees based in four offices in the U.S. and Europe. Messrs. Attanasio and Chapus head CCG LP&#146;s management committee, which oversees all of CCG LP&#146;s investment strategies. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Board of Directors 

&#160; 

Our business and affairs are managed under the direction of our Board of Directors (the &#147;Board&#148;). Our Board consists of five members, three of whom are not &#147;interested persons&#148; of CBDC, the Advisor, the Administrator or their respective affiliates as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. We refer to these individuals as our &#147;Independent Directors.&#148; The Independent Directors compose a majority of our Board. Our Board elects our officers, who serve at the discretion of our Board. The responsibilities of our Board include quarterly determinations of the fair value of our assets, corporate governance activities, oversight of our financing arrangements and oversight of our investment activities. 

&#160; 

Investment Advisory Agreement; Administration Agreement; License Agreement 

&#160; 

Our investment activities are managed by our Advisor, which is responsible for originating prospective investments, conducting research and due diligence investigations on potential investments, analyzing investment opportunities, negotiating and structuring our investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. On June 2, 2015, we entered into an investment advisory agreement (the &#147;Investment Advisory Agreement&#148;) with the Advisor, pursuant to which we have agreed to pay the Advisor a base management fee and an incentive fee for its services. The cost of both the base management fee and the incentive fee are ultimately borne by our stockholders. 

&#160; 

The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.5% of our gross assets, including assets purchased with borrowed funds or other forms of leverage but excluding cash and cash equivalents. For services rendered under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. Base management fees for any partial month or quarter will be appropriately pro-rated. For purposes of the Investment Advisory Agreement, cash equivalents means U.S. government securities and commercial paper maturing within one year of purchase. The Advisor, however, during periods prior to a Qualified IPO (as defined below) will agree to waive its right to receive management fees in excess of the sum of (i) 0.25% of the aggregate committed but undrawn capital and (ii) 0.75% of the aggregate gross assets excluding cash (including capital drawn to pay the Company&#146;s expenses). A &#147;Qualified IPO&#148; is an initial public offering of the Company&#146;s common stock that results in an unaffiliated public float of at least the lower of $75 million or 15% of the aggregate capital commitments received prior to the date of such initial public offering. The Advisor will not be permitted to recoup any waived amounts at any time and the waiver agreement may only be modified or terminated prior to a Qualified IPO with the approval of the Board. 

&#160; 

We will pay the Advisor an incentive fee. The incentive fee will consist of two parts&#151;an incentive fee based on income and an incentive fee based on capital gains. The first part, the &#147;income incentive fee&#148;, which is described in more detail in the bullet points below, are calculated and payable quarterly in arrears and (a) equals 100% of the excess of our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, over a preferred return of 1.5% per quarter (6% annualized), or &#147;Hurdle,&#148; and a &#147;catch-up&#148; feature, until the Advisor has received, (i) prior to a Qualified IPO, 15%, or (ii) after a Qualified IPO, 17.5%, of the pre-incentive fee net investment income for the current quarter up to the &#147;catch-up&#148; and (b) (i) prior to a Qualified IPO, 15% or (ii) after a Qualified IPO, 17.5%, of all remaining pre-incentive fee net investment income above the &#147;catch-up.&#148; The second part, the capital gains incentive fee, are determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon a Qualified IPO or termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement), (i) prior to a Qualified IPO, 15%, or (ii) after a Qualified IPO, 17.5%, of the Company&#146;s realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of the fiscal year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees. 

&#160; 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature such as market discount, OID, debt instruments with PIK interest, preferred stock with PIK dividends and zero-coupon securities, accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. See &#147; Item 1A. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure&#151;Incentive Fee Structure Relating to the Advisor .&#148; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized or unrealized capital gains or losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that we may pay an incentive fee in a quarter where we incur a loss. For example, if we receive pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the Hurdle rate for a quarter, we will pay the applicable incentive fee even if we have incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. 

&#160; 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income is compared to a &#147;Hurdle Amount&#148; equal to the product of (i) the Hurdle rate of 1.50% per quarter (6.00% annualized) and (ii) our net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any incentive fees payable during the period), at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter. If market interest rates rise, we may be able to invest our funds in debt instruments that provide for a higher return, which would increase our pre-incentive fee net investment income and make it easier for the Advisor to surpass the fixed Hurdle rate and receive an incentive fee based on such net investment income. PIK interest and OID will also increase our pre-incentive fee net investment income and make it easier to surpass the fixed Hurdle rate. Our pre-incentive fee net investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of our total assets (other than cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) used to calculate the 1.5% base management fee. 

&#160; 

Prior to the occurrence of a Qualified IPO, the Company will pay the income incentive fee in each calendar quarter as follows: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; no income incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which the Company&#146;s pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the Hurdle Amount;

&#183; &#160; 100% of the Company&#146;s pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the Hurdle Amount but is less than or equal to an amount (the &#147;Pre-Qualified IPO Catch-Up Amount&#148;) determined on a quarterly basis by multiplying 1.7647% by the Company&#146;s net asset value at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter. The Pre-Qualified IPO Catch-Up Amount is intended to provide the Advisor with an incentive fee of 15% on all of the Company&#146;s pre-incentive fee net investment income when the Company&#146;s pre-incentive fee net investment income reaches the Pre-Qualified IPO Catch-Up Amount in any calendar quarter; and

&#183; &#160; for any calendar quarter in which the Company&#146;s pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the Pre-Qualified IPO Catch-Up Amount, the income incentive fee shall equal 15% of the amount of the Company&#146;s pre-incentive fee net investment income for the calendar quarter.

&#160; 

On and after the occurrence of a Qualified IPO, the Company will pay the income incentive fee in each calendar quarter as follows: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; no income incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which the Company&#146;s pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the Hurdle Amount;

&#183; &#160; 100% of the Company&#146;s pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the Hurdle Amount but is less than or equal to an amount (the &#147;Post-Qualified IPO Catch-Up Amount&#148;) determined on a quarterly basis by multiplying 1.8182% by the Company&#146;s net asset value at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter. The Post-Qualified IPO Catch-Up Amount is intended to provide the Advisor with an incentive fee of 17.5% on all of the Company&#146;s pre-incentive fee net investment income when the Company&#146;s pre-incentive fee net investment income reaches the Post-Qualified IPO Catch-Up Amount in any calendar quarter; and

&#183; &#160; for any calendar quarter in which the Company&#146;s pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the Post-Qualified IPO Catch-Up Amount, the income incentive fee shall equal 17.5% of the amount of the Company&#146;s pre-incentive fee net investment income for the calendar quarter.

&#160; 

These calculations will be appropriately pro-rated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases by the Company during the current quarter. The Company does not currently intend to institute a share repurchase program and share repurchases will be effected only in extremely limited circumstances in accordance with applicable law. If the Qualified IPO occurs on a date other than the first day of a calendar quarter, the income incentive fee shall be calculated for such calendar quarter at a weighted rate calculated based on the fee rates applicable before and after a Qualified IPO based on the number of days in such calendar quarter before and after a Qualified IPO. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The second part of the incentive fee is a capital gains incentive fee that is determined and payable in arrears in cash as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals (i) 15% of our realized capital gains as of the end of the fiscal year prior to a Qualified IPO, and (ii) 17.5% of our realized capital gains as of the end of the fiscal year after a Qualified IPO. In determining the capital gains incentive fee payable to the Advisor, we calculate the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains and cumulative aggregate realized capital losses since our inception, and the aggregate unrealized capital depreciation as of the date of the calculation, as applicable, with respect to each of the investments in our portfolio. For this purpose, cumulative aggregate realized capital gains, if any, equals the sum of the differences between the net sales price of each investment, when sold, and the original cost of such investment since our inception. Cumulative aggregate realized capital losses equals the sum of the amounts by which the net sales price of each investment, when sold, is less than the original cost of such investment since our inception. Aggregate unrealized capital depreciation equals the sum of the difference, if negative, between the valuation of each investment as of the applicable calculation date and the original cost of such investment. At the end of the applicable year, the amount of capital gains that serves as the basis for our calculation of the capital gains incentive fee equals the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains less cumulative aggregate realized capital losses, less aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, with respect to our portfolio of investments. If this number is positive at the end of such year, then the capital gains incentive fee for such year will equal 15% or 17.5%, as applicable, of such amount, less the aggregate amount of any capital gains incentive fees paid in respect of our portfolio in all prior years as calculated in accordance with the below after a Qualified IPO. 

&#160; 

If a Qualified IPO occurs on a date other than the first day of a fiscal year, a capital gains incentive fee shall be calculated as of the day before the Qualified IPO, with such capital gains incentive fee paid to the Advisor following the end of the fiscal year in which the Qualified IPO occurred. For the avoidance of doubt, such capital gains incentive fee shall be equal to 15.0% of the Company&#146;s realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception through the day before the Qualified IPO, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gains incentive fees. Following a Qualified IPO, solely for the purposes of calculating the capital gains incentive fee, the Company will be deemed to have previously paid capital gains incentive fees prior to a Qualified IPO equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the actual aggregate amount of previously paid capital gains incentive fees for all periods prior to a Qualified IPO by (b) the percentage obtained by dividing (x) 17.5% by (y) 15.0%. In the event that the Investment Advisory Agreement shall terminate as of a date that is not a fiscal year end, the termination date shall be treated as though it were a fiscal year end for purposes of calculating and paying a capital gains incentive fee. 

&#160; 

Our Board will monitor the mix and performance of our investments over time and will seek to satisfy itself that the Advisor is acting in our interests and that our fee structure appropriately incentivizes the Advisor to do so. 

&#160; 

On June 2, 2015, we also entered into an administration agreement (the &#147;Administration Agreement&#148;) with the Administrator, an affiliate of CCG LP, pursuant to which the Administrator will provide the administrative services necessary for us to operate, and we will utilize the Administrator&#146;s office facilities, equipment and recordkeeping services. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, the Administrator has agreed to oversee our public reporting requirements and tax reporting and monitor our expenses and the performance of professional services rendered to us by others. The Administrator has also hired a sub-administrator to assist in the provision of administrative services. We will reimburse the Administrator for its costs and expenses and our allocable portion of overhead incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including compensation paid to or compensatory distributions received by our officers (including our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer) and any of their respective staff who provide services to us, operations staff who provide services to us, and any other staff, to the extent they perform a role in our Sarbanes-Oxley internal control assessment. Our allocable portion of overhead is determined by the Administrator, which expects to use various methodologies such as allocation based on the percentage of time certain individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to the business and affairs of the Company, and is subject to oversight by the Board. The sub-administrator is paid its compensation for performing its sub-administrative services under the sub-administration agreement. The Administrator will waive its right to be reimbursed in the event that any such reimbursements would cause any distributions to our stockholders to constitute a return of capital. See &#147; Fees and Expenses .&#148; In addition, the Advisor is permitted to delegate its duties under the Administration Agreement to affiliates or third parties and we will reimburse the expenses of these parties incurred and paid by the Advisor on our behalf. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Both the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement have been approved by our Board. Unless earlier terminated as described below, both the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement will remain in effect for a period of two years from their effective date and will remain in effect from year to year thereafter if approved annually by (i) the vote of our Board, or by the vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, and (ii) the vote of a majority of our Independent Directors. The Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of assignment. Both the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon not less than 60 days&#146; written notice to the other. See &#147; Item 1A. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure&#151; Dependence Upon Key Personnel of CCG LP .&#148; 

&#160; 

Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Advisor has not assumed any responsibility to us other than to render the services called for under that agreement. It will not be responsible for any action of our Board in following or declining to follow the Advisor&#146;s advice or recommendations. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Advisor, its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with the Advisor, including, without limitation, the Administrator, and any person controlling or controlled by the Advisor will not be liable to us, any subsidiary of ours, our directors, our stockholders or any subsidiary&#146;s stockholders or partners for acts or omissions performed in accordance with and pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, except those resulting from acts constituting gross negligence, willful misfeasance, bad faith or reckless disregard of the duties that the Advisor owes to us under the Investment Advisory Agreement. In addition, as part of the Investment Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to indemnify the Advisor and each of its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with the Advisor, including, without limitation, and the Administrator, from and against any claims or liabilities, including reasonable legal fees and other expenses reasonably incurred, arising out of or in connection with our business and operations or any action taken or omitted on our behalf pursuant to authority granted by the Investment Advisory Agreement, except where attributable to gross negligence, willful misfeasance, bad faith or reckless disregard of such person&#146;s duties under the Investment Advisory Agreement. These protections may lead the Advisor to act in a riskier manner when acting on our behalf than it would when acting for its own account. 

&#160; 

United States federal and state securities laws may impose liability under certain circumstances on persons who act in good faith. Nothing in the Investment Advisory Agreement constitutes a waiver or limitation of any rights that the Company may have under any applicable federal or state securities laws. 

&#160; 

We have also entered into a license agreement with CCG LP under which CCG LP has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name &#147;Crescent Capital.&#148; 

&#160; 

Investment Decision Process 

&#160; 

Through the resources of CCG LP, the Advisor will have access to origination capabilities and research resources, experienced investment professionals, internal information systems and a credit analysis framework and investment process. Over the years, CCG LP has designed its investment process to seek those investments which it believes have the most attractive risk/reward characteristics. The process involves several levels of review and is coordinated in an effort to identify risks in potential investments. Our Advisor will apply CCG LP&#146;s expertise to screen many of our investment opportunities as described below. Depending on the type of the investment and the obligor, Advisor may apply all or some of these levels of review, in its discretion. Based upon a favorable outcome of the diligence process described below, our Advisor&#146;s investment committee will make a final decision on such investment and such investment will only be funded after approval. 

&#160; 

Direct Originations : New directly originated investment opportunities will initially be reviewed by a senior investment professional to determine whether additional consideration is warranted. Factors influencing this decision include fundamental business considerations, including borrower industry, borrower financial leverage and quality of management as well as private equity sponsor involvement (if any). In the event of a positive review, potential investments will be further reviewed with senior and junior investment professionals. If the team agrees on the fundamental attractiveness of the investment, the review phase will proceed with preliminary strategic and financial analyses. At this point, CCG LP will utilize its credit analysis methodology to outline credit and operating statistics and identify key business characteristics through a dialogue with the proposed portfolio company&#146;s management. Following this analysis, CCG LP will develop an initial structure and pricing proposal for the investment and preliminarily inform the investment committee of such proposal.

&#160; 

&#160; 

After satisfactory preliminary analysis and review, a due diligence phase will begin, including completion of credit analysis, on-site due diligence (if deemed necessary), visits and meetings with management, reference checks and could include consultation with third-party experts. The credit analysis is a detailed, bottom-up analysis on the proposed portfolio company that generally includes an assessment of its market, competition, products, management and the equity sponsor or owner. Detailed financial analysis will also be performed at this stage with a focus on historical financial results. Projected financial information developed by the proposed portfolio company is analyzed and sensitized by CCG LP based upon the portfolio company&#146;s historical results and CCG LP&#146;s assessment of the portfolio company&#146;s future prospects. The sensitivity analysis will highlight the variability of revenues and earnings, &#147;worst case&#148; debt service coverage and available sources of liquidity. As part of the overall evaluation, comparisons are made to similar companies to help assess a portfolio company&#146;s asset coverage of debt, interest servicing capacity and competitive strength within its industry and market. At the completion of due diligence, the investment committee will complete a checklist to verify that all identified issues have been covered or mitigated. Additionally during this stage, CCG LP will typically work with the management of the proposed portfolio company and its other capital providers to develop the structure of an investment, including negotiating among these parties on how our investment is expected to perform relative to the other forms of capital in its capital structure. 

&#160; 

Syndicated Investments: For syndicated investments, CCG LP seeks to pursue an investment process based upon evaluation of the credit fundamentals of issuers. The foundation of this process is the &#147;bottom-up&#148; credit research process that CCG LP employs across multiple strategies. In selecting investments, CCG LP&#146;s investment professionals perform comprehensive analysis of credit worthiness, including an assessment of the business, an evaluation of management, an analysis of business strategy and industry trends, an examination of financial results and projections and a review of the security&#146;s proposed terms. Credit research is a critical component of the investment process. In selecting investments, CCG LP&#146;s respective portfolio management teams will analyze opportunities with an emphasis on principal preservation (i.e., an issuer&#146;s ability to service its debt and maintain cash flow).

&#160; 

Investment Strategy 

&#160; 

We intend to follow CCG LP&#146;s traditional approach of investing, which is based upon fundamental credit research and risk analysis. This approach reflects CCG LP&#146;s view that the cornerstone of successful investing is fundamental credit analysis. 

&#160; 

Specifically, we will pursue an investment strategy targeting companies primarily in the middle-market. We believe that the middle-market is attractive as a result of the lack of available lending sources to smaller companies. We believe many financing providers have chosen to focus on large corporate clients and managing capital markets transactions rather than lending to middle-market businesses. Further, many financial institutions and traditional lenders are faced with constrained balance sheets and are requiring existing borrowers to reduce leverage. We also believe hedge funds and collateralized debt obligation/collateralized loan obligation managers are less likely to pursue investment opportunities in our target market as a result of reduced liquidity for new investments. Specifically, CCG LP&#146;s sourcing platform should enable it, on our behalf and through our Advisor, to identify and invest in creditworthy borrowers. In addition, to take advantage of investment opportunities in middle-market companies that are identified for us by CCG LP, we may invest alongside other pools of capital, including bank debt, high-yield and mezzanine funds managed by CCG LP. See &#147; Item 7. Certain Relationships and Relation Transactions, and Director Independence &#148; for a discussion of certain conflicts of interest of CCG LP and certain limitations on our ability to co-invest with other accounts advised by CCG LP. 

&#160; 

We expect to target investments generally in companies that exhibit the following characteristics: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; businesses with strong franchises and sustainable competitive advantages;

&#183; &#160; businesses operating in industries with barriers to entry;

&#183; &#160; businesses in industries with positive long-term dynamics;

&#183; &#160; businesses with cash flows that are dependable and predictable; and

&#183; &#160; businesses with management teams with demonstrated track records and economic incentives.

&#160; 

We will seek to create a diversified portfolio of investments across various industries as a method to manage risk and capitalize on specific sector trends, although our investments may be concentrated in a small number of industries. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Investment Focus 

&#160; 

Generally, we focus on investing in secured debt (including senior secured, unitranche and second lien debt) and unsecured debt (including senior unsecured and subordinated debt), as well as related equity securities of private U.S. middle-market companies. By &#147;middle-market companies,&#148; we mean companies that have annual earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (&#147;EBITDA&#148;), which we believe is a useful proxy for cash flow, of $10 million to $250 million. We may on occasion invest in larger or smaller companies. 

&#160; 

We generally invest in securities that are rated below investment grade ( e.g. , junk bonds) by rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. See &#147; Item 1A. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Relating to Our Investments&#151; Lack of Liquidity in Investments .&#148; Our investments may include non-cash income features, including PIK interest and OID. See &#147; Item 1A. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Relating to Our Investments&#151;Risks Associated with OID and PIK Interest Income .&#148; 

&#160; 

Our business model is focused on the direct origination of loans to middle-market companies. The companies in which we invest use our capital to support organic growth, acquisitions, market or product expansion and recapitalizations. We expect to generate revenues primarily in the form of interest income from the investments we hold in addition to income from dividends on direct equity investments, capital gains on the sales of loans and debt and equity securities and various loan origination and other fees. 

&#160; 

We may purchase interests in loans or make other debt investments, directly from our target companies as primary market or directly originated investments or through secondary market transactions in the &#147;over-the-counter&#148; market. Although our focus is to invest in directly originated transactions, in certain circumstances we will also invest in the broadly syndicated loan and high yield markets. Broadly syndicated loans and bonds are generally more liquid than our directly originated investments and provide a complement to our less liquid strategies. In addition, and because we often receive more attractive financing terms on these positions than we do on our less liquid assets, we are able to leverage the broadly syndicated portion of our portfolio in such a way that can maximize the levered return potential of our portfolio. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Our primary competitors in providing financing to middle-market companies include public and private funds, other business development companies, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, we believe some competitors may have access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC or to the distribution and other requirements we must satisfy to maintain our qualification as a RIC. 

&#160; 

We expect to use the expertise of the investment professionals of CCG LP to which we will have access to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments in portfolio companies. In addition, we expect that the relationships of the senior members of CCG LP will enable us to learn about, and compete effectively for, financing opportunities with attractive middle-market companies in the industries in which we seek to invest. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see &#147; Item 1A. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Relating to our Business and Structure&#151;Operation in a Highly Competitive Market for Investment Opportunities .&#148; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Fees and Expenses 

&#160; 

Our primary operating expenses will include the payment of fees to the Advisor under the Investment Advisory Agreement, our allocable portion of overhead expenses under the Administration Agreement with our Administrator, operating costs associated with our sub-administration, custodian and transfer agent agreements with State Street Bank and Trust Company (the &#147;Sub-Administration Agreements&#148;) and other operating costs described below. We will bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; allocated organization costs from the Advisor incurred prior to the commencement of our operations up to a maximum of $1.5 million;

&#183; &#160; the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any third-party valuation services;

&#183; &#160; fidelity bond, directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability insurance and other insurance premiums;

&#183; &#160; direct costs, such as printing, mailing, long distance telephone and staff;

&#183; &#160; fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs;

&#183; &#160; independent directors&#146; fees and expenses;

&#183; &#160; U.S. federal, state and local taxes;

&#183; &#160; the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities;

&#183; &#160; fees payable to third parties relating to making investments, including out-of-pocket fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence and reviews of prospective investments;

&#183; &#160; out-of-pocket fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts;

&#183; &#160; federal and state registration fees and any stock exchange listing fees;

&#183; &#160; brokerage commissions;

&#183; &#160; costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and other applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws;

&#183; &#160; debt service and other costs of borrowings or other financing arrangements; and

&#183; &#160; all other expenses reasonably incurred by us in connection with making investments and administering our business.

&#160; 

We have agreed to repay the Advisor for initial organization costs and equity offering costs incurred prior to the commencement of operations up to a maximum of $1.5 million on a pro rata basis over the first $350 million of invested capital not to exceed 3 years from the initial capital commitment. The Advisor is responsible for organization and private equity offering costs in excess of $1.5 million. 

&#160; 

We expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines. Incentive Fees and costs relating to future offerings of securities would be incremental. 

&#160; 

Capital Resources and Borrowings 

&#160; 

We anticipate cash to be generated from our current private offering of common shares (the &#147;Private Offering&#148;) and other future offerings of securities (including a Qualified IPO), and cash flows from operations, including interest earned from the temporary investment of cash in cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. Additionally, we are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. Furthermore, while any indebtedness and senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. In connection with borrowings, our lenders may require us to pledge assets, investor commitments to fund capital calls and/or the proceeds of those capital calls. In addition, the lenders may ask us to comply with positive or negative covenants that could have an effect on our operations. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

On June 29, 2015, the Company entered into a revolving credit facility (the &#147;Revolving Credit Facility&#148;) with various lenders. Natixis, New York Branch, one of the lenders, also serves as administrative agent under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility has an aggregate committed amount of $75 million. On October 23, 2015, the Company amended the Revolving Credit Facility to include a multi-currency tranche allowing the Company to borrow up to 15% of the principal amount committed under an alternative currency including Euro, Canadian Dollar and Pound Sterling (GBP). 

&#160; 

The Company&#146;s obligations to the lenders are secured by a first priority security interest in the unused capital commitments and substantially the entire portfolio of investments and cash. The Revolving Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including, but not limited to maintaining an asset coverage ratio of total assets to total borrowings of at least 2 to 1. As of December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. 

&#160; 

Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at either (i) London Interbank Offered Rate (&#147;LIBOR&#148;) plus a margin with no LIBOR floor or (ii) at lenders&#146; cost of funds plus a margin. The Company pays a fee of 0.20% per annum on committed but undrawn amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility. Interest is payable monthly in arrears. Any amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility, and all accrued and unpaid interest, will be due and payable, on June 29, 2016. 

&#160; 

For more information on our debt, see &#147; ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#146;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS&#151;&#151;Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources. &#148; 

&#160; 

Dividend Reinvestment Plan 

&#160; 

Prior to the listing of the Company&#146;s shares on an exchange (a &#147;Listing&#148;), stockholders who &#147;opt in&#148; to the Company&#146;s dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash dividends and distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company&#146;s common stock, rather than receiving cash dividends and distributions. 

&#160; 

Subsequent to a Listing, stockholders who do not &#147;opt out&#148; of the Company&#146;s dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash dividends and distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company&#146;s common stock, rather than receiving cash dividends and distributions. 

&#160; 

Stockholders can elect to &#147;opt in&#148; or &#147;opt out&#148; of the Company&#146;s dividend reinvestment plan in their Subscription Agreements. We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that will provide for reinvestment of our dividends and other distributions on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if our Board authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend or other distribution, then (i) prior to a Listing, stockholders who &#147;opt in&#148; to the Company&#146;s dividend reinvestment plan and (ii) subsequent to a Listing, stockholders who do not &#147;opt out&#148; of the Company&#146;s dividend reinvestment plan, will have their cash dividends and distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company&#146;s common stock, rather than receiving cash dividends and distributions. The elections of stockholders that make an election prior to a Listing shall remain effective after the Listing. 

&#160; 

Administration 

&#160; 

We do not currently have any employees. Each officer of the Company will also be an employee of the Advisor or its affiliates. 

&#160; 

Our day-to-day investment operations are managed by the Advisor. Pursuant to its Resource Sharing Agreement with CCG LP, the Advisor will have access to the individuals who comprise our Advisor&#146;s investment committee, and a team of additional experienced investment professionals who, collectively, comprise the Advisor&#146;s investment team. The Advisor may hire additional investment professionals to provide services to us, based upon its needs. 

&#160; 

Regulation as a Business Development Company 

&#160; 

We are regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. A BDC must be organized in the United States for the purpose of investing in or lending to primarily private companies and making significant managerial assistance available to them. A BDC may use capital provided by public stockholders and from other sources to make long-term, private investments in businesses. A publicly-traded BDC provides stockholders the ability to retain the liquidity of a publicly-traded stock while sharing in the possible benefits, if any, of investing in primarily privately owned companies. Until a Qualified IPO, we do not intend to list our common stock on a stock exchange and it will not be publicly traded. We will only pursue a Qualified IPO if and when the Advisor believes market conditions are appropriate for the Company to conduct a Qualified IPO and list its shares on an exchange. At such time, the Adviser will recommend that the Board approve such Qualified IPO. There can be no guarantee that a Qualified IPO will take place and investors should not rely on a Qualified IPO for liquidity. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC unless authorized by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, as required by the 1940 Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (a) 67% or more of such company&#146;s voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company. We do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business. 

&#160; 

As with other companies regulated by the 1940 Act, a BDC must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. A majority of our directors must be persons who are not interested persons, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. Additionally, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect the BDC. Furthermore, as a BDC, we will be prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person&#146;s office. 

&#160; 

As a BDC, we will generally be required to meet an asset coverage ratio, defined under the 1940 Act as the ratio of our total assets (less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities) to our outstanding senior securities, of at least 200% after each issuance of senior securities. We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC through an exemptive relief order (other than in certain limited situations pursuant to current regulatory guidance). 

&#160; 

We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, except for registered money market funds, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of investment companies in the aggregate. The portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies ordinarily will subject our stockholders to additional expenses. Our investment portfolio is also subject to diversification requirements by virtue of our intention to be a RIC for U.S. tax purposes. 

&#160; 

We will generally not be able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value of our common stock if our Board determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. In addition, we may generally issue new shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value in rights offerings to existing stockholders, in payment of dividends and in certain other limited circumstances. 

&#160; 

We will be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act. 

&#160; 

As a BDC, we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. See &#147; Item 1A. Risk Factors .&#148; 

&#160; 

Qualifying Assets 

&#160; 

We may invest up to 30% of our portfolio opportunistically in &#147;non-qualifying assets&#148;. However, under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as &#147;qualifying assets,&#148; unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the BDC&#146;s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following: 

&#160; 

1. &#160; Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following:

&#160; 

a) &#160; Issuer is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;

b) &#160; Issuer is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and

c) &#160; Issuer satisfies any of the following:

&#160; 

i. &#160; does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange;

ii. &#160; has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million;

iii. &#160; is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or

iv. &#160; is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4.0 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2.0 million.

&#160; 

&#160; 

2. &#160; Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control.

3. &#160; Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements.

4. &#160; Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company.

5. &#160; Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities.

6. &#160; Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.

&#160; 

Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 

&#160; 

A BDC must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described under &#147;Qualifying Assets&#148; above. However, in order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, the BDC must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance; except that, where the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors or officers, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. 

&#160; 

Monitoring Investments 

&#160; 

In most cases, we will not have board influence over portfolio companies. In some instances, the Advisor&#146;s investment professionals may obtain board representation or observation rights in conjunction with our investments. In conjunction with our Advisor&#146;s investment committee and our Board, the Advisor will take an active approach in monitoring all investments, which includes reviews of financial performance on at least a quarterly basis and may include discussions with management and/or the equity sponsor. The monitoring process will begin with structuring terms and conditions which require the timely delivery and access to critical financial and business information regarding portfolio companies. 

&#160; 

Temporary Investments 

&#160; 

Pending investment in other types of &#147;qualifying assets,&#148; as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as &#147;temporary investments,&#148; so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. See &#147; Item I. Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences&#151;Election to be Taxed as a RIC .&#148; Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our gross assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our Advisor will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. Our Advisor will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Senior Securities 

&#160; 

We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage, see &#147; Item 1A. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure&#151; Financing Investments With Borrowed Money .&#148; 

&#160; 

The 1940 Act imposes limitations on a BDC&#146;s issuance of preferred shares, which are considered &#147;senior securities&#148; and thus are subject to the 200% asset coverage requirement described above. In addition, (i) preferred shares must have the same voting rights as the common stockholders (one share, one vote); and (ii) preferred stockholders must have the right, as a class, to appoint directors to the board of directors. 

&#160; 

Code of Ethics 

&#160; 

As required by Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act, respectively, we and the Adviser have adopted codes of ethics which apply to, among others, our and our Adviser&#146;s executive officers, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as well as our Adviser&#146;s officers, directors and employees. . Our codes of ethics generally will not permit investments by our and the Advisor&#146;s personnel in securities that may be purchased or sold by us. 

&#160; 

We hereby undertake to provide a copy of the codes to any person, without charge, upon request. Requests for a copy of the codes may be made in writing addressed to the Secretary of the Company, George Hawley, Crescent Capital BDC, Inc., 11100 Santa Monica Boulevard, Suite 2000, Los Angeles, California, 90025, Attention: CBDC Investor Relations, or by emailing us at investor.relations@crescentcap.com. 

&#160; 

Compliance Policies and Procedures 

&#160; 

We and our Advisor have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect and prevent violation of the federal securities laws and we are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation and designate a Chief Compliance Officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. Joseph Hanlon currently serves as our Chief Compliance Officer. 

&#160; 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 

&#160; 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the 1934 Act, our President and Chief Financial Officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports;

&#183; &#160; pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures;

&#183; &#160; pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the 1934 Act, our management must prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and (once we cease to be an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act or, if later, for the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC) must obtain an audit of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting performed by our independent registered public accounting firm; and

&#183; &#160; pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the 1934 Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.

&#160; 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 

&#160; 

We will delegate our proxy voting responsibility to our Advisor. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of the Advisor are set forth below. The guidelines are reviewed periodically by the Advisor and our non-interested directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change. 

&#160; 

An investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, the Advisor recognizes that it must vote portfolio securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of its clients. 

&#160; 

These policies and procedures for voting proxies are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 

&#160; 

The Adviser will vote all proxies based upon the guiding principle of seeking to maximize the ultimate long-term economic value of our stockholders&#146; holdings, and ultimately all votes are cast on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the contractual obligations under the relevant advisory agreements or comparable documents, and all other relevant facts and circumstances at the time of the vote. The Advisor will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by us. Although the Advisor will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our portfolio securities, the Advisor may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so. 

&#160; 

The Advisor&#146;s proxy voting decisions are made by our Advisor&#146;s investment committee. To ensure that the vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, the Advisor will require that: (1) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to our Advisor&#146;s investment committee, and disinterested directors, any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how the Advisor intends to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. 

&#160; 

Privacy Principles 

&#160; 

We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguarding their non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help investors understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to our privacy policy, we will not disclose any non-public personal information concerning any of our stockholders who are individuals unless the disclosure meets certain permitted exceptions under Regulation S-P. We generally will not use or disclose any stockholder information for any purpose other than as required by law. 

&#160; 

We may collect non-public information about investors from our Subscription Agreements or other forms, such as name, address, account number and the types and amounts of investments, and information about transactions with us or our affiliates, such as participation in other investment programs, ownership of certain types of accounts or other account data and activity. We may disclose the information that we collect from our stockholders or former stockholders, as described above, only to our affiliates and service providers and only as allowed by applicable law or regulation. Any party that receives this information will use it only for the services required by us and as allowed by applicable law or regulation, and is not permitted to share or use this information for any other purpose. To protect the non-public personal information of individuals, we permit access only by authorized personnel who need access to that information to provide services to us and our stockholders. In order to guard our stockholders&#146; non-public personal information, we maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that are designed to comply with applicable law. Non-public personal information that we collect about our stockholders will generally be stored on secured servers. An individual stockholder&#146;s right to privacy extends to all forms of contact with us, including telephone, written correspondence and electronic media, such as the Internet. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to our privacy policy, we will provide a clear and conspicuous notice to each investor that details our privacy policies and procedures at the time of the investor&#146;s subscription. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Reporting Obligations 

&#160; 

We will furnish our stockholders with annual reports containing audited financial statements, quarterly reports, and such other periodic reports as we determine to be appropriate or as may be required by law. We are required to comply with all periodic reporting, proxy solicitation and other applicable requirements under the 1934 Act..

Election to be Taxed as a RIC 

&#160; 

We intend to elect to be treated, and intend to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, commencing with our taxable year ending on December 31, 2015. As a RIC, we generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income or gains that we timely distribute to our stockholders as dividends. Rather, dividends we distribute generally will be taxable to our stockholders, and any net operating losses, foreign tax credits and other of our tax attributes generally will not pass through to our stockholders, subject to special rules for certain items such as net capital gains and qualified dividend income we recognize. See &#147; &#151;Taxation of U.S. Stockholders &#148; and &#147; &#151;Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders &#148; below. 

&#160; 

To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, to qualify as a RIC, we must timely distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our investment company taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction), which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses, if any, for each taxable year (the &#147;Annual Distribution Requirement&#148;). 

&#160; 

Taxation as a RIC 

&#160; 

As a RIC and if we satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, then we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain (generally, net long-term capital gain in excess of net short-term capital loss) that we timely distribute (or are deemed to timely distribute) to our stockholders. We are subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders. 

&#160; 

We generally are subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any net ordinary income and capital gains in excess of capital losses recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years (the &#147;Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement&#148;). We will not be subject to the U.S. federal excise tax on amounts on which we are required to pay U.S. federal income tax (such as retained net capital gains). Depending upon the level of taxable income earned in a year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income for distribution in the following year and pay the applicable U.S. federal excise tax. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

To maintain our status as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; qualify and have in effect an election to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year;

&#183; &#160; derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to loans of certain securities, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, net income derived from an interest in a &#147;qualified publicly traded partnership&#148; (as defined in the Code), or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities (the &#147;90% Income Test&#148;); and

&#183; &#160; diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:

&#160; 

i. &#160; at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and

ii. &#160; no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in (a) the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer or of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or (b) the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships (the &#147;Diversification Tests&#148;).

&#160; 

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will include in our taxable income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable U.S. federal income tax rules as having OID (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, that have increasing interest rates or are issued with warrants), we must include in our taxable income in each year a portion of the OID that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether we receive cash representing such income in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in our taxable income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as accruals on a contingent payment debt instrument or deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock. Because such OID or other amounts accrued are included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make distributions to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement and/or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, even though we will have not received any corresponding cash payments. Accordingly, to enable us to make distributions to our stockholders that will be sufficient to enable us to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we may need to sell some of our assets at times and/or at prices that we would not consider advantageous, we may need to raise additional equity or debt capital or we may need to forego new investment opportunities or otherwise take actions that are disadvantageous to our business (or be unable to take actions that are advantageous to our business). If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources to enable us to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we may fail to qualify for the U.S. federal income tax benefits allowable to RICs and, thus, become subject to a corporate-level U.S. federal income tax (and any applicable state and local taxes). 

&#160; 

Because we expect to use debt financing, we may be prevented by financial covenants contained in our debt financing agreements from making distributions to our stockholders in certain circumstances. In addition, under the 1940 Act, we are generally not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain &#147;asset coverage&#148; tests are met. Limits on our distributions to our stockholders may prevent us from satisfying the Annual Distribution Requirement and, therefore, may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a RIC, or subject us to the 4% U.S. federal excise tax. 

&#160; 

Although we do not presently expect to do so, we may borrow funds and sell assets in order to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient for us to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement. However, our ability to dispose of assets may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. Alternatively, although we currently do not intend to do so, to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we may declare a taxable dividend payable in our stock or cash at the election of each stockholder. In such case, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in our common stock will generally be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of our stock. See &#147; &#151;Taxation of Stockholders &#148; below for a discussion of the tax consequences to stockholders upon receipt of such dividends. 

&#160; 

Distributions we make to our stockholders may be made from our cash assets or by liquidation of our investments, if necessary. We may recognize gains or losses from such liquidations. In the event we recognize net capital gains from such transactions, investors may receive a larger capital gain distribution than they would have received in the absence of such transactions. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Failure to Qualify as a RIC 

&#160; 

If we fail to satisfy the 90% Income Test for any taxable year or the Diversification Tests for any quarter of a taxable year, we might nevertheless continue to qualify as a RIC for such year if certain relief provisions of the Code applied (which might, among other things, require us to pay certain corporate-level U.S. federal taxes or to dispose of certain assets). If we failed to qualify for treatment as a RIC and such relief provisions did not apply to us, we would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate U.S. federal income tax rates (and we also would be subject to any applicable state and local taxes), regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders. We would not be able to deduct distributions to our stockholders, nor would distributions to our stockholders be required to be made for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any distributions we make generally would be taxable to our U.S. stockholders as ordinary dividend income and, subject to certain limitations under the Code, would be eligible for the 20% maximum rate applicable to individuals and other non-corporate U.S. stockholders, to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, U.S. stockholders that are corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder&#146;s adjusted tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. 

&#160; 

Subject to a limited exception applicable to RICs that qualified as such under Subchapter M of the Code for at least one year prior to disqualification and that re-qualify as a RIC no later than the second year following the non-qualifying year, we could be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any unrealized net built-in gains in the assets held by us during the period in which we failed to qualify as a RIC that are recognized during the 10-year period after our requalification as a RIC, unless we made a special election to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on such net built-in gains at the time of our requalification as a RIC. We may decide to be taxed as a regular corporation even if we would otherwise qualify as a RIC if we determine that treatment as a corporation for a particular year would be in our best interests.
