 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

We are one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. We refer to this business as our property operations, which accounted for 98% &#32;of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 . We also offer tower-related services in the United States, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting and structural analysis, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. We refer to this business as our services operations. 

Our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to long-term lease arrangements, as well as distributed antenna system (&#8220;DAS&#8221;) networks, which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain in-building and outdoor wireless environments. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. Our communications real estate portfolio of 100,615 &#32;communications sites, as of December 31, 2015 , included 40,426 &#32;communications sites in the U.S., 15,074 &#32;communications sites in Asia, 12,176 &#32;communications sites in Europe, Middle East and Africa (&#8220;EMEA&#8221;) and 32,939 &#32;communications sites in Latin America. 

American Tower Corporation was originally created as a subsidiary of American Radio Systems Corporation in 1995 and was spun off into a free-standing public company in 1998. Since inception, we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions, long-term lease arrangements and site development. In 2015, we significantly expanded our portfolio by (i) obtaining the exclusive right to lease, acquire or otherwise operate and manage 11,449 wireless communications sites from Verizon Communications Inc. (&#8220;Verizon&#8221;) in the United States (the &#8220;Verizon Transaction&#8221;) and (ii) acquiring 4,716 communications sites in Nigeria from certain subsidiaries of Bharti Airtel Limited (&#8220;Airtel&#8221;). In addition, in October 2015, we signed a definitive agreement pursuant to which we expect to acquire a 51% controlling ownership interest in Viom Networks Limited (&#8220;Viom&#8221;), a telecommunications infrastructure company that owns and operates over 42,000 &#32;wireless communications towers and 200 indoor DAS networks in India. 

We are a holding company and conduct our operations through our directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures. Our principal domestic operating subsidiaries are American Towers LLC and SpectraSite Communications, LLC. We conduct our international operations primarily through our subsidiary, American Tower International, Inc., which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures. 

We operate as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (&#8220;REIT&#8221;). Accordingly, we generally are not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by our U.S. REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on our towers, as we receive a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets our income and gains. However, we remain obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from our domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries (&#8220;TRSs&#8221;). In addition, our international assets and operations, regardless of their designation for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted. 

The use of TRSs enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses while complying with REIT qualification requirements. We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2015 , our U.S. REIT qualified businesses included our U.S. tower leasing business, most of our operations in Costa Rica, Germany and Mexico and a majority of our services segment and indoor DAS networks business. 

During the fourth quarter of 2015, as a result of recent investment activity, including signed acquisitions, we reviewed and changed our reportable segments to divide our international segment into regional segments. We now operate in five reportable segments: U.S. property, Asia property, EMEA property, Latin America property and services. We believe this change provides more visibility into these operating segments as they continue to grow and corresponds with management&#8217;s current approach of allocating costs and resources, managing the growth and profitability of the business and assessing our operating performance. 

For more information about our business segments, as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate, see Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. 

Products and Services 

Property Operations 

Our property operations accounted for 98% &#32;of our total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . Our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases. Our tenants lease space on our communications real estate, where they install and maintain their individual communications network equipment. Rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, tower location, amount and type of tenant equipment on the tower, ground space required by the tenant and remaining tower capacity. Our costs typically include ground rent (which is primarily fixed, with annual cost escalations) and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes and repairs and maintenance expenses. Our property operations have generated consistent incremental growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics: 

&#8226; 

Long-term tenant leases with contractual rent escalations. &#32;In general, a tenant lease has an initial non-cancellable term of ten years with multiple renewal terms, with provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually, based on a fixed escalation percentage (approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in our international markets, or a combination of both. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2015 , we expect to generate over $30 billion &#32;of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, absent the impact of straight-line lease accounting. 

&#8226; 

Consistent demand for our sites. &#32;As a result of rapidly growing usage of wireless services and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve, we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites. We believe that our global asset base positions us well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless devices and the increasing usage of high bandwidth applications on those devices. We have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, which typically results in incremental revenue. Our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities, which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth. 

&#8226; 

High lease renewal rates. &#32;Our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect the quality of their network. Historically, churn has been approximately 1% to 2% of total property revenue per year. We define churn as revenue lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease or, in limited circumstances, when the lease rates on existing leases are reduced. We derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our revenue lost on this basis by our prior year property segment revenue. 

&#8226; 

High operating margins. &#32;Incremental operating costs associated with adding new tenants to an existing communications site are relatively minimal. Therefore, as tenants are added, the substantial majority of incremental revenue flows through to gross margin and operating profit. In addition, in many of our international markets, certain expenses, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs, are reimbursed and shared by our tenant base. 

&#8226; 

Low maintenance capital expenditures. &#32;On average, we require relatively low amounts of annual capital expenditures to maintain our communications sites. 

Our property business includes the operation of communications sites, managed networks, the leasing of property interests and the provision of backup power through shared generators. Our presence in a number of markets, at different relative stages of wireless development, provides us with significant diversification and long-term growth potential. Our property segments accounted for the following percentage of total revenue for the years ended December 31,: &#160;

Communications Sites. &#32;Approximately 95%, 95% and 96% of revenue in our property segments was attributable to our communications sites for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

We lease space on our communications sites to tenants providing a diverse range of communications services, including cellular voice and data, broadcasting, mobile video and a number of other applications. Our top tenants by revenue are as follows for the year ended December 31, 2015 : 

&#8226; 

U.S.: &#32;AT&#38;T, Verizon Wireless, Sprint and T-Mobile accounted for an aggregate of 87% &#32;of U.S. property segment revenue. 

&#8226; 

Asia: Vodafone, Idea Cellular, Airtel and Aircel accounted for an aggregate of 73% of Asia property segment revenue. 

&#8226; 

EMEA: MTN Group Limited, Airtel, Cell C and Vodafone accounted for an aggregate of 82% of EMEA property segment revenue. 

&#8226; 

Latin America: Telef&#243;nica, AT&#38;T, Nextel International and Telecom Italia accounted for an aggregate of 70% of Latin America property segment revenue. 

Accordingly, we are subject to certain risks, as set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants, and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants.&#8221; In addition, we are subject to risks related to our international operations, as set forth under the caption &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Our foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position, including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.&#8221; 

Managed Networks, Property Interests and Shared Generators. In addition to our communications sites, we also own and operate several types of managed network solutions, provide communications site management services to third parties, manage and lease property interests under carrier or other third-party communications sites and provide back-up power sources to tenants at our sites. 

&#8226; 

Managed Networks. We own and operate DAS networks in the United States and certain international markets. We obtain rights from property owners to install and operate in-building DAS networks, and we grant rights to wireless service providers to attach their equipment to our installations. We also offer outdoor DAS networks as a complementary shared infrastructure solution for our tenants in the United States and in certain international markets. Typically, we design, build and operate our outdoor DAS networks in areas in which zoning restrictions or other barriers may prevent or delay deployment of more traditional wireless communications sites. We also hold lease rights and easement interests on rooftops capable of hosting communications equipment in locations where towers are generally not a viable solution based on area characteristics. In addition, we provide management services to property owners in the United States who elect to retain full rights to their property while simultaneously marketing the rooftop for wireless communications equipment installation. As the demand for advanced wireless devices in urban markets evolves, we continue to evaluate a variety of infrastructure solutions, including small cells, that may support our tenants&#8217; networks in these areas. 

&#8226; 

Property Interests . &#32;We own a portfolio of property interests in the United States under carrier or other third-party communications sites, which provides recurring cash flow under complementary leasing arrangements. 

&#8226; 

Shared Generators . We have contracts with certain of our tenants in the United States pursuant to which we provide access to shared backup power generators. 

Services Operations 

We offer tower-related services, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting and structural analysis services. Our services operations primarily support our site leasing business, including through the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. This segment accounted for 2% &#32;of our total revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . 

Site Acquisition, Zoning and Permitting . We engage in site acquisition services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects, as well as on behalf of our tenants. We typically work with our tenants&#8217; engineers to determine the geographic areas where new communications sites will best address the tenants&#8217; needs and meet their coverage objectives. Once a new site is identified, we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed, and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site. 

Structural Analysis. &#32;We offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers. Our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed, which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision. Our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by, among other things, reducing the time required to achieve operational readiness, while also providing opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties. 

Strategy 

Operational Strategy 

Our operational strategy is to capitalize on the global growth in the use of wireless services and the evolution of advanced wireless handsets, tablets and other mobile devices, and the corresponding expansion of communications infrastructure required to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies. To achieve this, our primary focus is to (i) increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio, (ii) invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio, (iii) further improve upon our operational performance and (iv) maintain a strong balance sheet. We believe these efforts will further support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure. 

&#8226; 

Increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio. &#32;We believe that our highest returns will be achieved by leasing additional space on our existing communications sites. Increasing demand for wireless services in our served markets has resulted in significant capital spending by major wireless carriers. As a result, we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites because they are attractively located for wireless service providers and typically have capacity available for additional tenants. In the United States, incremental carrier network activity is being driven primarily by the build-out of fourth generation (4G) networks, while in our international markets, carriers are deploying a combination of second generation (2G), third generation (3G) and 4G networks, depending on the specific market. As of December 31, 2015 , we had a global average of approximately 1.8 tenants per tower. We believe that the majority of our towers have capacity for additional tenants and that substantially all of our towers that are currently at or near full structural capacity can be upgraded or augmented to meet future tenant demand with relatively modest capital investment. Therefore, we will continue to target our sales and marketing activities to increase the utilization and return on investment of our existing communications sites. 

&#8226; 

Invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio. &#32;We seek opportunities to invest in and grow our operations through our capital programs, new site construction and acquisitions. We believe we can achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns by pursuing such investments. In addition, we seek to secure property interests under our communications sites to improve operating margins as we reduce our cash operating expense related to ground leases. A significant portion of our inorganic growth has been focused on properties with lower initial tenancy because we believe that over time, we can significantly increase tenancy levels, and therefore, drive strong returns on those assets. 

&#8226; 

Further improve upon our operational performance. &#32;We continue to seek opportunities to improve our operational performance throughout the organization. This includes investing in our systems and people as we strive to improve efficiency and provide superior service to our customers. To achieve this, we intend to continue to focus on customer service, such as reducing cycle times for key functions, including lease processing and tower structural analysis. 

&#8226; 

Maintain a strong balance sheet. &#32;We remain committed to disciplined financial policies, which we believe result in our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and will support our overall strategy and focus on asset growth and operational excellence. As a result of these policies, we currently have investment grade credit ratings. We expect to continue to support these policies through, among other things, a combination of debt repayment and our continued growth. We continue to focus on maintaining a robust liquidity position and, as of December 31, 2015 , had $1.9 billion &#32;of available liquidity. We believe that our investment grade credit ratings provide us consistent access to the capital markets and our liquidity provides us the ability to selectively invest in our portfolio. 

Capital Allocation Strategy 

The objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations and our return on invested capital over the long term. To maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, we are required to distribute to our stockholders annually an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). After complying with our REIT distribution requirements and paying dividends on our preferred stock, we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria, while taking into account the repayment of debt, as necessary, consistent with our long-term financial policies. 

&#8226; 

Capital expenditure program. &#32;We will continue to invest in and expand our existing communications real estate portfolio through our annual capital expenditure program. This includes capital expenditures associated with maintenance, increasing the capacity of our existing sites, and projects such as new site construction, land interest acquisitions and shared generator installations. 

&#8226; 

Acquisitions. &#32;We intend to pursue acquisitions of communications sites in our existing or new markets where we can meet our risk-adjusted return on investment criteria. Our risk-adjusted hurdle rates consider additional risks such as the country and counter-parties involved, investment and economic climate, legal and regulatory conditions and industry risk. 

&#8226; 

Return excess capital to stockholders. &#32;If we have excess capital available after funding (i) our required distributions, (ii) our capital expenditures, (iii) repayment of debt, as necessary, consistent with our long-term financial policies and (iv) anticipated future investments, including acquisition opportunities, we will seek to return such excess capital to stockholders. 

International Growth Strategy 

We believe that, in certain international markets, we can create substantial value by either establishing a new, or expanding our existing, communications real estate leasing business. Therefore, we expect we will continue to seek international growth opportunities where we believe our risk-adjusted return objectives can be achieved. We strive to maintain a diversified approach to our international growth strategy by operating in a geographically diverse array of markets in a variety of stages of wireless network development. Our international growth strategy includes a disciplined, individualized market evaluation, in which we conduct the following analyses, among others: 

&#8226; 

Country analysis. &#32;Prior to entering a new market, we conduct an extensive review of the country&#8217;s historical and projected macroeconomic fundamentals, including inflation outlook and foreign currency exchange rate trends, capital markets, tax regime and investment alternatives, and the general business, political and legal environments, including property rights and regulatory regime. 

&#8226; 

Wireless industry analysis. &#32;To confirm the presence of sufficient demand to support an independent tower leasing model, we analyze the competitiveness of the country&#8217;s wireless market, such as the pricing environment, past and potential industry consolidation and the stage of its wireless network development. Characteristics that result in an attractive investment opportunity include (i) multiple competitive wireless service providers who are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data networks and (ii) ongoing or expected deployment of incremental spectrum from auctions that have occurred or are anticipated to occur. 

&#8226; 

Opportunity and counterparty analysis. &#32;Once an investment opportunity is identified within a geographic area with an attractive wireless industry, we conduct a multifaceted opportunity and counterparty analysis. This includes evaluating (i) the type of transaction, (ii) its ability to meet our risk-adjusted return criteria given the country and the counterparties involved, including the anticipated anchor tenant and (iii) how the transaction fits within our long-term strategic objectives, including future potential investment and expansion within the region. 

Recent Transactions 

Acquisitions 

We increased our communications site portfolio by 25,368 &#32;sites in 2015, including 3,235 &#32;build-to-suits. We believe these assets will be an important component of our long-term growth. Significant transactions in 2015 &#32;included the Verizon Transaction, the acquisition of 5,483 communications sites in Brazil from TIM Celular S.A. (&#8220;TIM&#8221;) and the acquisition of 4,716 communications sites in Nigeria from certain subsidiaries of Airtel. In addition, in October 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a 51% controlling ownership interest in Viom. 

We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios that we believe we can effectively integrate into our existing business and generate returns that meet or exceed our criteria. For more information about our acquisitions, see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. 

Financing Transactions 

During 2015 , to complement our operational strategy to selectively invest in and grow our communications real estate portfolio, while maintaining our long-term financial policies, we completed a number of key financing initiatives, which, among others, included the following: 

&#8226; 

Refinancing of GTP Acquisition Partners securitization with proceeds from a private issuance of American Tower Secured Revenue Notes. 

&#8226; 

Completion of registered public offerings of our common and preferred stock, the net proceeds of which were used to fund a portion of the Verizon Transaction. 

&#8226; 

Completion of a registered public offering of senior unsecured notes due 2020 and 2025, the proceeds of which were used to repay indebtedness under our existing credit facilities. 

For more information about our financing transactions, see Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; and notes 8 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. 

Regulatory Matters 

Towers and Antennas. &#32;Our U.S. and international tower leasing business is subject to national, state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration, siting, construction, lighting, marking and maintenance of our towers. In the United States, which accounted for 67% &#32;of our total property segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 , the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require pre-approval by the Federal Communications Commission (&#8220;FCC&#8221;) and the Federal Aviation Administration (&#8220;FAA&#8221;), depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields. Towers requiring pre-approval must be registered with the FCC and maintained in accordance with FAA standards. Similar requirements regarding pre-approval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries. Non-compliance with applicable tower-related requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orders. 

In India, each of our operating subsidiaries holds an Infrastructure Provider Category-I (&#8220;IP-I&#8221;) Registration Certificate issued by the Indian Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885. As a condition to the IP-I, the Indian government has the right to take over telecommunications infrastructure in the case of emergency or war. In Ghana, our subsidiary holds a Communications Infrastructure License, issued by the National Communications Authority (&#8220;NCA&#8221;), which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services and DAS networks for communications service providers licensed by the NCA. In Uganda, our subsidiary holds a Public Infrastructure Service License, issued by the Uganda Communications Commission (&#8220;UCC&#8221;), which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure and DAS networks for communication service providers licensed by the UCC. In Nigeria, our subsidiary holds a license for Infrastructure Sharing and Collocation Services, issued by the Nigerian Communications Authority (&#8220;NCC&#8221;), which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure for communication service providers licensed by the NCC. In Chile, our subsidiary is classified as a Telecom Intermediate Service Provider. We have received a number of site specific concessions and are working with the Chilean Subsecretaria de Telecommunicaciones to receive concessions on our remaining sites in Chile. In many of the markets in which we operate we are required to provide tower space to service providers on a non-discriminatory basis, subject to negotiation of mutually agreeable terms. 

Our international business operations may be subject to increased licensing fees or ownership restrictions. For example, in South Africa, the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act, 2003 (the &#8220;BBBEE Act&#8221;) has established a legislative framework for the promotion of economic empowerment of South African citizens disadvantaged by Apartheid. Accordingly, the BBBEE Act and related codes measure BBBEE Act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership, management control, employment equity and other metrics for companies that do business there. In addition, certain municipalities have sought to impose permit fees based upon structural or operational requirements of towers. Our foreign operations may be affected if a country&#8217;s regulatory authority restricts or revokes spectrum licenses of certain wireless service providers or implements limitations on foreign ownership. 

In all countries where we operate, we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community organizations. While these regulations vary, they typically require tower owners or tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower. Local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities, which can delay or prevent new tower construction, new antenna installation or site upgrade projects, thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demand. This opposition and existing or new zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction, tower modifications, and additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades, as well as adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects. Further, additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us. These factors could materially and adversely affect our operations. In the United States, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 prohibits any action by state and local authorities that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction, modification or placement of communications sites. It also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with FCC regulations. Further, in February 2012, the United States government adopted regulations requiring that local and state governments approve modifications or collocations that qualify as eligible facilities under the regulations. 

Portions of our business are subject to additional regulations, for example, in a number of states throughout the United States, certain of our subsidiaries hold Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (CLEC) or other status, in connection with the operation of our outdoor DAS networks business. In addition, we, or our tenants, may be subject to new regulatory policies in certain jurisdictions from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communications sites. 

Environmental Matters. &#32;Our U.S. and international operations are subject to various national, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the management, use, storage, disposal, emission and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances, materials and wastes and the siting of our towers. We may be required to obtain permits, pay additional property taxes, comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances or devices used to provide power such as batteries, generators and fuel at our sites. Violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctions. 

Additionally, in the United States and other international markets where we do business, before constructing a new tower or adding an antenna to an existing site, we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and whether we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment. If a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment, FCC or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed. 

Health and Safety. &#32;In the United States and in other countries where we operate, we are subject to various national, state and local laws regarding employee health and safety, including protection from radio frequency exposure. 

Competition 

We compete, both for new business and for the acquisition of assets, with other public tower companies, such as Crown Castle International Corp., SBA Communications Corporation, Telesites S.A.B. de C.V. and GTL Infrastructure Limited, wireless carrier tower consortia such as Indus Towers Limited and private tower companies, private equity sponsored firms, independent wireless carriers, tower owners, broadcasters and owners of non-communications sites, including rooftops, utility towers, water towers and other alternative structures. We believe that site location and capacity, network density, price, quality and speed of service have been, and will continue to be, significant competitive factors affecting owners, operators and managers of communications sites. 

Our services business competes with a variety of companies offering individual, or combinations of, competing services. The field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants, zoning consultants, real estate firms, right-of-way consultants, structural engineering firms, tower owners/managers, telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our tenants&#8217; personnel. We believe that our tenants base their decisions for services on various criteria, including a company&#8217;s experience, local reputation, price and time for completion of a project. 

Customer Demand 

Our strategy is predicated on the belief that wireless service providers will continue to invest in the coverage, quality and capacity of their networks in both our U.S. and international markets, driving demand for our communications sites. 

&#8226; 

U.S. wireless network investments. &#32;According to industry data, aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the United States has averaged over $30 billion, resulting in consistent demand for our sites. Demand for our U.S. communications sites is driven by: 

&#8226; 

Increasing wireless data usage, which continues to incentivize wireless service providers to focus on network quality and make incremental investments in the coverage and capacity of their networks; 

&#8226; 

Subscriber adoption of advanced wireless data applications such as mobile Internet and video, increasingly advanced devices and the corresponding deployments and densification of advanced networks by wireless service providers to satisfy this incremental demand for high-bandwidth wireless data; 

&#8226; 

Deployment of newly acquired spectrum; and 

&#8226; 

Deployment of wireless and backhaul networks by new market entrants. 

As consumer demand for and use of advanced wireless services in the United States grow, wireless service providers may be compelled to deploy new technology and equipment, further increase the cell density of their existing networks and expand their network coverage. 

&#8226; 

International (Asia, EMEA and Latin America) wireless network investments. &#32;The wireless networks in most of our international markets are typically less advanced than those in our U.S. market with respect to the density of voice networks and the current technologies generally deployed for wireless services. Accordingly, demand for our international communications sites is primarily driven by: 

&#8226; 

Incumbent wireless service providers investing in existing voice networks to improve or expand their coverage and increase capacity; 

&#8226; 

In certain of our international markets, increasing subscriber adoption of wireless data applications, such as email, Internet and video; 

&#8226; 

Spectrum auctions, which result in new market entrants, as well as initial and incremental data network deployments; and 

&#8226; 

The increasing availability of lower cost smartphones internationally. 

We believe demand for our communications sites will continue as wireless service providers seek to increase the quality, coverage area and capacity of their existing networks, while also investing in next generation data networks. To meet these network objectives, we believe wireless carriers will continue to outsource their communications site infrastructure needs as a means to accelerate network development and more efficiently use their capital, rather than construct and operate their own communications sites and maintain their own communications site operation and development capabilities. In addition, because our services operations are complementary to our property business, we believe demand for our services will continue, consistent with industry trends. 

Demand for our communications sites could be negatively impacted by an increase in network sharing or consolidation among our tenants, as set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;If our tenants share site infrastructure to a significant degree or consolidate or merge, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.&#8221; In addition, the emergence and growth of new technologies could reduce demand for our sites, as set forth under the caption &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;New technologies or changes in a tenant&#8217;s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues.&#8221; Further, our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications sites. 

&#32;Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed 3,371 full-time individuals and consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.
