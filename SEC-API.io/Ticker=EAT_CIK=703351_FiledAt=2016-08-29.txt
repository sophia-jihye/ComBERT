We completed the acquisition of Maggiano&#8217;s in August 1995. 

Restaurant Brands 

Chili&#8217;s Grill &#38; Bar 

Chili&#8217;s, a recognized leader in the Bar &#38; Grill category of casual dining, has been operating restaurants for over 40 years. Chili&#8217;s also enjoys a global presence with locations in 31 countries and two U.S. territories around the world. Whether domestic or international, company-owned or franchised, Chili&#8217;s and its more than 100,000 team members are dedicated to delivering fresh, high-quality food with a unique point of view, as well as dining experiences that make people feel special. Chili&#8217;s menu features Fresh Mex and Fresh Tex favorites including signature items such as slow-smoked baby back ribs, craft burgers, fajitas, and our famous bottomless chips &#38; salsa paired with tableside guacamole. This year, Chili's expanded upon its Fresh Tex and Fresh Mex menu platforms by introducing items like sizzling steaks and burritos. The all-day menu offers guests a generous selection of appetizers, entrees and desserts at affordable prices. Weekday lunch combos are also available enabling guests to pick their favorite lunch portion at an affordable price. Chili&#8217;s also offers a full selection of alcoholic beverages, but is known for its signature margaritas and new craft beer offerings. For guests seeking convenience, Chili&#8217;s To Go menu is available to order online, through the brand&#8217;s mobile app or by calling the restaurant. Convenience is also available for the in-restaurant guests with our tabletop devices allowing guests to order and re-order items, pay-at-the-table and enjoy entertainment offerings. 

During the year ended June 29, 2016 , at our company-owned restaurants, entr&#233;e selections ranged in menu price from $6.00 to $18.99. The average revenue per meal, including alcoholic beverages, was approximately $14.78 per person. During this same year, food and non-alcoholic beverage sales constituted approximately 85.9% of Chili&#8217;s total restaurant revenues, with alcoholic beverage sales accounting for the remaining 14.1%. Our average annual sales volume per Chili&#8217;s restaurant during this same year was $3.0 million. 

Maggiano&#8217;s Little Italy 

Maggiano&#8217;s is a full-service, national, casual dining Italian restaurant brand with a passion for making people feel special. The exterior of each Maggiano&#8217;s restaurant varies to reflect local architecture; however, the interior of all locations transport our guests back to a classic Italian-American restaurant in the style of New York&#8217;s Little Italy in the 1940s. Our Maggiano&#8217;s restaurants feature individual and family-style menus, and most of our restaurants also have extensive banquet facilities designed to host large party business or social events. We have a full lunch and dinner menu offering chef-prepared, classic Italian-American fare in the form of appetizers, entr&#233;es with bountiful portions of pasta, chicken, seafood, veal and prime steaks, and desserts. Our Maggiano&#8217;s restaurants also offer a full range of alcoholic beverages, including a selection of Handcrafted Classic Cocktails and premium wines. In addition, Maggiano&#8217;s offers a full carryout menu as well as local delivery services. 

During the year ended June 29, 2016 , entr&#233;e selections ranged in menu price from $13.95 to $42.50. The average revenue per meal, including alcoholic beverages, was approximately $27.00 per person. During this same year, food and non-alcoholic beverage sales constituted approximately 84.0% of Maggiano&#8217;s total restaurant revenues, with alcoholic beverage sales accounting for the remaining 16.0%. Sales from events at our banquet facilities made up 18.3% of Maggiano's total restaurant revenues for the year. Our average annual sales volume per Maggiano&#8217;s restaurant during this same year was $8.4 million. 

Business Strategy 

We are committed to strategies and initiatives that we believe are centered on growing long-term sales, increasing profits, enhancing the guest experience and engaging team members. These strategies are intended to differentiate our brands from the competition, reduce the costs associated with managing our restaurants and establish a strong presence for our brands in key markets around the world. 

Growing sales and guest traffic continues to be a challenge because of increased competition, heavy discounting in the restaurant industry and recent economic pressures in certain oil producing states. U.S. economic growth has been steady, but wage growth has been slow. This wage pressure has challenged both casual dining restaurant operators and consumers because discretionary income available for restaurant visits has been limited. In response to these economic factors, we have developed both short and long-term strategies that we believe are appropriate for all operating conditions and that will provide a solid foundation for earnings growth going forward. 

We have completed a number of significant initiatives in recent years which we believe will help us drive profitable sales and guest traffic growth and improve the guest experience in our restaurants. Investments in restaurant reimages, new kitchen equipment and operations software have improved the relevance of our brands and the efficiency of our restaurants. We believe that these initiatives have positively impacted the guest perception of our restaurants in both the dining room and bar areas and provide us with a great foundation for continued success. 

We have also differentiated the Chili&#8217;s brand by leveraging technology initiatives to create a digital guest experience that we believe will help us engage our guests more effectively and drive guest traffic. All domestic Chili&#8217;s restaurants, with the exception of airport and college locations, are now outfitted with tabletop devices, which gives us the largest network of tabletop devices in the country. The Ziosk &#174; &#32;branded tabletop device is a multi-functional device which provides ordering, guest survey and pay-at-the-table capabilities; loyalty program functionality; and entertainment. We also plan to leverage our tabletop devices to enable our partnership with Plenti&#174;, a consumer rewards program including a coalition of major national brands. We believe the integration of the My Chili&#8217;s Rewards program with Plenti will allow us to drive sales and profits. We are also investing in a new online ordering system that expands our current capabilities and gives our guests greater control of their experience. We plan to launch the Plenti and online ordering platforms in the first half of fiscal 2017. We have also launched Nowait&#174;, a new application which allows our hosts to provide more accurate wait times when a guest arrives during peak shifts and to send them a text when their table is ready. Guests can also add themselves to the wait list via the Chili&#8217;s mobile app, which we believe will reduce wait times spent in our restaurants. The application also enables our hosts to optimize available seating to increase the efficiency of our restaurants. 

We continually evaluate our menu at Chili's to improve quality, freshness and value by introducing new items and improving existing favorites. Our Fresh Mex platform has been successful and includes Fresh Mex bowls, mix and match fajitas, and tableside guacamole. We leveraged this success by launching our Top-Shelf Taco category, including pork carnitas, ranchero chicken and prime rib tacos. Our Texas-themed Fresh Tex platform features ribs, steaks and burgers, and our traditional burger menu now features craft burgers with fresh potato buns and house made garlic pickles. 

We refreshed our value proposition to drive sales and guest traffic in the fourth quarter with a limited time offer for a baby back rib entr&#233;e featuring new rib flavors, fries and a dessert at a $10.99 price point. We have also enhanced our value proposition in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with a limited time offer for a classic burger, salad and dessert for just $10.00. We are also promoting happy hour offerings with margaritas and a new line of craft beers featuring regional and national favorites. We continually seek opportunities to reinforce value and create interest for the Chili's brand with new and varied offerings to further enhance sales and drive incremental traffic. We are committed to offering a compelling everyday menu that provides items our guests prefer at a solid value. 

We expect that improvements at Chili's will have the most significant impact on our business; however, our results will also benefit through additional contributions from Maggiano's and our global business. Maggiano's opened two restaurants this year, one of which is a new prototype with a flexible dining area that may be used for banquets or opened up for general seating. This new prototype allows the brand to enter new markets for which the prior model was not suited, but still accommodate smaller banquets. Maggiano's is committed to delivering high quality food and a dining experience in line with our brand heritage. We will continue to strengthen the brand&#8217;s business model with kitchen efficiency and inventory controls that we believe will continue to enhance profitability. 

At the beginning of fiscal 2016 , we capitalized on an opportunity to further expand our domestic business by acquiring a franchisee which owned 103 Chili&#8217;s restaurants primarily located in the Northeast and Southeast United States. We believe this acquisition fits well within our capital allocation strategy and has enabled us to grow our sales and profits in fiscal 2016 . Our global Chili's business continues to grow with locations in 31 countries and two U.S. territories. Our international franchisees opened 36 new restaurants this year. We continue to work with domestic and international franchisees to grow our franchise operations, which we believe will increase earnings through increased royalties and franchise fees. 

Company Development 

Over the past fiscal year we continued the expansion of our restaurant brands domestically through a select number of new company-owned restaurants in strategically desirable markets. We concentrate on the development of certain identified markets to achieve the necessary levels to improve our competitive position, marketing potential, profitability and return on invested capital. Our domestic expansion efforts focus not only on major metropolitan areas in the United States but also on smaller market areas and non-traditional locations (such as airports and universities) that can adequately support our restaurant brands. For smaller market areas, we have developed a newer smaller prototype building that allows us to expand into these markets and serve our guests while maintaining a focus on profitability and return on invested capital. 

The restaurant site selection process is critical, and we devote significant effort to the investigation of new locations utilizing a variety of sophisticated analytical techniques. Our process evaluates a variety of factors, including: trade area demographics, such as target population density and household income levels; physical site characteristics, such as visibility, accessibility and traffic volume; relative proximity to activity centers, such as shopping centers, hotel and entertainment complexes and office buildings; and supply and demand trends, such as proposed infrastructure improvements, new developments and existing and potential competition. Members of each brand&#8217;s executive team inspect, review and approve each restaurant site prior to its lease or acquisition for that brand. 

The specific rate at which we are able to open new restaurants is determined, in part, by our success in locating satisfactory sites, negotiating acceptable lease or purchase terms, securing appropriate local governmental permits and approvals, and by our capacity to supervise construction and recruit and train management and hourly team members. 

The following table illustrates the system-wide restaurants opened in fiscal 2016 &#32;and the planned openings in fiscal 2017:

We periodically re-evaluate company-owned restaurant sites to ensure attributes have not deteriorated below our minimum standards. In the event site deterioration occurs, each brand makes a concerted effort to improve the restaurant&#8217;s performance by providing physical, operating and marketing enhancements unique to each restaurant&#8217;s situation. If efforts to restore the restaurant&#8217;s performance to acceptable minimum standards are unsuccessful, the brand considers relocation to a proximate, more desirable site, or evaluates closing the restaurant if the brand&#8217;s measurement criteria, such as return on investment and area demographic trends, do not support relocation. We closed seven company-owned restaurants in fiscal 2016 . We perform a comprehensive analysis that examines restaurants not performing at a required rate of return. These closed restaurants were generally performing below our standards or were near or at the expiration of their lease terms. If local market conditions warrant, we also opportunistically evaluate company-owned restaurants to determine if relocation to a proximate, more desirable site will strengthen our presence in those trade areas or markets. We relocated two company-owned restaurants in fiscal 2016. Our strategic plan is targeted to 

support our long-term growth objectives, with a focus on continued development of those restaurant locations that have the greatest return potential for the Company and our shareholders. 

Franchise Development 

In addition to our development of company-owned restaurants, our restaurant brands will maintain expansion through our franchisees and joint venture partners. 

As part of our strategy to expand through our franchisees, excluding our acquisition of a domestic franchisee's restaurants at the beginning of fiscal 2016, our franchise operations (domestically and internationally) increased in fiscal 2016. The following table illustrates the percentages of franchise operations as of June 29, 2016 &#32;for the Company and by restaurant brand, respectively:

International 

We continue our international growth through development agreements with new and existing franchisees and joint venture partners, introducing Chili&#8217;s to new countries and expanding the brand within our existing markets. As of June 29, 2016 , we had 24 total development arrangements. During fiscal year 2016 , our international franchisees and joint venture partners opened 36 Chili&#8217;s restaurants. We entered into new development agreements with new and existing franchisees for development in Bangladesh, Bolivia, Chile, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Panama, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka and United Arab Emirates. 

As we develop Chili&#8217;s internationally, we will selectively pursue expansion through various means, including franchising, joint ventures and acquisitions. Our international agreements provide the vehicle for payment of development fees and franchise fees in addition to subsequent royalty fees based on the gross sales of each restaurant. We expect future agreements to remain limited to enterprises who demonstrate a proven track record as a restaurant operator and showcase financial strength that can support a multi-unit development agreement, as well as, in some instances, multi-brand operations. 

Domestic 

We remain committed to also growing our number of domestic franchised restaurants. We are accomplishing this through existing, new or renewed development and franchise obligations with new or existing franchisees. In addition, we have from time to time also sold and may sell company-owned restaurants to our franchisees (new or existing). As of June 29, 2016 , three domestic development arrangements existed. Similar to our international agreements, a typical domestic agreement provides for payment of development and initial franchise fees in addition to subsequent royalty and advertising fees based on the gross sales of each restaurant. We expect future domestic agreements to remain limited to enterprises having significant experience as restaurant operators and proven financial ability to support and develop multi-unit operations. 

During the year ended June 29, 2016 , our domestic franchisees opened seven Chili's restaurants. 

Restaurant Management 

Our Chili&#8217;s and Maggiano&#8217;s brands have separate designated teams who support each brand, including operations, finance, franchise, marketing, peopleworks and culinary. We believe these strategic, brand-focused teams foster the identities of the individual and uniquely positioned brands. To maximize efficiencies, brands continue to utilize common and shared infrastructure, including, among other services, accounting, information technology, purchasing, legal and restaurant development. 

At the restaurant level, management structure varies by brand. A typical restaurant is led by a management team including a general manager, two to six additional managers, and for Maggiano&#8217;s, an additional three to four chefs. The level of restaurant supervision depends upon the operating complexity and sales volume of individual locations. 

We believe there is a high correlation between the quality of restaurant management and the long-term success of a brand. In that regard, we encourage increased experience at all management positions through various short and long-term incentive programs, which may include equity ownership. These programs, coupled with a general management philosophy emphasizing quality of life, have enabled us to attract and retain key team members, and enjoy turnover of managers and team members that is below industry averages. 

We ensure consistent quality standards in all brands through the issuance of operations manuals covering all elements of operations and food and beverage manuals, which provide guidance for preparation of brand-formulated recipes. Routine visitation to the restaurants by all levels of supervision enforces strict adherence to our overall brand standards and operating procedures. Each brand is responsible for maintaining their operational training program. Depending on the brand, the training program typically includes a training period of two-to-three months for restaurant management trainees, as well as special training for high-potential managers. We also provide recurring management training for managers and supervisors to improve effectiveness or prepare them for more responsibility. 

Supply Chain 

Our ability to maintain consistent quality and continuity of supply throughout each restaurant brand depends upon acquiring products from reliable sources. Our approved suppliers and our restaurants are required to adhere to strict product and safety specifications established through our quality assurance and culinary programs. These requirements ensure high quality products are served in each of our restaurants. We strategically negotiate directly with major suppliers to obtain competitive prices. We also use purchase commitment contracts when appropriate to stabilize the potentially volatile pricing associated with certain commodity items. All essential products are available from pre-qualified distributors to be delivered to our restaurant brands. Additionally, as a purchaser of a variety of food products, we require our suppliers to adhere to our supplier code of conduct, which sets forth our expectation on business integrity, food safety and food ingredients, animal welfare and sustainability. Due to the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products, inventories in the restaurants, which consist primarily of food, beverages and supplies, have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to revenues. Internationally, our franchisees and joint venture operations may encounter cultural and regulatory differences resulting in variances with product specifications for international restaurant locations. 

Advertising and Marketing 

Our brands generally target the 18 to 59 year-old age group. It is our belief that these consumers value the benefits of the casual dining category for multiple meal occasions. Brinker has launched several brand initiatives aimed at making both brands more relevant for today's evolving consumer. In doing so, we focus on the largest opportunity segment "Switchers", who are heavy users of casual dining, but are not loyal to any one brand. We engage with our target groups through a mix of national television, digital advertising, database and direct marketing, and social media, with each of our restaurant brands utilizing one or more of these mediums to meet our communication strategies and budget. 

Our franchise agreements generally require advertising contributions to us by the franchisees. We use these contributions, in conjunction with company funds, for the purpose of retaining advertising agencies, obtaining consumer insights, developing and producing brand-specific creative materials and purchasing national or regional media to meet the brand&#8217;s strategy. Some franchisees also spend additional amounts on local advertising. Any such local advertising must first be approved by us. 

Team Members 

As of June 29, 2016 , we employed approximately 58,335 team members, of which 617 were restaurant support center personnel in Dallas, and 4,531 were restaurant regional and area directors, managers, or trainees. The remaining 53,187 were employed in non-management restaurant positions. Our executive officers have an average of 21 years of experience in the restaurant industry. 

We have a positive team member relations outlook and continue to focus on improving our team member turnover rate. We have a variety of tools and strong resources in place to help us recruit and retain the best talent to work in our restaurants. 

The majority of our team members, outside of restaurant management and restaurant support center personnel, are paid on an hourly basis. We stand firm in the belief that we provide competitive working conditions and wages favorable with other companies in our industry. Our team members are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements. 

Trademarks 

We have registered or have pending, among other marks, &#8220;Brinker International&#8221;, &#8220;Chili&#8217;s&#8221;, &#8220;Chili&#8217;s Bar &#38; Bites&#8221;, &#8220;Chili's Express&#8221;, &#8220;Chili&#8217;s Margarita Bar&#8221;, &#8220;Chili&#8217;s Southwest Grill &#38; Bar&#8221;, &#8220;Chili&#8217;s Too&#8221;, &#8220;Maggiano&#8217;s&#8221;, and &#8220;Maggiano&#8217;s Little Italy&#8221;, as trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
