 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

General 

We are an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company focused on the exploration, exploitation, acquisition and production of natural gas, natural gas liquids and crude oil in the United States. Our corporate strategy is to internally identify prospects, acquire lands encompassing those prospects and evaluate those prospects using subsurface geology and geophysical data and exploratory drilling. Using this strategy, we have developed an oil and natural gas portfolio of proved reserves, as well as development and exploratory drilling opportunities on high potential conventional and unconventional oil and natural gas prospects. Our principal properties are located in the Utica Shale primarily in Eastern Ohio and along the Louisiana Gulf Coast in the West Cote Blanche Bay, or WCBB, and Hackberry fields. In addition, we have an interest in producing properties in the Niobrara Formation of Northwestern Colorado and the Bakken Formation. We also hold a significant acreage position in the Alberta oil sands in Canada through our interest in Grizzly Oil Sands ULC, or Grizzly, and an interest in an entity that operates in the Phu Horm gas field in Thailand. We seek to achieve reserve growth and increase our cash flow through our annual drilling programs. 

&#32;As of February 10, 2016 , we held leasehold interests in approximately 244,000 gross (237,000 net) acres in the Utica Shale primarily in Eastern Ohio, including approximately 24,000 net acres acquired in our purchase of Paloma Partners III, LLC, or Paloma, and approximately 35,000 net acres acquired from American Energy-Utica, LLC (now known as Ascent Resources Utica, LLC), or AEU, in each case during the second quarter of 2015. We spud our first well, the Wagner 1-28H, on our Utica Shale acreage in February 2012 and, as of December 31, 2015 , had spud 219 gross wells (including wells from our AEU acquisition), 165 of which were completed and were producing. In 2015 , we spud 49 gross (38.4 net) wells, of which ten were completed as producing wells, 36 were in various stages of completion and, as of December 31, 2015 , three were still being drilled. We commenced sales from 55 gross wells (50.2 net wells) in the Utica Shale during 2015 . During 2016 &#32;(through February 10, 2016 ), we had spud four gross (2.2 net) wells. As of February 10, 2016 , one well was waiting on completion and three were still drilling. In addition, 25 gross (7.3 net) wells were drilled by other operators on our Utica Shale acreage during 2015 . 

We currently intend to drill 29 to 32 gross (19 to 21 net) horizontal wells, and commence sales from 44 to 48 gross (28 to 30 net) horizontal wells on our Utica Shale acreage in 2016 &#32;for an estimated aggregate cost of $219.0 million to $247.0 million. We currently anticipate 17 to 19 gross (two to three net) horizontal wells will be drilled, and sales commenced from 30 to 34 gross (eight to nine net) horizontal wells, by other operators on our Utica Shale acreage during 2016 &#32;for an estimated net cost to us of $90.0 million to $100.0 million. 

&#32;&#32;Aggregate net production from our Utica Shale acreage during the three months ended December 31, 2015 &#32;was approximately 57,381 net million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent, or MMcfe, or 623.7 MMcfe per day, of which 85% was from natural gas and 15% was from oil and natural gas liquids, or NGLs. During January 2016 , our average daily net production from the Utica Shale was approximately 586.9 &#32;MMcfe, of which 86% &#32;was from natural gas and 14% &#32;was from oil and NGLs. 

In 2015 , at our WCBB field, we recompleted 35 gross and net wells and spud no new wells. In the fourth quarter of 2015 , production at WCBB was approximately 1,363 MMcfe, or an average of 14.8 MMcfe per day, of which 97% was from oil and 3% was from natural gas. During January 2016 , our average net daily production at WCBB was approximately 13.1 &#32;MMcfe, 100% &#32;of which was from oil. 

In 2015 , at our East Hackberry field, we recompleted 37 gross and net wells and spud no new wells. In the fourth quarter of 2015 , net production at East Hackberry was approximately 315.8 MMcfe, or an average of 3.4 MMcfe per day, of which 94% was from oil and 6% was from natural gas. During January 2016 , our average net daily production at East Hackberry was approximately 4.6 &#32;MMcfe, of which 96% &#32;was from oil and 4% &#32;was from natural gas. 

In 2015 , at our West Hackberry field, we had no recompletions and spud no new wells. In the fourth quarter of 2015 , net production at West Hackberry was approximately 45.1 MMcfe, or an average of 489.9 Mcfe per day, of which 94% was from oil and 6% was from natural gas. During January 2016 , our average net daily production at West Hackberry was approximately 685.5 &#32;Mcfe, of which 99% &#32;was from oil and 1% &#32;was from natural gas. 

We currently estimate our 2016 &#32;activities in our Southern Louisiana fields to be approximately $26.0 million to $28.0 million in aggregate for maintenance capital activities. 

Index to Financial Statements 

As of December 31, 2015 , we held leasehold interests in approximately 5,000 net acres in the Niobrara Formation in Northwestern Colorado. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , there were no wells spud on our Niobrara Formation acreage. In the fourth quarter of 2015 , net production from our Niobrara Formation acreage was approximately 29.1 MMcfe, or an average of 315.9 Mcfe per day, 100% of which was from oil. During January 2016 , our average net daily production from our Niobrara Formation acreage was approximately 292.5 &#32;Mcfe, 100% &#32;of which was from oil.

Utica Shale (primarily in Eastern Ohio) 

Location and Land 

As of December 31, 2015 , we held leasehold interests in approximately 240,000 gross (234,000 net) acres in the Utica Shale. 

Area History 

The Ohio Department of Natural Resources reported that in the Utica Shale in Ohio, as of January 2, 2016 , there were 1,126 producing horizontal wells, 403 horizontal wells that had been drilled but were not yet completed or connected to a pipeline, 12 horizontal wells that were being drilled and an additional 447 horizontal wells that had been permitted. 

Geology 

The Utica Shale is located in the Appalachian Basin of the United States and Canada. The Utica Shale is a rock unit comprised of organic-rich calcareous black shale that was deposited about 440 million to 460 million years ago during the Late Ordovician period. It overlies the Trenton Limestone and is located a few thousand feet below the Marcellus Shale. 

Recently, the application of horizontal drilling, combined with multi-staged hydraulic fracturing to create permeable flow paths from shale units into wellbores, has resulted in increased drilling activity and production in the Devonian-age Marcellus Shale and the Ordovician-age Utica Shale in the Appalachian Basin states of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Southern New York and Eastern Ohio. This proven technology has potential for application in other shale units which extend across much of the Appalachian Basin region. 

The Utica Shale is estimated to be thicker and more geographically extensive than the Marcellus Shale. The source rock portion of the Utica Shale underlies portions of Kentucky, Maryland, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, West Virginia and Virginia in the United States and is also present beneath parts of Lake Ontario, Lake Erie and Ontario, Canada. Throughout this area, the Utica Shale ranges in thickness from less than 100 feet to over 500 feet. There is a general thinning from east to west. 

The Utica Shale is also significantly deeper than the Marcellus Shale. In some parts of Pennsylvania, the Utica Shale is estimated to be over two miles below sea level and up to 7,000 feet below the Marcellus Shale. However, the depth of the Utica Shale decreases to the west into Ohio and to the northwest under the Great Lakes and into Canada to less than 2,000 feet below sea level. 

The Utica Shale is estimated to have higher carbonate and lower clay mineral content than the Marcellus Shale. The difference in mineralogy generally produces a different response to hydraulic fracturing treatments. Operators in the Utica play continue to refine completions techniques to optimize productivity. 

Facilities 

There are standard land oil and natural gas processing facilities in the Utica Shale. Our facilities located at well site pads include storage tank batteries, oil/gas/water separation equipment, vapor recovery units, line heaters, compression emission control devices and applicable metering.

Recent and Future Activities 

We spud our first well, the Wagner 1-28H, on our Utica Shale acreage in February 2012 and, as of December 31, 2015 , had spud 219 gross wells (including wells from our AEU acquisition), 165 of which were completed and were producing. In 2015 , we spud 49 gross (38.4 net) wells, of which ten were completed as producing wells, 36 were in various stages of completion and, as of December 31, 2015 , three were still being drilled. We commenced sales from 55 gross wells (50.2 net wells) in the Utica Shale during 2015 . During 2016 &#32;(through February 10, 2016 ), we had spud four gross (2.2 net) wells of which one was waiting on completion and three were still drilling. In addition, 25 gross (7.3 net) wells were drilled by other operators on our Utica Shale acreage during 2015 . 

We currently intend to drill 29 to 32 gross (19 to 21 net) horizontal wells, and commence sales from 44 to 48 gross (28 to 30 net) horizontal wells, on our Utica Shale acreage in 2016 &#32;for an estimated aggregate cost of $219.0 million to $247.0 million. We currently anticipate 17 to 19 gross (two to three net) horizontal wells will be drilled, and sales commenced from 30 to 34 gross (eight to nine net) horizontal wells, by other operators on our Utica Shale acreage during 2016 &#32;for an estimated net cost to us of $90.0 million to $100.0 million. As of February 10, 2016 , we had three operated horizontal rigs drilling in the play. 

Production Status 

&#160; 

&#32;&#32;Aggregate net production from our Utica Shale acreage during the three months ended December 31, 2015 &#32;was approximately 57,381 MMcfe, or 623.7 MMcfe per day, of which 85% was from natural gas and 15% was from oil and NGLs. During January 2016 , our average daily net production from the Utica Shale was approximately 586.9 &#32;MMcfe, of which 86% &#32;was from natural gas and 14% &#32;was from oil and NGLs. The slight decrease in January 2016 &#32;production was the result of our decision to temporarily curtail our production beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

West Cote Blanche Bay Field 

Location and Land 

The WCBB field is located approximately five miles off the coast of Louisiana in a shallow bay with water depths averaging eight to ten feet. We own a 100% working interest (80.108% net revenue interest, or NRI), and are the operator, in depths above the base of the 13900 Sand which is located at 11,320 feet. In addition, we own a 40.40% non-operated working interest (29.95% NRI) in depths below the base of the 13900 Sand, which is operated by Chevron Corporation. Our leasehold interests at WCBB contain 5,668 gross acres. 

Area History and Production 

Texaco, now Chevron Corporation, drilled the discovery well in this field in 1940 based on a seismic and gravitational anomaly. WCBB was subsequently developed on an even 160-acre pattern for much of the remainder of the decade. Developmental drilling continued and reached its peak in the 1970s when over 300 wells were drilled in the field. Of the 1,077 wells drilled as of December 31, 2015 , 973 were completed as producing wells. From the date of our acquisition of WCBB in 1997 through December 31, 2015 , we drilled 265 new wells, 233 of which were productive, for an 88% success rate. As of December 31, 2015 , estimated field cumulative gross production was 197.9 MMBO and 237.1 Bcf of gas. Of the 1,077 wells drilled in WCBB as of December 31, 2015 , 96 were producing, 202 were shut-in, two were producing intermittently, and six were being used as salt water disposal wells. The other 771 wells have been plugged and abandoned. 

Geology 

WCBB overlies one of the largest salt dome structures on the Gulf Coast. The field is characterized by a piercement salt dome, which created traps from the Pleistocene through the Miocene formations. The relative movements affected deposition and created a complex system of fault traps. The compensating fault sets generally trend northwest to southeast and are intersected by sets having a major radial component. Later-stage movement caused extension over the dome and a large graben system (a downthrown area bounded by normal faults) was formed. 

There are over 100 distinct sandstone reservoirs recognized throughout most of the field, and nearly 200 major and minor discrete intervals have been tested. Within the 1,077 wells that had been drilled in the field as of December 31, 2015 , over 4,000 potential zones have been penetrated. These sands are highly porous and permeable reservoirs primarily with a strong water drive. 

Index to Financial Statements 

WCBB is a structurally and stratigraphically complex field. All of the proved undeveloped, or PUD, locations at WCBB are adjacent to faults and abut at least one fault. Our drilling programs are designed to penetrate each PUD trap with a new wellbore in a structurally optimum position, usually very close to the fault seal. The majority of these wells have been, and new wells drilled in connection with our drilling programs will be, directionally drilled using steering tools and downhole motors. The tolerance for error in getting near the fault is low, so the complex faulting does introduce the risk of crossing the fault before encountering the zone of interest, which could result in part or all of the zone being absent in the borehole. This, in turn, can result in lower than expected or no reserves for that zone. The new wellbores eliminate the mechanical risk associated with trying to produce the zone from an old existing wellbore, while the wellbore locations are selected in an effort to more efficiently drain each reservoir. The vast majority of the PUD targets are up-dip offsets to wells that produced from a sub-optimal position within a particular zone. 

Facilities 

We own and operate a production facility at WCBB that includes four production tank batteries, seven natural gas compressors, a storage barge facility, a dock, a dehydration unit and a salt water disposal system. 

Recent Activity 

In 2015 , at our WCBB field, we recompleted 35 gross and net wells and spud no new wells. As of February 10, 2016 , we had recompleted six gross and net wells during 2016 &#32;in our WCBB field. 

Production Status 

In the fourth quarter of 2015 , our net production at WCBB was approximately 1,363 MMcfe, or an average of 14.8 MMcfe per day, of which 97% was from oil and 3% was from natural gas. During January 2016 , our average net daily production at WCBB was approximately 13.1 &#32;MMcfe, 100% &#32;of which was from oil. The slight decrease in average net daily production in January 2016 was due to normal production declines. 

East Hackberry Field 

Location and Land 

The East Hackberry field in Louisiana is located along the western shore and the land surrounding Lake Calcasieu, 15 miles inland from the Gulf of Mexico. We own a 100% working interest (approximately 79.91% average NRI) in certain producing oil and natural gas properties situated in the East Hackberry field. As of December 31, 2015 , we held beneficial interests in approximately 4,116 acres, including the Erwin Heirs Block, which is located on land, and the adjacent State Lease 50 Block, which is located primarily in the shallow waters of Lake Calcasieu. We licensed approximately 54 square miles of 3-D seismic data covering a portion of the area and have received a processed version of the seismic data. 

Area History and Production 

The East Hackberry field was discovered in 1926 by Gulf Oil Company, now Chevron Corporation, by a gravitational anomaly survey. The massive shallow salt stock presented an easily recognizable gravity anomaly indicating a productive field. Initial production began in 1927 and has continued to the present. The estimated cumulative oil and condensate production through 2015 &#32;was over 4,425 MBO and 331.9 Bcf of casinghead gas production. A total of 269 wells have been drilled on our portion of the field. As of December 31, 2015 , 21 wells had daily production, 125 were shut-in and three had been converted to salt water disposal wells. The remaining 120 wells had been plugged and abandoned. 

Geology 

The Hackberry field is a major salt intrusive feature, elliptical in shape as opposed to a classic &#8220;dome,&#8221; divided into east and west field entities by a saddle. Structurally, our East Hackberry acreage is located on the eastern end of the Hackberry salt ridge. There are over 30 pay zones at this field. The salt intrusion formed a series of structurally complex and steeply dipping fault blocks in the Lower Miocene and Oligocene age rocks. These fault blocks serve as traps for hydrocarbon accumulation. Our wells currently produce from perforations found between 5,100 and 12,200 feet. 

Index to Financial Statements 

Facilities 

We have a field office that serves both the East and West Hackberry fields. In addition, we own and operate three production facilities at East Hackberry that include two land based tank batteries, a production barge, three natural gas compressors, dehydration units and salt water disposal systems. 

Recent Activity 

During 2015 &#32;at East Hackberry, we recompleted 37 gross and net wells and spud no new wells. As of February 10, 2016 , we had recompleted two gross and net wells during 2016 &#32;in our East Hackberry field. 

Production Status 

In the fourth quarter of 2015 , our net production at East Hackberry was approximately 315.8 MMcfe, or an average of 3.4 MMcfe per day, of which 94% was from oil and 6% was from natural gas. During January 2016 , our average net daily production at East Hackberry was approximately 4.6 &#32;MMcfe, of which 96% &#32;was from oil and 4% &#32;was from natural gas. The slight increase in production in January 2016 is a result of our 2016 recompletion activities. 

West Hackberry Field 

Location and Land 

The West Hackberry field is located on land and is five miles west of Lake Calcasieu in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, approximately 85 miles west of Lafayette and 15 miles inland from the Gulf of Mexico. We own a 100% working interest (approximately 80.00% NRI) in 1,192 acres within the West Hackberry field. Our leases at West Hackberry are located within two miles of one of the United States Department of Energy's Strategic Petroleum Reserves. 

Area History 

The first discovery well at West Hackberry was drilled in 1938 and the field was developed by Superior Oil Company, now ExxonMobil Corporation, between 1938 and 1988. The estimated cumulative oil and condensate production through 2015 &#32;was 452 MBO and 140 Bcf of natural gas. As of December 31, 2015 , 41 wells had been drilled on our portion of West Hackberry. As of December 31, 2015 , five of such wells were producing, eight were shut-in and one had been converted to a saltwater disposal well. The remaining 27 wells have been plugged and abandoned. 

Geology 

Structurally, our West Hackberry acreage is located on the western end of the Hackberry salt ridge. There are over 30 pay zones at this field. West Hackberry consists of a series of fault-bounded traps in the Oligocene-age Vincent and Keough sands associated with the Hackberry Salt Ridge. Recoveries from these thick, porous, water-drive reservoirs have resulted in per well cumulative production of almost 700 MBOE. 

Recent Activity 

During 2015 &#32;at West Hackberry, we had no recompletions and spud no new wells. We do not anticipate drilling any wells in our West Hackberry field during 2016. 

Production Status 

In the fourth quarter of 2015 , our net production at West Hackberry was approximately 45.1 MMcfe, or an average of 489.9 Mcfe per day, of which 94% was from oil and 6% was from natural gas. During January 2016 , our average net daily production at West Hackberry was approximately 685.5 &#32;Mcfe, of which 99% &#32;was from oil and 1% &#32;was from natural gas. 

Facilities 

We own and operate a production facility at West Hackberry that includes a land based tank battery and salt water disposal system.

Niobrara Formation (Northwestern Colorado) 

Location and Land 

Effective as of April 1, 2010, we acquired leasehold interests in the Niobrara Formation in Northwestern Colorado and, as of December 31, 2015 , we held leases for approximately 5,000 net acres. In 2015 , no wells were spud on our Niobrara Formation acreage. 

Area History 

The Niobrara Formation is a shale oil rock formation located in Colorado, Northwest Kansas, Southwest Nebraska, and Southeast Wyoming. Oil and natural gas can be found at depths of 3,000 to 14,000 feet and is drilled both vertically and horizontally. The Upper Cretaceous Niobrara Formation has emerged as another potential crude oil resource play in various basins throughout the northern Rocky Mountain region. As with most resource plays, the Niobrara Formation has a history of producing through conventional technology with some of the earliest production dating back to the early 1900s. Natural fracturing has played a key role in producing the Niobrara Formation historically due to the low porosity and low permeability of the formation. Because of this, conventional production has been very localized and limited in area extent. We believe the Niobrara Formation can be produced on a more widespread basis using today's horizontal multi-stage fracture stimulation technology where the Niobrara Formation is thermally mature. 

Geology 

The Niobrara Formation oil play in Northwestern Colorado is located between the Piceance Basin to the south and the Sand Wash Basin to the north. Rocks mainly consist of interbedded organic-rich shales, calcareous shales and marlstones. It is the fractured marlstone intervals locally known as the Buck Peak, Tow Creek and Wolf Mountain benches that account for the majority of the area's production. These fractured carbonate reservoirs are associated with anticlinal, synclinal and monoclinal folds, and fault zones. This proven oil accumulation is considered to be continuous in nature and lightly explored. Source rocks are predominantly oil prone and thermally mature with respect to oil generation. The producing intervals are geologically equivalent to the Niobrara Formation reservoirs of the DJ and Powder River Basins, which are currently emerging as a major crude resource play. 

Production Status 

In the fourth quarter of 2015 , net production from our Niobrara Formation acreage was approximately 29.1 MMcfe, or an average of 315.9 Mcfe per day, 100% of which was from oil. During January 2016 , our average net daily production from our Niobrara Formation acreage was approximately 292.5 &#32;Mcfe, 100% &#32;of which was from oil. 

Facilities 

There are typical land oil and natural gas processing facilities in the Niobrara Formation. Our facilities located at well locations include storage tank batteries, oil/gas/water separation equipment and pumping units. 

Recent Activity 

There were no new wells drilled on our Niobrara Formation acreage in 2015 . We do not anticipate drilling any wells in the Niobrara Formation during 2016 . 

Bakken Formation 

Location and Land 

The Bakken Formation is located in the Williston Basin areas of Western North Dakota and Eastern Montana. As of December 31, 2015 , we held approximately 864 net acres, interests in 18 wells and overriding royalty interests in certain existing and future wells. 

Index to Financial Statements 

Production Status 

In the fourth quarter of 2015 , our net production from this acreage was approximately 94.3 MMcfe, or an average of 1.0 MMcfe per day, of which 90% was from oil and natural gas liquids and 10% was from natural gas. During January 2016 , our average daily net production from our Bakken Formation acreage was approximately 375.0 &#32;Mcfe, of which 82% &#32;was from oil and 18% &#32;was from natural gas. 

Facilities 

There are typical land, oil and natural gas processing facilities in the Williston Basin. The facilities located at well locations include storage tank batteries, oil/gas/water separation equipment and pumping units. 

Recent Activities 

There were no new wells drilled on our Bakken Formation acreage in 2015 . We do not anticipate drilling any wells in the Bakken Formation during 2016 . 

Additional Properties

Our Equity Investments 

Grizzly Oil Sands . We, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Grizzly Holdings Inc., own a 24.9% interest in Grizzly. As of December 31, 2015 , Grizzly had approximately 830,000 net acres under lease in the Athabasca, Peace River and Cold Lake oil sands regions of Alberta, Canada. Grizzly has three oil sands projects in various stages of development. Grizzly commenced commercial production from its Algar Lake Phase 1 steam-assisted gravity drainage, or SAGD, oil sand project during the second quarter of 2014 and has received regulatory approval for up to 11,300 barrels per day of bitumen production. Grizzly produced approximately 900 barrels of bitumen per day at its Algar Lake SAGD project during the first quarter of 2015. In April 2015, Grizzly determined to cease bitumen production at its Algar Lake facility due to the level of commodity prices. Grizzly continues to monitor market conditions as it assesses future plans for the facility. We reviewed our investment in Grizzly at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015 for impairment, resulting in an aggregate other than temporary impairment write down of $101.6 million &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2015. If commodity prices continue to decline, further impairment of our investment in Grizzly may result in the future. In the first quarter of 2012, Grizzly acquired the May River property comprising approximately 47,000 acres. An initial 12,000 barrel per day development application was filed with the regulatory authorities in the fourth quarter of 2013, covering the eastern portion of the May River lease. The development application continues to move through the regulatory process and is expected to be approved by early 2016. In the first quarter of 2014, a 2-D seismic program covering approximately 83 kilometers was completed to more fully define the resource over the remaining lease beyond the development application area. At the Thickwood thermal project, a development application for a 12,000 barrel per day oil sands project was filed in the fourth quarter of 2012. Since then, the Alberta Energy Regulator, or AER, announced it is implementing a policy for future regulatory requirements for reservoir containment in shallow SAGD areas, which impacts the Thickwood application. Additional work to advance the Thickwood application will be required and is expected to be addressed once the May River development approval is received. In December 2015, Grizzly suspended the review of the Thickwood application by the AER. The Thickwood application will be resubmitted once the regulations have

been updated. Grizzly has also developed delineation drilling, seismic and regulatory work plans at its Cadotte, Peace River property. Grizzly has pursued a rail marketing strategy to ensure consistent and flexible access to premium markets for its production, including its Windell truck to rail terminal located near Conklin, Alberta, which commenced transloading blended bitumen production from Algar Lake on to rail cars for delivery to the US Gulf Coast markets in the second quarter of 2014. 

Thailand . We own a 23.5% ownership interest in Tatex II. Tatex II, a privately held entity, holds an 8.5% interest in APICO, an international oil and gas exploration company. APICO has a reserve base located in Southeast Asia through its ownership of concessions covering approximately 243,000 acres which includes the Phu Horm Field. Our investment is accounted for on the equity method. Tatex II accounts for its investment in APICO using the cost method. In December 2006, first gas sales were achieved at the Phu Horm field located in northeast Thailand. Phu Horm's initial gross production was approximately 60 million cubic feet per day. For 2015, net gas production was approximately 90 MMcf per day and condensate production was 407 barrels per day. Hess Corporation, or Hess, operates the field with a 35% interest. Other interest owners include APICO (35% interest), PTT Exploration and Production Public Company Limited (20% interest) and ExxonMobil (10% interest). Our gross working interest (through Tatex II as a member of APICO) in the Phu Horm field is 0.7%. Since our ownership in the Phu Horm field is indirect and Tatex II's investment in APICO is accounted for by the cost method, these reserves are not included in our year-end reserve information. 

We own a 17.9% ownership interest in Tatex Thailand III, LLC, or Tatex III. Tatex III owns a concession covering approximately 245,000 acres in Southeast Asia. In 2009, Tatex III completed a 3-D seismic survey on this concession. Between 2010 and 2013, three wells were drilled on this concession. Each of the wells lacked sufficient permeability to produce in commercial quantities. Tatex III allowed the concession to expire in January 2015. 

Other Investments . In an effort to facilitate the development of our Utica Shale and other domestic acreage, we have invested in entities that can provide services that are required to support our operations. In 2013, we participated in the formation of Stingray Energy Services LLC, or Stingray Energy, with an initial ownership interest of 50%. Stingray Energy provides rental tools for land-based oil and natural gas drilling, completion and workover activities as well as the transfer of fresh water to wellsites. In 2012, we participated in the formation of Stingray Pressure Pumping LLC, or Stingray Pressure, Stingray Cementing LLC, or Stingray Cementing, and Stingray Logistics LLC, or Stingray Logistics, with an initial ownership interest in each entity of 50%. These entities provide well completion and other well services. In 2012, we also participated in the formation of Blackhawk Midstream LLC, or Blackhawk, and Timber Wolf Terminals LLC, or Timber Wolf, with an initial ownership interest of 50% in each entity. Blackhawk coordinates gathering, compression, processing and marketing activities in connection with the development of our Utica Shale acreage and Timber Wolf will operate a crude/condensate terminal and a sand transloading facility in Ohio. Also in 2012, we acquired a 22.5% equity interest in Windsor Midstream LLC, or Midstream, which owns a 28.4% equity interest in a gas processing plant in West Texas. In 2011 and 2012, we acquired an aggregate 40% equity interest in Bison Drilling and Field Services LLC, or Bison, which owns and operates drilling rigs and related equipment. Also in 2011, we acquired a 25% interest in Muskie Proppant LLC, or Muskie, which is engaged in the processing and sale of hydraulic fracturing grade sand. In 2014, we acquired a 25% equity interest in Sturgeon Acquisitions LLC, or Sturgeon. Sturgeon owns and operates sand mines that produce hydraulic fracturing grade sand. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we contributed our investments in Stingray Pressure, Stingray Logistics, Bison and Muskie to Mammoth Energy Partners LP, or Mammoth, in exchange for a 30.5% limited partner interest in this newly formed limited partnership. Mammoth has filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC in connection with its proposed initial public offering. Mammoth originally intended to pursue the offering in 2015; however, Mammoth continues to evaluate market conditions and the commodity price environment which will impact the timing of the proposed offering. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding these other investments. &#32; 

In February 2016, we entered into a joint venture with Rice Midstream Holdings LLC, or Rice, a subsidiary of Rice Energy Inc., to develop natural gas gathering assets in eastern Belmont County and Monroe County, Ohio, which we refer to as the dedicated areas. We own a 25% interest in the joint venture and Rice acts as operator and owns the remaining 75% interest in the joint venture. Construction of the gathering assets, which is underway, is expected to provide connectivity of our dry gas gathering systems and interchangeability of natural gas across our firm portfolio. The joint venture has completed the first phase of the projects: a lateral that connects two existing dry gas gathering systems on which we currently flow the majority of our dry gas volumes. The lateral has been commissioned and first flow commenced on February 1, 2016. In addition, we and Rice have agreed to negotiate in good faith to expand the joint venture to provide water services to us within the dedicated areas. 

&#32; Competition 

Index to Financial Statements 

The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies that have greater resources. Many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These competitors may be better positioned to take advantage of industry opportunities and to withstand changes affecting the industry, such as fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices and production, the availability of alternative energy sources and the application of government regulation. In addition, oil and natural gas compete with other forms of energy available to customers, primarily based on price. These alternate forms of energy include electricity, coal and fuel oils. Changes in the availability or price of oil and natural gas or other forms of energy, as well as business conditions, conservation, legislation, regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil and natural gas. 

Marketing and Customers 

The availability of a ready market for any oil and/or natural gas we produce depends on numerous factors beyond the control of our management, including but not limited to the demand for oil and natural gas and the level of domestic production and imports of oil, the proximity and capacity of gas pipelines, the availability of skilled labor, materials and equipment, the effect of state and federal regulation of oil and natural gas production and federal regulation of gas sold in interstate commerce. The oil and natural gas we produce in Louisiana is sold to purchasers who service the areas where our wells are located. We sell the majority of our Southern Louisiana oil to Shell Trading Company, or Shell. Shell takes custody of the oil at the outlet from our oil storage barge. Our production from WCBB is being sold in accordance with the Shell posted price for West Texas/New Mexico Intermediate crude plus or minus Platt's trade month average P+ value, plus or minus the Platt's HLS/WTI differential less transportation charges. The majority of our Utica Shale oil is sold to Shell and Marathon Petroleum Corporation, or Marathon. The purchaser takes custody at the MarkWest Utica EMG, or MarkWest, operated condensate stabilizer located near Cadiz, Ohio. Our Utica Shale NGLs are currently purchased by MarkWest which remits to us a weighted average selling price of products sold to various markets. We have NAESBs in place with various purchasers for our Utica Shale natural gas production. The majority of our gas is sold to BP Energy Company, or BP. In 2015, our Utica Shale natural gas and natural gas liquids were sold under monthly, seasonal and long term contracts and, as needed, through daily trades. The majority of purchases are transacted at the tailgate of the plants or at central delivery points with available pricing based on Platts Gas Daily - Appalachian - Dominion South Point (Dominion Eastern and Dominion Transmission) or Texas Eastern M2 Zone when sold in the Utica Basin. To maintain flow assurance and price stability, and as discussed under "&#8211; Transportation and Takeaway Capacity ," we have entered into agreements to transport a portion of our natural gas production out of the Utica Basin. These agreements have pricing based on the appropriate delivery point less transportation charges and fuel. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015 , we sold approximately 90% &#32;and 10% &#32;of our oil production to Shell and Marathon Oil Corporation, respectively, 76% &#32;and 24% &#32;of our natural gas liquids production to MarkWest and Antero Resources, respectively and 79% , 14% &#32;and 5% &#32;of our natural gas production to BP, DTE Energy Trading, Inc. and Hess, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2014 , we sold approximately 99% &#32;of our oil production to Shell, 100% &#32;of our natural gas liquids production to MarkWest and 40% , 32% &#32;and 19% &#32;of our natural gas production to BP, DTE Energy Trading, Inc. and Hess, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2013 , we sold approximately 99% &#32;of our oil production to Shell, 100% &#32;of our natural gas liquids production to MarkWest and 32% , 31% &#32;and 17% &#32;of our natural gas production to Sequent Energy Management, L.P., Hess and Interstate Gas Supply, Inc., respectively. 

As of December 31, 2015, we had an average of approximately 476,000 MMBtu per day of firm sales contracted with third parties for 2016. We had an average of approximately 349,000 MMBtu per day, 216,000 MMBtu per day, 197,000 MMBtu per day, 152,000 MMBtu per day and 62,000 MMBtu per day contracted with third parties for 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and thereafter, respectively. 

Transportation and Takeaway Capacity 

In Ohio, as of December 31, 2015, we had entered into firm transportation contracts to deliver approximately 725,000 MMBtu to 775,000 MMBtu per day for 2016. For 2017, we had entered into firm transportation contracts to deliver approximately 775,000 MMBtu to 1,125,000 MMBtu per day. For 2018 through 2020, we had entered into firm transportation contracts to deliver approximately 1,125,000 MMBtu per day. We continuously monitor the need to secure additional firm transportation contracts for incremental volumes from our Utica Shale acreage but expect additional contracts to be limited in 2016. Our primary long-haul firm transportation commitments include the following: 

&#8226; 

520,000 MMBtu per day of firm capacity on Dominion East Ohio, which began in 2014 and allows us to reach additional connectivity to Gulf Coast and Midwest natural gas markets;

Under firm transportation contracts, we are obligated to deliver minimum daily volumes or pay fees for any deficiencies in deliveries. We continue to actively identify and evaluate additional takeaway capacity to facilitate production growth in our Utica Basin position. 

Regulation 

Regulation of Oil and Natural Gas Production 

Oil and natural gas operations such as ours are subject to various types of legislation, regulation and other legal requirements enacted by governmental authorities. This legislation and regulation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion. Some of these requirements carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability. 

We own interests in producing oil and natural gas properties located in the Utica Shale primarily in Eastern Ohio, along the Louisiana Gulf Coast and in the Niobrara Formation in Northwestern Colorado and the Bakken Formation in Western North Dakota and Eastern Montana. The states in which our fields are located regulate the production and sale of oil and natural gas, including requirements for obtaining drilling permits, the method of developing fields and the spacing and operation of wells. In addition, regulations governing conservation matters aimed at preventing the waste of oil and natural gas resources could affect the rate of production and may include maximum daily production allowables for wells on a market demand or conservation basis. 

Index to Financial Statements 

Environmental Regulation 

Our oil and natural gas exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment or occupational health and safety. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for non-compliance. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities, limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically or seismically sensitive areas, and other protected areas, require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations, such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits, result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations or relate to our owned or operated facilities. Liability under such laws and regulations is strict (i.e., no showing of &#8220;fault&#8221; is required) and can be joint and several. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly pollution control or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our operations and financial position, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general. Our management believes that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these environmental requirements. This trend, however, may not continue in the future. 

Waste Handling . The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or RCRA, and comparable state statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder, affect oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities by imposing requirements regarding the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. With federal approval, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Although most wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA, such wastes may constitute &#8220;solid wastes&#8221; that are subject to the less stringent requirements of non-hazardous waste provisions. Moreover, the EPA or state or local governments may adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of non-hazardous wastes or categorize some non-hazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation. Indeed, legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress to re-categorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as &#8220;hazardous wastes.&#8221; Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses. 

Administrative, civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements related to waste handling, and that we hold all necessary and up-to-date permits, registrations and other authorizations to the extent that our operations require them under such laws and regulations. Although we do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes, as presently classified, to be significant, any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes. 

Remediation of Hazardous Substances . The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, also known as CERCLA or the &#8220;Superfund&#8221; law, and analogous state laws, generally imposes liability, without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a &#8220;hazardous substance&#8221; into the environment. These persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility, a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination, and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the facility. Under CERCLA and comparable state statutes, persons deemed &#8220;responsible parties&#8221; are subject to strict liability that, in some circumstances, may be joint and several, for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination), for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. In the course of our operations, we use materials that, if released, would be subject to CERCLA and comparable state statutes. Therefore, governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold us responsible under CERCLA and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such &#8220;hazardous substances&#8221; have been released.

Water Discharges . The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the &#8220;Clean Water Act,&#8221; the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Oil Pollution Act, or OPA, and analogous state laws and regulations promulgated thereunder impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other gas and oil wastes, into navigable waters of the United States, as well as state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state. The Clean Water Act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. These laws and regulations also prohibit certain activity in wetlands unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges. In addition, on April 7, 2015, the EPA published a proposed rule establishing federal pre-treatment standards for wastewater discharged from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned treatment works, or POTW, which regulations are discussed in more detail below under the caption &#8220; -Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing .&#8221; Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans, as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. 

The OPA is the primary federal law for oil spill liability. The OPA contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the United States, including the requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must develop and maintain facility response contingency plans and maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs. The OPA subjects owners of facilities to strict liability that, in some circumstances, may be joint and several for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a release, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters. 

Noncompliance with the Clean Water Act or the OPA may result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as injunctive obligations. We believe we are in material compliance with the requirements of each of these laws. 

Air Emissions . The federal Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state laws and regulations, regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements. The EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants at specified sources. New facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin, and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance. For example, on August 16, 2012, the EPA published final regulations under the federal Clean Air Act that establish new emission controls for oil and natural gas production and processing operations, which regulations are discussed in more detail below under the caption &#8220; -Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing .&#8221; These laws and regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities we own or operate, and federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable air emissions regulations and that we hold all necessary and valid construction and operating permits for our operations. Obtaining or renewing permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. 

Climate Change . In December 2009, the EPA issued an Endangerment Finding that determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases, or GHGs, present an endangerment to public health and the environment because, according to the EPA, emissions of such gases contribute to warming of the earth&#8217;s atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings by the EPA allowed the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act, including rules that regulate emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources of emissions such as power plants or industrial facilities. In response to its endangerment finding, the EPA adopted two sets of rules regarding possible future regulation of GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act. The motor vehicle rule, which became effective in July 2010, purports to limit emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles. The EPA adopted the stationary source rule, or the tailoring rule, in May 2010, and it became effective in January 2011. The tailoring rule established new GHG emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources must obtain permits under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, and Title V programs of the Clean Air Act. On June 23, 2014, in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA , the Supreme Court held that stationary sources could not become subject to PSD or Title V permitting solely by reason of their GHG emissions. The Court ruled, however, that the EPA may require installation of best available control technology for GHG emissions at sources otherwise subject to the PSD and Title V programs. On December 19, 2014, the EPA issued two memoranda providing initial guidance on GHG permitting requirements in response to 

Index to Financial Statements 

the Court&#8217;s decision in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA . In its preliminary guidance, the EPA indicated that it will undertake a rulemaking action to rescind any PSD permits issued under the portions of the tailoring rule that were vacated by the Court. In the interim, the EPA issued a narrowly crafted &#8220;no action assurance&#8221; indicating it will exercise its enforcement discretion not to pursue enforcement of the terms and conditions relating to GHGs in an EPA-issued PSD permit, and for related terms and conditions in a Title V permit. On April 30, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule allowing permitting authorities to rescind PSD permits issued under the invalid regulations. 

The EPA also adopted a GHG reporting rule in September 2009 authorizing the collection of GHG data from large emission sources across a range of industry sectors. In November 2010, the EPA expanded the GHG reporting rule to include onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities, which may include certain of our facilities, beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011. In October 2015, the EPA amended the GHG reporting rule to add the reporting of GHG emissions from gathering and boosting systems, completions and workovers of oil wells using hydraulic fracturing, and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines. 

The EPA has continued to adopt GHG regulations applicable to other industries, such as its August 2015 adoption of three separate, but related, actions to address carbon dioxide pollution from power plants, including final Carbon Pollution Standards for new, modified and reconstructed power plants, a final Clean Power Plan to cut carbon dioxide pollution from existing power plants, and a proposed federal plan to implement the Clean Power Plan emission guidelines. Upon publication of the Clean Power Plan on October 23, 2015, more than two dozen States as well as industry and labor groups challenged the Clean Power Plan in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. As a result of this continued regulatory focus, future GHG regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility. In addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Although the U.S. Congress has not adopted such legislation at this time, it may do so in the future and many states continue to pursue regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 

In December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties, or COP-21, of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake &#8220;ambitious efforts&#8221; to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of GHGs. The Agreement, if ratified, establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce GHG emissions. 

Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry. Currently, while we are subject to certain federal GHG monitoring and reporting requirements, our operations are not adversely impacted by existing federal, state and local climate change initiatives and, at this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business. 

In addition, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that GHG emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common law. As a result, private individuals may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury or property damages. While our business is not a party to this litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition. 

Moreover, there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornados and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels. Another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially colder than their historical averages. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. However, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations. 

Endangered Species Act 

Environmental laws such as the Endangered Species Act, as amended, or the ESA, may impact exploration, development and production activities on public or private lands. The ESA provides broad protection for species of fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered in the U.S., and prohibits taking of endangered species. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Federal agencies are required to insure that any action authorized, funded or carried out by them is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or modify their 

Index to Financial Statements 

critical habitat. While some of our facilities may be located in areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may identify, however, previously unidentified endangered or threatened species or may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species, which could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas. 

Occupational Safety and Health Act 

We are also subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees. In addition, OSHA&#8217;s hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the OSHA requirements. 

Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing 

Hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We use hydraulic fracturing extensively in the development of our Utica Shale acreage. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA, regulates the underground injection of substances through the Underground Injection Control, or UIC, program. Hydraulic fracturing is generally exempt from regulation under the UIC program, and the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. The EPA, however, has in the past taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the UIC program, specifically as &#8220;Class II&#8221; UIC wells. Furthermore, legislation to amend the SDWA to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of &#8220;underground injection&#8221; and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, have been proposed in recent sessions of Congress. 

In addition, on May 9, 2014, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on the development of regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. The public comment period ended on September 18, 2014. The EPA plans to develop a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking by December 2016, which would describe a proposed mechanism - regulatory, voluntary, or a combination of both - to collect data on hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures. Also, on April 7, 2015, the EPA published a proposed rule establishing federal pre-treatment standards for wastewater discharged from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to POTW. The EPA asserts that wastewater from such facilities can be generated in large quantities and can contain constituents that may disrupt POTW operations and/or be discharged, untreated, from the POTW to receiving waters. If adopted, the new pre-treatment rule would require unconventional oil and gas facilities to pre-treat wastewater before transferring it to a POTW. The public comment period ended on July 17, 2015, and the EPA is expected to publish a final rule by August 2016. The EPA is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities (also known as centralized waste treatment, or CWT, facilities) accepting oil and gas extraction wastewater. The EPA is collecting data and information related to the extent to which CWT facilities accept such wastewater, available treatment technologies (and their associated costs), discharge characteristics, financial characteristics of CWT facilities, and the environmental impacts of discharges from CWT facilities. 

On August 16, 2012, the EPA published final regulations under the federal Clean Air Act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations. Specifically, the EPA&#8217;s rule package includes NSP standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities. The final rule seeks to achieve a 95% reduction in VOCs emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or &#8220;green completions&#8221; on all hydraulically-fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. The rules also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment. The EPA received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community, and court challenges to the rules were also filed. In response, the EPA has issued, and will likely continue to issue, revised rules responsive to some of the requests for reconsideration. For example, in September 2013 and December 2014, the EPA amended its rules to extend compliance deadlines and to clarify the NSP standards. Further, on July 31, 2015, the EPA finalized two updates to the NSP standards to address the definition of low-pressure wells and references to tanks that are connected to one another (referred to as connected in parallel). In addition, on September 18, 2015, the EPA published a suite of proposed rules to reduce methane and VOC emissions from oil and gas industry, including new 

Index to Financial Statements 

&#8220;downstream&#8221; requirements covering equipment in the natural gas transmission segment of the industry that was not regulated by the 2012 rules. The public comment period closed on December 4, 2015. At this point, we cannot predict the final regulatory requirements or the cost to comply with such requirements with any certainty. 

In addition, on March 26, 2015, the Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, published a final rule governing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, implementation of a casing and cementing program, management of recovered fluids, and submission to the BLM of detailed information about the proposed operation, including wellbore geology, the location of faults and fractures, and the depths of all usable water. The rule took effect on June 24, 2015, although it is the subject of several pending lawsuits filed by industry groups and at least four states, alleging that federal law does not give the BLM authority to regulate hydraulic fracturing. On September 30, 2015, the United States District Court for Wyoming issued a preliminary injunction preventing the BLM from implementing the rule nationwide. This order has been appealed to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. Also, on January 22, 2016, the BLM announced a proposed rule to reduce the flaring, venting and leaking of methane from oil and gas operations on federal and Indian lands. The proposed rule would require operators to use currently available technologies and equipment to reduce flaring, periodically inspect their operations for leaks, and replace outdated equipment that vents large quantities of gas into the air. The rule would also clarify when operators owe the government royalties for flared gas. 

Furthermore, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and whether any meaningful results are obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory authorities. The EPA is currently evaluating the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. In June 2015, the EPA released its draft assessment report for peer review and public comment, finding that, while there are certain mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing activities could potentially impact drinking water resources, there is no evidence available showing that those mechanisms have led to widespread, systemic impacts. Also, on February 6, 2015, the EPA released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells. The report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injection-induced seismic events. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing, and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business. 

Some states and local jurisdictions in which we operate or hold oil and natural gas interests have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids. For example, in June 2012, Ohio&#8217;s Governor signed legislation mandating chemical disclosure for hydraulic fracturing fluids, pre-drilling testing of water samples within 1,500 feet of a proposed horizontal well, and increased well operator liability insurance requirements. In addition, in April 2014, Ohio&#8217;s Department of Natural Resources announced new permit conditions for drilling near faults or areas of past seismic activity. The Texas Railroad Commission, or RRC, and Louisiana Department of Natural Resources adopted rules and regulations requiring that well operators disclose the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of federal OSHA, to state regulators and on a public internet website. Also, in May 2013, the RRC adopted new rules, which became effective in January 2014, governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. Additionally, on October 28, 2014, the RRC adopted disposal well rule amendments designed, among other things, to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive non-hazardous produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the U.S. Geological Survey. These searches are intended to determine the potential of earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed new disposal well. The disposal well rule amendments, which became effective in Texas on November 17, 2014, also clarify the RRC&#8217;s authority to modify, suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity. RRC has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal wells. Effective August 26, 2011, Montana adopted hydraulic fracturing well integrity and disclosure regulations under which well operators must demonstrate a suitable and safe mechanical configuration for the proposed stimulation treatment and provide information in the drilling permit application on the estimated volume and types of materials to be used in the proposed hydraulic fracturing activities. Upon completion of the well, well operators must provide the Montana Board of Oil and Gas Conservation with the volume and type of chemicals used, including the additive type, chemical ingredient names, and Chemical Abstracts Service, or CAS, number, subject to certain trade secret protections. On April 1, 2012, the North Dakota Industrial Commission enacted regulations requiring hydraulic fracturing well operators to disclose the hydraulic fluid composition, including the trade name, supplier, ingredients, CAS Number, and the maximum ingredient concentrations of all additives in the hydraulic fracturing fluid. Colorado enacted rules requiring similar disclosures on January 30, 2012. Also, in 2013 and 2014, Colorado approved 

Index to Financial Statements 

regulations that require well operators to test groundwater quality before and after drilling and to install emission controls to capture 95 percent of VOC and methane emissions. 

There has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids, induced seismic activity, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally. A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal, state or local level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Such legislative changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal, state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing. 

Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry 

The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability, these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production. 

The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas. The interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation, including regulation of the terms, conditions and rates for interstate transportation, storage and various other matters, primarily by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC. Federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation. FERC's regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas. 

Although oil and natural gas prices are currently unregulated, Congress historically has been active in the area of oil and natural gas regulation. We cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil and natural gas might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures, and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on our operations. Sales of condensate and oil and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. 

Drilling and Production . Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local level. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The states and some counties and municipalities in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following: 

&#8226; 

the location of wells; 

&#8226; 

the method of drilling and casing wells; 

&#8226; 

the timing of construction or drilling activities, including seasonal wildlife closures; 

&#8226; 

the rates of production or &#8220;allowables&#8221;; 

&#8226; 

the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; 

&#8226; 

the plugging and abandoning of wells; and 

&#8226; 

notice to, and consultation with, surface owners and other third parties. 

Index to Financial Statements 

State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties. Some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct regulation, but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future. The effect of such future regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells, negatively affect the economics of production from these wells or to limit the number of locations we can drill. 

Federal, state and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the abandonment of wells, closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines and for site restoration in areas where we operate. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and many other state and local authorities also have regulations for plugging and abandonment, decommissioning and site restoration. Although the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers does not require bonds or other financial assurances, some state agencies and municipalities do have such requirements. 

Natural Gas Sales and Transportation . Historically, federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which we market our production. FERC has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Since 1978, various federal laws have been enacted which have resulted in the complete removal of all price and non-price controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in &#8220;first sales,&#8221; which include all of our sales of our own production. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders, including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties. 

FERC also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which we may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas and release of our natural gas pipeline capacity. Commencing in 1985, FERC promulgated a series of orders, regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas. Today, interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers, marketers and other shippers, regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company. FERC's initiatives have led to the development of a competitive, open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from third-party sellers other than pipelines. However, the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, we cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by FERC and Congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can we determine what effect, if any, future regulatory changes might have on our natural gas related activities. 

Under FERC&#8217;s current regulatory regime, transmission services are provided on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis at cost-based rates or at negotiated rates. Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA. Although its policy is still in flux, FERC has in the past reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the tendency to increase our costs of transporting gas to point-of-sale locations. 

Oil Sales and Transportation . Sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. 

Our crude oil sales are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation. FERC regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act and intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any materially different way than such regulation will affect the operations of our competitors. 

Index to Financial Statements 

Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. Under this open access standard, common carriers must offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines' published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our competitors. 

State Regulation . The states in which we operate regulate the drilling for, and the production and gathering of, oil and natural gas, including through requirements relating to the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources. States may also regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from oil and natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future. The effect of these regulations may be to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of wells or locations we can drill. 

In July 2015, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, or the ODNR, enacted a comprehensive set of rules to regulate the construction of well pads. Under these new rules, operators must submit detailed horizontal well pad site plans certified by a professional engineer for review by the ODNR Division of Oil and Gas Resources Management prior to the construction of a well pad. These rules will result in increased construction costs for operators. It is expected that the ODNR will pursue further initiatives in 2016, including additional emergency response rules. 

The petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us. 

Operational Hazards and Insurance 

The oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks, including the risk of fire, explosions, blow outs, pipe failures and, in some cases, abnormally high pressure formations which could lead to environmental hazards such as oil spills, natural gas leaks and the discharge of toxic gases. If any of these should occur, we could incur legal defense costs and could be required to pay amounts due to injury, loss of life, damage or destruction to property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations. 

In accordance with what we believe to be industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the operating risks to which our business is exposed. We insure some, but not all, of our properties for operational and hurricane related events. We currently have insurance policies that include coverage for general liability, physical damage to our oil and natural gas properties, operational control of certain wells, oil pollution, third party liability, workers compensation and employers' liability and other coverage. Our insurance coverage includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery. Additionally, our insurance is subject to exclusion and limitations, and there is no assurance that such coverage will fully or adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences, damages and losses. Any of these events could cause a significant disruption to our business. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

Currently, we have general liability insurance coverage with an annual aggregate limit of up to $21.0 million which includes sudden and accidental pollution for the effects of onshore and offshore pollution on third parties arising from our operations as well as $10.0 million of gradual pollution insurance coverage. For our offshore WCBB properties, we also have a $40.0 million property physical damage policy which insures against most operational perils, such as explosions, fire, vandalism, theft, hail and windstorms, provided, however, that this policy is limited to $12.5 million for damages arising as a result of a named windstorm. All of our insurance coverage includes deductibles of up to $250,000 per occurrence ($1.25 million in the case of a named windstorm) that must be met prior to recovery. Additionally, our insurance is subject to customary exclusions and limitations. We reevaluate the purchase of insurance, policy terms and limits annually each May. Future insurance coverage for our industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable. No assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable and we may elect to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage. We may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations. This may cause us to restrict our operations, which might severely impact our financial position. The occurrence of a significant event, not fully insured against, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

We carry control of well insurance for all of our Utica Shale wells and several Southern Louisiana wells. We also require all of our third party vendors to sign master service agreements in which they agree to indemnify us for injuries and deaths of the service provider's employees as well as contractors and subcontractors hired by the service provider. 

We have prepared and have in place spill prevention control and countermeasure plans for each of our principal facilities in response to federal and state requirements. The plans are reviewed annually and updated as necessary. As required by applicable regulations, our facilities are built with secondary containment systems to capture potential releases. We also own additional spill kits with oil booms and absorbent pads that are readily available, if needed. In addition, we have emergency response companies on retainer. These companies specialize in the clean up of hydrocarbons as a result of spills, blow-outs and natural disasters, and are on call to us 24 hours a day, seven days a week when their services are needed. We pay these companies a retainer plus additional amounts when they provide us with clean up services. Our aggregate payments for the retainer and clean up services during 2015 and 2014 were approximately $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively. While these companies have been able to meet our service needs when required from time to time in the past, it is possible that the ability of one or more of them to provide services to us in the future, if and when needed, could be hindered or delayed in the event of a widespread disaster. However, in light of the areas in which we operate and the nature of our production, we believe other companies would be available to us in the event our primary remediation companies are unable to perform. To supplement our planning and operation activities in Ohio, we also actively manage an incident response planning program and coordinate with applicable state agency personnel on spills and releases. We also participate in Ohio's Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) program, which includes reporting of various materials used or stored on-site as well as notification to state and local emergency response centers, such as local fire departments, for emergency planning purposes. 

Headquarters and Other Facilities 

We own an approximately 28,500 square foot office building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma that serves as our corporate headquarters. Additionally, we lease approximately 26,900 square feet of office space in other buildings in Oklahoma City. A new corporate headquarters is currently under construction in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The building, currently scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2016, will have approximately 120,000 square feet of office space and will allow our employees to office in one location in Oklahoma City. We have received various offers to purchase or lease our existing headquarters building which we are evaluating. 

We also own an approximately 12,500 square foot building in Lafayette, Louisiana. This building contains approximately 6,200 square feet of finished office area and 6,300 square feet of clear span warehouse area. We also lease approximately 3,700 square feet in a building in Lafayette that we use as our Louisiana headquarters. We own an approximately 5,700 square foot office building in St. Clairsville, Ohio that serves as our Ohio headquarters. In addition, we lease approximately 4,275 square feet of office space in St. Clairsville, Ohio. Each of these properties is suitable and adequate for its use. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015 , we had 230 employees. An unrelated third-party Louisiana well servicing company provides a majority of the field personnel needed to operate the WCBB and the Hackberry fields.
