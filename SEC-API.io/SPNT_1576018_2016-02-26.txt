 Item 1. Business 

Overview 

We are a holding company domiciled in Bermuda. Through our reinsurance subsidiaries, we provide specialty property and casualty reinsurance products to insurance and reinsurance companies on a worldwide basis. Our goal is to deliver attractive equity returns to our shareholders by combining profitable reinsurance underwriting with superior investment management provided by Third Point LLC, our investment manager. We believe that our reinsurance and investment strategy differentiates us from our competitors. 

Our reinsurance strategy is to be highly opportunistic and disciplined. During periods of extremely competitive or soft reinsurance market conditions, we intend to be selective with regard to the amount and type of reinsurance we write and conserve our risk-taking capital for periods when market conditions are more favorable to us from a pricing and terms and conditions perspective. 

Our management team is led by John R. Berger, a highly-respected reinsurance industry veteran with over 30 years of experience, the majority of which was spent as the principal executive officer of three successful reinsurance companies. Our management team also has significant senior leadership and underwriting experience in the reinsurance industry. We believe that our experience and longstanding relationships with our insurance and reinsurance company clients, senior reinsurance brokers, insurance regulators and rating agencies are an important competitive advantage. 

Substantially all of our investable assets are managed by our investment manager, Third Point LLC, which is wholly owned by Daniel S. Loeb, one of our founding shareholders. Third Point LLC is an SEC-registered investment adviser headquartered in New York, managing $16.1 billion in assets as of December 31, 2015 . We directly own our investments, 

&#32;2 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

which are held in separate accounts and are managed by Third Point LLC on substantially the same basis as its main hedge funds, including Third Point Partners L.P., the original Third Point LLC hedge fund. 

We were incorporated on October 6, 2011 and completed our initial capitalization transaction in December 2011 with $784.3 million of equity capital, and commenced underwriting business on January 1, 2012. Both of our operating subsidiaries have an A- (Excellent) financial strength rating from A.M. Best Company, Inc., or A.M. Best. 

In August 2013, we completed an initial public offering (&#8220;IPO&#8221;) of 24,832,484 common shares at an offering price of $12.50 per share. The net proceeds to us of the offering were $286.0 million, after deducting offering costs. Our common shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) under the symbol &#8220;TPRE&#8221;. 

In June 2012, Third Point Reinsurance Opportunities Fund Ltd. (the &#8220;Catastrophe Fund&#8221;), Third Point Reinsurance Investment Management Ltd. (the &#8220;Catastrophe Fund Manager&#8221;), and Third Point Re Cat Ltd. (the &#8220;Catastrophe Reinsurer&#8221;) were incorporated in Bermuda. In December 2014, we announced that we would no longer accept investments in the Catastrophe Fund and that no new business would be written in the Catastrophe Reinsurer. As of December 31, 2015, all investments in the Catastrophe Fund had been redeemed. In February 2016, we completed the dissolution of the Catastrophe Fund and Catastrophe Reinsurer. 

In August 2012, we established a wholly-owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom, Third Point Re Marketing (UK) Limited (&#8220;TPRUK&#8221;). In May 2013, TPRUK was licensed as an insurance intermediary by the UK Financial Conduct Authority. 

U.S. Operations 

In February 2015, we began reinsurance operations in the United States through Third Point Re USA, a Bermuda company licensed as a Class 4 insurer and a wholly owned operating subsidiary of Third Point Re (USA) Holdings Inc. (&#8220;TPRUSA&#8221;). TPRUSA is a wholly owned subsidiary of Third Point Re (UK) Holdings Ltd., a private company limited by shares organized under the laws of England and Wales and our direct wholly owned subsidiary. 

Third Point Re USA provides reinsurance products that are substantially similar to the reinsurance products provided by Third Point Re. In order to support these new reinsurance operations, Third Point Re USA has entered into a quota share reinsurance agreement with Third Point Re, pursuant to which Third Point Re has assumed 75% of premium and losses for Third Point Re USA&#8217;s portfolio of reinsurance contracts. Third Point Re USA also has entered into a Net Worth Maintenance Agreement with the Company, pursuant to which the Company has agreed to commit funds sufficient to maintain a minimum level of capital at Third Point Re USA of $250 million (the &#8220;Net Worth Maintenance Agreement&#8221;). In addition, Third Point Re USA has entered into a services agreement with the Company and Third Point Re, pursuant to which the Company and Third Point Re provide certain finance, actuarial, risk management, legal and administrative support services. 

Third Point Re USA has entered into a joint venture and investment management agreement with Third Point LLC and Third Point Advisors LLC under substantially similar terms to the investment management agreement with Third Point Re. In addition, Third Point Re USA became a party to the Founders Agreement dated as of December 22, 2011 among Third Point Re and the Company&#8217;s founders. 

Third Point Re USA&#8217;s U.S. presence is a strategic component of our overall growth strategy. As a result of Third Point Re USA&#8217;s U.S. presence, we expect to strengthen and expand our relationships with U.S. cedents and brokers. We also expect to develop a firsthand understanding of cedent underwriting and claims capabilities that will benefit our underwriting practices. 

Third Point Re USA made an election under Section 953(d) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to be taxed as a U.S. entity. Third Point Re USA prices and underwrites U.S. domiciled reinsurance business from an office in the United States. However, we believe that our current activities, notwithstanding activities conducted through Third Point Re USA, will not cause the Company or Third Point Re to be treated as engaging in a U.S. trade or business and will not cause the Company or Third Point Re to otherwise be subject to current U.S. federal income taxation on its consolidated net income. 

&#32;3 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

Segment Information 

We manage our business on the basis of two operating segments: Property and Casualty Reinsurance and Catastrophe Risk Management. We also have a corporate function that includes our investment income on capital, certain general and administrative expenses related to corporate activities, interest expense and income tax expense. For more information, see Note 22 &#32;of our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 

Reinsurance Strategy 

Our reinsurance strategy is to build a portfolio that generates stable underwriting profits, with margins commensurate with the amount of risk assumed, by opportunistically targeting sub-sectors of the market and specific situations where reinsurance capacity and alternatives may be constrained. Our management team has differentiated expertise that allows us to identify profitable reinsurance opportunities. The level of volatility in our reinsurance portfolio will be determined by market conditions, but will typically be lower than that of most other reinsurance companies. We manage reinsurance volatility by predominantly focusing on lines of business that have historically demonstrated more stable return characteristics. We seek to further manage the volatility of our reinsurance results by writing reinsurance contracts on a quota share basis, where we assume an agreed percentage of premiums and losses for a portfolio of insurance policies or reinsurance contracts. We also make use of contractual terms and conditions within our reinsurance contracts that may include individual or aggregate loss occurrence limits, which limit the dollar amount of loss that we can incur from a particular occurrence or series of occurrences within the term of the reinsurance contract; loss ratio caps, which limit the maximum loss we can incur pursuant to a contract to a defined loss ratio; sliding scale commissions that vary in accordance with the client&#8217;s performance; loss corridors, which limit the dollar amount of loss within a contract structure; and sub-limits and exclusions for specific risks not covered by a particular reinsurance contract. 

We also write reinsurance contracts that provide protection against adverse development on loss reserves where we provide an incremental amount of additional coverage limit. We typically provide coverage where we agree with the client&#8217;s reserving practices and reserve levels or where we believe there are structural or contractual safeguards in place. While these transactions are usually recorded at or close to a 100% composite ratio (combined ratio before general and administrative expenses) and therefore do not initially generate underwriting income, they produce premiums and float equal to the reserves at the inception of the contract. In some instances, the level of risk in the reserve cover contract or the risk mitigating features within the contract including limitations on the amount and timing of loss payments require us to account for the contract as a deposit liability contract. Using the deposit method of accounting, a deposit liability, rather than written premium, is initially recorded based upon the consideration received less any explicitly identified premiums or fees. In subsequent periods, the deposit liability is adjusted by calculating the effective yield on the deposit to reflect actual payments to date and future expected payments. 

We typically write larger customized reinsurance contracts that require significant interaction during the course of negotiations between the client, intermediaries and us. We take a lead underwriting position on many of our reinsurance contracts, meaning that we establish the pricing and terms and conditions of the reinsurance contract. In certain instances, we will follow terms and conditions established by our competitors if we believe the opportunity meets our return hurdles and helps us balance our reinsurance portfolio. 

Our property and casualty reinsurance operations generate excess cash flows, or float, which we track in managing our business. We believe that net investment income from float is a key part of our reinsurance strategy and an important consideration in evaluating the overall contribution of our property and casualty reinsurance operations to our consolidated results. 

Despite challenging market conditions, we have grown our underwriting portfolio as a result of the strength of our relationships with reinsurance brokers and reinsurance buyers and our ability to offer customized solutions, particularly in the area of reserve covers. Additionally, we have seen new opportunities as a result of our expansion in the U.S. through the formation of Third Point Re USA earlier in the year. As a result, we believe submission flow will remain strong. We write a small number of large contracts and, as a result, individual renewals or new business can have a significant impact on premiums recognized in a period. In addition, our contracts are subject to significant judgment in the amount of premiums that we expect to recognize. Changes in premium estimates are recorded in the period they are determined and can significantly alter the expected value of a particular reinsurance contract. We also offer customized solutions to our clients, including reserve covers, which are considered retroactive reinsurance contracts, 

&#32;4 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

on which we will not have a regular renewal opportunity. Furthermore, we record gross premiums written and earned for reserve covers at the inception of the contract. Together these factors can impact the comparability of premiums written and earned in a period and trends from period to period and year over year. 

See Note 22 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a breakdown of contracts that individually contributed more than 10% of total gross premiums written. 

We intend to grow our book of business by underwriting a mix of short to medium tail personal and commercial lines. We intend to increase our geographic spread over time by adding reinsurance programs from Europe, Asia and other regions; however, we expect that a majority of our reinsurance business will continue to be composed of U.S. exposure. See Note 22 &#32;to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a breakdown of gross premiums written by domicile of ceding companies. 

Many of our clients buy reinsurance from us for capital management purposes, primarily to increase their capacity to write insurance premium, maintain or improve their credit ratings from rating agencies, or to meet regulatory capital requirements. The most common form of reinsurance used for this purpose is quota share reinsurance. Many of the clients that buy these contracts are growing as a result of securing primary rate increases and an increase in the number of policies they write. Because quota share reinsurance typically includes structural and contractual features that limit the amount of risk assumed by the reinsurer, it therefore carries relatively lower expected margins than excess of loss reinsurance and other more volatile forms of reinsurance. During periods of less favorable market conditions, margins on quota share reinsurance written for the capital management purposes of our clients typically remain relatively stable and are sufficient to support our business plan. As market conditions improve, we may expand the lines of business and forms of reinsurance on which we focus to increase our risk-adjusted returns. 

In contrast to many reinsurers with whom we compete, we have elected to limit our underwriting of property catastrophe exposures. Through December 2014, we wrote excess of loss catastrophe reinsurance through the Catastrophe Fund, which was a separately capitalized reinsurance fund vehicle. In December 2014, we announced that we would no longer accept investments in the Catastrophe Fund and that no new business would be written in the Catastrophe Reinsurer. As of December 31, 2015, all investments in the Catastrophe Fund had been redeemed. 

On December 18, 2014, we entered into a subscription agreement with the Kiskadee Diversified Fund Ltd. (&#8220;Kiskadee Fund&#8221;) to invest up to $25.0 million &#32;in Hiscox Insurance Company (Bermuda) Limited&#8217;s (&#8220;Hiscox&#8221;) separately managed insurance-linked securities platform, Kiskadee Re Ltd. The Kiskadee Fund is a fund vehicle managed by Hiscox. The Kiskadee Fund invests in property catastrophe exposures through collateralized reinsurance transactions and other insurance-linked investments. On January 2, 2015 and June 1, 2015, we funded $5.0 million and $20.0 million, respectively, and there are no remaining commitments. The value of our investment in the Kiskadee Fund as of December 31, 2015 is $26.5 million . 

As there are no additional guarantees or recourse to us from these funds beyond the amount of our investment in the Kiskadee Fund, we anticipate that our property catastrophe exposures will consistently remain low when compared to our competitors. 

&#32;5 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

Since we predominantly focus on lines of business that have historically demonstrated more stable return characteristics and limit our underwriting of property catastrophe exposure, we do not manage our reinsurance portfolio to any particular breakdown by line of business.

Investment Strategy 

Our investment strategy distinguishes us from most other reinsurers, who typically concentrate their investment portfolios on long-only, investment grade, shorter-term, fixed income securities. As implemented by our investment manager, Third Point LLC, our investment strategy is intended to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns by deploying capital in both long and short investments with favorable risk/reward characteristics across select asset classes, sectors and geographies. Third Point LLC identifies investment opportunities via a bottom-up, value-oriented approach to single security analysis supplemented by a top-down view of portfolio and risk management. Third Point LLC seeks dislocations in certain areas of the capital markets or in the pricing of particular securities and supplements single security analysis with an approach to portfolio construction that includes sizing each investment based on upside/downside calculations, all with a view towards appropriately positioning and managing overall exposures. Dislocations in capital markets refer to any major movements in prices of the capital markets as a whole, certain segments of the market, or a specific security. If Third Point LLC has what it considers to be a differentiated view from the perceived market sentiment with respect to such movement, Third Point LLC may trade securities in our investment accounts based on that differentiated view. If the ultimate market reaction with respect to the event or movement ultimately proves to be closer to Third Point LLC&#8217;s original viewpoint, we may have investment gains in our investment portfolio as a result of the shift in market sentiment. Through our investment manager, Third Point LLC, we make investments globally, in both developed and emerging markets, in all sectors, and in equity, credit, commodity, currency, options and other instruments. 

Third Point LLC has historically favored event-driven situations, in which it believes that a catalyst, either intrinsic or extrinsic, will unlock value or alter the lens through which the greater market values a particular investment. Third Point LLC attempts to apply this event framework to each of its single security investments and this approach informs the timing and risk of each investment. 

&#32;6 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

As the investment manager for Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA, Third Point LLC has the contractual right to manage substantially all of our investable assets pursuant to investment management agreements that have an initial term expiring on December 22, 2016, subject to automatic renewal for additional successive three-year terms unless a party notifies the other parties of its intention to terminate at least six months prior to the end of a term. We are actively negotiating the renewal of these agreements and expect that they will be renewed in 2016. Under these investment management agreements, Third Point LLC is required to follow our investment guidelines and to act in a manner that is fair and equitable in allocating investment opportunities to us. However, it is not otherwise restricted with respect to the nature or timing of making investments for our separate accounts. Our investment guidelines require Third Point LLC to manage our investment portfolio on a substantially equivalent basis to its main funds; but in any event to keep at least 60% of the investment portfolio in debt and equity securities of publicly traded companies and governments of the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (&#8220;OECD&#8221;) high income countries, asset backed securities, cash, cash equivalents or precious metals; limit single position concentration to no more than 15% of the portfolio assets managed; and limit net exposure to no greater than 1.5 times portfolio assets managed for more than 10 trading days in any 30-day period. Net exposure represents the short exposure subtracted from the long exposure in a given category. We have the contractual right to withdraw funds from our managed accounts to pay claims and expenses as needed and to meet certain capital adequacy requirements. 

Property and Casualty Reinsurance Segment Products 

Our underwriting team has extensive experience in underwriting many forms of property and casualty reinsurance products. In the current market for property and casualty reinsurance, which we categorize as being highly competitive, we expect that our focus will continue to be on property and casualty quota share treaties, which may consist of broadly syndicated surplus relief quota share contracts, commonly referred to as traditional quota shares, as well as more opportunistic business opportunities. We also consider loss portfolio transfers, aggregate stop loss covers and other forms of reserve covers where we are able to apply our investment capabilities. Expected margins on traditional quota share reinsurance, which is generally purchased for capital management purposes by our clients, are typically lower than on opportunistic business contracts but are commensurate with the level of risk underwritten. We have generally achieved higher margins from opportunistic contracts where we are providing capital to a dislocated market, such as mortgage insurance, or where we can address a unique client problem. We believe there is less competition on reserve covers due to limited willingness of traditional reinsurers, who have historically experienced lower investment returns on investable assets backing reserves, to pursue these lower margin products. Margins on this business are determined through bilateral negotiations and comparing the cost of the reserve cover to non-reinsurance solutions such as raising additional equity or debt capital. We may expand the lines of business and forms of reinsurance on which we focus to increase our risk-adjusted returns. 

While we expect to establish a diversified portfolio, our allocation of risk will vary based on our perception of the opportunities available in each line of business. Moreover, our focus on certain lines will fluctuate based upon market conditions and we may only offer or underwrite a limited range of lines in any given period. We intend to: 

&#8226; 

target markets where capacity and alternatives are underserved or capacity constrained; 

&#8226; 

employ strict underwriting discipline; 

&#8226; 

select reinsurance opportunities with favorable economics over the life of the contract; and 

&#8226; 

potentially offer lines that are not identified in this Form 10-K. 

Through December 31, 2015 , we wrote reinsurance contracts covering the following product lines: 

Property 

This line of business primarily consists of homeowners&#8217; insurance coverage. Homeowners&#8217; insurance coverage combines various personal insurance protections, which can include losses occurring to one&#8217;s home, their contents, loss of use (including additional living expenses), or loss of other personal possessions of the homeowner, as well as liability insurance for accidents that may happen at covered homes or at the hands of the homeowners. We provide quota share reinsurance on a basis which limits the amount of catastrophic losses that can be recovered; in many cases, hurricanes 

&#32;7 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

and other serious natural events are excluded. There are also other loss sensitive features that can vary the cost of the reinsurance as results improve or deteriorate, reducing the potential volatility to us. 

Workers&#8217; Compensation 

Workers&#8217; compensation insurance provides wage replacement and medical benefits to employees injured in the course of employment in exchange for the mandatory relinquishment of the employee&#8217;s right to sue the employer for negligence. While plans differ among jurisdictions, provisions can be made for payments in place of wages (functioning as a form of disability insurance), compensation for economic loss (past and future), reimbursement or payment of medical and like expenses (functioning as a form of health insurance), and benefits payable to dependents of workers killed during employment (functioning as a form of life reinsurance). General damages for pain and suffering and punitive damages for employer negligence are not generally available in workers&#8217; compensation plans. Our approach to workers&#8217; compensation is very selective and targets insurance companies that are very specialized within the workers&#8217; compensation line and geographically focused. We manage the volatility of this line of business by capping our per occurrence exposures. 

Auto &#32; 

Personal automobile insurance is purchased for individually owned or leased cars designed to provide the insured with financial protection against bodily injury or physical damage resulting from traffic accidents and against liability that could arise from such occurrences. In addition, automobile insurance may offer financial protection against theft or damage of the vehicle from incidents other than collisions. Each state has different rules and regulations in place for compulsory coverage and the specific terms of automobile insurance policies will vary from company to company. We generally focus on providing proportional reinsurance to small, single state and regional carriers that specialize in minimum financial responsibility limits required by their respective states. This business is often referred to as &#8220;non-standard&#8221; automobile business and was historically underserved by standard markets. More recently, however, standard companies have expanded their appetite for such business and it is written by a broad range of carriers. 

General Liability 

General liability insurance policies are issued to business organizations to protect them against liability claims for bodily injury and property damage arising out of premises, operations, products, and completed operations. The premises and operations portion of the coverage includes liability for injury or damage arising out of the insured's premises or out of the insured's business operations while such operations are in progress. The products and completed operations portion of the coverage includes liability arising out of the insured's products or business operations conducted away from the insured's premises once those operations have been completed or abandoned. The standard general liability policy also covers advertising and personal injury liability. These coverages include a duty to defend a lawsuit seeking damages covered by the policy. 

Our exposure to this line either comes directly through quota share reinsurance of primary (i.e., with no significant deductible or self-insured retention) commercial general liability with per risk limits of $0.5 million or less, or through our multi-line exposures explained further below. 

Professional Liability 

Professional liability is a form of liability insurance that helps protect professional advisors and service-providing individuals and companies from bearing the full cost of defending against a negligence claim made by a client and damages awarded in a civil lawsuit. The coverage focuses on alleged failure to perform on the part of, financial loss caused by, and error or omission in the service provided by the policyholder. These are potential causes for legal action that would not be covered by a basic general liability insurance policy, which addresses more direct forms of harm. The broad category of professional liability insurance includes the specific products of errors and omissions (&#8220;E&#38;O&#8221;), directors and officers coverage (&#8220;D&#38;O&#8221;), as well as several other products. 

E&#38;O coverage protects the insured against liability for committing inadequate work or negligent actions in performance of their professional duties. Generally, such policies are designed to cover financial losses rather than liability for bodily 

&#32;8 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

injury and property damage. E&#38;O coverage was historically purchased by individuals with professional designations such as doctors, lawyers, architects, and engineers, but more recently of other professions also purchase E&#38;O coverage. 

D&#38;O coverage insures the legal liability of the individual directors and officers of the insured company for certain errors and omissions committed by them. In certain circumstances in which the insured company is not legally permitted to indemnify its directors or officers for a covered loss, the policy&#8217;s D&#38;O coverage provides for insurance payments to be made directly to the directors or officers. Conversely, if the insured company indemnifies its directors or officers for their loss, the policy&#8217;s D&#38;O coverage reimburses the insured company for those indemnification payments. In this way, the coverage insures against the insured company&#8217;s own &#8220;indemnification risk.&#8221; 

There are two types of coverages available in professional liability insurance: occurrence and claims-made. An occurrence policy protects the insured from any covered incident that &#8220;occurs&#8221; during the policy period, regardless of when a claim is filed. An occurrence policy protects the insured from claims that are made even after the policy has been canceled, so long as the incident occurred during the period in which coverage was in effect. Claims-made policies provide coverage for claims only when a claim is reported during the period the policy is actually in force. Claims-made policies provide coverage so long as the insured continues to pay premiums for the initial policy and any subsequent renewals. A claims-made policy will cover claims after the coverage period only if the insured purchases extended reporting period or &#8220;tail&#8221; coverage. 

Professional liability coverage is usually (but not always) written under an claims-made coverage form, and includes a duty to defend a lawsuit seeking damages covered by the policy. 

Our exposure to this line is primarily within the multi-line business. In addition, we also currently have one contract with retrocessional exposure that is a mix of underlying E&#38;O and D&#38;O policies with high attachment points. In the case of that particular contract, our exposure is limited to $3.5 million per risk. 

&#32; Agriculture 

Agriculture insurance on growing crops in the United States provides protection to farmers for crop losses caused by weather, disease, and insects. Two types of policies are available. Multiple peril crop insurance, or MPCI, is subsidized by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and covers most natural perils. Additionally, farmers can purchase single peril policies such as hail insurance. These products are not subsidized and the farmer pays the entire premium. Other single peril policies cover perils such as wind, freeze, and excess rain. We predominantly underwrote MPCI business. At the end of 2013, we decided to stop underwriting Agriculture business and this line of business, with the limited number of contracts previously bound, is now in runoff. 

Credit &#38; Financial Lines 

Credit &#38; Financial Lines primarily consists of mortgage insurance policies. Mortgage insurance is an insurance policy that compensates lenders or investors for losses due to the default of a mortgage loan. Mortgage insurance can refer to private mortgage insurance (&#8220;PMI&#8221;), mortgage life insurance or mortgage title insurance. We focus on PMI, which is normally required by lenders when a borrower&#8217;s down payment or equity is less than 20% of the loan value. Not all lenders will require PMI but those that follow the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines for home loan approval require PMI. In addition to mortgage insurance, policies classified as Credit &#38; Financial Lines may include political risk, trade credit, surety, financial guarantee and title insurance. 

Multi-line 

Multi-line reinsurance is reinsurance of an underlying portfolio of several different types of insurance risks. We focus on multi-line reinsurance opportunities where we have expertise in the underlying lines of business or where the terms and conditions of the reinsurance contract minimize the volatility of the more difficult to analyze classes of business in the portfolio. Contracts that cover more than one line of business will be designated as multi-line even if a portion of the underlying business is covered by one of the lines of business listed above. The most significant line of business we include in multi-line that we do not write on a standalone basis is Extended Warranty Insurance, a description of which is included below. 

&#32;9 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

Extended Warranty Insurance 

Extended warranty insurance compensates individuals or businesses for correction or repair necessary as a result of mechanical or electrical breakdown. Our reinsurance contracts cover motor vehicles, vans, trucks, construction equipment and agricultural equipment, and the coverage varies according to the product, the age and the usage. The insurance is offered on a multi-year basis, generally with a maximum period of three years on risk, and can cover either new units after a period of warranty offered by the manufacturer or used units once the manufacturer&#8217;s warranty has expired. All of the extended warranty insurance business we have written excludes manufacturer defect and product recall. The auto warranty business we have written is captured within the multi-line product line because the reinsurance contracts also cover other lines of business. 

Marketing 

The majority of our business is sourced through reinsurance brokers. Broker distribution channels provide us with access to an efficient, variable cost, global distribution system without the significant time and expense that would be incurred in creating a wholly-owned distribution network. We believe that our financial strength rating, well known and respected management team, and responsive client service enhance our working relationships with clients and brokers. 

Our objective is to build long-term relationships with senior individuals at reinsurance brokers and with our clients. We meet frequently with brokers, senior representatives of existing clients and prospective clients, and encourage clients to visit our executive offices in order to help distinguish us and to develop mutually beneficial understandings of our respective businesses. As evidenced by rates of submission flow, open dialogue, and successful closing of targeted accounts, we believe we have successfully leveraged the underwriting experience and relationships of our management team. Reinsurance brokers receive a brokerage commission that is usually a percentage of gross premiums written. We seek to become the first choice of brokers and clients by providing: 

&#8226; 

creative solutions that address the specific business needs of our clients; 

&#8226; 

rapid and substantive responses to structuring and pricing quote requests; 

&#8226; 

financial security; and 

&#8226; 

clear indication of risks we will and will not underwrite. 

The following table sets forth our premiums written by source that individually contributed more than 10% of total gross premiums written for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 :

We believe that the number of brokers with whom we do business will continue to expand over time, and by maintaining close working relationships with brokers, we are able to increase our chances of successfully growing and accessing a broader range of potential clients. 

Underwriting 

We have established a team of senior underwriters and actuaries to develop and manage our reinsurance business. We believe that their experience, industry presence and long-standing relationships will allow us to tailor our portfolio to specific market segments. Our approach to underwriting will allow us to deploy our capital in a variety of lines of business and to capitalize on opportunities that we believe offer favorable returns on equity over the long term. Our 

&#32;10 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

underwriters and actuaries have expertise in a number of lines of business and we will also look to outside consultants to help us with niche areas of expertise when we deem it appropriate. From time to time, we may consider investment income in our underwriting and pricing of a particular transaction. 

We generally apply the following underwriting management principles: 

Team Approach 

Each submission is assigned to an underwriter. If the program meets our underwriting criteria, the underwriter and pricing actuary evaluate the opportunity, determine the optimal structure, and price the deal. When capital is committed to any transaction, the underwriting team creates a deal analysis memorandum that highlights the key components of the proposed transaction and presents the proposed transaction to a senior group of staff including our senior executives and representatives of the underwriting, actuarial and finance teams. This group must agree that the transaction meets or exceeds our profitability expectations and requirements before we submit a binding proposal. 

Actuarial Pricing 

We have developed proprietary actuarial models and also use several commercially available tools to assist in pricing our business. Our analysis considers the data and information provided by the potential cedent as well as relevant industry data, where appropriate. We use this cedent specific and industry data to develop our own point estimate of the expected losses under each potential contract. We also use a stochastic model to simulate a distribution of potential loss outcomes and the impact of any contractual features that may exist such as sliding scale ceding commissions or profit commissions. 

One of the key metrics that we consider as a result of this process is the expected composite ratio on a particular transaction. We also consider the projected underwriting and economic results at various confidence levels with a specific focus on the likelihood and magnitude of adverse outcomes. As part of this process, we also specifically review each transaction to determine if there is sufficient risk transfer to qualify for reinsurance accounting. The results of this pricing process are shared with the underwriter on a contract, and if a deal is bound, summary exhibits are attached to a memo summarizing the actuarial pricing analysis that was performed. 

Act as Lead Underwriter 

Typically, one or two reinsurers will act as the lead or co-lead parties in developing and negotiating treaty pricing, terms and conditions of reinsurance contracts. We act as the lead underwriter for the majority of the premium that we underwrite. We believe that lead underwriting is a critically important factor in achieving long-term success, as lead underwriters have greater control of overall economics of their programs. In addition, we believe that reinsurers that lead contracts are generally solicited for a broader range of business and have greater access to attractive risks. 

Alignment of Interests 

We seek to ensure that every contract we underwrite aligns our interests with our client&#8217;s interest. Specifically, we may seek to: 

&#8226; 

require our clients to maintain a meaningful risk position in their business; 

&#8226; 

pay our clients a commission based upon their actual expenses and offer an additional commission as an incentive based upon profitability; 

&#8226; 

include deficit carry-forward provisions in our multi-year contracts that allows us to potentially offset underwriting losses from one year to the next; 

&#8226; 

charge the client a premium for reinstatement of the amount of reinsurance coverage to the full amount reduced as a result of a reinsurance loss payment, which we refer to as a reinstatement premium; 

&#8226; 

require specific levels of rate increases on the underlying insurance policies; and 

&#32;11 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

&#8226; 

for contracts on which we offer an interest credit on funds we hold, credit interest income on actual cash received into a notional experience account whereby the experience account is credited to the ceding company at the maturity of the contract if underwriting results are realized as initially expected. 

We believe these tools help us align our risk with the risk of the client and provide incentive to clients to manage our mutual interests. We also believe that aligning our interests with our client&#8217;s interests promotes profitability, accurate reporting of information, timely settling and management of claims, and limits the potential for disputes. Adjustments to profit commissions and other participating features are recorded in our financial statements based on our estimate of losses and the contractual provisions of the reinsurance contract. 

Underwriting Operations 

As Chief Executive Officer of the Company, John Berger sets underwriting strategy, establishes underwriting policies and has appointed the underwriting teams for each of Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA. Our underwriting teams consist of underwriters who have significant experience in the reinsurance business. The Presidents of Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA have exclusive authority to bind contracts on behalf of their respective companies. 

Detailed Underwriting Diligence 

We employ selective underwriting criteria in the contracts we choose to underwrite and spend a significant amount of time with our clients and brokers to understand the risks and appropriately structure the contracts. We usually obtain significant amounts of data from our clients to conduct a thorough actuarial modeling analysis. As part of our pricing and underwriting process, we assess among other factors: 

&#8226; 

the client&#8217;s and industry historical loss data and current market conditions; 

&#8226; 

the business purpose served by a proposed contract; 

&#8226; 

the client&#8217;s pricing and underwriting strategies; 

&#8226; 

the expected duration for claims to fully develop; 

&#8226; 

the geographic areas in which the client is doing business and its market share; 

&#8226; 

the reputation and financial strength of the client; 

&#8226; 

the reputation and expertise of the broker; 

&#8226; 

proposed contract terms and conditions; and 

&#8226; 

reports provided by independent industry specialists. 

Retrocessional Coverage 

Retrocessional coverage consists of reinsurance purchased to cover a portion of the risks that we reinsure on behalf of our clients. We purchased a small amount of retrocessional coverage in 2015 &#32;on specific accounts, and we may continue to do so in the future. From time to time, we consider purchases of retrocessional coverage for one or more of the following reasons: to specifically reduce our property catastrophe exposure in certain reinsurance contracts that we write, to reduce our net liability on individual risks, to obtain additional underwriting capacity and to balance our underwriting portfolio. Additionally, retrocession can be used as a mechanism to share the risks and rewards of business written and therefore can be used as a tool to align our interests with those of our counterparties. 

Claims Management 

Our claims management process begins upon receipt of periodic contract reports from brokers or clients. These statements are reviewed on an individual basis, evaluated against our expectations and entered in our management system for portfolio analysis and reporting purposes. In addition to analyzing report statements and results, claims audits are performed on specific contracts based on results and management direction to ensure the clients are reporting and reserving their claims accurately and appropriately. &#160; 

&#32;12 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

Reserves &#32; 

On a quarterly basis, our actuaries produce an actuarial central estimate of the gross and net loss reserves for all contracts bound as of the evaluation date. The reserves are calculated on an undiscounted basis with regards to future investment income. The projections also include estimates of loss-sensitive contingent terms such as additional premium features, profit commissions and sliding scale ceding commissions. All calculations are done on a contract-by-contract basis and reflect the most recent premium and loss information provided by our cedents. 

In estimating our loss and loss adjustment reserves, it is necessary to project future loss and loss adjustment expense payments. Actual future loss and loss adjustment expenses will not develop exactly as projected and may, in fact, significantly vary from the projections. Further, the projections make no provision for extraordinary future emergence of new classes of losses or types of losses not sufficiently represented in our or the cedent&#8217;s historical database or which are not yet quantifiable. 

See Note 8 &#32;to our consolidated financial statements for additional information and details on our loss reserve development. 

Current loss and loss adjustment reserves 

The following table represents the development of GAAP balance sheet reserves for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, net of loss and loss adjustment expenses recoverable as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 , 2013 &#32;and 2012 . This table does not present policy or accident year development data. The top line of the table shows our gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves as of the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years. This represents the estimated amounts of gross and net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves arising in the current year and all prior years that are unpaid as of the balance sheet date, including incurred but not reported (&#8220;IBNR&#8221;) reserves. The table also shows the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded loss and loss adjustment expense reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year. The estimates change as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years. The &#8220;cumulative redundancy (deficiency)&#8221; represents the aggregate change to date from the original estimate. The table also shows the cumulative paid amounts as of successive years with respect to the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves.

Collateral Arrangements and Letter of Credit Facilities 

Neither Third Point Re nor Third Point Re USA is licensed or admitted as an insurer in any jurisdiction other than Bermuda. Many jurisdictions, such as the United States, do not permit clients to take credit for reinsurance on their 

&#32;13 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

statutory financial statements if such reinsurance is obtained from unlicensed or non-admitted insurers without appropriate collateral or, in some states, unless they have investment grade financial strength ratings from two recognized rating agencies. As a result, we anticipate that all of our U.S. clients and a portion of our non-U.S. clients will require us to provide collateral for the contracts we bind with them. We expect this collateral to take the form of funds withheld, trust arrangements or letters of credit. As of December 31, 2015 , we had in place letter of credit facilities for an aggregate amount of $550.0 million &#32;and have letters of credit totaling $270.4 million &#32;in favor of clients. The failure to maintain, replace or increase our letter of credit facilities on commercially acceptable terms may significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy. See &#8220;Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business - Our failure to obtain sufficient letter of credit facilities or to increase our letter of credit capacity on commercially acceptable terms as we grow could significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy.&#8221; 

In addition, we have $352.3 million &#32;of restricted cash and investments held in trust accounts to secure obligations under certain reinsurance contracts. 

Competition 

The reinsurance industry is highly competitive. We compete with major reinsurers, most of which are well established, have a significant operating history and stronger financial strength ratings and have developed long-standing client relationships. 

Although we seek to provide coverage where capacity and alternatives are limited, we directly compete with larger companies due to the breadth of their coverage across the property and casualty market in substantially all lines of business. We also compete with smaller companies and other niche reinsurers. While we have a limited operating history, we believe that our unique approach to underwriting and extensive relationships allow us to be successful in underwriting transactions against more established competitors. 

Risk Management 

We have developed a comprehensive risk management strategy that is governed by an articulated vision of risk appetite and control that is conveyed throughout the organization and measured in a transparent and consistent manner. Our risk management strategy, metrics and progress are summarized in a report that is presented to the board of directors on a quarterly basis. Our internal capital model incorporates statistics from the pricing, reserving and investment processes to produce an estimate of the amount of capital used at set points in time (e.g., each quarter-end) as well as the overall variability in the prospective financial results. We work closely with the risk management personnel of Third Point LLC, our investment manager, to measure and report the variability of results from our investment portfolio. We also monitor the contractual exposure to catastrophic losses as aggregated across all bound reinsurance contracts. 

Ratings 

Each of our reinsurance subsidiaries has an A- (Excellent) financial strength rating with a stable outlook from A.M. Best, which is the fourth highest of 15 ratings. We believe that a strong rating is a critical factor in the marketing of reinsurance products to clients and brokers. This rating reflects the rating agency&#8217;s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet obligations. It is not an evaluation directed toward the protection of investors or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our common shares. 

Joint Ventures and Investment Management Agreements 

On December 22, 2011, we entered into an investment management agreement with Third Point LLC, Third Point Re, and Third Point Advisors LLC (&#8220;TP GP&#8221;) (Third Point Re and TP GP, together with any other party admitted in the future as a participant, the &#8220;Participants&#8221; and each a &#8220;Participant&#8221;) pursuant to which the parties created a joint venture (the &#8220; 2011 Account&#8221;) whereby Third Point LLC manages the assets of Third Point Re and TP GP as well as any of our subsidiaries&#8217; assets, if any, in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the investment management agreement, except as described below. 

On January 28, 2015, we entered into another investment management agreement with Third Point LLC, Third Point Re USA and TP GP pursuant to which the parties created a separate managed account (the &#8220;2015 Account&#8221; and together with the 2011 Account, each, an &#8220;Account&#8221;) whereby Third Point LLC manages the assets of Third Point Re USA and 

&#32;14 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

TP GP under substantially the same terms and conditions as our existing investment management agreement for Third Point Re. 

Management Fee 

Pursuant to each investment management agreement, Third Point LLC is entitled to receive a monthly payment in advance by each Participant (other than TP GP) and is equal to (i) 0.1667% (2.0% annualized) of the capital account of such Participant (before accounting for any accrual of the Performance Allocation (as defined in the applicable investment management agreement)) minus (ii) the aggregate amount of Founders payments paid for such month pursuant to the Founders Agreement, in each case pro-rated for intra-month withdrawals or contributions. This payment is debited against the capital account of each relevant Participant and paid in cash to Third Point LLC. 

Performance Allocation 

As further set out in each investment management agreement, each Account has established one or more capital accounts to which capital contributions, withdrawals, net profit and net loss will be allocated in respect of each Participant. At the end of each fiscal year, the Performance Allocation (equal to 20% of the net profit allocable to the capital account of each Participant) will be reallocated to the capital account of TP GP from the capital account of each other Participant, provided, however, that a Performance Allocation will not be made with respect to such capital account until such capital account has recouped the amount of any unrecouped net capital loss in its Loss Recovery Account (as defined in the investment management agreement). If a Participant withdraws all or a portion of its capital account other than at the end of a fiscal year, the Performance Allocation accrued and attributable to the portion withdrawn will be debited against such Participant&#8217;s capital account and credited to TP GP&#8217;s capital account at the time of withdrawal. 

Under each investment management agreement, Third Point LLC is required to maintain a Loss Recovery Account in respect of each Participant, the opening balance of which will be zero. Thereafter, for any fiscal year, the Loss Recovery Account balance shall be the sum of all prior year net loss amounts allocated to the Participant and not subsequently offset by prior year net profit amounts allocated to such Participant; provided that the Loss Recovery Account balance will be reduced proportionately to reflect any withdrawals made by such Participant. TP GP may waive or reduce the Performance Allocation, in its sole discretion. Third Point LLC and TP GP may elect, at the beginning of each fiscal year to restructure the Performance Allocation as a performance fee to Third Point LLC with the same terms as the Performance Allocation. As of December 31, 2015, the Loss Recovery Account was $5.0 million &#32;for Third Point Re&#8217;s investment account and $1.2 million &#32;for Third Point Re USA&#8217;s investment account (December 31, 2014 - $ nil ). These amounts have not been recorded in the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets. 

Investment Guidelines 

As detailed in each investment management agreement, Third Point LLC is required to adhere to the following investment guidelines: 

&#8226; 

Composition of Investments : At least 60% of the applicable investment portfolio will be held in debt or equity securities (including swaps) of publicly traded companies (or their subsidiaries) and governments of the OECD high income countries, asset-backed securities, cash, cash equivalents and gold and other precious metals. Except with the prior written consent of the Investment and Finance committee, none of the assets in the investment portfolio will be held in illiquid investments traditionally considered &#8220;venture capital&#8221; or private equity investments. In addition, no investments in third party managed funds or other investment vehicles will be made without the consent of the Investment and Finance committee. 

&#8226; 

Concentration of Investments : Other than cash, cash equivalents and United States government obligations, no single investment in the investment portfolio will constitute more than 15% of the portfolio. 

&#8226; 

Liquidity : Assets will be invested in such fashion that Third Point Re and, with respect to our second investment management agreement, Third Point Re USA, has a reasonable expectation that it can meet any of its liabilities as they become due. We review the liquidity of the Third Point LLC portfolio on a periodic basis. 

&#8226; 

Net Exposure Limits : The investment portfolio may not employ greater than 1.5 times portfolio assets managed for more than 10 trading days in any 30-trading day period. 

&#32;15 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

Term 

The original investment management agreement for Third Point Re has an initial term of five years, subject to automatic renewal for additional successive three-year terms unless a party notifies the other parties at least six months prior to the end of a term that it wishes to terminate the investment management agreement at the end of such term. The second investment management agreement for Third Point Re USA entered into in January 2015 has an expiration date that coincides with the expiration date of the original investment management agreement and is subject to similar renewal provisions. We are actively negotiating the renewal of these agreements and expect that they will be renewed in 2016. 

We may also terminate either investment management agreement upon the death, long-term disability or retirement of Daniel S. Loeb, or the occurrence of other circumstances in which Mr. Loeb is no longer directing the investment program of Third Point LLC. 

We may also withdraw as participants under the investment management agreements prior to the expiration of the investment management agreements&#8217; term at any time only &#8220;for cause&#8221;, which is defined under both investment management agreements as: 

&#8226; 

a material violation of applicable law relating to Third Point LLC&#8217;s advisory business; 

&#8226; 

Third Point LLC&#8217;s fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or reckless disregard of its obligations under the investment management agreement; 

&#8226; 

a material breach by Third Point LLC of our investment guidelines that is not cured within a 15-day period; 

&#8226; 

a conviction or, a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a felony or a crime affecting the asset management business of Third Point LLC by certain senior officers of Third Point LLC; 

&#8226; 

any act of fraud, material misappropriation, material dishonesty, embezzlement, or similar conduct against or involving us by senior officers of Third Point LLC; or

a formal administrative or other legal proceeding before the SEC, the CFTC, the FINRA, or any other U.S. or non-U.S. regulatory or self-regulatory organization against Third Point LLC; or certain key personnel which would likely have a material adverse effect on us. 

In addition, we may withdraw as a participant under the investment management agreements prior to the expiration of their term if the net investment performance of Third Point LLC has (a) (i) incurred a loss in two successive calendar years and (ii) underperformed the S&#38;P 500 Index by at least 10 percentage points for such two successive calendar years, taken as a whole, or (b) (i) incurred a cumulative loss of 10% or more during any 24-month period and (ii) underperformed the S&#38;P 500 Index by at least 15 percentage points for such 24-month period.

In managing our investment portfolio, Third Point LLC assigns every investment position a sector, strategy and geographic category. The dollar exposure of each position under each category is aggregated and the exposure 

&#32;17 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

percentages listed in the exposure table represent the aggregate market exposure of a given category against the total net asset value of the consolidated account. Long and short exposure percentages represent the aggregate relative value of all long and short positions in a given category, respectively. Net exposure represents the short exposure subtracted from the long exposure in a given category. Third Point LLC reports the composition of our total managed portfolio on a market exposure basis, which it believes is the appropriate manner in which to assess the exposure and profile of investments and is the way in which it manages the portfolio. Under this methodology, the exposure for equity swaps and futures contracts are reported at their full notional amount. The notional amount of any derivative contract is the underlying value upon which payment obligations are computed. For an equity total return swap, for example, the notional amount is the number of shares underlying the swap multiplied by the market price of those shares. Options are reported at their delta adjusted basis. The delta of an option is the sensitivity of the option price to the underlying stock price. The delta adjusted basis is the number of shares underlying the option multiplied by the delta and the underlying stock price. Credit derivatives are reported in accordance with their equivalent underlying security exposure. Cash and cash equivalents are excluded from exposure calculations.

Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. 

Our investment manager, Third Point LLC, manages several funds and may manage other client accounts besides ours, some of which have, or may have, objectives and investment portfolio compositions similar to ours. Because of the similarity or potential similarity of our investment portfolio to these others, and because, as a matter of ordinary course, Third Point LLC provides its clients, including us, and investors in its main hedge funds with results of their respective investment portfolios following the last day of each month, those other clients or investors indirectly may have material nonpublic information regarding our investment portfolio. To address this issue, and to comply with Regulation FD, we will continue to post on our website under the heading Investment Portfolio Returns located in the Investors section of the website, following the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the last business day of each month, 

&#32;18 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

our preliminary monthly investment results for that month, with additional information regarding our monthly investment results to be posted following the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the first business day of the following month. 

Investment Regulatory Concerns and Restrictions 

Third Point LLC is involved regularly in trading activities that involve a broad number of U.S. and foreign securities law regimes, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical trading requirements that involve fundamental market regulation policies. Violation of such laws could result in severe restrictions on Third Point LLC&#8217;s activities and, indirectly, damage to our investment portfolio and/or reputation as each investment management agreement has limited termination provisions. 

Third Point LLC&#8217;s failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result in fines, censure, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions. The regulations that Third Point LLC is subject to are designed primarily to ensure the integrity of the financial markets. They are not designed to protect us or, indirectly, you. Even if a sanction imposed against Third Point LLC or one of its personnel by a regulator was for a small monetary amount, the adverse publicity related to such sanction against Third Point LLC by regulators could harm its reputation and, possibly, ours. 

In recent years, there has been debate in both the U.S. and foreign governments about new rules or regulations to be applicable to alternative investment advisers, like Third Point LLC. 

In August 2007, the SEC adopted a new rule intended to clarify the SEC&#8217;s authority to bring enforcement actions against investment advisers for fraud against investors and prospective investors in their funds (as opposed to fraud against the funds themselves). Although we do not believe the SEC&#8217;s rule has directly affected us, Third Point LLC and, accordingly, our investment strategy, may be adversely affected if new or revised legislation or regulations are enacted or by changes to existing rules and regulations of U.S. or foreign governmental regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets. 

It is possible that increased regulation of alternative investment advisers could adversely affect Third Point LLC&#8217;s ability to manage our investment portfolio or its ability to manage our portfolio pursuant to our existing investment strategy, which could cause us to alter our existing investment strategy and could significantly and negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, adverse publicity regarding alternative investment strategies generally, or Third Point LLC or its affiliates specifically, could negatively affect our business reputation and attractiveness as a counterparty to brokers and clients. 

Other Trading Restrictions 

Third Point LLC may from time to time place it or its affiliates&#8217; representatives on creditors committees or boards of certain companies in which our portfolio is invested. While such representation may enable Third Point LLC to enhance the value of our investments, it may place trading restrictions on certain securities included in our investment portfolio. 

Regulation 

Bermuda Insurance Regulation 

The Insurance Act of 1978 

The Insurance Act of 1978, as amended, and related regulations of Bermuda (the &#8220;Insurance Act&#8221;), which regulates the insurance business of Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA, provides that no person shall carry on any insurance business in or from within Bermuda unless registered as an insurer under the Insurance Act by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (&#8220;BMA&#8221;). Under the Insurance Act, insurance business includes reinsurance business. The BMA, in deciding whether to grant registration, has broad discretion to act as it thinks fit in the public interest. The BMA is required by the Insurance Act to determine whether the applicant is a fit and proper body to be engaged in the insurance business and, in particular, whether it has, or has available to it, adequate knowledge and expertise. The registration of an applicant as an insurer is subject to its complying with the terms of its registration and such other conditions as the BMA may impose from time to time. The Insurance Act also grants to the BMA powers to supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies. 

&#32;19 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

An insurance advisory committee appointed by the Bermuda Minister of Finance advises the BMA on matters connected with the discharge of the BMA&#8217;s functions and sub-committees thereof supervise and review the law and practice of insurance in Bermuda, including reviews of accounting and administrative procedures. 

The Insurance Act imposes on Bermuda insurance companies solvency and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements and grants to the BMA powers to supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies. Certain significant aspects of the Bermuda insurance regulatory framework are set forth below. 

Classification of Insurers 

The Insurance Act distinguishes between insurers carrying on long-term business, insurers carrying on general business and insurers carrying on special purpose business. There are six classifications of insurers carrying on general business, ranging from Class 1 insurers (pure captives) to Class 4 insurers (very large commercial underwriters). Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA are registered as Class 4 insurers. 

Classification as a Class 4 Insurer 

A body corporate is registrable as a Class 4 insurer where (i) it has at the time of its application for registration, or will have before it carries on insurance business, a total statutory capital and surplus of not less than $100,000,000; and (ii) it intends to carry on general insurance business, including excess liability business or property catastrophe reinsurance business. Class 4 insurers are required to maintain fully paid-up share capital of $1,000,000. 

Principal Representative and Principal Office 

Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA are each required to maintain a principal office and to appoint and maintain a principal representative in Bermuda. For the purpose of the Insurance Act, the principal office of Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA is at our principal executive offices in Bermuda. Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA&#8217;s principal representative is Christopher Coleman. The principal office of Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA is at Point House, 3 Waterloo Lane, Pembroke HM 08 Bermuda. Without a reason acceptable to the BMA, an insurer may not terminate the appointment of its principal representative, and the principal representative may not cease to act as such, unless 30 days&#8217; notice in writing to the BMA is given of the intention to do so. 

It is the duty of the principal representative to forthwith notify the BMA where the principal representative believes there is a likelihood of the insurer (for which the principal representative acts) becoming insolvent or that a reportable &#8220;event&#8221; has, to the principal representative&#8217;s knowledge, occurred or is believed to have occurred. Examples of a reportable &#8220;event&#8221; include a failure by Third Point Re or Third Point Re USA to comply substantially with a condition imposed upon it by the BMA relating to a solvency margin or a liquidity or other ratio, a significant loss likely to cause the insurer to fail to comply with its enhanced capital requirement (discussed below) and the occurrence of a &#8220;material change&#8221; (as such term is defined under the Insurance Act) in its business operations. 

Within 14 days of such notification to the BMA, the principal representative must furnish the BMA with a written report setting out all the particulars of the case that are available to the principal representative. 

Loss Reserve Specialist 

As Class 4 insurers, Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA must each appoint an individual approved by the BMA to be its loss reserve specialist. In order to qualify as an approved loss reserve specialist, the applicant must be an individual and possess adequate professional qualifications as a casualty actuary and/or possess adequate experience to assess the sufficiency of insurance reserves of the insurer. The Class 4 insurers are required to submit annually an opinion of their approved loss reserve specialists with their statutory financial return in respect of their loss and loss expense provisions. 

Annual Financial Statements 

As Class 4 insurers, Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA must prepare and submit, on an annual basis, both audited U.S. GAAP and statutory financial statements. 

&#32;20 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

The Insurance Act prescribes rules for the preparation and substance of statutory financial statements (which include, in statutory form, a balance sheet, income statement, a statement of capital and surplus, and notes thereto). The statutory financial statements include detailed information and analysis regarding premiums, claims, reinsurance and investments of the insurer. In addition, as Class 4 insurers, Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA are also required to prepare and submit to the BMA financial statements which have been prepared under generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards (&#8220;GAAP financial statements&#8221;). 

As Class 4 insurers, Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA&#8217;s annual U.S. GAAP and statutory financial statements are required to be filed with the BMA within four months from the end of the relevant financial year (unless specifically extended). 

The statutory financial statements do not form part of the public records maintained by the BMA but the GAAP financial statements for both Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA are available for public inspection. 

Declaration of Compliance 

Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA, at the time of filing their statutory financial statements, will also be required to deliver to the BMA a declaration of compliance, in such form and with such content as may be prescribed by the BMA, declaring whether or not Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA have, with respect to the preceding financial year (i) complied with all requirements of the minimum criteria applicable to it; (ii) complied with the minimum margin of solvency as at its financial year end; (iii) complied with the applicable enhanced capital requirements as at its financial year end; and (iv) observed any limitations, restrictions or conditions imposed upon issuance of its license, if applicable. The declaration of compliance is required to be signed by two directors of each of Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA, and if Third Point Re or Third Point Re USA have failed to comply with any of the requirements referenced in (i) through (iii) above or observe any limitations, restrictions or conditions imposed upon issuance of its license, if applicable, Third Point Re and/or Third Point Re USA will be required to provide the BMA with particulars of such failure in writing. Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA shall be liable to a fine for failure to comply with a duty imposed on it in connection with the delivery of the declaration of compliance. 

Annual Statutory Financial Return and Annual Capital and Solvency Return 

Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA, as Class 4 insurers, are required to file with the BMA a statutory financial return no later than four months after their respective financial year end (unless specifically extended). The statutory financial return includes, among other matters, a report of the approved independent auditor on the statutory financial statements of the insurer, a general business, or special purpose business, as applicable, solvency certificate, the statutory financial statements themselves and the opinion of the loss reserve specialist. 

The principal representative and at least two directors of the insurer must sign the solvency certificate. The directors are required to certify whether the minimum solvency margin has been met, and the approved independent auditor is required to state whether in its opinion it was reasonable for the directors to make this certification. 

Where an insurer&#8217;s accounts have been audited for any purpose other than compliance with the Insurance Act, a statement to that effect must be filed with the statutory financial return. 

In addition, each year Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA, as a Class 4 insurers, are also required to file with the BMA a capital and solvency return along with their annual financial statutory returns. The prescribed form of capital and solvency return comprises the insurer&#8217;s Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement (&#8220;BSCR&#8221;) model or an approved internal capital model in lieu thereof (more fully described below), a schedule of fixed income investments by rating categories, a schedule of net loss and loss expense provisions by line of business, a schedule of premiums written by line of business, a schedule of risk management, a schedule of fixed income securities, a schedule of commercial insurer&#8217;s solvency self assessment (&#8220;CISSA&#8221;), a schedule of catastrophe risk return, a schedule of loss triangles or reconciliation of net loss reserves and a schedule of eligible capital. 

Neither the statutory financial return nor the capital and solvency return is available for public inspection. 

&#32;21 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

Economic Balance Sheet 

The BMA is in the process of introducing an economic balance sheet (&#8220;EBS&#8221;) framework, which will become effective with the December 31, 2016 capital and solvency return filing, and will form the basis for the Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA&#8217;s enhanced capital requirements (&#8220;ECR&#8221;), as described below. The EBS framework will replace the current statutory financial reporting and valuation framework. The underlying premise of the EBS is that both assets and liabilities are valued using market or fair values. 

Quarterly Financial Statements 

Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA, as Class 4 insurers not being otherwise subject to group supervision (described below), are each required to prepare and file quarterly financial returns with the BMA on or before the last day of the months May, August and November of each year. The quarterly financial returns consist of (i) quarterly unaudited financial statements for each financial quarter (which must minimally include a balance sheet and income statement and must also be recent and not reflect a financial position that exceeds two months) and (ii) a list and details of material intra-group transactions and risk concentrations that have materialized since the most recent quarterly or annual financial returns, details surrounding all intra-group reinsurance and retrocession arrangements and other intra-group risk transfer insurance business arrangements that have materialized since the most recent quarterly or annual financial returns and details of the ten largest exposures to unaffiliated counterparties and any other unaffiliated counterparty exposures exceeding 10% of the insurer&#8217;s statutory capital and surplus. Quarterly financial statements are not required where the Class 4 insurer is subject to group supervision. 

Approved Independent Auditor 

Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA, as Class 4 insurers, must each appoint an independent auditor who will annually audit and report on the insurer&#8217;s GAAP financial statements, its statutory financial statements and its statutory financial returns, each of which are required to be filed annually with the BMA. The auditor must be approved by the BMA as the independent auditor of the insurer. If the insurer fails to appoint an approved auditor or at any time fails to fill a vacancy for such auditor, the BMA may appoint an approved auditor for the insurer and shall fix the remuneration to be paid to the approved auditor within 14 days, if not agreed sooner by the insurer and the auditor. 

Non-insurance Business 

Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA, as Class 4 insurers may not engage in non-insurance business unless that non-insurance business is ancillary to their core insurance business. Non-insurance business means any business other than insurance business and includes carrying on investment business, managing an investment fund as operator, carrying on business as a fund administrator, carrying on banking business, underwriting debt or securities or otherwise engaging in investment banking, engaging in commercial or industrial activities and carrying on the business of management, sales or leasing of real property. Third Point Re, as a Class 4 insurer registered before December 31, 2012, will be permitted to continue engaging in non-insurance business but must discontinue doing so not later than year-end 2016. 

Minimum Liquidity Ratio 

The Insurance Act provides a minimum liquidity ratio for general business. As an insurer engaged in general business, Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA are each required to maintain the value of their relevant assets at not less than 75% of the amount of their relevant liabilities. Relevant assets include cash and time deposits, quoted investments, unquoted bonds and debentures, first liens on real estate, investment income due and accrued, accounts and premiums receivable, reinsurance balances receivable and funds held by ceding reinsurers. 

There are certain categories of assets that, unless specifically permitted by the BMA, do not automatically qualify as relevant assets, such as unquoted equity securities, investments in and advances to affiliates and real estate and collateral loans. 

The relevant liabilities are total general business insurance reserves and total other liabilities less deferred income tax and sundry liabilities (by interpretation, those not specifically defined) and letters of credit and guarantees. 

&#32;22 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

Minimum Solvency Margin and Enhanced Capital Requirements 

The Insurance Act provides that the value of the statutory assets of a Class 4 insurer must exceed the value of its statutory liabilities by an amount greater than its prescribed minimum solvency margin (&#8220;MSM&#8221;). 

The MSM that must be maintained by a Class 4 insurer with respect to its general business is the greater of (i) $100 million, or (ii) 50% of net premium written (with a credit for reinsurance ceded not exceeding 25% of gross premiums) or (iii) 15% of net discounted aggregate loss and loss expense provisions and other insurance reserves. 

Class 4 insurers are also required to maintain available statutory capital and surplus at a level equal to or in excess of its ECR, which is established by reference to either the BSCR model or an approved internal capital model. 

The BSCR model is a risk-based capital model that provides a method for determining an insurer&#8217;s capital requirements (statutory capital and surplus) by taking into account the risk characteristics of different aspects of the insurer&#8217;s business. The BSCR formulae establish capital requirements for eight categories of risk: fixed income investment risk, equity investment risk, interest rate/liquidity risk, premium risk, reserve risk, credit risk, catastrophe risk and operational risk. For each category, the capital requirement is determined by applying factors to asset, premium, reserve, creditor, probable maximum loss and operation items, with higher factors applied to items with greater underlying risk and lower factors for less risky items. 

While not specifically referred to in the Insurance Act, the BMA has also established a target capital level (&#8220;TCL&#8221;) for each Class 4 insurer equal to 120% of its ECR. While a Class 4 insurer is not currently required to maintain its statutory capital and surplus at this level, the TCL serves as an early warning tool for the BMA and failure to maintain statutory capital at least equal to the TCL will likely result in increased regulatory oversight. 

Any Class 4 insurer that at any time fails to meet its MSM requirements must, upon becoming aware of such failure, immediately notify the BMA and, within 14 days thereafter, file a written report with the BMA containing particulars of the circumstances that gave rise to the failure and setting out its plan detailing specific actions to be taken and the expected timeframe in which the company intends to rectify the failure. 

Any Class 4 insurer that at any time fails to meet its enhanced capital requirement applicable to it shall upon becoming aware of that failure, or of having reason to believe that such a failure has occurred, immediately notify the BMA in writing and within 14 days of such notification file with the BMA a written report containing particulars of the circumstances leading to the failure; and a plan detailing the manner, specific actions to be taken and time within which the insurer intends to rectify the failure and within 45 days of becoming aware of that failure, or of having reason to believe that such a failure has occurred, furnish the BMA with (i) unaudited interim statutory financial statements covering such period as the BMA may require; (ii) the opinion of a loss reserve specialist where applicable; (iii) a general business solvency certificate in respect of the financial statements; and (iv) a capital and solvency return reflecting an enhanced capital requirement prepared using post failure data where applicable. 

Eligible Capital 

To enable the BMA to better assess the quality of the insurer&#8217;s capital resources, a Class 4 insurer is required to disclose the makeup of its capital in accordance with the recently introduced &#8216;3-tiered capital system&#8217;. Under this system, all of the insurer&#8217;s capital instruments will be classified as either basic or ancillary capital, which in turn will be classified into one of 3 tiers based on their &#8220;loss absorbency&#8221; characteristics. Highest quality capital will be classified as Tier 1 Capital, lesser quality capital will be classified as either Tier 2 Capital or Tier 3 Capital. Under this regime, up to certain specified percentages of Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 Capital may be used to support the insurer&#8217;s MSM, ECR and TCL. 

The characteristics of the capital instruments that must be satisfied to qualify as Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 Capital are set out in the Insurance (Eligible Capital) Rules 2012, and any amendments thereto. Under these rules, Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 Capital may, until January 1, 2024, include capital instruments that do not satisfy the requirement that the instrument be non-redeemable or settled only with the issuance of an instrument of equal or higher quality upon a breach, or if it would cause a breach, of the ECR. 

Where the BMA has previously approved the use of certain instruments for capital purposes, the BMA&#8217;s consent will need to be obtained if such instruments are to remain eligible for use in satisfying the MSM and the ECR. 

&#32;23 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

Code of Conduct 

Every Bermuda registered insurer must comply with the Insurance Code of Conduct (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), which prescribes the duties and standards that must be complied with to ensure sound corporate governance, risk management and internal controls are implemented. The BMA will assess an insurer&#8217;s compliance with the Code in a proportionate manner relative to the nature, scale and complexity of its business. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Code will be taken into account by the BMA in determining whether an insurer is conducting its business in a sound and prudent manner as prescribed by the Insurance Act and may result in the BMA exercising its powers of intervention and investigation (see below) and, in the case of Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA, as Class 4 insurers, will be a factor in calculating the operational risk charge under the insurer&#8217;s BSCR or approved internal model. 

Restrictions on Dividends and Distributions 

A Class 4 insurer is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend if it is in breach of its MSM, ECR or minimum liquidity ratio or if the declaration or payment of such dividend would cause such a breach. Where a Class 4 insurer fails to meet its MSM or minimum liquidity ratio, it is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends during the next financial year without the approval of the BMA. 

In addition, a Class 4 insurer is prohibited from declaring or paying in any financial year dividends of more than 25% of its total statutory capital and surplus (as shown on its previous financial year&#8217;s statutory balance sheet) unless it files (at least seven days before payment of such dividends) with the BMA an affidavit signed by at least two directors (one of whom must be a Bermuda resident director if any of the insurer&#8217;s directors are resident in Bermuda) and the principal representative stating that it will continue to meet its solvency margin and minimum liquidity ratio. Where such an affidavit is filed, it shall be available for public inspection at the offices of the BMA. 

Reduction of Capital 

Neither Third Point Re nor Third Point Re USA, as general business insurers, may reduce its total statutory capital by 15% or more, as set out in their respective previous year&#8217;s financial statements, unless it has received the prior approval of the BMA. Total statutory capital consists of the insurer&#8217;s paid in share capital, its contributed surplus (sometimes called additional paid in capital) and any other fixed capital designated by the BMA as statutory capital (such as letters of credit). 

As Class 4 insurers, where either of Third Point Re or Third Point Re USA seek to reduce their statutory capital by 15% or more, as set out in their respective previous year&#8217;s financial statements, they must also submit an affidavit signed by at least two directors (one of whom must be a Bermuda resident director if any of the company&#8217;s directors are resident in Bermuda) and the principal representative stating that the proposed reduction will not cause the company to fail its relevant margins. Where such an affidavit is filed, it shall be available for public inspection at the offices of the BMA. 

Fit and Proper Controllers 

The BMA maintains supervision over the controllers of all registered insurers in Bermuda. A controller includes (i) the managing director of the registered insurer or its parent company; (ii) the chief executive of the registered insurer or of its parent company; (iii) a shareholder controller; and, (iv) any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the registered insurer or of its parent company are accustomed to act. 

The definition of shareholder controller is set out in the Insurance Act but generally refers to (i) a person who holds 10% or more of the shares carrying rights to vote at a shareholders&#8217; meeting of the registered insurer or its parent company, or (ii) a person who is entitled to exercise 10% or more of the voting power at any shareholders&#8217; meeting of such registered insurer or its parent company, or (iii) a person who is able to exercise significant influence over the management of the registered insurer or its parent company by virtue of its shareholding or its entitlement to exercise, or control the exercise of, the voting power at any shareholders&#8217; meeting. 

A shareholder controller that owns 10% or more but less than 20% of the shares as described above is defined as a 10% shareholder controller; a shareholder controller that owns 20% or more but less than 33% of the shares as described above is defined as a 20% shareholder controller; a shareholder controller that owns 33% or more but less than 50% 

&#32;24 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

of the shares as described above is defined as a 33% shareholder controller; and a shareholder controller that owns 50% or more of the shares as described above is defined as a 50% shareholder controller. 

Where the shares of the shareholder of a registered insurer, or the shares of its parent company, are traded on a recognised stock exchange, and such person becomes a 10%, 20%, 33% or 50% shareholder controller of the insurer, that person shall, within 45 days, notify the BMA in writing that he has become such a controller. 

Where the shares of a shareholder or prospective shareholder of an insurer, or the shares of its parent company, are not traded on a recognised stock exchange (i.e., private companies), the Insurance Act prohibits such person from becoming a shareholder controller unless he has first served on the BMA notice in writing stating that he intends to become such a controller and the BMA has either, before the end of 45 days following the date of notification, provided notice to the proposed controller that it does not object to his becoming such a controller or the full 45 days has elapsed without the BMA filing an objection. 

Any person who contravenes the Insurance Act by failing to give notice or knowingly becoming a controller of any description before the required 45 days has elapsed is guilty of an offence and liable to a fine of $25,000 on summary conviction. 

The BMA may file a notice of objection to any person who has become a controller of any description where it appears that such person is not, or is no longer, a fit and proper person to be a controller of the registered insurer. Before issuing a notice of objection, the BMA is required to serve upon the person concerned a preliminary written notice stating the BMA&#8217;s intention to issue formal notice of objection. Upon receipt of the preliminary written notice, the person served may, within 28 days, file written representations with the BMA, which shall be taken into account by the BMA in making its final determination. Any person who continues to be a controller of any description after having received a notice of objection shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine of $25,000 (and a continuing fine of $500 per day for each day that the offence is continuing) or, if convicted on indictment, to a fine of $100,000 and/or two years in prison. 

Notification by Registered Person of Change of Controllers and Officers 

All registered insurers are required to give written notice to the BMA of the fact that a person has become, or ceased to be, a controller or officer of the registered insurer within 45 days of becoming aware of such fact. An officer in relation to a registered insurer means a director, chief executive or senior executive performing duties of underwriting, actuarial, risk management, compliance, internal audit, finance or investment matters. 

Notification of Material Changes 

All registered insurers are required to give notice to the BMA of their intention to effect a material change within the meaning of the Insurance Act. For the purposes of the Insurance Act, the following changes are material: (i) the transfer or acquisition of insurance business being part of a scheme falling under section 25 of the Insurance Act or section 99 of the Companies Act, (ii) the amalgamation with or acquisition of another firm, (iii) engaging in unrelated business that is retail business, (iv) the acquisition of a controlling interest in an undertaking that is engaged in non-insurance business that offers services and products to persons who are not affiliates of the insurer, (v) outsourcing all or substantially all of the company&#8217;s actuarial, risk management and internal audit functions, (vi) outsourcing all or a material part of an insurer&#8217;s underwriting activity, (vii) the transfer other than by way of reinsurance of all or substantially all of a line of business, (viii) the expansion into a material new line of business, (ix) the sale of an insurer and (x) outsourcing of an officer role, effective as of January 1, 2016). 

No registered insurer shall take any steps to give effect to a material change unless it has first served notice on the BMA that it intends to effect such material change and before the end of 30 days, either the BMA has notified such company in writing that it has no objection to such change or that period has lapsed without the BMA having issued a notice of objection. 

Before issuing a notice of objection, the BMA is required to serve upon the person concerned a preliminary written notice stating the BMA&#8217;s intention to issue formal notice of objection. Upon receipt of the preliminary written notice, 

&#32;25 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

the person served may, within 28 days, file written representations with the BMA, which shall be taken into account by the BMA in making its final determination. 

Group Supervision 

The BMA may, in respect of an insurance group, determine whether it is appropriate for it to act as its group supervisor. An insurance group is defined as a group of companies that conducts exclusively, or mainly, insurance business. The BMA may make such determination where it ascertains that (i) the group is headed by a &#8220;specified insurer&#8221; (that is to say, it is headed by either a Class 3A, Class 3B or Class 4 general business insurer or a Class C, Class D or Class E long term insurer or another class of insurer designated by order of the BMA); or (ii) where the insurance group is not headed by a &#8220;specified insurer&#8221;, where it is headed by a parent company that is incorporated in Bermuda or (iii) where the parent company of the group is not a Bermuda company, in circumstances where the BMA is satisfied that the insurance group is directed and managed from Bermuda or the insurer with the largest balance sheet total is a specified insurer. 

Where the BMA determines that it should act as the group supervisor, it shall designate a specified insurer that is a member of the insurance group to be the designated insurer (the &#8220;Designated Insurer&#8221;) and it shall give to the Designated Insurer and other competent authorities written notice of its intention to act as group supervisor. Once the BMA has been designated as group supervisor, the Designated Insurer must ensure that an approved group actuary is appointed to provide an opinion as to the adequacy of the insurance group&#8217;s insurance reserves as reported in its group statutory financial statements. 

Pursuant to its powers under the Insurance Act, the BMA will maintain a register of particulars for every insurance group for which it acts as the group supervisor detailing, among other things, the names and addresses of the Designated Insurer; each member company of the insurance group falling within the scope of group supervision; the principal representative of the insurance group in Bermuda; other competent authorities supervising other member companies of the insurance group; and the insurance group auditors. The Designated Insurer must notify the BMA of any changes to the above details entered on the register of an insurance group. 

As group supervisor, the BMA will perform a number of supervisory functions including (i) coordinating the gathering and dissemination of information which is of importance for the supervisory task of other competent authorities; (ii) carrying out a supervisory review and assessment of the insurance group; (iii) carrying out an assessment of the insurance group&#8217;s compliance with the rules on solvency, risk concentration, intra-group transactions and good governance procedures; (iv) planning and coordinating, with other competent authorities, supervisory activities in respect of the insurance group, both as a going concern and in emergency situations; (v) coordinating any enforcement action that may need to be taken against the insurance group or any of its members; and (vi) planning and coordinating meetings of colleges of supervisors (consisting of insurance regulators) in order to facilitate the carrying out of the functions described above. 

In carrying out its functions, the BMA may make rules for (i) assessing the financial situation and the solvency position of the insurance group and/or its members and (ii) regulating intra-group transactions, risk concentration, governance procedures, risk management and regulatory reporting and disclosure. 

We are not currently subject to group supervision, but the BMA may exercise its authority to act as our group supervisor in the future. 

Supervision, Investigation, Intervention and Disclosure 

The BMA may, by notice in writing served on an insurer or a designated insurer (as described in &#8220;Group Supervision&#8221; above), require the insurer or designated insurer to provide such information and/or documentation as the BMA may reasonably require with respect to matters that are likely to be material to the performance of its supervisory functions under the Insurance Act. In addition, it may require such person&#8217;s auditor, underwriter, accountant or any other person with relevant professional skill to prepare a report on any aspect pertaining thereto. In the case of a report, the person so appointed shall immediately give the BMA written notice of any fact or matter of which he becomes aware or which indicates to him that any condition attaching to his registration under the Insurance Act is not or has not or may not be or may not have been fulfilled and that such matters are likely to be material to the performance of its functions under 

&#32;26 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

the Insurance Act. If it appears to the BMA to be desirable in the interests of the clients of an insurer or relevant insurance group, the BMA may also exercise these powers in relation to subsidiaries, parent companies and other affiliates of the insurer or designated insurer. 

If the BMA deems it necessary to protect the interests of the policyholders or potential policyholders of an insurer or insurance group, it may appoint one or more competent persons to investigate and report on the nature, conduct or state of the insurer&#8217;s or the insurance group&#8217;s business, or any aspect thereof, or the ownership or control of the insurer or insurance group. If the person so appointed thinks it necessary for the purposes of his investigation, he may also investigate the business of any person who is or has been at any relevant time, a member of the insurance group or of a partnership of which the person being investigated is a member. In this regard, it shall be the duty of every person who is or was a controller, officer, employee, agent, banker, auditor, accountant, barrister and attorney or insurance manager to produce to the person appointed such documentation as he may reasonably require for purposes of his investigation, and to attend and answer questions relevant to the investigation and to otherwise provide such assistance as may be necessary in connection therewith. 

Where the BMA suspects that a person has failed to properly register under the Insurance Act or that an insurer or designated insurer has failed to comply with a requirement of the Insurance Act or that a person is not, or is no longer, a fit and proper person to perform functions in relation to a regulated activity, it may, by notice in writing, carry out an investigation into such person (or any other person connected thereto). In connection therewith, the BMA may require every person who is or was a controller, officer, employee, agent, banker, auditor, accountant, barrister and attorney or insurance manager to make a report and produce such documents in his care, custody and control and to attend before the BMA to answer questions relevant to the BMA&#8217;s investigation and to take such actions as the BMA may direct. The BMA may also enter any premises for the purposes of carrying out its investigation and may petition the court for a warrant if it believes a person has failed to comply with a notice served on him or there are reasonable grounds for suspecting the completeness of any information or documentation produced in response to such notice or that its directions will not be complied with or that any relevant documents would be removed, tampered with or destroyed. 

If it appears to the BMA that the business of the insurer is being so conducted that there is a significant risk of the insurer becoming insolvent, or that the insurer is in breach of the Insurance Act or any conditions imposed upon its registration, or the minimum criteria stipulated in the Insurance Act is not or has not been fulfilled in respect of a registered insurer, or that a person has become a controller without providing the BMA with the appropriate notice or in contravention of a notice of objection, or the registered insurer is in breach of its ECR, or that a designated insurer is in breach of any provision of the Insurance Act or the regulations or rules applicable to it, the BMA may issue such directions as appear desirable for safeguarding the interests of policyholders or potential policyholders of the insurer or the insurance group. The BMA may direct an insurer, for itself and in its capacity as designated insurer of the insurance group of which it is a member, (1) not to take on any new insurance business, (2) not to vary any insurance contract if the effect would be to increase the insurer&#8217;s liabilities, (3) not to make certain investments, (4) to realize certain investments, (5) to maintain in, or transfer to the custody of, a specified bank, certain assets, (6) not to declare or pay any dividends or other distributions or to restrict the making of such payments, (7) to limit its premium income, (8) not to enter into specified transactions with any specified person or persons of a specified class, (9) to provide such written particulars relating to the financial circumstances of the insurer as the BMA thinks fit, (10) (as an individual insurer only and not in its capacity as designated insurer) to obtain the opinion of a loss reserve specialist and submit it to the BMA and/or (11) to remove a controller or officer. 

The BMA has the power to assist other regulatory authorities, including foreign insurance regulatory authorities, with their investigations involving insurance and reinsurance companies in Bermuda if it is satisfied that the assistance being requested is in connection with the discharge of regulatory responsibilities and that such cooperation is in the public interest. The grounds for disclosure by the BMA to a foreign regulatory authority without consent of the insurer are limited and the Insurance Act provides for sanctions for breach of the statutory duty of confidentiality. 

Cancellation of Insurer&#8217;s Registration 

An insurer&#8217;s registration may be canceled by the BMA on certain grounds specified in the Insurance Act. Failure by the insurer to comply with its obligations under the Insurance Act, or if the BMA believes that the insurer has not been 

&#32;27 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

carrying on business in accordance with sound insurance principles, could result in an insurer&#8217;s registration being canceled. 

In addition to powers under the Insurance Act to investigate the affairs of an insurer, the BMA may require certain information from an insurer (or certain other persons) to be produced to the BMA. Further, the BMA has been given powers to assist other regulatory authorities, including foreign insurance regulatory authorities, with their investigations involving insurance and reinsurance companies in Bermuda but subject to restrictions. For example, the BMA must be satisfied that the assistance being requested is in connection with the discharge of regulatory responsibilities of the foreign regulatory authority. Further, the BMA must consider whether cooperation is in the public interest. The grounds for disclosure are limited and the Insurance Act provides for sanctions for breach of the statutory duty of confidentiality. 

Certain Other Bermuda Law Considerations 

All Bermuda &#8220;exempted companies&#8221; are exempt from certain Bermuda laws restricting the percentage of share capital that may be held by non-Bermudians. However, exempted companies may not participate in certain business transactions, including (i) the acquisition or holding of land in Bermuda except that required for their business and held by way of lease or tenancy for terms of not more than 50 years or, with the consent of the Minister of Finance, land that is used to provide accommodation or recreational facilities for officers and our employees for a term not exceeding 21 years, (ii) the taking of mortgages on land in Bermuda to secure an amount in excess of $50,000 without the consent of the Minister, (iii) the acquisition of any bonds or debentures secured by any land in Bermuda, other than certain types of Bermuda government securities or securities issued by Bermuda public authorities or, (iv) the carrying on of business of any kind in Bermuda, except in furtherance of the business carried on outside Bermuda or under license granted by the Minister. Generally it is not permitted without a special license granted by the Minister to insure Bermuda domestic risks or risks of persons of, in or based in Bermuda. 

All Bermuda companies must comply with the provisions of the Companies Act regulating the payment of dividends and making distributions from contributed surplus. A company may not declare or pay a dividend, or make a distribution out of contributed surplus, if there are reasonable grounds for believing that: (i) the company is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due; or (ii) the realizable value of the company&#8217;s assets would thereby be less than its liabilities. 

United States Insurance Regulation 

Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA are licensed in Bermuda to write reinsurance and are not admitted to do business in any jurisdiction in the United States or in any country other than Bermuda. The insurance laws of each state of the United States and of many foreign countries regulate the sale of insurance and reinsurance within their jurisdictions by alien insurers and reinsurers, such as Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA. 

Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA currently intend to conduct their business so as not to be subject to the licensing requirements of insurance regulators in the United States or elsewhere (other than Bermuda). Many aspects of the activities of Third Point Re and Third Point Re USA are similar to those employed by other non-admitted reinsurers that provide reinsurance to U.S. and other ceding companies. There can be no assurance, however, that insurance regulators in the United States or elsewhere will not review the activities of Third Point Re or Third Point Re USA and claim that Third Point Re or Third Point Re USA is subject to such jurisdiction&#8217;s licensing requirements. 

In addition to the regulatory requirements imposed by the jurisdictions in which they are licensed, reinsurers are subject to indirect regulatory requirements imposed by jurisdictions in which their ceding companies are licensed through the &#8220;credit for reinsurance&#8221; mechanism. In general, a ceding company that obtains reinsurance from a reinsurer that is licensed, accredited or approved by the jurisdiction or state in which the insurer files statutory financial statements is permitted to reflect in its statutory financial statements a credit in an aggregate amount equal to the liability for unearned premiums and loss reserves and loss adjustment expense reserves ceded to the reinsurer. 

In the United States, many states allow credit for reinsurance ceded to a reinsurer that is domiciled and licensed in another state of the United States and meets certain financial requirements. A few states do not allow credit for reinsurance ceded to non-licensed reinsurers except in certain limited circumstances and others impose additional requirements that make it difficult to become accredited. The great majority of states, however, permit the reduction in statutory 

&#32;28 &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

surplus resulting from reinsurance obtained from a non-licensed or non-accredited reinsurer to be offset to the extent that the reinsurer provides a letter of credit or other acceptable security arrangement, and a few states reduce the amount of security to be posted based on a number of factors, including the credit rating given to a reinsurer from a U.S.-nationally recognised statistical rating organization. 

Information Technology 

We have a disaster recovery plan with respect to our information technology infrastructure that includes arrangements with an offshore data center. Our secondary off-island location for data systems back-up and recovery is located in Toronto, Canada, providing a remote site, that we believe is unlikely to be subject to the same disaster events that might impair our operations in Bermuda. The environment is configured to be live within one hour of a disaster scenario and supports the necessary business capabilities of our Bermuda and U.S. operations. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 26 employees, 19 of whom were based in Bermuda, 6 of whom were based in the United States and 1 of whom was based in the United Kingdom. We believe that our employee relations are good. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements, and we are not aware of any current efforts to implement such agreements.

You may read and copy any documents that we file at the SEC&#8217;s public reference room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. You may call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 to obtain further information about the public reference room. In addition, the SEC maintains an Internet website ( www.sec.gov ) that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding registrants that file electronically with the SEC, including us. You may also access, free of charge, our reports filed with the SEC (for example, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those forms) through the &#8220;Investors&#8221; portion of our Internet website ( www.thirdpointre.bm ). Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC will be available as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with or furnished to the SEC. Our website is included in this Annual Report as an inactive textual reference only. The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report filed with or furnished to the SEC. 

Because Third Point Reinsurance Ltd. has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the debt securities issued by TPRUSA in February 2015, no separate filings are made by TPRUSA with the SEC. See Note 25 &#32;to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding TPRUSA.
