Water Supplies and Contracts 

&#160;

Our New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania water supply systems are physically separate and are not interconnected. In New Jersey, the Pinelands System and Bayview System are not interconnected with the Middlesex System or each other. We believe that we have adequate sources of water supply to meet the current service requirements of our present customers in New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania.

&#160; 

Middlesex System 

&#160;

Our Middlesex System, which produced approximately 14.4 billion gallons in 2015, obtains water from surface sources and wells, or groundwater sources. In 2015, surface sources of water provided approximately 72% of the Middlesex System&#8217;s water supply, groundwater sources provided approximately 21% from 31 wells and the balance was purchased from a non-affiliated water utility. Middlesex System&#8217;s distribution storage facilities are used to supply water to customers at times of peak demand, outages and emergencies. 

&#160;

The principal source of surface water for the Middlesex System is the Delaware &#38; Raritan Canal, which is owned by the State of New Jersey and operated as a water resource by the New Jersey Water Supply Authority (NJWSA). Middlesex is under a contract with the NJWSA, which expires November 30, 2023, and provides for average purchases of 27.0 million gallons per day (mgd) of untreated water from the Delaware &#38; Raritan Canal, augmented by the Round Valley/Spruce Run Reservoir System. The untreated surface water is pumped to and treated at the Middlesex Carl J. Olsen (CJO) Water Treatment Plant. Middlesex also has an agreement with a non-affiliated regulated water utility for the purchase of treated water. This agreement, which expires February 27, 2021, provides for minimum purchase of 3.0 mgd of treated water with provisions for additional purchases.

4&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Tidewater System 

&#160;

Our Tidewater System produced approximately 2.1 billion gallons in 2015 from 163 wells. Tidewater will submit applications to Delaware regulatory authorities for the approval of additional wells as growth, demand and water quality warrant. Tidewater augments its water production with annual minimum purchases of 15.0 million gallons of treated water under contract with the City of Dover, Delaware. Tidewater does not have a central water treatment facility for the 375 separate communities it serves. As the number has grown, many of Tidewater&#8217;s individual systems have been interconnected forming several regional systems that are served by multiple water treatment facilities. 

&#160; 

Pinelands Water System 

&#160; 

Water supply to our Pinelands Water System is derived from four wells which produced approximately 151.9 million gallons in 2015. The pumping capacity of the four wells is 2.2 mgd.

&#160; 

Pinelands Wastewater System 

&#160; 

The Pinelands Wastewater System discharges into the South Branch of the Rancocas Creek through a tertiary treatment plant that provides clarification, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection. The total capacity of the plant is 0.5 mgd, and the system treated approximately 102.0 million gallons in 2015.

&#160; 

Bayview System 

&#160; 

Water supply to Bayview customers is derived from two wells, which produced approximately 7.3 million gallons in 2015.

&#160; 

TESI System 

&#160;

The TESI System is comprised of eight wastewater treatment systems in Kent and Sussex Counties, Delaware. The treatment plants provide clarification, sedimentation, and disinfection. The combined total treatment capacity of the plants is 0.7 mgd. The TESI System treated approximately 107.1 million gallons in 2015.

&#160; 

Twin Lakes System 

&#160; 

Water supply to Twin Lakes&#8217; customers is derived from one well, which produced approximately 19.8 million gallons in 2015.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had a total of 293 employees. No employees are represented by a union. We believe our employee relations are positive. Wages and benefits are reviewed annually and are considered competitive within both the industry and the regions where we operate.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

Our business in our franchised service areas is substantially free from direct competition with other public utilities, municipalities and other entities. However, our ability to provide contract water supply and wastewater services and operations and maintenance services that are not under the jurisdiction of a state public utility commission is subject to competition from other public utilities, municipalities and other entities. Although Tidewater and TESI have been granted exclusive franchises for each of their existing community water and wastewater systems, their ability to expand service areas can be affected by the Delaware Public Service Commission awarding franchises to other regulated water and wastewater utilities with whom we compete for such franchises and for projects.

5&#160;

&#160;

Regulation 

&#160;

Our rates charged to customers for water and wastewater services, the quality of the services we provide and certain other matters are regulated by the following state utility commissions (collectively, the Utility Commissions):

&#183; New Jersey-New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU) &#183; Delaware-Delaware Public Service Commission (DEPSC) &#183; Pennsylvania-Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission (PAPUC) &#160;

Our USA, USA-PA and White Marsh subsidiaries are not regulated public utilities. However, they are subject to environmental regulation with respect to water quality and wastewater effluent quality to the extent such services are provided.

&#160;

We are subject to environmental and water quality regulation by the following regulatory agencies (collectively, the Government Environmental Regulatory Agencies):

&#183; United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) &#183; New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) with respect to operations in New Jersey &#183; Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services-Division of Public Health (DEDPH), and the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) with respect to operations in Delaware &#183; Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) with respect to operations in Pennsylvania &#160;

In addition, our issuances of equity securities are subject to the prior approval of the NJBPU and require registration with the SEC. Our issuances of long-term debt securities are subject to the prior approval of the appropriate Utility Commissions.

&#160; 

Regulation of Rates and Services 

&#160;

For ratemaking purposes, we account separately for operations in New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania to facilitate independent ratemaking by the applicable Utility Commissions.

&#160;

In determining our regulated utility rates, the respective Utility Commissions consider the revenue, expenses, rate base of property used and useful in providing service to the public and a fair rate of return on investments within their separate jurisdictions. Rate determinations by the respective Utility Commissions do not guarantee particular rates of return to us for our New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania operations. Thus, we may not achieve the rates of return permitted by the Utility Commissions. In addition, there can be no assurance that any future rate increases will be granted or, if granted, that they will be in the amounts requested.

&#160; 

Middlesex Rate Matters 

&#160; 

In August 2015, Middlesex&#8217;s Petition to the NJBPU seeking permission to increase base water rates was concluded, based on a negotiated settlement, resulting in an increase in annual operating revenues of $5.0 million. The base water rate increase request of $9.5 million, filed in March 2015, was necessitated by declining consumption by Middlesex&#8217;s Commercial and Industrial class customers, increasing benefit costs for active and retired employees, capital infrastructure investments and regulation-driven increases in other operations and maintenance costs. The new base water rates are designed to recover the increased costs and lost revenues, as well as a return on invested capital in rate base of $219.0 million, based on a return on equity of 9.75%. The rate increase became effective on August 29, 2015, which was significantly earlier than under standard procedural schedules. Concurrent with the increase Middlesex was required to reset its Distribution System Improvement Charge (DSIC) to zero. A DSIC is a rate-mechanism that allows water utilities to recover investments in, and generate a return on, qualifying capital improvements to their water distribution system made between base rate proceedings. The Middlesex DSIC had been in effect since May 2015, and had generated less than $0.1 million of revenues.

6&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In June 2014, Middlesex&#8217;s Petition to the NJBPU seeking permission to increase base water rates was partially approved, granting an increase in annual operating revenues of $4.2 million. The originally-filed base water rate increase request of $10.6 million, filed in November 2013 (subsequently revised to $8.1 million, primarily resulting from lower employee benefit plan costs), was necessitated by capital investments Middlesex had made, or committed to make, increased operations and maintenance costs and reduced revenues resulting from the expiration of a wholesale water sales contract with the Borough of Sayreville, New Jersey in August 2013. In addition, Middlesex&#8217;s largest retail water customer, Hess Corporation, ceased its oil refining operations at its Port Reading, New Jersey facility in February 2013. The new base water rates were designed to recover the increased costs and lost revenues, as well as a return on invested capital in rate base of $208.6 million, based on a return on equity of 9.75%. The rate increase became effective on July 20, 2014.

&#160; 

Tidewater Rate Matters 

&#160; 

The DEPSC approved a $0.8 million increase in Tidewater&#8217;s annual base water rates, effective August 19, 2014. The originally-filed base water rate increase request of $3.9 million, filed in November 2013 (subsequently revised to $2.5 million, primarily resulting from lower employee benefit plan costs), was necessitated by capital investments Tidewater had made, or committed to make, as well as increased operations and maintenance costs. In connection with the rate increase application, Tidewater implemented a DEPSC approved 6.5% interim rate increase, subject to refund, on February 6, 2014. Since the final required and approved rate increase was less than the interim rate increase, Tidewater refunded $0.4 million of previously deferred revenues to customers in the form of a one-time credit to each customer account.

&#160;

Effective January 1, 2016, Tidewater increased its DEPSC-approved DSIC rate, which is expected to generate additional revenues of approximately $0.2 million annually.

&#160;

In April 2014, the DEPSC approved Tidewater&#8217;s 50-year agreement with the United States Department of Defense for the privatization of the water system of Dover Air Force Base (DAFB) in Dover, Delaware. On October 1, 2014, Tidewater assumed ownership of the DAFB water utility assets and began providing regulated water service to DAFB under Tidewater&#8217;s DEPSC approved tariff rates.

&#160; 

TESI Rate Matters 

&#160; 

On October 1, 2013, TESI closed on its DEPSC-approved purchase of the wastewater utility assets of the Plantations development (the Plantations) for $0.4 million and began providing wastewater services to the 600 residential customers in the Plantations in Delaware. Upon commencing service to the Plantations, annual revenues were approximately $0.2 million. In October 2014, TESI implemented a 33.5% Plantations base wastewater rate increase (approximately $0.1 million annually).

&#160; 

Pinelands Rate Matters 

&#160; 

In October 2015, Pinelands Water and Pinelands Wastewater filed separate petitions with the NJBPU seeking permission to increase base rates by approximately $0.3 million and $0.2 million per year, respectively. These requests were necessitated by capital infrastructure investments both companies have made, or have committed to make, increased operations and maintenance costs and lower non-fixed fee revenues for both companies. We cannot predict whether the NJBPU will ultimately approve, deny, or reduce the amount of the requests. A decision by the NJBPU in either matter is not expected until the third quarter of 2016.

&#160; 

In March 2013, the NJBPU approved a combined $0.2 million increase in Pinelands Water and Pinelands Wastewater&#8217;s annual base water and wastewater revenues. In its initial request, filed in August 2012, Pinelands had sought an increase of $0.3 million on a combined basis. The rate increase for water service, which was approximately 50% of the approved increase, was phased-in over one year.

7&#160;

&#160;

Southern Shores Rate Matters 

&#160; 

Under the terms of a multi-year DEPSC-approved agreement expiring in 2020, customer rates will increase on January 1 st of each year to generate additional annual revenue of $0.1 million with each increase.

&#160; 

Twin Lakes Rate Matters 

&#160; 

In November 2015, Twin Lakes filed a Petition with the PAPUC seeking permission to increase its base water rates by approximately $0.2 million per year. This request was necessitated by capital infrastructure investments Twin Lakes has made, or committed to make, and increased operations and maintenance costs. We cannot predict whether the PAPUC will ultimately approve, deny, or reduce the amount of the requests. A decision by the PAPUC is not expected until the third quarter of 2016.

&#160; 

Future Rate Filings 

&#160; 

Management monitors the need for rate relief for our regulated subsidiaries on an ongoing basis. When capital improvements (both made and planned) and/or increases in operation and maintenance costs require rate relief, base rate increase requests are expeditiously filed with those subsidiaries&#8217; Utility Commissions.

&#160; 

Water and Wastewater Quality and Environmental Regulations 

&#160;

Government environmental regulatory agencies regulate our operations in New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania with respect to water supply, treatment and distribution systems and the quality of the water. They also regulate our operations with respect to wastewater collection, treatment and disposal.

&#160;

Regulations relating to water quality require us to perform tests to ensure our water meets state and federal quality requirements. In addition, government environmental regulatory agencies continuously review current regulations governing the limits of certain organic compounds found in the water as byproducts of the treatment process. We participate in industry-related research to identify the various types of technology that might reduce the level of organic, inorganic and synthetic compounds found in water. The cost to water companies of complying with the proposed water quality standards depends in part on the limits set in the regulations and on the method selected to treat the water to the required standards. We regularly test our water to determine compliance with existing government environmental regulatory agencies&#8217; primary water quality standards.

&#160;

Treatment of well water in our Middlesex System is by chlorination for primary disinfection purposes. In addition, at certain locations, air stripping is used for removal of volatile organic compounds.

&#160;

Surface water treatment in our Middlesex System is by conventional treatment; coagulation, sedimentation and filtration. The treatment process includes pH adjustment, chlorination for disinfection, and corrosion control for the distribution system.

&#160; 

Treatment of well water in our Tidewater System is by chlorination for disinfection purposes and, in some cases, pH correction and filtration for nitrate and iron removal and granular activated carbon filtration for organics removal. Chloramination is used for final disinfection at Southern Shores.

&#160;

Treatment of well water in the Pinelands, Bayview and Twin Lakes Systems (primary disinfection only) is performed at individual well sites.

&#160;

The NJDEP, DEDPH and PADEP monitor our activities and review the results of water quality tests that are performed for adherence to applicable regulations. Other applicable regulations include the Federal Lead and Copper Rule, the Federal Surface Water Treatment Rule and the Federal Total Coliform Rule and regulations for maximum contaminant levels established for various volatile organic compounds.

&#160;

8&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160;

Customer demand for our water during the warmer months is generally greater than other times of the year due primarily to additional consumption of water in connection with irrigation systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other outside water use. Throughout the year, and particularly during typically warmer months, demand may vary with temperature and rainfall timing and overall levels. In the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the customer demand for our water may decrease and therefore, adversely affect our revenues.
