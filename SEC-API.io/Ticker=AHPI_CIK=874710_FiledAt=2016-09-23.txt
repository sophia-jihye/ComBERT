Respiratory Care Products 

&#160; 

Market. Respiratory care products are used in the treatment of acute and chronic respiratory disorders such as asthma, emphysema, bronchitis and pneumonia. Respiratory care products are used in both hospitals and alternate care settings. Sales of respiratory care products are made through distribution channels focusing on hospitals and other sub-acute facilities. Sales of home respiratory care products are made through durable medical equipment dealers through telemarketing, and by contract sales with national chains.

&#160; 

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Respiratory Care/Anesthesia Products. The Company manufactures and sells a broad range of products for use in respiratory care and anesthesia delivery, including carbon dioxide absorbents. These products include large volume air compressors, calibration equipment, humidifiers, croup tents, equipment dryers and a complete line of respiratory disposable products such as oxygen tubing, facemasks, cannulas and ventilator circuits.

&#160;

Home Respiratory Care Products. Allied&#8217;s broad line of home respiratory care products include aluminum oxygen cylinders, oxygen regulators, pneumatic nebulizers, portable suction equipment and a full line of respiratory disposable products.

&#160;

Medical Gas Equipment

&#160; 

Market . The market for medical gas equipment consists of hospitals, alternate care settings and surgery centers. The medical gas equipment group is broken down into three separate categories: construction products, regulation devices and suction equipment, and disposable cylinders.

&#160;

Construction Products. Allied&#8217;s medical gas system construction products consist of in-wall medical system components, central station pumps and compressors, and headwalls. These products are typically installed during construction or renovation of a health care facility and are built in as an integral part of the facility&#8217;s physical plant. Typically, the contractor for the facility&#8217;s construction or renovation purchases medical gas system components from manufacturers and ensures that the design specifications of the health care facility are met.

&#160;

Allied&#8217;s in-wall components, including outlets, manifolds, alarms, ceiling columns and zone valves, serve a fundamental role in medical gas delivery systems.

&#160;

Central station pumps and compressors are individually engineered systems consisting of compressors, reservoirs, valves and controls designed to drive a hospital&#8217;s medical gas and suction systems. Each system is designed specifically for a given hospital or facility, which purchases pumps and compressors from suppliers. The Company&#8217;s sales of pumps and compressors are driven, in large part, by its share of the in-wall components market. 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s construction products are sold primarily to hospitals, alternate care settings and hospital construction contractors. The Company believes that these products are installed in more than three thousand hospitals in the United States. The Company believes that most hospitals and sub-acute care facility construction spending is for expansion or renovation of existing facilities. Many hospital systems and individual hospitals undertake major renovations to upgrade their operations to improve the quality of care they provide, reduce costs and attract patients and personnel.

&#160;

Regulation Devices and Suction Equipment. The Company&#8217;s medical gas system regulation products include flowmeters, vacuum regulators and pressure regulators, as well as related adapters, fittings and hoses which measure, regulate, monitor and help transfer medical gases from walled piping or equipment to patients in hospital rooms, operating theaters or intensive care areas.

&#160;

Portable suction equipment is typically used when in-wall suction is not available or when medical protocol specifically requires portable suction. The Company also manufactures disposable suction canisters, which are clear containers used to collect the fluids suctioned by in-wall or portable suction systems. The containers have volume calibrations, which allow the medical practitioner to measure the volume of fluids suctioned.

&#160;

The market for regulation devices and suction equipment includes hospital and sub-acute care facilities. Sales of these products are made through the same distribution channel as our respiratory care products. The Company believes that it holds a significant share of the U.S. market in both regulation devices and suction equipment.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Disposable Cylinders. Disposable oxygen cylinders are designed to provide oxygen for short periods of time in emergency situations. Since they are not subjected to the same pressurization as standard containers, they are much lighter and less expensive than standard gas cylinders. The Company markets filled disposable oxygen cylinders through industrial safety distributors and similar customers, principally to first aid providers, restaurants, industrial plants and other customers that require oxygen for infrequent emergencies.

&#160; 

Emergency Medical Products 

&#160; 

Market . Emergency medical products are used in the treatment of trauma-induced injuries. The Company&#8217;s emergency medical products provide patient resuscitation or ventilation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation or respiratory distress as well as immobilization and treatment for burns. The Company expects that additional countries will develop trauma care systems in the future, although no assurance can be given that such systems will develop or that they will have a favorable impact on the Company. Sales of emergency medical products are made through specialized emergency medical products distributors to ambulance companies, fire departments and emergency medical systems volunteer organizations.

&#160;

The emergency medical products are broken down into two categories: respiratory/resuscitator products and trauma patient handling products.

&#160;

Respiratory/Resuscitation Products. The Company&#8217;s respiratory/resuscitation products include demand resuscitation valves, portable resuscitation systems, bag masks and related products, emergency transport ventilators, precision oxygen regulators, minilators, multilators and humidifiers.

&#160; 

Demand resuscitation valves are designed to provide 100% oxygen to breathing or non-breathing patients. In an emergency situation, they can be used with a mask or tracheotomy tubes and operate from a standard regulated oxygen system. The Company&#8217;s portable resuscitation systems provide fast, simple and effective means of ventilating a non-breathing patient during cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 100% oxygen to breathing patients on demand with minimal inspiratory effort. The Company also markets a full line of disposable and reusable bag mask resuscitators, which are available in a variety of adult and child-size configurations. Disposable mouth-to-mask resuscitation systems have the added advantage of reducing the risk of transmission of communicable diseases.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s autovent transport ventilator can meet a variety of needs in different applications ranging from typical emergency medical situations to more sophisticated air and ground transport. Each autovent is accompanied by a patient valve, which provides effective ventilation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation or respiratory distress. When administration of oxygen is required at the scene of a disaster, in military field hospitals or in a multiple-victim incident, Allied&#8217;s minilators and multilators are capable of providing oxygen to one or a large number of patients.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s transport and mass casualty ventilation line has been designed to meet the unique ventilation demands that affect everyday inter-hospital and intra-hospital transport scenarios, and amplify exponentially during a mass casualty event or pandemic. Our ventilators for transport and mass casualty are rugged, easy to operate, and capable of providing reliable ventilation even in unpredictable environments and conditions. Additionally, they are affordable to purchase and require little periodic maintenance, minimizing the cost of ownership over time. 

&#160;

To complement the family of respiratory/resuscitation products, the Company offers a full line of oxygen product accessories. This line of accessory products includes reusable aspirators, tru-fit masks, disposable cuffed masks and related accessories.

&#160;

Trauma and Patient Handling Products. The Company&#8217;s trauma and patient handling products include spine immobilization products, pneumatic anti-shock garments and trauma burn kits. Spine immobilization products include a backboard that is designed for safe immobilization of injury victims and provides a durable and cost effective means of emergency patient transportation and extrication. The infant/pediatric immobilization board is durable and scaled for children. The half back extractor/rescue vest is useful for both suspected cervical/spinal injuries and for mountain and air rescues. The Company&#8217;s pneumatic anti-shock garments are used to treat victims experiencing hypovolemic shock. Allied&#8217;s trauma burn kits contain a comprehensive line of products for the treatment of trauma and burns.

&#160;

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

Allied sells its products primarily to hospitals, hospital equipment dealers, hospital construction contractors, home health care dealers, emergency medical products dealers and others. The Company maintains a sales force of 17 sales professionals, all of whom are full-time employees of the Company.

&#160;

The sales force includes seven domestic hospital, homecare and emergency specialists, four domestic construction specialists, and three international sales representatives. A total of three sales managers lead each of the sales groups. A product manager is responsible for the marketing activities of our product lines.

&#160;

The domestic hospital specialists are responsible for sales of all Allied products with the exception of construction products within their territory. Sales of hospital products are accomplished through respiratory care/anesthesia distributors for the regulation devices, suction equipment, respiratory care/anesthesia products and disposable cylinders. The domestic construction specialists are responsible for sales of all Allied construction products within their territory. Emergency products are principally sold to ambulance companies, fire departments and emergency medical systems volunteer organizations through specialized emergency medical products distributors.

&#160;

Construction products are sold direct to hospital construction contractors and through distributors.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s international specialists sell all Allied products within their territory. Allied&#8217;s net sales to foreign markets totaled 24% of total net sales in fiscal 2016, 23% in 2015 and 25% in 2014. International sales are made through a network of dealers, agents and U.S. exporters who distribute the Company&#8217;s products throughout the world. Allied has market presence in Canada, Mexico, Central and South America, Europe, the Middle East and the Far East.

&#160;

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

Allied&#8217;s manufacturing processes include fabrication, electro-mechanical assembly operations, plastics manufacturing, and chemical processing with automated packaging. A significant part of Allied&#8217;s manufacturing operations involves electro-mechanical assembly of proprietary products and the Company is vertically integrated in most elements of metal machining and fabrication. Most of Allied&#8217;s hourly employees are involved in machining, metal fabrication, plastics manufacturing and product assembly.

&#160;

Allied manufactures small metal components from bar stock in a machine shop, which includes automatic screw machines, horizontal lathes and drill presses and computer controlled machining centers. The Company makes larger metal components from sheet metal using computerized punch presses, brake presses and shears. In its plastics manufacturing processes, the Company utilizes both extrusion and injection molding. In its chemical process, the Company utilizes mixing, drying, and sizing equipment. The Company believes that its production facilities and equipment are in good condition and sufficient to meet planned increases in volume over the next few years and that the conditions in local labor markets should permit the implementation of additional shifts and days operated.

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Allied Healthcare Products&#8217; research and development group is responsible for the development of new products. This group is staffed with mechanical and electrical engineers.

&#160;

During fiscal year 2016 the research and development group continued to support the launch of the AHP300 and AHP300P ventilators.

&#160;

The group is actively working on other products that were not released during the fiscal year 2016.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Government Regulation

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s products and its manufacturing activities are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation by federal and state authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, medical devices for human use are subject to comprehensive review by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;FDA&#8221;). The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (&#8220;FDC Act&#8221;), and other federal statutes and regulations, govern or influence the research, testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of such products. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in warning letters, fines, recall or seizure of products, injunction, refusal to permit products to be imported into or exported out of the United States, refusal of the government to clear or approve marketing applications or to allow the Company to enter into government supply contracts, or withdrawal of previously approved marketing applications and criminal prosecution.

&#160;

The Company is required to file a premarket notification in the form of a premarket approval (&#8220;PMA&#8221;) with the FDA before it begins marketing a new medical device that offers new technology that is currently not on the market. The Company also must file a premarket notification in the form of a 510(k) with the FDA before it begins marketing a new medical device that utilizes existing technology for devices that are currently on the market. The 510(k) submission process is also required when the Company makes a change or modifies an existing device in a manner that could significantly affect the device&#8217;s safety or effectiveness.

&#160;

Compliance with the regulatory approval process in order to market a new or modified medical device can be uncertain, lengthy and, in some cases, expensive. There can be no assurance that necessary regulatory approvals will be obtained on a timely basis, or at all. Delays in receipt or failure to receive such approvals, the loss of previously received approvals, or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations.

&#160;

The Company manufactures and distributes a broad spectrum of respiratory therapy equipment, emergency medical equipment and medical gas equipment. To date, all of the Company&#8217;s FDA clearances have been obtained through the 510(k) clearance process. These determinations are very fact specific and the FDA has stated that, initially, the manufacturer is best qualified to make these determinations, which should be based on adequate supporting data and documentation. The FDA however, may disagree with a manufacturer&#8217;s determination not to file a 510(k) and require the submission of a new 510(k) notification for the changed or modified device. Where the FDA believes that the change or modification raises significant new questions of safety or effectiveness, the agency may require a manufacturer to cease distribution of the device pending clearance of a new 510(k) notification. Certain of the Company&#8217;s medical devices have been changed or modified subsequent to 510(k) marketing clearance of the original device by the FDA. Certain of the Company&#8217;s medical devices, which were first marketed prior to May 28, 1976, and therefore, grandfathered and exempt from the 510(k) notification process, also have been subsequently changed or modified. The Company believes that these changes or modifications do not significantly affect the devices&#8217; safety or effectiveness, or make a major change or modification in the devices&#8217; intended uses and, accordingly, submission of new 510(k) notification to the FDA is not required. There can be no assurance, however, that the FDA would agree with the Company&#8217;s determinations.

&#160;

In addition, commercial distribution in certain foreign countries is subject to additional regulatory requirements and receipt of approvals that vary widely from country to country. The Company believes it is in compliance with regulatory requirements of the countries in which it sells its products.

&#160;

The Medical Device Reporting regulation requires that the Company provide information to the FDA on deaths or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of its devices, as well as product malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. The Medical Device Tracking regulation requires the Company to adopt a method of device tracking of certain devices, such as ventilators, which are life-supporting or life-sustaining devices used outside of a device user facility, some of which are permanently implantable devices. The regulation requires that the method adopted by the Company will ensure that the tracked device can be traced from the device manufacturer to the person for whom the device is indicated (i.e., the patient). In addition, the FDA prohibits a company from promoting an approved device for unapproved applications and reviews a company&#8217;s labeling for accuracy. Labeling and promotional activities also are in certain instances, subject to scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s medical device manufacturing facilities are registered with the FDA, and have received ISO 9001 certification under the Medical Device Directive (MDD - European) for certain products in 1998, and ISO 13485 certification in 2002. The Company&#8217;s St. Louis facility is ISO 9001:2008 certified and ISO13485:2003 certified. The Company&#8217;s Stuyvesant Falls facility is ISO13485:2003 certified. The Company is subject to audit by the FDA, International Organization for Standardization (&#8220;ISO&#8221;), and European auditors for compliance with the Good Manufacturing Practices (&#8220;GMP&#8221;), the ISO, CMDCAS, and MDD regulations for medical devices. These regulations require the Company to manufacture its products and maintain its products and documentation in a prescribed manner with respect to design, manufacturing, testing and control activities. The Company also is subject to the registration and inspection requirements of state regulatory agencies.

&#160;

There can be no assurance that any required FDA or other governmental approval will be granted, or, if granted, will not be withdrawn. Governmental regulation may prevent or substantially delay the marketing of the Company&#8217;s proposed products and cause the Company to undertake costly procedures. In addition, the extent of potentially adverse government regulation that might arise from future administrative action or legislation cannot be predicted. Any failure to obtain, and maintain, such approvals could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s ability to market its products or proposed products.

&#160;

Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. Medical products shipped to the European Community generally require CE certification. The letters &#8220;CE&#8221; are an abbreviation of Conformit&#233; Europ&#233;enne, French for European conformity. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a device by a comparable regulatory authority of a foreign country generally must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing in those countries. The time required to obtain such approvals may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In addition, FDA approval may be required under certain circumstances to export certain medical devices.

&#160;

The Company is also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protections, fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances.

&#160; 

Patents, Trademarks and Proprietary Technology 

&#160; 

The company owns and maintains domestic and foreign patents on several products it believes are useful to the business and provided the Company with an advantage over its competitors. During fiscal 2016 the company received a foreign patent on the Litholyme&#174; carbon dioxide absorbent product. The company continues to seek U.S. and foreign patents on the EPV200 and AHP300 ventilators.

&#160;

Patents which will expire in the period of 2016 to 2033 in the aggregate are believed to be of material importance in the operation of Allied&#8217;s business. Allied believes no single patent, except that related to Litholyme&#174;, is material in relation to Allied&#8217;s future business as a whole. Although the expiration of an individual patent may lead to increased competition, other factors such as a competitor&#8217;s need to obtain regulatory approvals prior to marketing a competitive product and the nature of the market, may allow Allied to continue to have commercial advantages after the expiration of the patent.

&#160;

The company owns and maintains U.S. trademarks for Allied Healthcare Products Inc., Chemetron, Gomco, Oxequip, Lif-O-Gen, Life Support Products, Timeter, Vacutron and Schuco, its principle trademarks. Registrations for these trademarks are also owned and maintained in countries where such products are sold and such registrations are considered necessary to preserve the Company&#8217;s proprietary rights therein.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Environmental and Safety Regulation 

&#160;

The Company is subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the treatment, storage and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes. The Company is also subject to the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and similar state statutes. From time to time, the Company has been involved in environmental proceedings involving cleanup of hazardous waste. There are no such material proceedings currently pending. Costs of compliance with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material to the Company. The Company believes it is in material compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

The Company has different competitors within each of its product lines. Many of the Company&#8217;s principal competitors are larger than the Company and have greater financial and other resources. The Company competes primarily on the basis of price, quality and service. The Company believes that it is well positioned with respect to product cost, brand recognition, product reliability, and customer service to compete effectively in each of its markets.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

At June 30, 2016, the Company had approximately 236 full-time employees. Approximately 139 employees in the Company&#8217;s principal manufacturing facility located in St. Louis, Missouri, are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that will expire on May 31, 2018.
