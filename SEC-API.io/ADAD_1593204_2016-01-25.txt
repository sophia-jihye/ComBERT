 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

General 

&#160;

Adaiah Distribution Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit company on September 12, 2013 and established a fiscal year end of October 31. We have generated revenues of $197,146 through October 31, 2015, have $25,634 in assets, $5,198 in liabilities and have incurred losses of $23,675 since inception. We are a development-stage company formed to develop and distribute our product to the pillow industry. It is our goal to do business in the U.S., Russia and the European Union. To date, we have had some business operations. We have developed our business plan and executed contracts with Ningbo Hounuo Plastic Co., LTD, Hangzhou Yintex Co., Ltd, Suemon Furniture Co., Ltd, Vision Industry Co., Ltd and E&#38;O International Trade Co., Ltd, where we engage these companies as independent contractors for the specific purpose of developing, manufacturing and supplying products to us. Adaiah Distribution Inc. will then distribute these neck, head, donut, lumbar, decorative, throw and orthopedic pillows to our customers.

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

We received the initial equity funding of $4,000 from our sole officer and director who purchased 4,000,000 shares of our common stock at $0.001 per share. In January 2015, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of common stock to 30 independent persons pursuant to the Registration Statement on Form S-1 for total cash proceeds of $40,000. 

&#160;

Our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills.

&#160;

Because we were not able to raise sufficient capital to execute our full business plan, we are now engaged in discussions with third parties regarding alternative directions for the Company that could enhance shareholder value. As of the date of filing this Report on Form 10-K, we have not entered into any definitive agreement to change our direction. The description of our business below assumes that we will continue with our business as originally planned. However, as noted above, we are in discussions that could lead to another direction for the Company.

&#160;

We currently have revenues from operations but there is no guarantee this will continue or there will be enough gross profit to sustain operations. If we need additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. We may need more funds for business operations in the next year, and we may have to revert to obtaining additional money.

&#160;

We had generated $197,146 in revenue through October 31, 2015. Our cost of sales was $137,553 which included $134,373 in pillow purchases and $3,180 in sales commissions. Our independent salespeople are paid a commission of 10% of the initial sale to the customer. Commissions are not paid on any re-orders from the same customer. In this way we encourage new sales instead of the salesperson making one sale and getting paid from it during the lifetime of the customer account. The revenue was the result of pillow sales. Right now we are focusing on distributing ready made products from our suppliers, however we have produced and sold a number of custom pillows from our sewing shop.

&#160;

The Company qualifies as an "emerging growth company" as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act (the "JOBS Act"). We intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As well, our election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until they apply to private companies. Therefore, as a result of our election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.

History of the Pillow 

&#160;

The pillow has a strong historical presence wherever people have been civilized enough to desire more comfort than that of the floor or a piece of furniture. The first people to use pillows were those who lived in early civilizations of Mesopotamia around 7,000 BC. During this time, only the wealthy and more fortunate people of the world were the ones who used pillows. The number of pillows symbolized status so the more pillows one owned the more affluence he or she held. Pillows have always been produced around the world in order to help solve the old, re-occurring problem of neck, back, and shoulder pain while sleeping. The pillow was also used in order to keep bugs and insects out of people's hair, mouth, nose, and ears while sleeping.

&#160;

Pillow use has been associated with the mummies and tombs of ancient Egypt dating back to 2055-1985 B.C. Ancient Egyptian pillows were wooden or stone headrests. These pillows were mostly used by placing them under the heads of the deceased because the head of a human was considered to be the essence of life and sacred. The Romans and Greeks of ancient Europe mastered the creation of the softer pillow. These pillows were stuffed with reeds, feathers, and straw in order to make them softer and more comfortable. Only upper-class people typically owned these softer pillows, however all classes of people used some type of pillow while sleeping in order to give them support. People in ancient Europe started to use pillows when going to church in order to kneel on while praying and to place holy books on. This is a tradition that still lives on today. Additionally, the Romans and Greeks used their pillows by placing them under the head of those deceased just like the ancient Egyptians did. European pillows continue to have a lot of popularity still to this day because of their beauty and quality.

&#160;

Chinese dynasties used pillows that were made from a wide range of materials including bamboo, jade, porcelain, wood, and bronze. Porcelain pillows became the most popular. The use of the porcelain pillow first appeared in the Sui Dynasty between 581 and 618 while mass production of the porcelain pillow appeared in the Tang Dynasty between 618 and 907. The Chinese decorated their pillows by making them different shapes and by painting pictures of animals, humans, and plants on them. Ancient Chinese porcelain pillows reached their peak in terms of production and use during the Song, Jin, and Yuan dynasties between the 10th and 14th century, but slowly phased out during the Ming and Qing dynasties between 1368 and 1911 with the emergence of better pillow making materials.

&#160;

How a pillow is constructed 

&#160;

Internally, a pillow comprises a filler, often made from foam, synthetic plastic fibers, feathers, or down and viscoelastic foam and latex. Traditionally straw was used as filler, but this is uncomfortable and rarely used today. Feathers and down are the most expensive and usually the most comfortable; they offer the advantage of softness and their ability to conform to shapes desired by the user, more so than foam or fiber pillows. One of the disadvantages of a down-filled pillow is that a significant number of people are allergic to them. There are currently hypoallergenic varieties of down pillows to allow people sensitive to down to enjoy the comfort of feather or down pillows. In Asia, buckwheat is a common filler, as are plastic imitations. Such pillows tend to be smaller than a standard pillow. In India, cotton is also a common filler and is considered to be healthier than synthetic fills.

&#160;

The fill is surrounded with a cover or shell made of cloth, such as silk, known as the pillow case or pillow slip. Some pillows have a fancier cover called a sham which is closed on all sides and usually has a slit in the back through which the pillow is placed. Rectangular standard bed pillow cases usually do not have zippers, but instead have one side open all the time, however, a zippered pillow protector is often placed around standard pillows with the case in turn covering the protector. It is generally recommended that all types of pillow covers be laundered periodically since they are the part that is in contact with a person's body. But even with regular washing, pillows tend to accumulate dust and microbes among the fill and it is recommended that they be replaced every few years, especially for those with allergies.

Types of pillows 

&#160;

Neck pillows support the neck by providing a deep area for the head to rest and a supportive area to keep the neck in alignment with the spine while sleeping. These can also be known as cervical pillows.

&#160;

Travel pillows provide support for the neck in a sitting position. Their "U" shape fits around the back of the neck and keeps the head from slipping into an uncomfortable and possibly harmful position during sleep. However, U-shaped pillows can sometimes force the head forwards creating neck stiffness.

&#160;

Donut pillows are firm pillows shaped like a torus, with a space in the middle to alleviate pressure on the tailbone area while sitting. These pillows are used primarily by individuals who have suffered an injury to the tailbone area or who suffer pain from hemorrhoids or another ailment of the colon. 

&#160;

Lumbar pillows are designed to support the inward curve of the lower back, filling the space created between the lower back and the back of the chair when in a sitting position. These pillows are generally used to support the lower back while driving or sitting, such as in an office chair. Orthopedic pillows are similar to Memory foam pillows.

&#160;

Decorative Pillows serve a dual purpose. They likely have fancy cover material which serves to decorate the room where they are found. When used to decorate a fully made up bed, decorative pillows are likely thrown aside at bedtime, since they are not covered with a washable pillow case, thus, while found on the bed, they are primarily there for decoration, hence they fall under this category. These pillows may be custom made, as well as made by freelancers.

&#160;

Decorative pillows are also found on furnishings in more public parts of the home, such as sofas, chairs and window seats. Here, their common use may overlap both orthopedic and bed pillows. For example, unless a person has some particular medical condition, they will likely use a handy decorative pillow for lumbar support, as needed, while seated on a sofa. Likewise, for the occasional nap, decorative pillows are handy for supporting the head or neck, even though they are not covered with a pillow case, as are bed pillows.

&#160;

The state of the consumer and distributor market for pillows 

&#160;

Management believes the state of the consumer and distributor market for pillows continues to expand and grow. This belief is primarily based upon internet market research and discussions with manufacturers, suppliers and distributors. Based upon this research, Management believes the following are the key points in determining the state of the industry:

&#160;

1. Decorative pillows are generally considered a cheap way to spruce up your home while sleep pillows are increasingly marketed as a way to enhance health.

2. China and India currently dominate the pillow production market and are likely to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.Their marketposition is based largely on low-cost, high volume, Western-designed goods.

3. Many buyers and consumers seek unique specialty products.While there continues to be a market for standard pillow design there is a growing market for smaller production, unique designs. Products that combineunique elements with modern designs are a growing category and represent an opportunityfor our company.

4. Low-end (with a priority on low prices) and high-end (with priority on high quality) markets continue to expand.Competition at the low end is strong and requires very large production capacity. Thehigh-end market tends to focus on unique designs, high quality, and small quantitieswith flexibility design and pricing.

5. There is a growing market for home accessory products, particularly in the high-end segment. It is expected to grow not only in Western markets but in all regions as middle-class populations expand.

6. Purchasers of all types of pillows prefer multiple product options to choose from, flexibility to make design modifications and reliable suppliers.There are many producers and suppliers of pillow products, in order to stay competitive we will have to stand out among them, we plan to do this by focusing on customer service and reliable delivery.

Target Market 

&#160;

We have already identified major distributors of neck, head, donut, lumbar, decorative, throw and orthopedic pillows in the USA and intend to market directly to these distributors upon completion of our Public Offering. The initial list of distributors we obtained using internet . Future distributors we are planning to obtain via expo and trade shows. It is our goal to do business in the U.S., Russia and the European Union. We are planning to focus our business plan on those markets for next year to establish relationship with major distribution companies, after that, if we are successful in the U.S. market, we may expand to Canada and Mexico using the same strategy.

&#160;

Our main clients are distributors but in some areas there are no distributors so we will sell directly to the public. Most of the revenue will be received from distributors as they are our main target market. We do not currently have any agreements or contracts with distributors. The sales to date have been made by our independent sales representatives. In the future as we grow and have the ability to fulfill large orders and negotiate pricing we may enter into agreements or contracts with distributors if it is in the best interests of the company.

&#160;

Marketing 

&#160;

In places where are no distributors we are planning to market our products using these resources:

&#160;

- Internet advertising (Google AdSence)

- Magazine advertising (Design Trade magazine)

- Expo Show (TransWorld's Jewelry, Fashion &#38; Accessories Show)

&#160;

Direct contact with distributors 

&#160;

We have identified some distributors of neck, head, donut, lumbar, decorative, throw and orthopedic pillows in the U.S. and intend to market directly to these distributors.

&#160;

Industry advertising 

&#160;

We intend to advertise online and using ads in industry-related magazines. Some sites and industry media have already been identified. Media advertising campaign will coincide with Trade Show marketing campaign.

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

Freight 

&#160;

Product availability is also a key component of sales. We have researched delivery methods, cost and estimated delivery times to all major markets. Based on the fact that our pillows will be produced in China, we anticipate 15 days delivery time to the U.S.

&#160;

Contracts 

&#160;

We have executed the contracts with Ningbo Hounuo Plastic Co., LTD, Hangzhou Yintex Co., Ltd, Suemon Furniture Co., Ltd, Vision Industry Co., Ltd and E&#38;O International Trade Co., Ltd manufacturing companies having a principal office and manufacturing facilities in China and Hong Kong. According to the agreements, these companies have agreed to develop and manufacture and supply us with pillow products. These companies will develop, test, manufacture and supply the pillow products under the terms and conditions contained in the agreement. The material terms of the Contract are the following:

&#160; &#160;

Revenue 

&#160;

- Our revenue is a 20-30% mark up: depending on quantity of the order. If it is a large order we may give a lower mark-up, if it is a small order or custom order the mark-up may be greater. This is general estimation of our mark up. We looked at our competitors sales prices, at the cost of product from our suppliers and came up with an approximate mark-up figure. We can adjust it if need be so. In any case, it is going to be just an estimate until we have more sales.

- Manufacturer gives us 90 days to pay an invoice and we give to our customers 30-60 days depending on a quantity of the order to pay their invoices which allows us to make sales without initial investment for neck, head, donut, lumbar, decorative, throw and orthopedic pillows.

- We do not keep warehousing and shipping within the country because all the products will be going directly to our customers from the manufacturer eliminating our storage costs. The customer is responsible for any shipping charges.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

There are few barriers of entry in the neck, head, donut, lumbar, decorative, throw and orthopedic pillows distribution business and level of competition is extremely high. There are many domestic and international distributors of neck, head, donut, lumbar, decorative, throw and orthopedic pillows. We are in direct competition with them. Many large distributors have greater financial capabilities than us and will be able to provide more favorable services to the potential customers. Many of these companies have a greater, more established customer base than us. We likely lose business to such companies. Also, many of these companies are able to afford to offer better prices for similar neck, head, donut, lumbar, decorative, throw and orthopedic pillows than us which may also cause us to lose business.

&#160;

Insurance 

&#160;

We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

We are a development stage company and currently have no employees, other than, Nikolay Titov, our president and director. We currently have three independent sales representatives to sell are product. Our independent salespeople are paid a commission of 10% of the initial sale to the customer. Commissions are not paid on any re-orders from the same customer. In this way we encourage new sales instead of the salesperson making one sale and getting paid from it during the lifetime of the customer account.

&#160;

Offices 

&#160;

Our business office is located at Poruka iela 3 Madona, LV-4801 Latvia. This is the office provided by our President and Director, Nikolay Titov. Our office is a part of a Mr. Titov's residence. Our phone number is (775)375-5240. We do not pay any rent to Mr. Titov and there is no agreement to pay any rent in the future. 

&#160;

Our president and director, Nikolay Titov currently takes care of our administrative duties from his office in the Latvia. The Latvia office is used for communication with customers and distributors and holds all related samples and paperwork as well as serving as a shipping destination if necessary.

&#160;

&#160; 8 

&#160; &#160;

On January 28, 2014 we purchased for $16,940US a 1,969 sq. ft. building on approximately 2 acres of land located at 10 Oktyabrskaya St., Manchazh Settlement, Artinsky District, Sverdlovsk Oblast, Russia. The building was formerly used as a sewing shop and we were able to purchase the contents of the building which includes 8 sewing machines. The building has one office area of $650 sq. ft. and the remaining is production floor area. Management currently has 5 independent contractors who will work on orders for custom pillows at this location when we receive orders. The maximum number of pillows that could be produced per week at this location is estimated at 250 pieces. 

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

We are required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the neck, head, donut, lumbar, decorative, throw and orthopedic pillows distribution business in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities. All products imported from China and Hong Kong are required to meet U.S. standards so we do not believe that regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business.

&#160;

Legal Proceedings 

&#160;

We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings, and we are not aware of any pending or potential legal actions.

&#160;

Emerging Growth Company Status under the JOBS Act 

&#160;

Adaiah Distribution Inc. qualifies as an "emerging growth company" as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act (the "JOBS Act"). 

&#160;

The JOBS Act creates a new category of issuers known as "emerging growth companies." Emerging growth companies are those with annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion (as indexed for inflation) during their most recently completed fiscal year. The JOBS Act is intended to facilitate public offerings by emerging growth companies by exempting them from several provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and its regulations. An emerging growth company will retain that status until the earliest of:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

The first fiscal year after its annual revenues exceed $1 billion;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

The first fiscal year after the fifth anniversary of its IPO;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

The date on which the company has issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the previous three-year period; and

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

The first fiscal year in which the company has a public float of at least $700 million.

&#160;

Financial and Audit Requirements 

&#160;

Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies are subject to scaled financial disclosure requirements. Pursuant to these scaled requirements, emerging growth companies may:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Provide only two rather than three years of audited financial statements in their IPO Registration Statement;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Provide selected financial data only for periods no earlier than those included in the IPO Registration Statement in all SEC filings, rather than the five years of selected financial data normally required;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards until they are made applicable to private companies; and

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Be exempted from compliance with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires companies to receive an outside auditor's attestation regarding the issuer's internal controls.

&#160;

&#160; 9 

&#160; 

&#160;

Offering Requirements 

&#160;

In addition, during the IPO offering process, emerging growth companies are exempt from:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Restrictions on analyst research prior to and immediately after the IPO, even from an investment bank that is underwriting the IPO;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Certain restrictions on communications to institutional investors before filing the IPO registration statement; and

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

The requirement initially to publicly file IPO Registration Statements. Emerging growth companies can confidentially file draft Registration Statements and any amendments with the SEC. Public filings of the draft documents must be made at least 21 days prior to commencement of the IPO "road show."

&#160;

Other Public Company Requirements 

&#160;

Emerging growth companies are also exempt from other ongoing obligations of most public companies, such as:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

The requirements under Section 14(i) of the Exchange Act and Section 953(b)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act to disclose executive compensation information on pay-for-performance and the ratio of CEO to median employee compensation;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Certain other executive compensation disclosure requirements, such as the compensation discussion and analysis, under Item 402 of Regulation S-K; and

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

The requirements under Sections 14A(a) and (b) of the Exchange Act to hold advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments.

&#160;

Smaller Reporting Company 

&#160;

We have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this annual report, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Further, we may continue to take advantage of these reduced reporting requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies even if we no longer qualify as an "emerging growth company." 

&#160;

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to use the extended transition period provided above and therefore our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.

&#160;

We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a "large accelerated filer" as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.
