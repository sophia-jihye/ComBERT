 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Southwestern Energy Company (including its subsidiaries, collectively, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;Southwestern&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is an independent natural gas and oil company with operations predominantly in the United States, engaged in exploration , development and production activities, including related natural gas gathering and marketing. Southwestern is a holding company whose assets consist of direct and indirect ownership interests in, and whose business is conducted substantially through, its subsidiaries. Southwestern&#8217;s common and preferred stock are listed and traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbols &#8220;SWN&#8221; and &#8220;SWNC&#8221;, respectively. 

&#160; 

Southwestern, which was incorporated in Arkansas in 1929 and reincorporated in Delaware in 2006, has its executive offices located at 10000 Energy Drive, Spring, Texas 77389, and can be reached by phone at 832-796-1000. The Company also maintains offices in Conway, Arkansas; Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania; and Jane Lew, West Virginia. 

&#160; 

Our Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Our Company is guided by our formula, which represents the essence of our corporate philosophy and how we operate our business: 

Our formula, which stands for &#8220;The Right People doing the Right Things, wisely investing the cash flow from our underlying Assets will create Value+,&#8221; also guides our business strategy. The key elements of our business strategy , &#160; along with how we are implement ing them in the current low commodity price environment , are as follows: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Maintain a Strong Balance Sheet and Liquidity to Enhance Long-Term Shareholder Value. We believe a strong balance sheet and liquidity position are important to long-term value creation and extremely valuable in challenging pricing environments, helping to preserve options and flexibility. 

o 

What We Are Doing Now. &#160; As commodity prices fell during 2015, we reduced our capital program by approximately $800 million from what we expected early in the year. We are also committed to investing within cash flow levels rather than increasing debt in this lower-price environment. Although we have opportunities that meet our investment threshold described below, we are currently not drilling new wells as we focus on decreasing our debt levels. If and when prices improve and sufficient cash flow is generated, we expect to increase our activity levels and pursue these opportunities. With respect to debt and maturities, early in 2015 we paid off $5.0 billion of bank debt with long-term notes and equity, and late in the year we increased our liquidity by $750 million by entering into a three-year term loan and utilized the proceeds to pay down our revolving credit facility. We continue to look at ways to reduce debt levels and extend maturities . 

&#183; 

Exercise Capital Discipline. We prepare an economic analysis for our drilling programs and other investments based upon the expected net present value added for each dollar to be invested, which we refer to as Present Value Index, or PVI. We target creating an average of at least a 1.3 PVI in our projects using a 10% discount rate. Our actual PVI results are utilized to help determine the allocation of our future capital investments and are reflected in our management compensation. This disciplined investment approach governs our investment decisions at all times, including the current lower-price commodity market. 

o 

What We Are Doing Now. We continuously reassess our price expectations used in calculating expected PVI to align with market conditions. The current price environment reduces the number of wells and other projects that meet our PVI threshold, but even at current prices, we have projects that we expect would generate 1.3 PVI or above. As discussed above, the timing of those projects depends on availability of capital. 

&#183; 

Maximizing Margins and Production Available for Sale. We concentrate our operations in large, scalable projects, such as our large positions in Northeast Appalachia, Southwest Appalachia and the Fayetteville Shale. We believe this allows us the economies of scale that drives efficiency and learning opportunities. These efficiencies and learnings help improve future well results and enhance the economics of our portfolio. They also allow us to continuously identify ways to lower costs in each asset in which we operate. We routinely review costs in detail and analyze processes implemented, materials used and vendor relationships to enhance our economics and cost structure. 

&#160;

o 

What We Are Doing Now. Cost control has been a differentiator for us in the past, and we believe our focus on costs gives us a competitive advantage as we move into the future. We have successfully renegotiated contracts, improved well results and implemented continuous process improvements in each of our operating areas, resulting in these differentiating cost savings. 

&#160; 

Our predominant operations, which we refer to as Exploration and Production (&#8220;E&#38;P&#8221;), are focused on the finding and development of natural gas and oil reserves. We are also focused on creating and capturing additional value through our natural gas gathering and marketing segment, which we refer to as Midstream Services. We conduct substantially all of our business through subsidiaries. 

&#160; 

Exploration and Production - Our primary business is the exploration for and production of natural gas and oil, with our current operations principally focused within the United States on development of unconventional natural gas reservoirs located in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Arkansas. Our operations in northeast Pennsylvania are primarily focused on the unconventional natural gas reservoir known as the Marcellus Shale (herein referred to as &#8220;Northeast Appalachia&#8221;), our operations in West Virginia are also focused on the Marcellus Shale, the Utica and the Upper Devonian unconventional natural gas and oil reservoirs (herein referred to as &#8220;Southwest Appalachia&#8221;) and our operations in Arkansas are primarily focused on an unconventional natural gas reservoir known as the Fayetteville Shale. Collectively, our properties located in Pennsylvania and West Virginia are herein referred to as the &#8220;Appalachian Basin.&#8221; We also actively seek to find and develop new natural gas and oil plays with significant exploration and exploitation potential, which we refer to as &#8220;New Ventures.&#8221; We have exploration and production activities ongoing in Colorado and Louisiana along with other areas in which we are currently exploring for new development opportunities. We also have drilling rigs located in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Arkansas and provide oilfield products and services, principally serving our exploration and production operations. 

&#160; 

&#160; Midstream Services &#8211; Through our affiliated midstream subsidiaries, we engage in natural gas gathering activities in Arkansas and Louisiana. These activities primarily support our E&#38;P operations and generate revenue from fees associated with the gathering of natural gas. Our marketing activities capture opportunities that arise through the marketing and transportation of the natural gas, oil and NGLs produced in our E&#38;P operations. 

&#160; 

Historically, the vast majority of our operating income and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization and any non-cash impairment of natural gas and oil properties , (gain) loss on derivatives, excluding derivatives, settled , gain on sale of assets and certain one-time charges (&#8220;Adjusted EBITDA&#8221;), have been derived from our E&#38;P business. However, in 2015, depressed commodity prices significantly decreased our E&#38;P results. In 2015, our E&#38;P business had an operating loss of $154 million, excluding non-cash impairment s of natural gas and oil properties , and constituted 75% of our Adjusted EBITDA, had operating income of $1,013 million in 2014 and constituted 82% of our Adjusted EBITDA and had an operating income of $879 million in 2013 and constituted 81% of our Adjusted EBITDA . The remainder of our consolidated operating income and Adjusted EBITDA in each of these years was primarily generated from Midstream Services. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. We refer you to &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Results of Operations &#8212; Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures&#8221; in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report for a table that reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss). 

&#160; 

Recent Developments 

&#160; 

CEO Succession. In January 2016, Steve Mueller, Chief Executive Officer since 2009, announced his retirement. He will remain on the Board of Directors as Non-Executive Chairman through the annual shareholder meeting in May 2016. Bill Way, previously the President and Chief Operating Officer of the company, was named Chief Executive Officer to replace Mr. Mueller. Mr. Way retained his title of President and was appointed to the Board of Directors. 

&#160; 

Workforce Reduction. In January 2016, as a result of lower anticipated drilling activity we announced a 40% workforce reduction of approximately 1,100 employees , which included a majority of employees in our oilfield services businesses . This reduction should be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Exploration and Production 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Operations in our E&#38;P segment are primarily in the Appalachian Basin and Fayetteville Shale assets. We also have conducted additional exploration and production activities in other basins targeting various formations as part of our New Ventures projects. 

&#160; 

Our E&#38;P segment recorded an operating loss of $7,104 million in 2015, operating income of $1,013 million in 2014, and operating income of $879 million in 2013. The operating loss in 2015 was primarily a result of $7.0 billion, or $4.3 billion net of taxes, non-cash impairments of natural gas and oil properties due to the fall in commodity prices. Operating income for 2014 increased $134 million compared to 2013 as a result of an increase in revenue of $403 million from higher production volumes, an increase in revenue of $55 million from increased realized prices, offset by an increase in operating costs and expenses of $324 million associated with the expansion of our operations and higher activity levels in Northeast Appalachia and the Fayetteville Shale. In May 2015, we divested of our East Texas and Arkoma properties, previously referred to as the Ark-La-Tex division. 

&#160; 

Adjusted EBITDA from our E&#38;P segment was $1.1 billion in 2015, compared to $1.9 billion in 2014 and $1.6 billion in 2013. Our Adjusted EBITDA decreased in 2015 as lower realized natural gas prices and increased total operating costs and expenses due to increased activity levels more than offset the revenue impacts of higher production volumes. Our Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2014 as higher realized natural gas prices and production volumes more than offset increased total operating costs and expenses due to increased activity levels. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. We refer you to &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Results of Operations &#8211; Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures&#8221; in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report for a table that reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss). 

&#160; 

Oilfield Services Vertical Integration 

&#160; 

We seek to provide oilfield services that are strategic and economically beneficial for our E&#38;P operations when our E&#38;P activity levels support these activities. This vertical integration lowers our net well costs, allows us to operate safely and efficiently and mitigates certain operational environmental risks. Among others, these services include drilling, hydraulic fracturing and the mining of proppant used for our well completions. In 2016 through February 23, these operations have largely been inactive and w e expect lower activity in these areas in 2016 due to reduced drilling activity resulting from lower commodity prices. 

&#160; 

Drilling Services 

&#160; 

We have conduct ed drilling operations for a majority of our operated wells. As of December 31, 2015, we had 13 re-entry rigs and 2 spudder rigs which were located in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Arkansas. In 2015, we provided drilling services for 82, 41 and 230 wells that we operate in Northeast Appalachia, Southwest Appalachia and the Fayetteville Shale, respectively, and were able to reduce our drilling costs on average by 1%, 2% and 1% per well for the wells we drilled in Northeast Appalachia, Southwest Appalachia and the Fayetteville Shale, respectively. 

&#160; 

Hydraulic Fracturing 

&#160; 

We provide pressure pumping services for a portion of our operated wells. As of December 31, 2015, we operated 2 leased pressure pumping spreads with a total capacity of approximately 72,000 horsepower to conduct a variety of completion services designed to stimulate natural gas production. In 2015, we provided pressure pumping services for 192 wells that we operated in the Fayetteville Shale and were able to reduce our well completion costs on average by 6% per well for the wells we completed. 

&#160; 

Sand Mine 

&#160; 

Since 2009, we have owned and operated a sand mine to provide a reliable supply of proppant primarily used for the completion of our wells that we operate in the Fayetteville Shale. As of December 31, 2015, our sand mine is comprised of 570 acres and produces 30/70 and 100 mesh sized sand. In 2015, we provided sand for the completion of 261 wells operated by us in the Fayetteville Shale and were able to reduce our well completion costs on average by 11% per well for the wells for which we provided sand. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our Proved Reserves 

&#160; 

Our estimated proved natural gas and oil reserves were 6,215 Bcfe at year-end 2015, compared to 10,747 Bcfe at year-end 2014 and 6,976 Bcfe at year-end 2013. The significant decrease in our reserves in 2015 was primarily due to downward price revisions in our proved undeveloped reserves associated with decreased commodity prices, partially offset by upward performance revisions in Northeast Appalachia and Southwest Appalachia and our successful development programs in the Northeast Appalachia, Southwest Appalachia and the Fayetteville Shale. The significant increase in our reserves in 2014 was primarily due to the acquisition of approximately 413,000 net acres in Southwest Appalachia, our successful development drilling programs in Northeast Appalachia and the Fayetteville Shale and upward performance revisions in Northeast Appalachia. Because our proved reserves are primarily natural gas, our reserve estimates and the after-tax PV-10 measure, or standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved natural gas and oil reserve quantities, are highly dependent upon the natural gas price used in our reserve and after-tax PV-10 calculations. In order to value our estimated proved natural gas, NGL and oil reserves as of December 31, 2015, we utilized average prices from the first day of each month from the previous 12 months for Henry Hub natural gas of $2.59 per MMBtu for natural gas, West Texas Intermediate oil of $46.79 per barrel for oil and $6.82 per barrel for NGLs compared to $4.35 per MMBtu for natural gas, $91.48 per barrel for oil and $23.79 per barrel for NGLs at December 31, 2014 and $3.67 per MMBtu for natural gas, $93.42 per barrel for oil and $43.45 per barrel for NGLs at December 31, 2013. 

&#160; 

Our after-tax PV-10 was $2.4 billion at year-end 2015, $7.5 billion at year-end 2014, and $3.7 billion at year-end 2013. The decrease in our after-tax PV-10 value in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to lower average natural gas, oil and NGL prices. The increase in our after-tax PV-10 value in 2014 over 2013 was primarily due to an increase in our reserves and higher average natural gas prices. The difference in after-tax PV-10 and pre-tax PV-10 (a non-GAAP measure which is reconciled in the 2015 Proved Reserves by Category and Summary Operating Data table below) is the discounted value of future income taxes on the estimated cash flows. Our year-end 2015 after-tax PV-10 computation does not have future income taxes because our tax basis in the associated oil and gas properties exceeded expected pre-tax cash inflows . &#160; Our year-end 2015 estimated proved reserves had a present value of estimated future net cash flows before income tax, or pre-tax PV-10, of $2 .4 billion, compared to $9.5 billion at year-end 2014 and $5.1 billion at year-end 2013. 

&#160; 

We believe that the pre-tax PV-10 value of the estimated cash flows related to our estimated proved reserves is a useful supplemental disclosure to the after-tax PV-10 value. While pre-tax PV-10 is based on prices, costs and discount factors that are comparable from company to company, the after-tax PV-10 is dependent on the unique tax situation of each individual company. We understand that securities analysts use pre-tax PV-10 as one measure of the value of a company&#8217;s current proved reserves and to compare relative values among peer companies without regard to income taxes. We refer you to Note 4 in the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our standardized measure of discounted future cash flows related to our proved natural gas , oil and NGL reserves, to the risk factor &#8220;Our proved natural gas , &#160; oil and NGL reserves are estimates. Any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated&#8221; in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report, and to &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report for a discussion of the risks inherent in utilization of standardized measures and estimated reserve data. 

&#160; 

At year-end 2015, 95% of our estimated proved reserves were natural gas and 93% of total estimated proved reserves were classified as proved developed, compared to 91% and 55%, respectively, in 2014 and 100% and 61%, respectively in 2013. We operate, or if operations have not commenced, plan to operate, approximately 98% of our reserves, based on the pre-tax PV-10 value of our proved developed producing reserves, and our reserve life index approximated 6.4 years at year-end 2015. In 2015, natural gas sales accounted for 93% of total operating revenues, compared to nearly 100% in 2014 and 2013. 

&#160; 

&#160;

The following table provides an overall and categorical summary of our natural gas, oil and NGL reserves, as of fiscal year-end 2015 based on average fiscal year prices, and our well count, net acreage and PV-10 as of December 31, 2015 and sets forth 2015 annual information related to production and capital investments for each of our operating areas:

The 2013 proved undeveloped reserve additions are primarily associated with the increase in gas prices. 

(3) 

Primarily associated with the undeveloped locations that were added throughout the year in 2014 due to our successful drilling program. 

(4) 

Primarily due to changes associated with the analysis of updated data collected in the year and decreases related to current year production. 

(5) 

Our acquisition of reserves in place is attributable to the purchase of undeveloped locations in West Virginia and southwest Pennsylvania. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 443 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves, all of which we expect will be developed within five years of the initial disclosure as the starting reference date. During 2015, we invested $869 million in connection with converting 1,044 Bcfe, or 22%, of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2014 into proved developed reserves and ad ded 176 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserve additions in the Appalachian Basin and the Fayetteville Shale. As a result of the depressed commodity price environment in 2015, we had downward price revisions of 4, 217 Bcfe which were slightly offset &#160; by a 733 Bcfe increase due to performance revisions. As of December 31, 2014, we had 4,796 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves. During 2014, we invested $767 million in connection with converting 790 Bcfe, or 29%, of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2013 into proved developed reserves and added 2,643 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserve additions in the Appalachian Basin and the Fayetteville Shale. Our December 31, 2015 proved reserves include 217 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves from 75 locations that have a positive present value on an undiscounted basis in compliance with proved reserve requirements but do not have a positive present value when discounted at 10%. These properties have a negative present value of $34 million when discounted at 10%. We have made a final investment decision and are committed to developing these reserves within the next five years. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We expect that the development costs for our proved undeveloped reserves of 443 Bcfe as of December 31, 2015 will require us to invest an additional $2 35 million for those reserves to be brought to production. Our ability to make the necessary investments to generate these cash inflows is subject to factors that may be beyond our control. The decreased commodity price environment has resulted, and could continue to result, in certain reserves no longer being economic to produce, leading to both lower proved reserves and cash flows. We refer you to the risk factors &#8220;Natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids prices greatly affect our revenues, profitability, liquidity and growth and the value of our assets,&#8221; &#8220;Significant capital expenditures are required to replace our reserves and conduct our business,&#8221; and &#8220;Lower commodity prices may impair our ability to service our existing debt or refinance it when it becomes due&#8221; in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report and to &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report for a more detailed discussion of these factors and other risks. 

&#160; 

Our Reserve Replacement 

&#160; 

The reserve replacement ratio measures the ability of an exploration and production company to add new reserves to replace the reserves that are being depleted by its current production volumes. The reserve replacement ratio, which we discuss below, is an important analytical measure used by investors and peers in the E&#38;P industry to evaluate performance results and long-term prospects. There are limitations as to the usefulness of this measure, as it does not reflect the type of reserves or the cost of adding the reserves or indicate the potential value of the reserve additions. 

&#160; 

In 2015, our reserve replacement ratio was negatively affected by net downward revisions of 4,083 Bcfe primarily as a result of the depressed commodity price environment. Excluding reserve revisions, we replaced 72% of our production volumes with 592 Bcfe of proved reserve additions and 114 Bcfe of proved reserve additions as a result of acquisitions. Of the reserve additions, 416 Bcfe were proved developed and 176 Bcfe were proved undeveloped. In 2015, downward reserve revisions resulting from lower natural gas, oil and NGL prices totaled 2,315 Bcf, 1,875 Bcfe, 1,496 Bcf and 32 Bcfe in our Northeast Appalachia, Southwest Appalachia, Fayetteville Shale and other divisions, respectively. We also had upward performance revisions in 2015 of 1,383 Bcf, 209 Bcfe, 10 Bcf and 33 Bcfe in our Northeast Appalachia, Southwest Appalachia, Fayetteville Shale and other divisions, respectively. Additionally, our reserves decreased by 179 Bcfe as a result of our sale of natural gas and oil leases and wells in 2015. 

&#160; 

In 2014, we replaced 591% of our production volumes with 1,693 Bcfe of proved reserve additions, net upward revisions of 543 Bcfe, and 2,304 Bcfe of proved reserve additions as a result of acquisitions. Of the reserve additions, 531 Bcfe were proved developed and 1,162 Bcfe were proved undeveloped. In 2014, upward reserve revisions resulting from higher gas prices totaled 38 Bcf, 10 Bcf and 6 Bcf in our Fayetteville Shale, Northeast Appalachia and Ark-La-Tex divisions, respectively. We also had performance revisions in 2014 of (126) Bcf, 636 Bcf and (21) Bcf in our Fayetteville Shale, Northeast Appalachia and Ark-La-Tex divisions, respectively. Additionally, our reserves increased by 2,304 Bcfe in 2014 as a result of acquisitions primarily associated with acreage in Southwest Appalachia. Our reserve replacement ratio, excluding reserve revisions, was 520% in 2014. 

&#160; 

In 2013, we replaced 550% of our production volumes with 3,285 Bcfe of proved reserve additions, net upward revisions of 326 Bcfe, and 4 Bcfe of proved reserve additions as a result of acquisitions. Of the reserve additions, 945 Bcfe were proved developed and 2,340 Bcfe were proved undeveloped. In 2013, upward reserve revisions resulting from higher gas prices totaled 191 Bcf, 35 Bcf and 21 Bcf in our Fayetteville Shale, Northeast Appalachia and Ark-La-Tex divisions, respectively. We also had upward performance revisions in 2013 of 16 Bcf, 62 Bcf and 1 Bcf in our Fayetteville Shale, Northeast Appalachia and New Ventures divisions, respectively. Additionally, our reserves increased by 4 Bcf in 2013 as a result of our acquisition of natural gas leases and wells. Our reserve replacement ratio, excluding reserve revisions, was 501% in 2013. 

&#160; 

For the period ended December 31, 2015, our three-year average reserve replacement ratio, including revisions and acquisitions, was 199%. Excluding reserve revisions and acquisitions, our three-year average reserve replacement ratio was 232%. 

&#160; 

Since 2005, the substantial majority of our reserve additions have been generated from our Fayetteville Shale division. However, over the past several years, Northeast Appalachia has also contributed to an increasing amount of our reserve additions as a result of increased development activity, totaling 419 Bcf, 836 Bcf and 1,200 Bcf in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Additionally, we added 123 Bcfe of reserves in 2015 as a result of our drilling program in Southwest Appalachia, which was acquired in December 2014. &#160; We expect our drilling programs in Northeast Appalachia, Southwest Appalachia and the Fayetteville Shale to continue to be the primary source of our reserve additions in the future; however, our ability to add reserves depends upon many factors that are beyond our control. We refer you to the risk factors &#8220; Significant capital expenditures are required to replace our reserves and conduct our business&#8221; and &#8220;If we are not able to 

&#160;

replace reserves, we may not be able to grow or sustain production.&#8221; in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report and to &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report for a more detailed discussion of these factors and other risks.

Our Operations 

&#160; 

Northeast Appalachia 

We began leasing acreage in northeast Pennsylvania in 2007 in an effort to participate in the emerging Marcellus Shale. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 270,335 net acres in Northeast Appalachia under which we believe the Marcellus Shale is present (168,753 net undeveloped acres and 101,582 net developed acres held by production), compared to approximately 266,073 net acres at year-end 2014 and 292,446 net acres at year-end 2013. Our undeveloped acreage position as of December 31, 2015 had an average royalty interest of 15% and was obtained at an average cost of approximately $990 per acre. 

As of December, 31, 2015, we had spud or acquired 553 operated wells, 424 of which were on production and 542 of which are horizontal wells. In 2015, we invested approximately $710 million in Northeast Appalachia and spud 89 operated horizontal wells and acquired 86 horizontal and 2 vertical wells. Our reserves in Northeast Appalachia decreased by 873 Bcf in 2015, which included reserve additions of 340 Bcf, 1,383 Bcf of net upward revisions due to well performance, net downward price revisions of 2,315 Bcf and acquisitions of 79 Bcf, offset by production of 360 Bcf. Of the 89 horizontal wells spud during 2015, 79 wells are located in Susquehanna County, 4 wells are located in Bradford County, 4 wells are located in Tioga County and the remaining 2 wells are located in Wyoming County. We also acquired 86 horizontal wells in 2015, nearly all of which were located in Susquehanna County. In 2015, our operated horizontal wells had an average completed well cost of $5.4 million per well, average horizontal lateral length of 5,403 feet an d an average of 11 fracture stimulation stages. This compares to an average completed operated well cost of $6.1 million per well, average horizontal lateral length of 4,752 feet and an average of 15 fracture stimulation stages in 2014. In 2013, our average completed operated well cost was $7.0 million per well with an average horizontal lateral length of 4,982 feet and an average of 18 fracture stimulation stages. Included in our total capital investments in Northeast Appalachia during 2015 was approximately $472 million for drilling and completions, $172 million for acquisition of properties, and $66 million in facilities, capitalized costs and other expenses. In 2014, we invested approximately $695 million in Northeast Appalachia , spud 99 operated wells, and acquired 5 horizontal and 2 vertical wells, resulting in reserve additions and revisions of 1,483 Bcf. In 2013, we invested approximately $872 million in Northeast Appalachia and spud 108 operated wells, resulting in net reserve additions and revisions of 1,297 Bcf. 

Approximately 2,319 Bcf of our total proved net reserves at year-end 2015 were attributable to Northeast Appalachia. We had a total of 423 horizontal and one vertical well that we operated and that were on production as of December 31, 2015, resulting in net production from this area of 360 Bcf in 2015, compared to 254 Bcf in 2014 and 151 Bcf in 2013. Our 2015 year-end reserves in Northeast Appalachia include a total of 826 locations, of which 767 were proved developed producing, 23 were proved developed non-producing and 36 were proved undeveloped. At year-end 2014, we had approximately 3,192 Bcf in proved reserves in Northeast Appalachia from a total of 737 locations, of which 524 were proved developed producing, 13 were proved developed non-producing and 200 were proved undeveloped. At year-end 2013, we had approximately 1,963 Bcf of proved reserves in Northeast Appalachia from a total of 522 locations, of which 333 were proved developed producing, and 189 were proved undeveloped. The average gross proved reserves for the undeveloped wells included in our year-end reserves for 2015 was approximately 10.4 Bcf per well, compared to 9.6 Bcf per well at year-end 2014 and 6.9 Bcf per well in 2013. 

Our ability to bring our Northeast Appalachia production to market will depend on a number of factors including the construction of and/or the availability of capacity on gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own. We refer you to &#8220;Midstream Services&#8221; in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report for a discussion of our gathering and transportation arrangements for Northeast Appalachia production. 

Southwest Appalachia 

In late 2014 and early 2015, we closed two transactions to acquire natural gas and oil assets in West Virginia and southwest Pennsylvania for approximately $5.4 billion. This acreage has at least three drilling objectives, namely the Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian Shales. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 425,098 net acres in Southwest Appalachia (193,582 net undeveloped acres and 231,516 net developed acres held by production) compared to 

&#160;

approximately 413,376 net acres at year-end 2014. Our undeveloped acreage position as of December 31, 2015 had an average royalty interest of 16 %. 

In 2015, we invested approximately $857 million in Southwest Appalachia, which included approximately $248 million to spud 48 wells. Net production from Southwest Appalachia was 143 Bcfe in 2015. Included in our total capital investments in Southwest Appalachia during 2015 was approximately $409 million for acquisition of properties and $200 million in capitalized costs and other expenses. Approximately 611 Bcfe of our total proved net reserves at year-end 2015 were in Southwest Appalachia and substantially all attributable to the Marcellus Shale. Our reserves in Southwest Appalachia decreased by 1,686 Bcfe in 2015, which included reserve additions of 88 Bcfe, 209 Bcfe of net upward revisions due to well performance, net downward price revisions of 1,875 Bcfe, and acquisitions of 35 Bcfe, offset by production of 143 Bcfe. We had a total of 318 horizontal and 676 vertical wells that we operated and that were on production as of December 31, 2015. Additionally, there were 43 horizontal wells in progress at the end of 2015, of which 21 were waiting on pipeline or production facilities. Our 2015 year-end reserves in Southwest Appalachia include a total of 1,429 locations, of which 1,028 were proved developed producing, 400 were proved developed non-producing and 1 w as proved undeveloped. At December 31, 2014, approximately 2,297 Bcfe of total proved net reserves were attributable to Southwest Appalachia from a total of 1,502 locations, of which 1,034 were proved developed producing, 124 were proved developed non-producing and 344 were proved undeveloped. 

Our ability to bring our Southwest Appalachia production to market will depend on a number of factors including the construction of and/or the availability of capacity on gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own. We refer you to &#8220;Midstream Services&#8221; within Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report for a discussion of our gathering and transportation arrang ements for Southwest Appalachia production. 

Fayetteville Shale 

&#160; 

The Fayetteville Shale is a Mississippian-age unconventional gas reservoir located on the Arkansas side of the Arkoma Basin, ranging in thickness from 50 to 550 feet and ranging in depth from 1,500 to 6,500 feet. As of December 31, 2015, we held leases for approximately 957,641 net acres in the play area (257,156 net undeveloped acres, 498,329 net developed acres held by Fayetteville Shale production, 170,743 net developed acres held by conventional production in the Arkoma Basin, and 31,413 net undeveloped acres in the Arkoma Basin), compared to approximately 888,161 net acres at year-end 2014 and 905,684 net acres at year- end 2013. Certain acreage previously reported as a component of our conventional Arkoma Basin has been included in the unconventional net acreage for the Fayetteville Shale at December 31, 2015, reflecting our current drilling focus. 

Approximately 3,281 Bcf of our reserves at year-end 2015 were attributable to our Fayetteville Shale properties, compared to approximately 5,069 Bcf at year-end 2014 and 4,795 Bcf at year-end 2013. Our reserves in the Fayetteville Shale decreased by 1,788 Bcf in 2015, which included reserve additions of 163 Bcf, net downward price revisions of 1, 496 Bcf, 10 Bcf of net upward revisions due to well performance, offset by production of 465 Bcf. Our net production from the Fayetteville Shale was 465 Bcf in 2015, compared to 494 B cf in 2014 and 486 Bcf in 2013. 

At year-end 2015, after excluding our acreage in the conventional Arkoma Basin and the federal acreage we hold in the Ozark Highlands Unit, approximately 87% of our 597,254 total net leasehold acres remaining in the Fayetteville Shale was held by production. For more information about our acreage and well count, we refer you to &#8220;Properties&#8221; in Item 2 of Part I of this Annual Report. Our acreage position was obtained at an average cost of approximately $335 per acre and has an average royalty interest o f 15%. We refer you to the risk factor &#8220;Certain of our undeveloped assets are subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage&#8221; in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report. 

Following the commencement of two court actions, now consolidated, alleging deficiencies in the Environmental Impact Statement issued in connection with the grant of the leases by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in the Ozark National Forest, the BLM has discontinued approval of operational permits in the forest, including permits to drill, pending resolution of the litigation. The Ozark Highlands Unit lies entirely within the Ozark National Forest. Although we are not a party to the litigation and the plaintiffs&#8217; complaints do not seek invalidation of the leases, we currently are unable to obtain permits to drill on the 158,231 acres we have leased in the unit and the national forest. 

As of December 31, 2015, we had spud a total of 4,737 wells in the Fayetteville Shale since our commencement of activities there in 2004, of which 4,157 were operated by us and 580 were outside-operated wells. Of these wells, 155 were spud in 2015, 468 in 2014 and 527 in 2013. All of the wells spud in 2015 were designated as horizontal wells. At year-end 2015, 4,003 wells operated by the Company had been drilled and completed overall, inc luding 3,912 horizontal wells. 

&#160;

In 2015, the horizontal wells we drilled as operator had an average completed well cost of $2.8 million per well, average horizontal lateral length of 5,729 feet, and an average time to drill to total depth of 7.3 days from re-entry to re-entry. This compares to an average completed operated well cost of $2.6 million per well, average horizontal lateral length of 5,440 feet and average time to drill to total depth of 6.8 days from re-entry to re-entry during 2014. In 2013, our average completed operated well cost was $2.4 million per well with an average horizontal lateral length of 5,356 feet and average time to drill to total depth of 6.2 days from re-entry to re-entry. The operated wells we placed on production during 2015 averaged initial production rates of 4, 280 Mcf per day, compared to average initial production rates of 4,430 Mcf per day in 2014 and 4,041 Mcf per day in 2013. During 2015, we placed 74 operated wells on production with initial production rates that exceeded 5.0 MMcf per day, compared to 145 wells in 2014 and 93 wells in 2013. 

Our total proved net reserves in the Fayetteville Shale at year-end 2015 were from a total of 4,560 locations, of which 4,268 were proved developed producing, 231 were proved developed non-producing and 61 were proved undeveloped. Of the 4,560 locations, 4,493 were horizontal. The average gross proved reserves for the undeveloped wells included at year-end 2015 was approximately 3.0 Bcf per well, compared to 2.3 Bcf per well at year-end 2014, and 2.5 Bcf per well at year-end 2013. The increase in average gross proved reserves for our undeveloped wells in 2015 was primarily due to the estimated ultimate recoveries of those locations which remained economic at the average prices utilized during 2015. The decrease in average gross proved reserves for our undeveloped wells in 2014 was primarily due to the addition of proven undeveloped locations in areas of the field with lower estimated ultimate recoveries. Total proved net natural gas reserves in the Fayetteville Shale in 2014 were approximately 5,069 Bcf from a total of 5,445 locations, of which 4,045 were proved developed producing, 187 were proved developed non-producing and 1,213 were proved undeveloped. Total proved net natural gas reserves in the Fayetteville Shale in 2013 totaled approximately 4,795 Bcf from a total of 4,631 locations, of which 3,511 were proved developed producing, 59 were proved developed non-producing and 1,061 were proved undeveloped. 

In 2015, we invested approximately $565 million in the Fayetteville Shale, which included approximately $481 million to spud 155 wells, all of which we operate. Included in our total capital investments in the Fayetteville Shale during 2015 w ere $80 million in capitalized costs and other expenses and $4 million for acquisition of properties. In 2014, we invested approximately $944 million in the Fayetteville Shale, which included $838 million to spud 468 wells, 464 of which we operate, $99 million in capitalized costs and other expenses and $7 million for acquisition of properties. In 2013, we invested approximately $907 million in the Fayetteville Shale, which included $804 million to spud 527 wells, 504 of which we operate, $97 million in capitalized costs and other expenses and $6 million for acquisition of properties. As of December 31, 2015, we had acquired approximately 1,324 square miles of 3-D seismic data, which provides us with seismic data on approximately 65% of our net acreage position in the Fayetteville Shale. 

New Ventures 

We also seek to find and develop new natural gas and oil plays with significant exploration and exploitation potential, which we refer to as &#8220;New Ventures.&#8221; We have been focusing on both natural gas and oil unconventional plays, and the technological methods best suited to developing these plays, such as horizontal drilling and fracture stimulation techniques. New Ventures prospects are evaluated based on multi-well potential and land availability as well as other criteria and may be located both inside and outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2015, we held 3,661,375 net undeveloped acres in connection with our New Ventures prospects, of which 2,518,518 net acres were located in New Brunswick, Canada. This compares to 4,170,687 net undeveloped acres held at year-end 2014 and 3,972,732 net undeveloped acres held at year-end 2013. 

Activity on our New Ventures assets was limited in 2015 as a result of the low commodity price environment. We are currently in the process of marketing these assets and anticipate activity to remain limited in 2016 as we focus on more proven development plays. Although we believe that our New Ventures projects have significant exploration and exploitation potential, there can be no assurance that any prospects will result in viable projects or that we will not abandon our initial investments. 

Sand Wash Basin. In 2014, we acquired acreage in northwest Colorado targeting crude oil, NGLs and natural gas contained in the Sand Wash Basin, with the target zone ranging in vertical depth from 5,500 to 11,500 feet. Our leases currently have an approximate 81% average net revenue interest. As of December 31, 2015, we held approximately 251,478 net acres in the area, obtained at an average cost of $570 per acre. 

Brown Dense. In July 2011, we announced that we would begin testing a new unconventional liquids rich play targeting the Brown Dense formation, an unconventional reservoir that ranges in vertical depths from 8,000 to 11,000 feet and appears to be laterally extensive over a large area ranging in thickness from 300 to 550 feet. As of December 31, 2015, we held 

&#160;

approximately 201,091 net acres in the area, obtained at an average cost of $1,313 per acre. Our leases currently have an approximate 80% average net revenue interest. As of December 31, 2015, we had drilled 14 operated wells in the area, 6 of which were cur rently producing. In 2015, we processed and analyzed 3-D seismic data and believe that we have a better understanding of factors contributing to the quality of the wells drilled to date. 

&#160; 

New Brunswick, Canada . In March 2010, we successfully bid for exclusive licenses from the Department of Natural Resources of New Brunswick to search and conduct an exploration program covering 2,518,518 net acres in the province in order to test new hydrocarbon basins. In 2015, the provincial government in New Brunswick announced a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing until a list of conditions is met. The list of conditions that the provincial government has announced is somewhat subjective, and although the provincial government has stated that it expects to make a decision on the moratorium by the end of 2016, we cannot predict whether or when it may be lifted. Unless and until the moratorium is lifted, we will not be able to continue with our program in New Brunswick. In response to this moratorium, the Company requested and was granted an extension of its licenses. With these extensions, our licenses are scheduled to expire in March 2021 . 

&#160; 

Acquisitions and Divestitures 

&#160; 

In May 2015, the Company sold conventional oil and gas assets located in East Texas and the Arkoma Basin for approximately $211 million. As of December 2014, these assets included approximately 184 Bcf of proved reserves. 

&#160; 

In April 2015, the Company sold its gathering assets located in Bradford and Lycoming counties in northeast Pennsylvania for approximately $489 million. The assets included approximately 100 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines, with nearly 600 million cubic feet per day of capacity. 

&#160; 

In January 2015, we acquired approximately 46,700 net acres in northeast Pennsylvania for $270 million. As part of this transaction, we also received firm transportation capacity of 260 million cubic feet per day predominately on the Millennium pipeline. 

&#160; 

In December 2014, we acquired approximately 413,000 net acres in West Virginia and southwest Pennsylvania with plans to target the Marcellus, Utica and Upper Devonian Shales for approximately $5.0 billion. Additionally, in January 2015, we acquired an additional approximate 30,000 net acres in this area for $357 million. 

&#160; 

In March 2014 and July 2014, we acquired approximately 380,000 net acres in northwest Colorado principally in the Sand Wash Basin for approximately $215 million. 

&#160; 

In April 2013, we acquired approximately 162,000 net acres in Northeast Appalachia for approximately $82 million. The acquired acreage is near our existing acreage in Northeast Appalachia. 

&#160; 

Capital Investments 

During 2015, we invested a total of approximately $2.3 billion in our E&#38;P business. In 2015, we placed 430 wells to sales and had 203 wells in progress. Of the 203 wells in progress at year-end, 83 , 43 and 77 were located in our Northeast Appalachia, Southwest Appalachia and Fayetteville Shale operating areas, respectively , and 4 1 of these wells are waiting on pipeline or production facilities. Of the approximately $2.3 billion invested in our E&#38;P business in 2015, approximately $710 million was invested in Northeast Appalachia, $857 million in Southwest Appalachia, $565 million in the Fayetteville Shale, and $102 million in New Ventures projects. 

Of the $2.3 billion invested in 2015, approximately $1.2 billion was invested in exploratory and development drilling and workovers, $607 million for acquisition of properties, $390 million in capitalized interest and other expenses and $6 million for seismic expenditures. Additionally, we invested approximately $21 million in our drilling rigs and related equipment, sand facility and other equipment, and $8 million in water facilities. In 2014, we invested approximately $7.3 billion in our primary E&#38;P business activities and participated in drilling 576 wells. &#160; Of the $7.3 billion invested in 2014, approximately $5.3 billion was invested for acquisition of properties, $1.5 billion in exploratory and development drilling and workovers, $247 million in capitalized interest and other expenses and $56 million for seismic expenditures. Additionally, we invested approximately $105 million in our drilling rigs and related equipment, sand facility and other equipment, and $5 million in water facilities. In 2013, we invested approximately $2.1 billion in our primary E&#38;P business activities and participated in drilling 653 wells. Of the $2.1 billion invested in 2013, approximately $1.5 billion was invested in exploratory and development drilling and workovers, $224 million in capitalized interest and other expenses, $159 million for acquisition of properties, and $28 million for seismic expenditures. Additionally, we invested approximately $76 million in our drilling rigs and related equipment, sand facility and other equipment. 

&#160;

Based on current commodity prices, our capital program for 2016 will be flexible &#160; and aligned with expected cash flow. This will involve little, if any, drilling at current prices unless we realize additional cash. We refer you to &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8211; Capital Investments&#8221; within Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report for additional discussion of the factors that could impact our planned capital investments in 2016. 

&#160; 

Sales, Delivery Commitments and Customers 

&#160; 

Sales. Our daily natural gas equivalent production averaged 2,675 MMcfe in 2015, compared to 2,105 MMcfe in 2014 and 1,800 MMcfe in 2013. Total natural gas equivalent production was 976 Bcfe in 2015, up from 768 Bcfe in 2014 and 657 Bcfe in 2013. Our natural gas production was 899 Bcf in 2015, compared to 766 Bcf in 2014 and 656 Bcf in 2013. The increase in production in 2015 resulted primarily from a 106 Bcf increase in net production from our Northeast Appalachia properties and a 140 Bcfe increase in net production from our Southwest Appalachia properties, which more than offset a 2 9 Bcf decrease in net production from our Fayetteville Shale properties and a combined 9 Bcfe decrease in net production from our East Texas and Arkoma Basin properties, which were divested in the first half of 2015. The increase in production in 2014 resulted primarily from a 103 Bcf increase in net production from our Northeast Appalachia properties, a 3 Bcfe increase in net production from our Southwest Appalachia properties and an 8 Bcf increase in net production from our Fayetteville Shale properties, which more than offset a combined 3 Bcfe decrease in net production from our East Texas and Arkoma Basin properties. We produced 2,265 MBbls of oil in 2015, compared to 235 MBbls of oil in 2014 and 138 MBbls of oil in 2013. Our oil production has increased in 2015 and 2014 primarily due to the acquisition of natural gas and oil properties in Southwest Appalachia and our exploration activities in the Brown Dense. In 2015, we produced 10,702 MBbls of NGLs, compared to 231 MBbls and 50 MBbls of NGLs in 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily due to the acquisition of natural gas and oil properties in Southwest Appalachia and our exploration activities in the Brown Dense. 

&#160; 

Sales of natural gas and oil production are conducted under contracts that reflect current prices and are subject to seasonal price swings. We are unable to predict changes in the market demand and price for natural gas, including changes that may be induced by the effects of weather on demand for our production. We periodically enter into various hedging and other financial arrangements with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas production to support certain desired levels of cash flow and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations. Our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings. As of December 31, 2015, we did not have any New York Mercantile Exchange, or NYMEX, commodity price hedges in place on our targeted 2016 natural gas production. As of February 23, 2016, we had NYMEX commodity price hedges in place on 37 Bcf of ou r targe ted 2016 natural gas production . We intend to hedge additional future production volumes to the extent natural gas prices rise to levels that we believe will achieve certain desired levels of cash flow. We refer you to Item 7A of Part II of this Annual Report, &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks,&#8221; for further information regarding our hedge position as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Including the effect of hedges, we realized an average price of $2.37 per Mcf for our natural gas production in 2015, compared to $3.72 per Mcf in 2014 and $3.65 per Mcf in 2013. Our hedging activities increased our average realized natural gas sales price by $0.46 per Mcf in 2015, compared to a decrease of $0.02 per Mcf in 2014 and an increase of $0.48 per Mcf in 2013. Our average oil price realized was $33.25 per barrel in 2015, compared to $79.91 per barrel in 2014 and $103.32 per barrel in 2013. Our average realized NGL price was $6.80 per barrel in 2015, $15.72 per barrel in 2014 compared to $43.63 per barrel in 2013. None of our oil or NGL production was hedged during 2015, 2014 or 2013. 

&#160; 

During 2015, the average price received for our natural gas production, excluding the impact of hedges, was approximately $0.75 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX prices. Differences between NYMEX and price realized are due primarily to locational differences and transportation cost. As of December 31, 2015, we have attempted to mitigate the volatility of basis differentials by protecting basis on approximately 2 16 Bcf and 67 Bcf of our 2016 and 2017 production, respectively, and expected natural gas production through physical sales arrangements at a basis differential to NYMEX natural gas prices of approximately ($0.1 6 ) per Mcf and ($0.20) per Mcf for 2016 and 2017, respectively. Additionally, we have financial hedges in place on 5 Bcf of our 2016 production at a weighted average basis differential of $0.75 per Mcf. 

&#160; 

Delivery Commitments. As of December 31, 2015, we had natural gas delivery commitments of 455 Bcf in 2016 and 198 Bcf in 2017 under existing agreements. These amounts are well below our forecasted 2016 natural gas production from our Fayetteville Shale, Northeast Appalachia and Southwest Appalachia divisions and anticipated 2017 production from our available reserves in our Fayetteville Shale, Northeast Appalachia and Southwest Appalachia divisions, which are not subject to any priorities or curtailments that may affect quantities delivered to our customers or any priority allocations or price limitations imposed by federal or state regulatory agencies, or any other factors beyond our control that may affect our ability to meet our contractual obligations other than those discussed in Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; of Part I of this Annual Report. &#160; We expect to be able to fulfill all of our short-term or long-term contractual obligations to provide natural gas from our own 

&#160;

production of available reserves; however, if we are unable to do so, we may have to purchase natural gas at market to fulfill our obligations. 

&#160; 

Customers. Our customers include major energy companies, utilities and industrial purchasers of natural gas. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, no single third-party purchaser accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

All phases of the natural gas and oil industry are highly competitive. We compete in the acquisition of properties, the search for and development of reserves, the production and sale of natural gas and oil and the securing of labor and equipment required to conduct our operations. Our competitors include major oil and natural gas companies, other independent oil and natural gas companies and individual producers and operators. Many of these competitors have financial and other resources that substantially exceed those available to us. Consequently, we will encounter competition that may affect both the price we receive and contract terms we must offer. We also face competition for pipeline and other services to transport our product to market, particularly in the n ortheastern United States. 

&#160; 

We cannot predict whether and to what extent any market reforms initiated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or the FERC, or any new energy legislation will achieve the goal of increasing competition, lessening preferential treatment and enhancing transparency in markets in which our natural gas production is sold. However, we do not believe that we will be disproportionately or regulatory affected as compared to other natural gas and oil producers and marketers by any action taken by the FERC or any other legislative body. 

&#160; 

Regulation 

&#160; 

The exploration and development of natural gas and oil resources and the transportation and sale of production historically have been heavily regulated. For example, state governments regulate the location of wells and establish the minimum size for spacing units. Permits typically are required before drilling. State and local government zoning and land use regulations may also limit the locations for drilling and production. Similar regulations can also affect the location, construction and operation of gathering and other pipelines needed to transport production to market. In addition, various suppliers of goods and services may require licensing. 

&#160; 

Currently in the United States, the price at which natural gas or oil may be sold is not regulated. Congress has imposed price regulation from time to time, and there can be no assurance that the current, less stringent regulatory approach will continue. In December 2015, the federal government repealed a 40-year ban on the export of crude oil. The export of natural gas continues to require federal permits. Broader freedom to export could lead to higher prices. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) and the rules that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or the CFTC, the SEC, and certain other regulators have issued thereunder regulate certain swaps, futures, and options contracts in the major energy markets, including for natural gas and oil. 

&#160; 

The exploration and development of natural gas and oil is also subject to extensive environmental regulation. We refer you to &#8220;Other &#8212; Environmental Regulation &#8221; in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Annual Report and the risk factor &#8220;We are subject to complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities&#8221; in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report for a discussion of the impact of environmental regulation on our business. 

&#160; 

Midstream Services 

&#160; 

We believe our Midstream Services segment is well-positioned to complement our E&#38;P initiatives and to compete with other midstream providers for unaffiliated busin ess. We generate revenue from gathering fees associated with the transportation of natural gas to market and through the marketing of natural gas, oil and NGLs. Our gathering assets support our E&#38;P operations and are currently concentrated in the Fayetteville Shale in Arkansas after the sale of our gathering assets in northeast Pennsylvania and Texas in the second quarter of 2015 . 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our operating income from this segment was $583 million on revenues of $3.1 billion in 2015, compared to $361 million on revenues of $4. 4 billion in 2014 and $325 million on revenues of $3.3 billion in 2013. Operating income in 2015 includes a $277 million net gain related to the sale of our n ortheast Pennsylvania and East Texas gathering assets. Excluding this gain, operating income decreased to $306 million in 2015 primarily due to a decrease in volumes gathered resulting from lower production volumes in the Fayetteville Shale and the sale of our n ortheast Pennsylvania gathering assets. Revenues decreased in 2015 primarily due to the prices received for volumes marketed. Revenues increased in 2014 primarily due to an increase in the prices received for volumes marketed and an increase in volumes marketed. Adjusted EBITDA generated by our Midstream Services segment was $3 68 million in 2015, compared to $418 million in 2014 and $377 million in 2013. The decrease in 2015 was primarily due to decreased gathered volumes . The increase in 2014 operating income and Adjusted EBITDA were primarily due to increased gathering revenues, partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. We refer you to &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis&#8221; in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report for a table that reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss). During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, no single third-party customer in our Midstream Services Segment accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues. 

&#160; 

Gas Gathering 

&#160; 

Currently, our gas gathering activities are located predominantly in Arkansas and are &#160; related to the operation of our Fayetteville Shale asset. We invested approximately $58 million related to our gathering activities in 2015 and had gathering revenues of $491 million, compared to $144 million invested and revenues of $562 million in 2014 and $158 million invested and revenues of $516 million in 2013. During 2015, we divested our gathering assets in northeast Pennsylvania and East Texas. The divested gathering assets accounted for $21 million, $6 7 million and $4 8 million of our gathering revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. &#160; 

&#160; 

During 2015, we gathered approximately 750 Bcf of natural gas in the Fayetteville Shale area, including 55 Bcf of natural gas from third-party operated wells. During 2014, we gathered approximately 812 Bcf of natural gas volumes in the Fayetteville Shale area, including 62 Bcf of natural gas from third-party operated wells. In 2013, we gathered approximately 790 Bcf of natural gas volumes in the Fayetteville Shale area, including 62 Bcf of natural gas from third-party wells. At the end of 2015, we had approximately 2,044 miles of pipe from the individual wellheads to the transmission lines and compression equipment representing in aggregate approximately 502,555 horsepower had been installed at 58 central point gathering facilities in the Fayetteville Shale. 

&#160; 

Marketing 

&#160; 

We attempt to capture opportunities related to the marketing and transportation of natural gas, oil and NGLs; although, &#160; o ur current marketing strategy primarily involves the marketing of our own natural gas production. Additionally, we manage portfolio and basis risk, acquire transportation rights on third-party pipelines and in limited circumstances, purchase third-party natural gas. During 2015, we marketed 1,12 7 Bcf e , compared to 904 Bcf in 2014 and 786 Bcf in 2013. Of the total gas volumes marketed, production from our affiliated E&#38;P operations accounted for 97% in 2015, compared to 97% in 2014 and 96% in 2013. Our Midstream Services segment also marketed approximately 60% of our combined oil and NGL production for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Northeast Appalachia 

&#160; 

In January 2015, we completed the purchase of certain natural gas and oil assets in northeast Pennsylvania and assumed short and long-term natural gas transportation agreements with Millennium Pipeline Company, L.L.C. with a total capacity of approximately 260,000 Mcf per day. 

&#160; 

In January 2014, we entered into a precedent agreement with Transcontinental Gas Pipeline Company LLC that will provide additional firm transportation capacity for supplies of natural gas from northern Pennsylvania to markets along the Transco pipeline system stretching from the northeastern US in Transco&#8217;s Zone 6, to Zone 5 and terminating in Zone 4. Subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions, we agreed to enter a 15-year firm transportation agreement with a total capacity of approximately 44,000 Mcf per day on this project which is expected to be in service in the second half of 2017. 

&#160; 

In May 2013, we entered into a precedent agreement with Columbia Gas Transmission, LLC for a project that expanded their existing system from Chester County, Pennsylvania to various interconnects throughout Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia. Our volume on this project, which was placed in service October 2015, is 72,000 Mcf per day. 

&#160;

In March 2012, we entered into a precedent agreement with Constitution Pipeline Co. LLC for a proposed 121-mile pipeline connecting to the Iroquois Gas Transmission and Tennessee Gas Pipeline systems in Schoharie County, New York. Subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions, we agreed to enter a 15-year firm transportation agreement with a total capacity of approximately 150,000 Mcf per day on this project. Constitution Pipeline Co. LLC has extended the range for the pipeline&#8217;s target in-service date to late 2016 as a result of a longer than expected regulatory and permitting process. We have provided certain guarantees of a portion of our obligations under these agreements. 

&#160; 

During 2011 and 2012, we entered into a number of short- and long-term firm transportation service agreements in support of our growing Northeast Appalachia operations in Pennsylvania. In March 2011, we entered into a precedent agreement with Millennium Pipeline Company, L.L.C. pursuant to which we entered into short- and long-term firm natural gas transportation services on Millennium&#8217;s existing system. Expansions of the system were placed in-service in the second quarter of 2013 and the second quarter of 2014. 

&#160; 

We have also executed firm transportation agreements with Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (&#8220;TGP&#8221;), a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P., that increase our ability to move our Northeast Appalachia natural gas production in the short term to market as well as a precedent agreement for an expansion project that was placed in-service in November 2013 pursuant to which we have subscribed for approximately 100,000 Mcf per day of capacity. TGP&#8217;s expansion project will expand its 300 Line in Pennsylvania to provide natural gas transportation from the Northeast Appalachia supply area to existing delivery points on the TGP system. 

&#160; 

Southwest Appalachia 

&#160; 

As part of our December 2014 acquisition of natural gas and oil assets in West Virginia and southwest Pennsylvania, we were assigned approximately 92,000 Mcf per day of capacity on the Columbia Gas Transmission pipeline. Additionally, we were assigned a precedent agreement with ET Rover Pipeline LLC for approximately 200,000 Mcf per day of capacity. ET Rover Pipeline LLC is constructing a new interstate pipeline to receive and transport natural gas from Marcellus and Utica production outlets to points of interconnection with Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company and ANR Pipeline, to interconnections in Michigan, to the Union Gas Dawn Hub and to certain off-system delivery points on Trunkline Zone 1A, and is anticipated to be in service by the second quarter 2017. 

&#160; 

In December 2014, we also were assigned certain ethane transportation agreements that allow for the transport of our ethane production to both domestic and international markets. 

&#160; 

In March 2015, we entered into a precedent agreement with Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc. that secured capacity of 500,000 Mcf per day on the Mountaineer XPress pipeline, with a portion of these volumes going to the Gulf Coast on the Gulf Xpress pipeline. The project is expected to be in service by late 2018 and will be routed through much of our core Southwest Appalachia acreage located in West Virginia. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, we had 45 0,000 Mcf per day of firm processing capacity with multiple processing providers located near our core acreage position in West Virginia. In the future, we have the option to increase our firm processing capacity by exercising options for the construction of incremental processing trains, the use of interruptible processing capacity, or consummating new processing agreements with new or existing service providers. 

&#160; 

Fayetteville Shale 

&#160; 

We are a &#8220;foundation shipper&#8221; on two pipeline projects serving the Fayetteville Shale. The Fayetteville Express Pipeline LLC, or FEP, is a 2.0 Bcf per day pipeline that is jointly owned by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. and Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. FEP was placed in service in January 2011. We have a maximum aggregate commitment of approximately 1,200,000 Mcf per day for an initial term of ten years from the in-service date. Texas Gas Transmission, LLC or Texas Gas, a subsidiary of Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP, constructed two pipeline laterals called the Fayetteville and Greenville Laterals, which also provide transportation for our Fayetteville Shale gas. We have maximum aggregate commitments of approximately 800,000 Mcf per day on the Fayetteville Lateral and 640,000 Mcf per day on the Greenville Lateral. 

&#160; 

The Fayetteville and the Greenville Laterals and the FEP allow us to transport our natural gas to interconnecting pipelines that offer connectivity and marketing options to the eastern half of the United States. These interconnecting pipelines include Centerpoint, Natural Gas Pipeline, Mississippi River Transmission, Gulf South, Texas Gas, Tennessee Gas Pipeline, Trunkline, ANR, Columbia Gulf, Texas Eastern, and Sonat. We rely in part upon the Fayetteville and Greenville Laterals and the FEP to service our production from the Fayetteville Shale. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Demand Charges 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, our obligations for demand and similar charges under the firm transportation agreements and gathering agreements totaled approximately $ 8.9 billion, 38 % of which related to access capacity on future pipeline and gathering infrastructure projects that still require the granting of regulatory approvals and additional construction efforts. We also have guarantee obligations of up to $960 million of that amount. Additionally, $100 million relates to demand charges under firm transportation agreements under which we have the option to reduce our commitment by 531 Bcf beginning in 2018 . 

&#160; 

We refer you to the risk factor &#8220; We have made significant investments in pipelines and gathering systems and contracts and in oilfield service businesses, including our drilling rig, pressure pumping equipment and sand mine operations, to lower costs and secure inputs for our operations and transportation for our production. If our exploration and production activities are curtailed or disrupted, we may not recover our investment in these activities, which could adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, our continued expansion of these operations may adversely impact our relationships with third-party providers.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Our marketing activities compete with numerous other companies offering the same services, many of which possess larger financial and other resources than we have. Some of these competitors are other producers and affiliates of companies with extensive pipeline systems that are used for transportation from producers to end-users. Other factors affecting competition are the cost and availability of alternative fuels, the level of consumer demand and the cost of and proximity to pipelines and other transportation facilities. We believe that our ability to compete effectively within the marketing segment in the future depends upon establishing and maintaining strong relationships with producers and end-users. 

&#160; 

Regulation 

&#160; 

The transportation of natural gas and oil are heavily regulated. Interstate pipelines must obtain authorization from the FERC, to operate in interstate commerce, and state governments typically must authorize the construction of pipelines for intrastate service. The FERC currently allows interstate pipelines to adopt market-based rates; however, in the past the FERC has regulated pipeline tariffs and could do so again in the future. State tariff regulations vary. Currently, all pipelines we own are intrastate. 

&#160; 

State and local permitting, zoning and land use regulations can affect the location, construction and operation of gathering and other pipelines needed to transport production to market. In addition, various suppliers of goods and services to our midstream business may require licensing. 

&#160; 

The transportation of natural gas and oil is also subject to extensive environmental regulation. We refer you to &#8220;Other &#8211; Environmental Regulation&#8221; in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report and the risk factor &#8220;We are subject to complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities&#8221; in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report for a discussion of the impact of environmental regulation on our business. 

&#160; 

Other 

&#160; 

Our other operations have primarily consisted of real estate development activities. In 2013, we started construction on a corporate office complex located in Spring, Texas on 26 acres of commercial land that we purchased in 2012. The Company financed the construction of this complex through a construction agreement and lease arrangement. In January 2015, construction on the corporate office was completed and the Company commenced a lease with a term of approximately five years. 

&#160; 

We sold no commercial real estate in 2015, 2014 or 2013. 

&#160; 

Environmental Regulation 

&#160; 

General. Our operations are subject to environmental regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations require permits for drilling wells and the maintenance of bonding requirements to drill or operate wells and also regulate the spacing and location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells and the prevention and cleanup of pollutants and other matters. We maintain insurance against costs of clean-up operations, but we are not fully insured against all such 

&#160;

risks. Although future environmental obligations are not expected to have a material impact on the results of our operations or financial condition, there can be no assurance that future developments, such as increasingly stringent environmental laws or enforcement thereof, will not cause us to incur material environmental liabilities or costs. 

&#160; 

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties and the imposition of injunctive relief. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes may result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements . &#160; We do not expect continued compliance with existing requirements to have a material adverse impact on us, but there can be no assurance that this will continue in the future. 

&#160; 

The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject. 

&#160; 

Certain U.S. Statutes. CERCLA, also known as the &#8220;Superfund law,&#8221; imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a &#8220;hazardous substance&#8221; into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that transported or disposed or arranged for the transport or disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. 

&#160; 

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or RCRA, generally does not regulate wastes generated by the exploration and production of natural gas and oil. RCRA specifically excludes from the definition of hazardous waste &#8220;drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil, natural gas or geothermal energy.&#8221; However, legislative and regulatory initiatives have been considered from time to time that would reclassify certain natural gas and oil exploration and production wastes as &#8220;hazardous wastes,&#8221; which would make the reclassified wastes subject to much more stringent handling, disposal and clean-up requirements. If such measures were to be enacted, it could have a significant impact on our operating costs. Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste oils, may be regulated as hazardous waste. 

&#160; 

The Clean Water Act, as amended, or CWA, and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of produced waters and other natural gas and oil waste into regulated waters. Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants to regulated waters and to conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands. The CWA and similar state laws provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharges of pollutants and unauthorized discharges of reportable quantities of oil and other hazardous substances. The EPA has adopted regulations requiring certain natural gas and oil exploration and production facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges. Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans. 

&#160; 

The Oil Pollution Act, as amended, or the OPA, and regulations thereunder impose a variety of requirements on &#8220;responsible parties&#8221; related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in regulated waters. A &#8220;responsible party&#8221; includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, pipeline or vessel, or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located. OPA assigns liability to each responsible party for oil cleanup costs and a variety of public and private damages. Although liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation. If the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup, liability limits likewise do not apply. Few defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA. OPA imposes ongoing requirements on a responsible party, including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill. In 201 5 , 201 4 and 201 3 , oil accounted for less than 1% of our total production, although we expect this percentage to increase as we develop our Southwest Appalachia assets. 

&#160; 

We own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, onshore properties that for many years have been used for or associated with the exploration and production of natural gas and oil. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us on or under other locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of wastes was not under our control. These properties and the wastes disposed on them may be subject to CERCLA, the Clean Water Act, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously 

&#160;

disposed wastes (including waste disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators), or to perform remedial plugging or closure operations to prevent future contamination. 

&#160; 

The Clean Air Act, as amended, restricts emissions into the atmosphere. Various activities in our operations, such as drilling, pumping and the use of vehicles, can release matter subject to regulation. We must obtain permits, typically from local authorities, to conduct various activities. Federal and state governmental agencies are looking into the issues associated with methane and other emissions from oil and natural gas activities, and further regulation could increase our costs or restrict our ability to produce. Although methane emissions are not currently regulated at the federal level, we are required to report emissions of various greenhouse gases, including methane. 

&#160; 

The Endangered Species Act and comparable state laws protect species threatened with possible extinction. &#160; Protection of threatened and endangered species may have the effect of prohibiting or delaying us from obtaining drilling and other permits and may include restrictions on road building and other activities in areas containing the affected species or their habitats. &#160; Based on the species that have been identified to date, we do not believe there are any species protected under the Endangered Species Act that would materially and adversely affect our operations at this time. 

&#160; 

Hydraulic Fracturing. We utilize hydraulic fracturing in drilling wells as a means of maximizing their productivity. It is an essential and common practice in the oil and gas industry used to stimulate production of oil, natural gas, and associated liquids from dense and deep rock formations. The knowledge and expertise in fracturing techniques we have developed through our operations in the Fayetteville Shale and Northeast Appalachia are being utilized in our other operating areas, including Southwest Appalachia, the Sand Wash Basin and our Lower Smackover Brown Dense acreage and, in the future, may include our exploration program in New Brunswick, Canada. Successful hydraulic fracturing techniques are also expected to be critical to the development of other New Venture areas. Hydraulic fracturing involves using water, sand, and certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow the flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. 

&#160; 

In the past few years, there has been an increased focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practice, both in the United States and abroad. In the United States, hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but federal agencies have started to assert regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, issued final rules effective as of October 15, 2012 that subject oil and gas operations (production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution) to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards, or NSPS, and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, or NESHAPS programs. In August 2015, the EPA released proposed additional regulations that would control methane and volatile organic compound emissions from certain oil and gas equipment and operations. The EPA also recently proposed pretreatment standards that would prohibit the indirect discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned treatment works. Based on our current operations and practices, management believes, such newly promulgated and proposed rules will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows but these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management&#8217;s view may change in the future. 

In addition, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. A number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. The EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater. A final draft of the report was released for peer review and public comment in 2015. 

Some states in which we operate have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure, waste disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. In the event state, local, or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where we are currently conducting, or in the future plan to conduct operations, we may incur additional costs to comply with such requirements that may be significant in nature, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from the drilling and/or completion of wells. In 2015, the provincial government in New Brunswick announced a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing until a list of conditions is met. The list of conditions is subjective, and although the provincial government has stated that it expects to make a decision on the moratorium by the end of 2016, we cannot predict whether or when it may be lifted. Unless and until the moratorium is lifted, we will not be able to continue with our program in New Brunswick. 

&#160; 

In addition, concerns have been raised about the potential for earthquakes to occur from the use of underground injection control wells, a predominant method for disposing of waste water from oil and gas activities. We operate injection wells and 

&#160;

utilize injection wells owned by third parties to dispose of waste water associated with our operations. New rules and regulations may be developed to address these concerns, possibly limiting or eliminating the ability to use disposal wells in certain locations and increasing t he cost of disposal in others.

&#160; 

Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil, natural gas, and associated liquids including from the development of shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of additional federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells, increased compliance costs and time, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We refer you to the risk factor &#8220;We are subject to complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities&#8221; in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report. 

&#160; 

Greenhouse Gas Emissions . In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to human health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their greenhouse gas emissions also will be required to meet &#8220;best available control technology&#8221; standards that will be established on a case-by case basis. One of our subsidiaries operates compressor stations, which are facilities that are required to adhere to the PSD or Title V permit requirements. EPA rulemakings related to greenhouse gas emissions could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources. 

The EPA also has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and gas production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations. More recently, in 2015, the Obama Administration announced that the EPA is expected to finalize in 2016 new regulations that will set methane emission standards for new and modified oil and gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities as part of the Administration&#8217;s efforts to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by up to 45% from 2012 levels by 2025. EPA proposed such regulations in August 2015. 

Although Congress from time to time has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of states, including states in which we operate, have enacted or passed measures to track and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and regional greenhouse gas cap-and-trade programs. Most of these cap-and-trade programs require major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal is achieved. These reductions may cause the cost of allowances to escalate significantly over time. 

The adoption and implementation of regulations that require reporting of greenhouse gases or otherwise limit emissions of greenhouse gases from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to monitor and report on greenhouse gas emissions or install new equipment to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations. In addition, these regulatory initiatives could drive down demand for our products by stimulating demand for alternative forms of energy that do not rely on combustion of fossil fuels that serve as a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. At the same time, new laws and regulations are prompting power producers to shift from coal to natural gas, which is increasing demand. 

Further, in December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. To the extent that the United States and other countries implement this agreement or impose other climate change regulations on the oil and gas industry, it could have an adverse effect on our business. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Employee health and safety. Our operations are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. 

&#160; 

Canada. Our activities in Canada have, to date, been limited to certain geological and geophysical activities that are not subject to extensive environmental regulation. If and when we begin drilling and development activities in New Brunswick, we will be subject to federal, provincial and local environmental regulations . 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 2,597 total &#160; employees. None of our employees were covered by a collective bargaining agr eement at year-end 2015 . We believe that our relationships with our employees are good. In January 2016, as a result of lower anticipated drilling activity due to a prolonged depressed commodity price environment, we announced a workforce reduction of approximately 1,100 employees. We expect this reduction to be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter of 2016. Affected employees were offered a severance package, which included a one-time cash payment depending on length of service and, if applicable, amendments to outstanding equity awards to modify forfeiture provisions.

&#8220; Unconventional play &#8221; &#160; &#160; A play in which the targeted reservoirs generally fall into one of three categories: (1) tight sands, (2) coal beds, or (3) shales. The reservoirs tend to cover large areas and lack the readily apparent traps, seals and discrete hydrocarbon-water boundaries that typically define conventional reservoirs. These reservoirs generally require fracture stimulation treatments or other special recovery processes in order to produce economic flow rates. 

&#160; 

&#8220; Undeveloped acreage &#8221; Those leased acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic quantities of oil or gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. For additional information, see the SEC &#8217; s definition in Item 1208(c)(4) of Regulation S-K, a link for which is available at the SEC &#8217; s website . 

&#160; 

&#8220; Undeveloped natural gas, oil and NGL reserves &#8221; Undeveloped natural gas, oil and NGL reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Also referred to as &#8220;undeveloped reserves.&#8221; For additional information, see the SEC&#8217;s definition in Rule 4-10(a) (31) of Regulation S-X, a link for which is available at the SEC&#8217;s website .

&#160; 

&#8220; Well spacing &#8221; &#160; The regulation of the number and location of wells over an oil or natural gas reservoir, as a conservation measure. Well spacing is normally accomplished by order of the regulatory conservation commission in the applicable jurisdiction. The order may be statewide in its application (subject to change for local conditions) or it may be entered for each field after its discovery. In the operational context, &#8220;well spacing&#8221; refers to the area attributable between producing wells within the scope of what is permitted under a regulatory order. 

&#160; 

&#8220; Working interest &#8221; &#160; An operating interest that gives the owner the right to drill, produce and conduct operating activities on the property and to receive a share of production. 

&#160; 

&#8220; Workovers &#8221; &#160; Operations on a producing well to restore or increase production.
