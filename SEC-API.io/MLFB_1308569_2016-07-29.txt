Our Plan of Business 

Major League Football, Inc. (the &#147; Company &#148;) is seeking to establish, develop and operate Major League Football (&#34; MLFB &#34;) as a professional spring/summer football league. Our anticipated launch is March 2017. We intend to fill a void by establishing franchises in cities overlooked by existing professional sports leagues and provide fans with professional football in the NFL off-seasons, which will enable it to take a totally non-adversarial approach towards the National Football League (&#34;NFL&#34;). Our spring and early summer schedule ensures no direct competition with autumn/winter sports, including the 32 NFL, 9 Canadian Football League, 627 NCAA, 91 NAIA, 142 JUCO's, 27 Canadian Universities, and thousands of high school and collegiate institution teams.

During April 2016, we determined to reschedule our inaugural year of professional, spring-league football from spring 2016 to spring 2017 due to a lack of adequate funding, and instead during 2016 to launch a development season to develop players, plan for staffing in cities and provide ample time for ticketing agencies and our broadcasting partner to advertise and market MLFB's formal kick-off in 2017. 

Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to the &#147; Company ,&#148; &#147; we ,&#148; &#147; our &#148; or &#147; us &#148; and other similar terms collectively means Major League Football, Inc., a Delaware corporation. Our principal offices are presently located at 6230 University Parkway, Suite 301, Lakewood Ranch, Florida, 34240. Our telephone number is (774) 213-1995. Our Internet website is located at: www.mlfb.com .

We expect that we will need new financing over the next 12 months in order to position our Company for its anticipated launch in March 2017. Specifically, we anticipate that we will need to raise approximately $8 million prior to September 1, 2016 and subsequently, commence another offering or offerings to raise an additional $30 million to cover our operating expenses through the end of 2017.

Single Entity Structure 

We intend to operate the league as a single entity owned, stand alone, dominant independent sports league. The single entity structure will be based on the design of Major League Soccer (MLS), where a single entity sports league owns and operates all of its teams. This corporate structure provides several compelling benefits, including: 

&#183; 

Centralized contracting for players &#8217; services that result in controlled player payrolls without violating antitrust laws 

&#183; 

Greater parity among teams 

&#183; 

Focus on the bottom line 

&#183; 

Controlled costs 

Management believes that this structure will also promote efficiency by depoliticizing decisions on league policies and allowing decisions to be made with consistency and in a timely fashion. Economies of scale will be achieved through centralizing contract negotiations and handling business affairs in the league office to ensure that individual teams are unified in their decision-making. Further, under this structure, we expect teams will operate in the best interest of the league. 

MLFB Market Opportunity 

Major League Football intends to establish a brand that is fan-friendly, exciting, affordable and interactive, but most importantly provides consumers real value for their sports dollars. MLFB will underscore the fans&#146; access to team members, coaches, league officials and other fans, something no other existing or previous football league has ever delivered to its viewing audience. Although Major League Football&#146;s ticket pricing will be a fraction to that of the established professional leagues (NBA, MLB, NHL and NFL), its ultimate goal will be to offer its fans an incomparable value-added experience for their entertainment dollar. 

Additionally, as a result of a carefully crafted study, we will not locate teams in any established NFL cities and more importantly in any Major League Baseball cities, thus avoiding direct in-season competition with an established sports entity. By positioning teams in prime emerging and under-represented markets throughout the contiguous 48 states (including placing teams in well respected and football fan friendly metropolitan markets in the country), our research suggests that an exciting sports entity like Major League Football will be viewed in a positive light by sports fans throughout the US, many of whom are already experiencing post Super Bowl withdrawal. Of equal or greater importance to Major League Football is the fact that both established and peripheral football fans in these exciting new markets will finally be afforded the opportunity of establishing their own personal sports identity while at the same time fostering strong community pride. Lastly, although Major League Football&#146;s long range vision is to maintain a positive working relationship with the NFL, its ultimate intent is to function as an independent, stand-alone entity that captures sports content needed during off season. 

Major League Football intends to disseminate its message using a comprehensive marketing strategy that employs both traditional and new media marketing channels. MLFB&#146;s marketing plans are anticipated to create multiple revenue streams and engage sports fans over a variety of mediums, many of which have only emerged during the past few years. Specifically, Major League Football intends to develop a far-reaching Internet and mobile strategy that will serve as the backbone of its marketing strategy. This will include developing a mobile initiative, where fans can interact with the league, its players, its coaches, and other fans using their mobile phones all while taking advantage of the player name recognition that comes with fantasy football. 

Major League Football also intends to create an interactive website that includes a social networking aspect, podcasts, live video, and more. Along with this new media strategy, cross promotions will also be an important part of the MLFB&#146;s marketing strategy. Major League Football plans to work with businesses involved in video, television, print media and the Internet to promote its business. We believe that the cumulative effect of this marketing plan will help it achieve its early objectives, which include the following: 

&#183; 

Establish itself as a recognized professional football league 

&#183; 

Build a base of teams and fans that is broad enough to sustain business over the critical first five years of operation 

&#183; 

Generate enough revenue to expand its operations in years three through six 

&#183; 

Build successful teams located in regions where there are no existing MLB franchises 

&#183; 

Adopt a spring schedule to avoid competing with professional, collegiate and prep football 

&#183; 

Provide year-round cash flow from multi-functioning revenue streams 

&#183; 

Build a positive image for the league through year-round community relations campaigns 

Professional Sports Market 

The sports media market in North America was worth $60.5 billion in 2014. It is expected to reach $73.5 billion by 2019. The biggest reason for such growth is projected increases in revenue derived from media rights deals, which is predicted to surpass gate revenues as the sports industry&#146;s largest segment. Sports media rights are projected to go from $14.6 billion in 2014 to $20.6 billion by 2019, accounting for a compound annual rate increase of 7.2%. Upon closer inspection it becomes clearly evident that professional football is far and away the leader in this prestigious space. 

Major League Football recognizes the NFL is the dominant professional sports league in the United States. Although it clearly respects the success of the NFL business model, its defined objective is to position itself as an independent, non-adversarial football league. Major League Football believes that its own business model encompasses innovations that will be viewed positively by NFL officials, resulting in a strong working relationship between the two leagues. 

Major League Football will endeavor to maximize ticket vendor technology and enhance its services to patrons with innovative ticketing procedures that include: 

&#183; 

Average ticket prices targeted at approximately one fourth the prices of NFL, NBA, NHL &#38; MLB tickets 

&#183; 

Year-round cash flow derived from multiple revenue streams utilizing new technologies that didn &#8217; t exist as recently as a few years ago 

&#183; 

A highly developed marketing strategy that uses both traditional and new media to attract existing football fans as well as an entirely untapped market of potential new fans 

&#183; 

A more interactive, informative website in professional sports using cutting edge technologies that help preserve fan loyalty 

&#183; 

Proven executive staff members with considerable practical experience in professional football 

&#183; 

Player and coaching costs projected at 65-80% less than those of the NFL, NBA, NHL or MLB 

Initially, Major League Football teams will operate in either existing collegiate or municipal stadiums during the under-represented spring and early summer season, 19 of which are among the top fifty (50) of the Nations (366) statistical market regions. Over the past decade, none of the proposed Major League Football team cities have shown a drop in population while during the same period of time, five of the current NFL franchise cities (Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Detroit, Buffalo and New Orleans) showed significant negative change. 

We believe that our business model and long range vision possesses many innovations that will be viewed in a positive light by NFL owners and league officials, and will also lend itself to the potential of establishing a strong working relationship with our venture by positioning ourselves in a 100% non-adversarial position to the established NFL. 

Audience 

Major League Football believes that today&#146;s market demands a controlled deliverable to a targeted demographic viewing audience as well as controlled advertising deliverables to specific targeted demographic audiences as well. Other sports attract audiences that are only a fraction of that number, in producing the sponsor and advertiser concerns. Therefore, retaining the mass appeal needed to attract such an audience is an over-arching consideration that shapes much of what we do and what concerns us. 

We believe our largest competitive advantage on television will be that our product will be offered in prime time weekend viewing time slots, through a broad array of regional telecasts, with key matchups of national interest featured as late games on Saturday, Sunday afternoons and evenings. We believe that scheduling and broadcasting our games in standard time slots will prevent potential fragmentation of our audience and commoditization our product. 

Integration of Television and Media - American Sports Network Contract 

On January 7, 2016, Major League Football entered into a two-year television contract with American Sports Network (&#147;ASN&#148;), a division of Sinclair Networks Group, which is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group. The agreement includes broadcasting for all regular season and post season MLFB games in both 2016 (season postponed) and 2017, along with promotional activity at the local level in each MLFB&#146;s franchise markets. In year two, with the anticipated MLFB expansion teams growing from eight to twelve franchises, ASN and MLFB will provide MLFB fans with the ability to view every single regular season and post season game on multiple television outlets and digital media platforms for the next two MLFB seasons. 

Merchandising &#38; Licensing Overview 

The thrust of our licensing and co-branding strategy is to create an increase in brand value for MLFB and the partners we align with. In order for the league to have a robust licensing and co-branding business, we have created a 3-tier approach that focuses on generating strong revenue streams for the league and initiating value based collaborative efforts that further enhance the MLFB brand. 

The main benefits of the program are: 

&#183; 

Fans will find quality items at more favorable price points 

&#183; 

Teams will gain more profit on each item, and stop tying up money on inventory they can &#8217; t properly sell through 

&#183; 

More fans will be wearing and supporting the team and league branded merchandise, which is the number one way to brand outside the stadium 

We also intend to develop private label products where we will feature products that are core fan favorites (hats, shirts, popular novelties and gifts, etc.) all manufactured at the highest level, and priced far below traditional licensed sports merchandise programs. All merchandise, when league sanctioned, will be pre-ticketed and priced.

Competition 

We face significant competition within the professional sports league market and in order to attract fans and market league-related merchandise and other products and services offered by the Company and the league, we must successfully compete with 32 NFL, 9 Canadian Football League, 627 NCAA, 91 NAIA, 142 JUCO's, 27 Canadian Universities, and thousands of high school and collegiate institution teams. Additionally, we must compete with other sporting and non-sporting sources of entertainment.

Government Regulation 

We expect that our business operations will be subject to minimal government regulation. 

Employees 

Our Company currently has 10 full-time employees. We fully expect to engage additional employees, consultants and/or independent contractors to assist with our operations as our Company grows. Our goal is to keep our corporate structure simple and small to allow for quick decision making, control, and low operating budgets.

Corporate Headquarters

Company History 

On July 14, 2014 our Company entered into and closed a definitive Asset Purchase Agreement with Major League Football, LLC, a company formed in 2009, to establish, develop and operate a professional spring/summer football league to be known as &#147;Major League Football&#148; (&#147; MLFB &#148;). Pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, we issued Major League Football, LLC 8,000,000 shares of our common stock in exchange for assets of Major League Football, LLC primarily comprised of business plans and related proprietary documents, trademarks and other related intellectual property related to the development of the league. Also, our Board of Directors was expanded, a new management team was appointed, and a number of league consultants were retained by our Company. On November 24, 2014, we changed our name to Major League Football, Inc. from Universal Capital Management, Inc. 

Prior to July 13, 2014, our primary business was to identify and advise in development and market consumer products. Our strategy employed three primary channels: Direct Response Television (Infomercials), Television Shopping Networks and Retail Outlets. We sought to assist and enable entrepreneurs to introduce products to the consumer market. Entrepreneurs could leverage our experience and valuable business contacts in functions such as product selection, marketing development, media buying and direct response television production. Inventors and entrepreneurs submitted products or business concepts for our input and advice. We generated revenues from two primary sources (i) management of the entire business cycle of the consumer product and (ii) sales of consumer products, for which we received a share of net profits of consumer products sold.
