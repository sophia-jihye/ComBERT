Overview 

Phibro Animal Health Corporation is a leading global diversified animal health and mineral nutrition company. We are committed to providing livestock producers with value-based products and solutions to help them maintain and enhance the health and productivity of their animals and meet the growing demand for animal protein. Our sales, marketing and technical support organization of approximately 300 employees sells more than 1,400 product presentations in over 65 countries to approximately 3,000 customers. We develop, manufacture and market products for a broad range of food animals including poultry, swine, beef and dairy cattle and aquaculture. Our products help prevent, control and treat diseases, enhance nutrition to help improve health and performance and contribute to balanced mineral nutrition. We sell animal health and mineral nutrition products either directly to integrated poultry, swine and cattle integrators or through commercial animal feed manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors. 

Our products include: 

&#8226; 

Animal health products such as antibacterials, anticoccidials and vaccines, which help prevent and manage infectious disease in livestock and therefore improve food safety, and nutritional specialty products, which enhance nutrition to help improve health and performance. 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Mineral nutrition products that fortify the animal&#8217;s diet and help maintain optimal health. 

&#8203;

We have focused our efforts in regions where the majority of livestock production is consolidated in large commercial farms such as the United States, Brazil, China, Russia, Mexico, Australia, Turkey, Israel, Canada and Europe, and we believe we are well positioned to further accelerate our growth with our established network of sales, marketing and distribution professionals in emerging markets in Latin America, Asia Pacific, Europe and Africa. 

In addition to animal health and mineral nutrition products, we manufacture and market specific ingredients for use in the personal care, automotive, industrial chemical and chemical catalyst industries. We sell performance products directly to customers in the aforementioned industries.

&#8203;

Our animal health products help our customers prevent, control and treat diseases and enhance nutrition to help improve health and performance, enabling our customers to more efficiently produce high-quality, wholesome animal protein products for human consumption. We develop, manufacture and market animal health products for a broad range of food animals including poultry, swine, beef and dairy cattle and aquaculture. We provide technical and product support directly to our customers to ensure the optimal use of our products. The animal health industry and demand for many of our animal health products in a particular region are affected by changing disease pressures and by weather conditions, as usage of our products follows varying weather patterns and seasons. As a result, we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our animal health segment. Animal Health net sales by product group and regions were:

Our MFAs and other business primarily consists of concentrated medicated products that are administered through animal feeds, commonly referred to as Medicated Feed Additives (&#8220;MFAs&#8221;). Our MFAs and other business primarily consists of the production and sale of antibacterials (including Stafac &#174; , Terramycin &#174; , Neo-Terramycin &#174; and Mecadox &#174; ) and anticoccidials (including Nicarb &#174; , Aviax &#174; , Aviax 

Plus&#8482;, Coxistac&#8482; and amprolium). Growth in this business primarily stems from increased penetration into emerging markets. MFAs and other also includes antibacterial products used to control bacterial infections, as well as other processing aids, for the ethanol fermentation industry. 

Approximately 55% of our MFAs and other sales in fiscal year 2016 were to the poultry industry, with sales to swine, cattle, dairy and other customers accounting for the remainder. The principal regions we serve include the U.S. and Canada, Brazil and Latin America, China and Asia Pacific, and Israel and other, with the largest region (as measured by net sales) accounting for less than half of total net sales. 

Nutritional Specialties 

Many of our proprietary nutritional specialty products have been developed through basic research in cooperation with private research companies or by leading universities with whom we collaborate and then further develop through commercial trials with customers. Our nutritional specialty products include OmniGen-AF &#174; , a unique, patented nutritional specialty product that has been shown in several studies to help maintain a cow&#8217;s healthy immune system, and Animate &#174; , a unique, patented anionic nutritional specialty product that helps optimize the health and performance of the transition dairy cow. We sell OmniGen-AF in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, several European countries, Turkey, Israel, Japan, China and Australia. We sell Animate in the United States, Canada and Mexico. We sell Magni-Phi &#174; , a unique proprietary specialty product that has been shown in several studies to help improve immune response in poultry, which may lead to better health and performance, to poultry integrators in the United States. 

Vaccines 

Our vaccines products are primarily focused on preventing diseases in poultry and swine. We market these products in the United States, Israel, Turkey, China, South East Asia, India, East and Central Europe, Brazil and other Latin American countries and various African countries. Our vaccine products protect animals from both viral and bacterial disease challenges. 

We have developed and distribute over 25 vaccine presentations for prevention of disease in poultry including vaccines to protect against Infectious Bursal Disease, Infectious Bronchitis, and Newcastle Disease. 

In January 2016, we acquired the business and assets of MVP Laboratories, Inc. (&#8220;MVP&#8221;), which developed, manufactured and distributed autogenous vaccines against bacterial and viral diseases, adjuvants and other products. As a result of this acquisition, we became the manufacturer of the MJ Biologics, Inc. (&#8220;MJB&#8221;) autogenous vaccine against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (&#8220;PRRS&#8221;), which we have exclusively distributed pursuant to an agreement entered into with MJB in January 2015. We and MJB have also agreed to collaborate on the development of certain other animal vaccines. We have agreed to purchase MJB&#8217;s intellectual property and certain other assets comprising MJB&#8217;s animal vaccines business with an expected closing date of January 1, 2021. 

We are also the exclusive distributor of Epitopix&#8217;s autogenous vaccines protecting against various diseases including Salmonella and E. coli for chickens in the United States, containing their proprietary SRP &#174; technology, primarily for broiler breeders and table egg laying hens. Our autogenous vaccines allow us to produce custom vaccines for veterinarians that contain antigens specific to each farm, allowing Phibro to provide comprehensive health management solutions to our customers. 

We have developed TAbic &#174; , an innovative and proprietary delivery platform for vaccines. TAbic is a patented technology for formulation and delivery of vaccine antigens in effervescent tablets, packaged in sealed aluminum blister packages. The technology replaces the glass bottles that are in common use today, and offers significant advantages including storage requirements, customer handling and disposal. Several of our vaccine products are available in the patented TAbic format. We also focus on innovation to produce new antigens or new presentations of antigens, and have developed new vaccines, such as the inactivated subunit Infectious Bursal Disease Virus and Egg Drop Syndrome vaccines, being sold as monovalent vaccines or in combinations with other antigens. 

Mineral Nutrition 

Our Mineral Nutrition business manufactures and markets more than 400 formulations and concentrations of trace minerals such as zinc, manganese, copper, iron and other compounds, with a focus on customers in North America. Our customers use these products to fortify the daily feed requirements of their livestock&#8217;s diets and maintain an optimal balance of trace elements in each animal. We manufacture and market mineral nutrition products for a broad range of food animals including poultry, swine and beef and dairy cattle. Volume growth in the mineral nutrition sector is primarily driven by livestock production numbers, while pricing is largely based on costs of the underlying commodity metals. Demand for our mineral nutrition products can vary in different seasons of the year and due to changes in weather conditions in a particular region, both of which may cause animal feed consumption to fluctuate. As a result, we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our Mineral Nutrition segment.

&#8203; &#8203; Anticoccidial for poultry &#8203; Antibacterials are biological or chemical products used in the animal health industry to treat or to prevent bacterial diseases, thereby promoting more efficient livestock growth. Several factors contribute to limit the efficiency, weight gain and feed conversions of livestock production, including stress, poor nutrition, environmental and management challenges and disease. Antibacterials help prevent, control and treat disease in livestock, which can also lead to improved overall health of the animals, improved rate of weight gain and more efficient feed conversion. Our antibacterial products include: 

&#8226; 

Oxytetracycline and Neomycin . Terramycin &#174; utilizes the active ingredient oxytetracycline and Neo-Terramycin &#174; combines the active ingredients neomycin and oxytetracycline to prevent, control and treat a wide range of diseases in chickens, turkeys, cattle, swine and aquaculture. We sell Terramycin and/or Neo-Terramycin products primarily in the United States, Latin America, Mexico and Asia to livestock and aquaculture producers, feed companies and distributors.

Mecadox is sold primarily in the United States to feed companies and large integrated swine producers. 

&#8203;

Anticoccidials are produced through fermentation and chemical synthesis, and are primarily used to prevent and control the disease coccidiosis in poultry and cattle, thereby promoting more efficient livestock growth. Coccidiosis is a disease of the digestive tract that has considerable health consequences to livestock and, as a result, is of great concern to livestock producers. We sell our anticoccidials primarily to integrated poultry producers and feed companies in North America, Latin America and Asia, and to international animal health companies. Our anticoccidial products include: 

&#8226; 

Nicarbazin . We produce and market nicarbazin under the trademark Nicarb &#174; and as an active pharmaceutical ingredient. Nicarbazin is a broad-spectrum anticoccidial used for coccidiosis prevention in chickens. 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Amprolium . We produce and market amprolium as an active pharmaceutical ingredient. We also have received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) approval to sell amprolium as Boviprol&#8482; 9.6% Oral Solution to cattle and calves and Coxiprol&#8482; 9.6% Oral Solution to poultry.

&#8203;

We also focus on innovation to produce new antigens or new presentations of antigens, and have developed new vaccines, such as the inactivated subunit Infectious Bursal Disease Virus and Egg Drop Syndrome vaccines, being sold as monovalent vaccines or in combinations with other antigens. 

MJPRRS &#174; , an autogenous vaccine for swine, is administered to pregnant sows to protect their offspring from PRRS in the United States. This vaccine includes multiple PRRS isolates representing different groups of PRRS viruses. 

Mineral Nutrition 

Our mineral nutrition products principally include inorganic and organic compounds of copper, zinc, cobalt, iron, selenium, manganese, magnesium and iodine. 

Our major mineral nutrition customers are regional and national feed companies, distributors, co-ops, premixers, integrated swine, beef and poultry operations and pet food companies. The majority of our customers have nutrition staffs who determine their own formulae for custom trace mineral premixes. 

Trace mineral costs fluctuate with commodity markets, and therefore, these products are price-sensitive. Their sale requires a focused effort on cost management, quality control, customer service, pricing and logistics execution to be profitable. 

Performance Products 

Our Performance Products business manufactures and markets products for use in the personal care, automotive, industrial chemical and chemical catalyst industries. We operate the business through our PhibroChem (a division of PAHC), Ferro Metal and Chemical Corporation Limited and Phibro-Tech, Inc. (&#8220;Phibro-Tech&#8221;) business units. 

Sales and Marketing 

Our sales organization includes sales, marketing and technical support employees. In markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence, we generally contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for our products. Together, our Animal Health and Mineral Nutrition businesses have a sales, marketing and technical support organization of approximately 300 employees plus approximately 200 distributors who market our portfolio of more than 1,300 product presentations to livestock producers, animal feed companies and distributors in over 65 countries. 

In direct sales markets, we sell our animal health and mineral nutrition products through our local sales offices, either directly to integrated poultry, swine and cattle integrators or through commercial animal feed manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors. Our sales representatives visit our customers, including animal feed companies, distributors and livestock producers, to inform, promote and sell our products and services. In direct service markets, our technical operations specialists provide scientific consulting focused on disease management and herd management, training and education on diverse topics, including responsible product use. 

We sell our Performance Products through our local sales offices to the personal care, automotive, industrial chemical and chemical catalyst industries. We market these products predominately in the United States. 

Customers 

We have approximately 3,000 customers, of which approximately 2,700 customers are served by our Animal Health and Mineral Nutrition businesses. We consider a diverse set of livestock producers, including poultry and swine operations and beef and dairy farmers, to be the primary customers of our livestock products. We sell our products directly to livestock and aquaculture producers and to distributors that typically re-sell the products to livestock producers. We do not consider the business to be dependent on a single customer or a few customers, and we believe the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our results. 

We typically sell pursuant to purchase orders from customers and generally do not enter into long-term delivery contracts. 

Product Registrations, Patents and Trademarks 

We own certain product registrations, patents, trade names and trademarks, and use know-how, trade secrets, formulae and manufacturing techniques, which assist in maintaining the competitive positions of certain of our products. We believe that technology is an important component of our competitive position, and it provides us with low cost positions enabling us to produce high quality products. Patents protect some of our technology, but a significant portion of our competitive advantage is based on know-how built up over many years of commercial operation, which is protected as trade secrets. We own, or have exclusive rights to use under license, more than 160 patents or pending applications in more than 40 countries but we believe that no single patent is of material importance to our business and, accordingly, that the expiration or termination thereof would not materially affect our business. 

We market our animal health products under hundreds of governmental product registrations approving many of our products with respect to animal drug safety and efficacy. The use of many of our medicated products is controlled by regulatory authorities that are specific to each country (e.g., the FDA 

in the United States, Health Canada in Canada and EFSA/EMA in Europe). Because they regulate the safety and wholesomeness of the human food supply, their responsibility includes feed additives for animals from which human food products are derived. Each of our medicated products is registered separately in each country where it is sold. We continuously monitor, maintain and update the appropriate registration files pertaining to such regulations and approvals. In certain countries where we work with a third party distributor, local regulatory requirements may require registration in the name of such distributor. As of June 30, 2016, we had over 750 Animal Health product registrations globally, including 450 MFA registrations and 300 vaccine registrations. Our MFA global registrations included 88 registrations for virginiamycin. 

Additionally, many of our vaccine products are based on proprietary master seeds, proprietary adjuvant formulations or patented virus grouping technology. We actively seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by seeking to require our employees, consultants, advisors and partners to enter into confidentiality agreements and other arrangements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement. 

We seek to file and maintain trademark registrations around the world based on commercial activities in most regions where we have, or desire to have, a business presence for a particular product or service. We currently maintain, or have rights to use under license, more than 1,400 trademark registrations or pending applications globally, identifying goods and services related to our business. 

Our technology, brands and other intellectual property are important elements of our business. We rely on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as non-disclosure agreements, to protect our intellectual property rights. Our policy is to vigorously protect, enforce and defend our rights to our intellectual property, as appropriate. 

Regulatory 

Many of our animal health and mineral nutrition products require licensing by a governmental agency before marketing. To maintain compliance with these regulatory requirements, we have established processes, systems and dedicated resources with end-to-end involvement from product concept to launch and maintenance in the market. Our regulatory function seeks to engage in dialogue with various global agencies regarding their policies that relate to animal health products. For products that are currently subject to formal licensing by government agencies, our business relies on the ongoing approval and/or periodic re-approval of those licenses. Failure to maintain and, where applicable, renew those licenses for any reason including, but not limited to, changing regulations, more stringent technical, legal or regulatory requirements, or failure of the company or its agents to make timely, complete or accurate submissions, could result in suspension or loss of the company&#8217;s rights to market its products in one or more countries. 

United States 

In the United States, governmental oversight of animal nutrition and health products is conducted primarily by the United States Department of Agriculture (&#8220;USDA&#8221;) and/or the FDA. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (the &#8220;EPA&#8221;) has jurisdiction over certain products applied topically to animals or to premises to control external parasites and shares regulatory jurisdiction of ethanol manufactured in biofuel manufacturing facilities with the FDA. 

The USDA and the FDA are primarily responsible for the safety and wholesomeness of the U.S. human food supply. The FDA regulates foods intended for human consumption and, through the Center for Veterinary Medicine (&#8220;CVM&#8221;), regulates the manufacture and distribution of animal drugs that will be given to animals from which human foods are derived. All manufacturers of animal health pharmaceuticals must show their products to be safe, effective and produced by a consistent method of manufacture as defined under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. To protect the food and drug supply for animals, the FDA develops technical standards for animal drug safety and effectiveness and evaluates data necessary to support approvals of veterinary drugs. Drug sponsors are required to file reports of certain product quality defects and adverse events in accordance with agency requirements. 

The main regulatory body in the United States for veterinary pesticides is the EPA. The EPA&#8217;s Office of Pesticide Programs is responsible for the regulation of pesticide products applied to animals. All manufacturers of animal health pesticides must show their products will not cause &#8220;unreasonable adverse 

effects to man or the environment&#8221; as stated in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. Within the United States, pesticide products that are approved by the EPA must also be approved by individual state pesticide authorities before distribution in that state. Post-approval monitoring of products is required, with reports provided to the EPA and some state regulatory agencies. 

FDA approval of Type A/B/C Medicated Feed Articles and drugs is based on satisfactory demonstration of safety, efficacy, manufacturing quality standards and appropriate labelling. Efficacy requirements are based on the desired label claim and encompass all species for which label indication is desired. Safety requirements include target animal safety and, in the case of food animals, human food safety (HFS). HFS reviews encompass drug residue levels and the safety of those residue levels. In addition to the safety and efficacy requirements for animal drugs used in food-producing animals, environmental safety must be demonstrated. Depending on the compound, the environmental studies may be quite extensive and expensive. In many instances, the regulatory hurdles for a drug that will be used in food-producing animals are at least as stringent as, if not more so than, those required for a drug used in humans. 

The Office of New Animal Drug Evaluation is responsible for reviewing information submitted by drug sponsors who wish to obtain approval to manufacture and sell animal drugs. A new animal drug is deemed unsafe unless there is an approved New Animal Drug Application (&#8220;NADA&#8221;). Virtually all animal drugs are &#8220;new animal drugs&#8221; within the meaning of the term in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. An approved Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application (&#8220;ANADA&#8221;) is a generic equivalent of an NADA previously approved by the FDA. Both are administered by the FDA. The drug development process for human therapeutics can be more involved than that for animal drugs. However, because human food safety and environmental safety are issues for food-producing animals, the animal drug approval process for food-producing animals typically takes longer than for non-food-producing animals, such as companion animals. 

The FDA may deny an NADA or ANADA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information, or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product. There can be no assurances that FDA approval of any NADA or ANADA will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. Moreover, if regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed. Finally, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur following initial marketing. Among the conditions for NADA or ANADA approval is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer&#8217;s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to FDA&#8217;s current Good Manufacturing Practice (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;) regulations. A manufacturing facility is periodically inspected by the FDA for determination of compliance with cGMP after an initial pre-approval inspection. Certain subsequent manufacturing changes must be approved by the FDA prior to implementation. In complying with standards set forth in these regulations, manufacturers must continue to expend time, monies and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure compliance. The process of seeking FDA approvals can be costly, time consuming, and subject to unanticipated and significant delays. There can be no assurance that such approvals will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. Any delay in obtaining or any failure to obtain FDA or foreign government approvals, or the suspension or revocation of such approvals, would adversely affect our ability to introduce and market our products and to generate revenue. 

The issue of the potential for increased bacterial resistance to certain antibiotics used in certain food-producing animals is the subject of discussions on a worldwide basis and, in certain instances, has led to government restrictions on the use of antibiotics in these food-producing animals. The sale of antibiotics is a material portion of our business. Legislative bills are introduced in the United States Congress from time to time that, if adopted, could have an adverse effect on our business. One of these initiatives is a proposed bill called the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act, which has been introduced in every Congress since the mid 2000&#8217;s. To date, such bills have not had sufficient support to become law. Should statutory, regulatory or other developments result in restrictions on the sale of our products, it could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

In November 2004, the CVM released a draft for comment of its risk assessment of streptogramin resistance for treatment of certain infections in humans attributable to the use of streptogramins in animals 

(the &#8220;risk assessment&#8221;). The risk assessment was initiated after approval of a human drug called Synercid &#174; (quinupristin/dalfopristin) for treating vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREf), which led to increased attention regarding the use of streptogramins in animals. Synercid and virginiamycin (the active ingredient in our Stafac product) are both members of the streptogramin class of antimicrobial drugs. The risk assessment was unable to produce any firm conclusions as to whether, and, if so, how much, the use of virginiamycin in food animals contributes to the occurrence of streptogramin-resistant infections in humans via a foodborne pathway. 

In classifying virginiamycin in 2003 as a &#8220;medically important antimicrobial&#8221; (&#8220;MIA&#8221;) on the CVM&#8217;s Guidance for Industry (&#8220;GFI&#8221;) 152 list, a guidance document for evaluating the microbial safety of antimicrobial new animal drugs on food for human consumption, the FDA&#8217;s stated concern was the potential impact on use of Synercid for treating VREf in humans. In 2010, the U.S. label for Synercid was changed and the VREf indication was removed. The FDA determined that data submitted by the sponsor of Synercid failed to verify clinical benefit of the product for the treatment of VREf infections in humans. In September 2011, we requested that FDA remove the streptogramin class of antimicrobials from GFI 152 to reflect that they are not &#8220;medically important&#8221; for human therapy. In March 2012, the FDA declined our request, citing primarily the need to engage all stakeholders on any possible changes to GFI 152 through the processes mandated by the FDA&#8217;s good guidance practices, including issuing guidance revisions in draft and giving the public an opportunity to comment. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in the future in gaining the FDA&#8217;s agreement with our view that removal of the VREf indication for Synercid requires the FDA to remove virginiamycin from the GFI 152 list. 

In April 2012, the CVM released its GFI 209 (&#8220;The Judicious Use of Medically Important Antimicrobial Drugs in Food-Producing Animals&#8221;). In December 2013, the CVM released the final version of GFI 213 (&#8220;New Animal Drugs and New Animal Drug Combination Products Administered in or on Medicated Feed or Drinking Water of Food-Producing Animals: Recommendations for Drug Sponsors for Voluntarily Aligning Product Use Conditions with GFI #209&#8221;), and the proposed language relating to amending the current Veterinary Feed Directive (&#8220;VFD&#8221;) regulations. The two Guidance documents and the proposed revised VFD language are all relevant to the use of MIAs in the feed or drinking water of food-producing animals. The two key principles of GFI 209 are that MIAs should be limited to those uses that are considered necessary for assuring animal health, namely for the prevention, control, and/or treatment of disease, and that MIA use in food-producing animals should include veterinary oversight/&#8203;consultation. GFI 213 outlines CVM&#8217;s proposal with respect to removing production claims for MIAs as well as the path a sponsor may take for new claims. These Guidance documents are not legally binding, but they do reflect the FDA&#8217;s current thinking. These GFIs provide an opportunity for sponsors to seek to amend product claims to more accurately reflect the health function of antimicrobial products; however, there can be no assurance that if a sponsor presents a specific proposal to pursue such changes the FDA will agree with that proposal or, even if the FDA does agree, that the execution of the work and the subsequent submission to the FDA will successfully achieve the desired label amendments. 

In June 2015, the CVM issued final revisions to the existing VFD regulations, which include changes to the control and use of antimicrobial products for use in animal feed. Prior to implementation of the revised VFD regulations, many approved antimicrobial products could be obtained and used without formal veterinary authorization. Under the new VFD regulations, affected antimicrobial products may only be used if authorized by a veterinarian in accordance with the VFD regulations. The current use of our antimicrobial products in the United States typically, but not always, involves veterinary oversight. However, the final VFD regulations may impose additional costs on some producers, which may discourage them from using our antimicrobial products. The FDA would like companies to complete the process for label changes relating to the new GFI 213 by January 2017. 

In the United States, the antibacterial products within our poultry business, the largest portion of our MFAs and other business in this region, as well as our cattle business, have both approved therapeutic and non-therapeutic indications. We believe, based on current producer usage patterns, that the large majority of use of our products in these segments that have been classified by the FDA as medically important antibacterials is for therapeutic purposes. We currently generate a portion of our revenues from antibacterial products sold for use in turkeys and swine in the United States where we do not currently have therapeutic claims that match our customers&#8217; usage patterns. We intend to ensure that our antibacterial 

product offerings are in alignment with the FDA&#8217;s guidance documents within the FDA&#8217;s three-year implementation period, and are pursuing both new and additional therapeutic claims for these products under the process provided by the FDA. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such claims. While it is difficult to predict exactly what impact the removal of non-therapeutic claims for our products that have been classified by the FDA as medically important antibacterials will ultimately have on our sales, we estimate that, had we voluntarily decided to withdraw all of our non-therapeutic claims in the United States, and did not add any new therapeutic claims, our MFAs and other net sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, would have been reduced by approximately $7 million. 

In April 2016, the FDA began initial steps to withdraw approval of Mecadox (carbadox), due to concerns that certain residues from the product may persist in tissues for longer than previously determined. This initial action by the FDA does not prohibit the sale or use of Mecadox in the United States. Mecadox has been approved and sold in the United States for more than 40 years and is a widely used treatment for controlling bacterial diseases including Salmonella and swine dysentery. Mecadox is not used in human medicine and the class of drug is not considered a medically important antimicrobial. The approved Mecadox label requires a 42-day withdrawal period pre-harvesting, and to date we have not seen any hazardous residues of carbadox being detected from pig meat treated in accordance with the approved label. We have complete confidence in the safety of Mecadox. In response to FDA inquiries several years ago, we began rigorous new studies of the continued safety of the product when used in accordance with the label. Our studies were completed in July 2016, and we submitted our data, analyses and information to the FDA that we believe support the continued safe use of Mecadox. The timing of the FDA&#8217;s response to our submission is not subject to a predetermined deadline. Our sales of Mecadox in the United States were approximately $15 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. Should we be unable to successfully defend the safety of the product, the loss of Mecadox sales would have a negative impact to the results of our operations. 

In February 2015, the FDA conducted a follow-up inspection at our Teaneck, NJ headquarters to verify changes to and corrective actions related to various analytical test results and practices, expiration dating and reporting requirements regarding specification non-conformance. A Form 483 was issued, which contained one inspectional observation citing two examples of the observed violation. The observation questioned whether or not we are able to confirm that the drug components (of Type A medicated products) remain uniformly dispersed and stable under ordinary conditions of shipment, storage and use. We responded to the inspectional observation in writing in March 2015. This inspectional observation has not impacted our ability to market products in the United States or any other country, and we expect the Form 483 observation will be satisfactorily addressed. 

In March 2016, the FDA conducted a cGMP audit of our manufacturing facility at Guarulhos, Brazil. The FDA issued inspectional observations (Form 483) pertaining to six observations made during the inspection. We responded to the inspectional observations in May 2016 and have committed to provide additional data when available. It is likely the FDA will require a follow up site inspection to review the actions we have taken. Such an inspection, if needed, could occur at any time, or may be incorporated with a routine cGMP audit. The timing of such audits is determined by the FDA but is typically at approximately two year intervals. While we have taken actions to address our cGMP program and are working to implement the FDA&#8217;s remaining recommendations, there can be no assurance that the FDA will concur. Failure to comply with cGMP standards could have a financially material impact on our business. 

While we have taken actions to address our cGMP program and are working with the FDA to implement the FDA&#8217;s remaining recommendations, there can be no assurance that the FDA will concur. Failure to comply with cGMP standards could have a financially material impact on our business. 

European Union 

European Union (&#8220;E.U.&#8221;) legislation requires that veterinary medicinal products must have a marketing authorization before they are placed on the market in the European Union. A veterinary medicinal product must meet certain quality, safety, efficacy and environmental criteria to receive a marketing authorization. The European Medicines Agency (and its main veterinary scientific committee, 

the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use) and the national authorities in the various E.U. Member States, are responsible for administering this regime. 

A separate E.U. regime applies to feed additives. It provides for a re-registration process for existing additives and this process is ongoing. For certain types of additives, the authorizations are not generic in nature (so that they can be relied upon by any operator) but are limited to the company that obtained the marketing authorization. They are known as Brand Specific Approvals (&#8220;BSA&#8221;). The system is similar to the U.S. system, where regulatory approval is for the formulated product or &#8220;brand.&#8221; 

The European Food Safety Authority (&#8220;EFSA&#8221;) is responsible for the E.U. risk assessment regarding food and feed safety. In close collaboration with national authorities and in open consultation with its stakeholders, EFSA provides independent scientific advice and communication on existing and emerging risks. EFSA may issue advice regarding the process of adopting or revising European legislation on food or feed safety, deciding whether to approve regulated substances such as pesticides and food additives, or developing new regulatory frameworks and policies, for instance, in the field of nutrition. EFSA aims to provide appropriate, consistent, accurate and timely communications on food safety issues to all stakeholders and the public at large, based on the Authority&#8217;s risk assessments and scientific expertise. One of the key areas of concern for the EFSA is the containment of antimicrobial resistance. 

A number of manufacturers, including us, submitted dossiers in order to re-register various anticoccidials for the purpose of obtaining regulatory approval from the European Commission. The BSA for our nicarbazin product was published in October 2010. We sell nicarbazin under our own BSA and as an active ingredient for another marketer&#8217;s product that has obtained a BSA and is sold in the European Union. Similarly, a BSA for our semduramicin product, Aviax, was published in 2006 and requires reauthorization in October 2016. We have submitted a dossier for reauthorization in accordance with the requirements of the EFSA. There can be no guarantee that these submissions will be reviewed favorably or in a timely manner. Failure to gain reauthorization in a timely manner could have an adverse financial impact on our business. 

Brazil 

The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock Production and Supply (&#8220;MAPA&#8221;) is the regulatory body in Brazil responsible for the regulation and control of pharmaceuticals, biologicals and medicinal feed additives for animal use. MAPA&#8217;s regulatory activities are conducted through the Secretary of Agricultural Defense and its Livestock Products Inspection Department. These activities include the inspection and licensing of both manufacturing and commercial establishments for veterinary products, as well as the submission, review and approval of pharmaceuticals, biologicals and medicinal feed additives. 

Rest of world 

We are also subject to regulatory requirements governing investigation, clinical trials and marketing approval for animal drugs in many other countries in which our products are sold. The regulatory approval process includes similar risks to those associated with FDA and European Commission approvals set forth above. 

Global policy and guidance 

Country-specific regulatory laws have provisions that include requirements for certain labeling, safety, efficacy and manufacturers&#8217; quality procedures (to assure the consistency of the products), as well as company records and reports. With the exception of Australia, Canada, Japan and New Zealand, most other countries&#8217; regulatory agencies will generally refer to the FDA, USDA, European Union and other international animal health entities, including the World Organization for Animal Health, Codex Alimentarius Commission, the recognized international standard-setting body for food (&#8220;Codex&#8221;), before establishing their own standards and regulations for veterinary pharmaceuticals and vaccines. 

The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives is an international expert scientific committee that is administered jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Health Organization. It provides risk assessments and safety evaluations of residues of veterinary drugs in animal products as well as exposure and residue definition and maximum residue limit 

proposals for veterinary drugs in traded food commodities. These internationally published references may also be used by national authorities when setting domestic standards. We work with the national authorities to establish acceptable safe levels of residual product in food-producing animals after treatment. This in turn enables the calculation of appropriate withdrawal times for our products prior to an animal entering the food chain. 

In July 2014, the Codex adopted risk management advice language for a number of compounds including carbadox. The advice language states &#8220;authorities should prevent residues of carbadox in food. This can be accomplished by not using carbadox in food producing animals.&#8221; The advice language is to provide advice only and is not binding on individual national authorities, and almost all national authorities already have long-established regulatory standards for carbadox, including prohibiting the use of carbadox in swine production within their territory, prohibiting the importation of pork from swine that are fed carbadox, or permitting the importation of pork from swine that are fed carbadox provided there is no detection of carbadox residues in the meat. The advice language may be considered by national authorities in making future risk management determinations. To the extent additional national authorities elect to follow the advice and prohibit the use of carbadox in food-producing animals and/or the importation of pork from swine that are fed carbadox, such decisions could have an adverse effect on our sales of carbadox in those countries or in countries that produce meat for export to those countries. 

Advertising and promotion review 

Promotion of animal health products is controlled by regulations in many countries. These rules generally restrict advertising and promotion to those approved claims and uses that have been reviewed and endorsed by the applicable agency. We conduct a review of promotion material for compliance with the local and regional requirements in the markets where we sell animal health products. 

Food Safety Inspection Service/Generally Recognized As Safe 

The FDA is authorized to determine the safety of substances (including &#8220;generally recognized as safe&#8221; (&#8220;GRAS&#8221;) substances, and food and feed additives), as well as prescribing safe conditions of use. The FDA, which has the responsibility for determining the safety of substances, together with the Food Safety and Inspection Service, the food safety branch within the USDA, maintain the authority in the United States to determine that new substances and new uses of previously approved substances are suitable for use in meat, milk and poultry products. 

In 2008, the FDA announced that the agency required formal review of all additives used in the production of ethanol, including our Lactrol &#174; product (formulated virginiamycin), where the co-products may be used for animal feed. Virginiamycin has been certified by an independent expert panel convened by us as GRAS for use as a processing aid in ethanol production and as related to the use of the resulting distiller&#8217;s co-products for animal feed. We believe that this determination satisfies the FDA requirement. However, there can be no assurance we will be successful in maintaining market access for our Lactrol product or other ethanol production additives that we sell. 

Competition 

We are engaged in highly competitive industries and, with respect to all of our major products, face competition from a substantial number of global and regional competitors. Some competitors have greater financial, R&#38;D, production and other resources than we have. Our competitive position is based principally on our product registrations, customer service and support, breadth of product line, product quality, manufacturing technology, facility location, and product prices. We face competition in every market in which we participate. Some of our principal competitors include Bayer AG, Ceva Sant&#233; Animale, Boehringer Ingelheim International GMBH, Eli Lilly and Company (Elanco Animal Health), Huvepharma Inc., Lallemand Inc., Merck &#38; Co., Inc. (Merck Animal Health and MSD Animal Health), Pharmgate LLC, Sanofi S.A. (Merial), Southeastern Minerals, Inc., Virbac and Zoetis Inc. Many of our products face competition from products that may be used as an alternative or substitute. 

There continues to be consolidation in the animal health market, which could strengthen our competitors. Our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price and performance characteristics. There can 

be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to maintain our current competitive position, however, we believe the following strengths create sustainable competitive advantages that will enable us to continue our growth as a leader in our industry: 

Products Aligned with Need for Increased Protein Production 

Increased scarcity of natural resources is increasing the need for efficient production of food animals such as poultry, swine and cattle. Our key animal health products, including our MFAs, vaccines and nutritional specialty products, help prevent and manage disease outbreaks and enhance nutrition to help support natural defenses against diseases. These products are often critical to our customers&#8217; efficient production of healthy animals. Our leading product franchise, Stafac/V-Max/Eskalin, is approved in over 30 countries for use in poultry, swine and cattle and is regarded as one of the leading MFA products for production animals. Similarly, our nutritional specialty product offerings like OmniGen-AF and Animate are used increasingly in the global dairy industry. 

Global Presence with Existing Infrastructure in Key High-Growth Markets 

We have an established direct presence in many important emerging markets, and we believe we are a leader in many of the emerging markets in which we operate. Our existing operations and established sales, marketing and distribution network in over 65 countries, provide us with opportunities to take advantage of global growth opportunities. Outside of the United States, our global footprint reaches to key high growth regions (countries where the livestock production growth rate is expected to be higher than the average growth rate) including Brazil and other countries in South America, China, India and Southeast Asia, Russia and former CIS countries, Mexico, Turkey, Australia, Canada and South Africa and other countries in Africa. Our operations in countries outside of the United States contributed approximately 53% of our Animal Health segment revenues for the year ended June 30, 2016. 

Leading Positions in High Growth Sub-sectors of the Animal Health Market 

We are a global leader in the development, manufacture and commercialization of MFA products for the animal health market. We believe we are well positioned in the fastest growing food animal species segments of the animal health market with significant presence in poultry and swine, which are projected by Vetnosis to grow globally at compound annual rates from 2015 through 2020 of 6.2% and 5.1%, respectively. Our sales of MFA products were third largest in the animal health market. According to Vetnosis, MFA products are projected to grow at a compound annual rate of approximately 4.0% between 2015 and 2020. 

Diversified and Complementary Product Portfolio with Strong Brand Name Recognition 

We market products across the three largest livestock species (poultry, cattle and swine) and aquaculture and in the major product categories (MFAs, vaccines and nutritional specialty products). We believe our diversity of species and product categories enhances our sales mix and lowers our sales concentration risk. The complementary nature of our Animal Health and Mineral Nutrition portfolio provides us with unique cross-selling opportunities that can be used to gain access to new customers or deepen our relationships with existing customers. We believe we have strong brand name recognition for the Phibro name and for many of our animal health and mineral nutrition products, and we believe Phibro vaccines are recognized as an industry standard in efficacy against highly virulent disease challenges. Our diverse portfolio of products also allows us to address the distinct growing conditions of livestock in different regions. 

Experienced Sales Force and Technical Support Staff with Strong, Consultative Customer Relationships 

Within our Animal Health and Mineral Nutrition segments, utilizing both our sales, marketing and technical support organization of approximately 300 employees and a broad distribution network, we market our portfolio of more than 1,300 product presentations to livestock producers and veterinarians in over 65 countries. We interact with customers at both their corporate and operating level, which we believe allows us to develop an in-depth understanding of their needs. Our technical support and research 

personnel are also important contributors to our overall sales effort. We have a total of approximately 130 technical, field service and quality control/quality assurance personnel throughout the world. These professionals interface directly with our key customers to provide practical solutions to derive optimum benefits from our products. 

Experienced, Committed Employees and Management Team 

We have a diverse and highly skilled team of animal health professionals, including technical and field service personnel located in key countries throughout the world. These individuals have extensive field experience and are vital to helping us maintain and grow our business. Many of our field team have more than 20 years of experience in the animal health industry and many have been with us for more than 10 years. 

We have a strong management team with a proven track record of success at both the corporate and operating levels. The executive management team has diverse backgrounds and an average of approximately 17 years of experience in the animal health industry. 

Employees 

As of June 30, 2016, we had more than 1,300 employees. Employees at our Guarulhos, Brazil facility are covered by a multi-employer regional industry-specific union. Certain of our Israeli employees are covered by site-specific collective bargaining agreements. Certain employees are covered by individual employment agreements. We believe our relations with union and non-union employees are good. 

Manufacturing 

The Animal Health business segment manufactures many products internally and supplements that production with contract manufacturing organizations (&#8220;CMOs&#8221;) as necessary. 

We manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients for certain of our antibacterial and anticoccidial products at our facilities in Guarulhos, Brazil and Braganca Paulista, Brazil. We manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients for certain of our anticoccidial products at our facility in Neot Hovav (formerly Ramat Hovav), Israel. We produce vaccines at our facilities in Beit Shemesh, Israel and Omaha, Nebraska. We produce pharmaceuticals, disinfectants and other animal health products at our facility in Petach Tikva, Israel. We produce certain of our major nutritional specialty and mineral nutrition products at our facilities in Quincy, Illinois, and we produce certain of our mineral nutrition products at our facility in Omaha, Nebraska. 

We supplement internal manufacturing and production capabilities with CMOs. We purchase certain active pharmaceutical ingredients for other medicated products from CMOs in China, India, Mexico and other locations. We then formulate the final dosage form in our facilities and in contract facilities located in the United States, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Australia, China and Israel. 

We purchase certain raw materials necessary for the commercial production of our products from a variety of third-party suppliers. Such raw materials are generally available from multiple sources, are purchased worldwide and are normally available in quantities adequate to meet the needs of the Company&#8217;s business. 

We believe that our existing facilities, as supplemented by CMOs, are adequate for our current requirements and for our operations in the foreseeable future. 

Research and Development 

Most of our manufacturing facilities have chemists and technicians on staff involved in product development, quality assurance, quality control and providing technical services to customers. Research, development and technical service efforts are conducted by our veterinarians (DVMs) and nutritionists at various facilities. 

We operate Animal Health R&#38;D and product testing at our facilities in: Guarulhos, Brazil; Beit Shemesh, Israel; Neot Hovav (formerly Ramat Hovav), Israel; Quincy, Illinois; Corvallis, Oregon; State College, Pennsylvania; Manhattan, Kansas; St. Paul, Minnesota; Omaha, Nebraska; and Ma&#8217;ayan Tzvi, Israel. 

These facilities provide R&#38;D services relating to: fermentation development and micro-biological strain improvement; vaccine development; chemical synthesis and formulation development; nutritional specialty product development; and ethanol-related products. 

Our R&#38;D expenses were $11.0 million, $9.5 million and $8.2 million for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

Environmental, Health and Safety 

Our operations and properties are subject to Environmental Laws (as defined below) and regulations. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to attain and maintain compliance with Environmental Laws. While we believe that our operations are currently in material compliance with Environmental Laws, we have, from time to time, received notices of violation from governmental authorities, and have been involved in civil or criminal action for such violations, including for odor releases in Guarulhos, Brazil. Additionally, at various sites, our subsidiaries are engaged in continuing investigation, remediation and/or monitoring to address contamination associated with historical operations. We maintain accruals for costs and liabilities associated with Environmental Laws, which we currently believe are adequate. In many instances, it is difficult to predict the ultimate costs under Environmental Laws and the time period during which such costs are likely to be incurred. 

Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations. Violators of Environmental Laws may be subject to civil, criminal and administrative penalties, injunctions or both. Failure to comply with Environmental Laws may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of operations and/or permits, limitations on production, or increased operating costs. In addition, private plaintiffs may initiate lawsuits for personal injury, property damage, diminution in property value or other relief as a result of our operations. Environmental Laws, and the interpretation or enforcement thereof, are subject to change and may become more stringent in the future, potentially resulting in substantial future costs or capital or operating expenses. We devote considerable resources to complying with Environmental Laws and managing environmental liabilities. We have developed programs to identify requirements under and maintain compliance with Environmental Laws; however, we cannot predict with certainty the impact of increased and more stringent regulation on our operations, future capital expenditure requirements, or the cost of compliance. Based upon our experience to date, we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing Environmental Laws, and liabilities for known environmental claims pursuant to such Environmental Laws, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity. 

Environmental Health and Safety Regulations 

The following summarizes the principal Environmental Laws affecting our business. 

Waste Management. Our operations are subject to statutes and regulations addressing the contamination by, and management of, hazardous substances and solid and hazardous wastes. In the United States, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;), also known as the &#8220;Superfund&#8221; law, and comparable state laws, generally impose strict joint and several liability for costs of investigation and remediation and related liabilities, on defined classes of&#8201; &#8220;potentially responsible parties&#8221; (&#8220;PRPs&#8221;). PRPs can be required to bear all of such costs regardless of fault, the legality of the original disposal or ownership of the disposal site. We have been, and may become, subject to liability under CERCLA for cleanup costs or investigation or clean up obligations or related third-party claims in connection with releases of hazardous substances at or from our current or former sites or offsite waste disposal facilities used by us, including those caused by predecessors or relating to divested properties or operations. 

We must also comply with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;), and comparable state laws regulating the treatment, storage, disposal, remediation and transportation of solid and hazardous wastes. These laws impose management requirements on generators and transporters of such wastes and on the owners and operators of treatment, storage and disposal facilities. As current or historic recyclers of chemical waste, certain of our subsidiaries have been, and are likely to be, the focus of extensive compliance reviews by environmental regulatory authorities under 

RCRA. Our subsidiary Phibro-Tech currently has a RCRA operating permit for its Santa Fe Springs, California facility, for which a renewal application is under review. Phibro-Tech initially submitted an application for renewal of its permit for the Santa Fe Springs facility in 1996. The State of California is expected to issue a draft permit in 2016 for public review and comment. In addition, because we or our subsidiaries have closed several facilities that had been the subject of RCRA permits, we or our subsidiaries have been and will be required to investigate and remediate certain environmental contamination conditions at these shutdown plant sites within the requirements of RCRA corrective action programs. 

Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended. We must comply with regulations related to the discharge of pollutants to the waters of the United States without governmental authorization, including those pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. 

Chemical Product Registration Requirements. We must comply with regulations related to the testing, manufacturing, labeling, registration and safety analysis of our products in order to distribute many of our products, including, for example, in the United States, the federal Toxic Substances Control Act and Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, and in the European Union, the Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances (&#8220;REACH&#8221;). 

Air Emissions. Our operations are subject to the U.S. Clean Air Act (the &#8220;CAA&#8221;) and comparable U.S. state and foreign statutes and regulations, which regulate emissions of various air pollutants and contaminants. Certain of the CAA&#8217;s regulatory programs are the subject of ongoing review and/or are subject to ongoing litigation, such as the rules establishing new Maximum Achievable Control Technology for industrial boilers; significant expenditures may be required to meet current and emerging air quality standards. Regulatory agencies can also impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other air quality regulations. States may choose to set more stringent air emissions rules than those in the CAA. State, national and international authorities have also issued requirements focusing on greenhouse gas reductions. In the United States, the EPA has promulgated federal greenhouse gas regulations under the CAA affecting certain sources. In addition, a number of state, local and regional greenhouse gas initiatives are also being developed or are already in place. In Israel and Brazil, implementation of the Kyoto Protocol requirements regarding greenhouse gas emission reductions consists of energy efficiency regulations, carbon dioxide emissions allowances trading and renewable energy requirements. 

Capital Expenditures 

We have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Our capital expenditures relating to environmental, health and safety regulations were $3.0 million for fiscal year 2016. We estimate that our capital expenditures for compliance will be $3.5 million for both fiscal years 2017 and 2018; however, these estimates are subject to change given the uncertainty of future Environmental Laws and the interpretation and enforcement thereof, as further described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our environmental capital expenditure plans cover, among other things, the currently expected costs associated with known permit requirements relating to facility improvements. 

Contamination and Hazardous Substance Risks 

Investigation, Remediation and Monitoring Activities . Certain of PAHC&#8217;s subsidiaries that are currently or were historically engaged in recycling and other activities involving hazardous materials have been required to perform site investigations at their active, closed and former facilities and neighboring properties. Contamination of soil, groundwater and other environmental media has been identified or is suspected at several of these locations, including Santa Fe Springs, California; Powder Springs, Georgia; Union, Illinois; Sewaren, New Jersey; Sumter, South Carolina; and Joliet, Illinois, and regulatory authorities have required, and will continue to require, further investigation, corrective action and monitoring over future years. These subsidiaries also have been, and in the future may be, required to undertake additional capital improvements as part of these actions. In addition, RCRA and other applicable statutes and regulations require these subsidiaries to develop closure and post-closure plans for their facilities and in the event of a facility closure, obtain a permit that sets forth a closure plan for 

investigation, remediation and monitoring and requires post-closure monitoring and maintenance for up to 30 years. We believe we are in material compliance with these requirements and maintain adequate reserves to complete remediation and monitoring obligations at these locations. 

In connection with past acquisitions and divestitures, we have undertaken certain indemnification obligations that require us, or may in the future require us, to conduct or finance environmental cleanups at sites we no longer own or operate. Under the terms of the sale of the former facility in Joliet, Illinois, Phibro-Tech remains responsible for any required investigation and remediation of the site attributable to conditions at the site at the time of the February 2011 sale date, and we believe we have sufficient reserves to cover the cost of the remediation. 

PRP at Omega Chemical Superfund Site. The EPA is investigating and planning for the remediation of offsite contaminated groundwater that has migrated from the Omega Chemical Corporation Superfund Site (&#8220;Omega Chemical Site&#8221;), which is upgradient of Phibro-Tech&#8217;s Santa Fe Springs, California facility. The EPA has named Phibro-Tech and certain other subsidiaries of PAHC as PRPs due to groundwater contamination from Phibro-Tech&#8217;s Santa Fe Springs facility that has allegedly commingled with contaminated groundwater from the Omega Chemical Site. In September 2012, the EPA notified approximately 140 PRPs, including Phibro-Tech and the other subsidiaries, that they have been identified as potentially responsible for remedial action for the groundwater plume affected by the Omega Chemical Site and for EPA oversight and response costs. Phibro-Tech contends that groundwater contamination at its site is due to historical operations that pre-date Phibro-Tech and/or contaminated groundwater that has migrated from upgradient properties. In addition, a successor to a prior owner of the Phibro-Tech site has asserted that PAHC and Phibro-Tech are obligated to provide indemnification for its potential liability and defense costs relating to the groundwater plume affected by the Omega Chemical Site. Phibro-Tech has vigorously contested this position and has asserted that the successor to the prior owner is required to indemnify Phibro-Tech for its potential liability and defense costs. Furthermore, a nearby property owner has filed a complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California against many of the PRPs allegedly associated with the groundwater plume affected by the Omega Chemical Site (including Phibro-Tech) for alleged contamination of groundwater underneath its property, and a group of companies that sent chemicals to the Omega Chemical Site for processing and recycling has filed a complaint under CERCLA, RCRA and the common law public nuisance doctrine in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against many of the PRPs allegedly associated with the groundwater plume affected by the Omega Chemical Site (including Phibro-Tech) for contribution toward past and future costs associated with the investigation and remediation of the groundwater plume affected by the Omega Chemical Site. Due to the ongoing nature of the EPA&#8217;s investigation and Phibro-Tech&#8217;s dispute with the prior owner&#8217;s successor, at this time we cannot predict with any degree of certainty what, if any, liability Phibro-Tech or the other subsidiaries may ultimately have for investigation, remediation and the EPA oversight and response costs associated with the affected groundwater plume. 

Potential Claims. In addition to cleanup obligations, we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage, which liability may not be covered by insurance. 

Environmental Accruals and Financial Assurance. We have established environmental accruals to cover known remediation and monitoring costs at certain of our current and former facilities. Our accruals for environmental liabilities are recorded by calculating our best estimate of probable and reasonably estimable future costs using current information that is available at the time of the accrual. Our accruals for environmental liabilities totaled $7.0 million and $6.8 million as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

In certain instances, regulatory authorities have required us to provide financial assurance for estimated costs of remediation, corrective action, monitoring and closure and post-closure plans. Our subsidiaries have, in most instances, chosen to provide the required financial assurance by means of letters of credit issued pursuant to our revolving credit facility. As of June 30, 2016, the total outstanding balance of letters of credit providing such financial assurance was $9.9 million.
