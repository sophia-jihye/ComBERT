Overview 

We are a specialty pharmaceutical company developing and planning to commercialize next &#8209;generation abuse &#8209;deterrent products that incorporate our patented DETERx &#174; platform technology for the treatment of chronic pain and other diseases. Our lead product candidate, Xtampza &#160; ER&#8482; , or Xtampza , is an abuse &#8209;deterrent, extended &#8209;release, oral formulation of oxycodone, a widely prescribed opioid medication. On November 6, 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA , granted tentative approval to the new drug application, or NDA , for Xtampza for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around &#8209;the &#8209;clock, long &#8209;term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. The FDA granted tentative approval because Xtampza met the required quality, safety and efficacy standards for approval but was subject, at that time, to an automatic stay of up to 30 months as a result of patent litigation filed by Purdue Pharma, L.P., or Purdue, in March 2015. The FDA may grant final regulatory approval upon the earliest to occur of expiration of the automatic stay, the court invalidating Purdue&#8217;s patents or issuing an opinion of non &#8209;infringement, or expiration of Purdue&#8217;s listed patents. In February 2016, the District Court of Massachusetts entered a judgment in our favor related to Purdue&#8217;s three Orange Book-listed patents that were the cause of the 30 month stay. We submitted our Request for Final Approval of the Xtampza NDA to the FDA on February 26, 2016. The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, goal date of April 26, 2016. 

In connection with the FDA&#8217;s tentative approval of our NDA for Xtampza, the FDA tentatively approved a product label, product packaging, post &#8209;marketing commitments and a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, program, subject to change should new information become available prior to the time that the FDA considers the Xtampza NDA for final regulatory approval. The tentatively approved Xtampza label, in contrast to the product labels for all currently approved extended &#8209;release opioids, does not include a black box warning and related precautions stating that crushing, chewing or dissolving can cause rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of the active ingredient. The absence of these warnings is supported by data that is described in the tentatively approved product label to support the claim that when Xtampza is crushed or chewed, the drug release profile is bioequivalent to taking Xtampza intact, as directed. Furthermore, the tentatively approved product label contains differentiated abuse &#8209;deterrent claims for Xtampza and also states that Xtampza can be taken by sprinkling the capsule contents on soft foods or into a cup, and then directly into the mouth, or through a gastrostomy or nasogastric feeding tube. 

Xtampza has the same active ingredient as OxyContin &#174; OP, which is the largest selling abuse &#8209;deterrent, extended &#8209;release opioid in the United States by dollars, with $2.5 billion in U.S. sales in 2014. We conducted a comprehensive preclinical and clinical program for Xtampza consistent with FDA guidance on abuse &#8209;deterrence. These studies and clinical trials demonstrated that chewing, crushing and/or dissolving Xtampza, and then taking it orally or smoking, snorting or injecting it did not meaningfully change its drug release profile or safety characteristics. By contrast, clinical trials performed by us and others &#8212; including a head &#8209;to &#8209;head clinical trial comparing Xtampza with OxyContin OP &#8212; have shown that drug abusers can achieve rapid release and absorption of the active ingredient by manipulating OxyContin OP using common household tools and methods commonly available on the Internet. 

In addition, our preclinical studies and clinical trials have shown that the contents of the Xtampza capsule can be removed from the capsule and sprinkled on food or into a cup and then directly into the mouth or administered through feeding tubes, without compromising their drug release profile, safety or abuse &#8209;deterrent characteristics. By contrast, OxyContin OP, which is formulated in hard tablets, has a black box warning product label stating that crushing, 

&#160;

dissolving, or chewing can cause rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of the active ingredient. We believe that Xtampza, if it ultimately receives final regulatory approval, can address the pain management needs of the approximately 11 million patients in the United States who suffer from chronic pain with difficulty swallowing. 

Background on Chronic Pain and Opioid Abuse 

Patients Suffering from Chronic Pain 

Chronic pain, typically defined as pain that lasts beyond the healing of an injury or that persists longer than three months, is a worldwide problem with serious health and economic consequences. According to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, chronic pain represents a public health crisis of epidemic proportions affecting approximately 100 million people in the United States and 20 &#8209;30% of the population worldwide &#8212; more than heart disease, cancer and diabetes combined. Common types of chronic pain include lower back pain, arthritis, headache, and face and jaw pain. The prevalence of chronic pain is expected to rise in the future, as the incidence of associated illnesses such as diabetes, arthritis and cancer increases in the aging population. 

Chronic pain leads to over $560 billion in healthcare and productivity costs each year according to the Institute of Medicine. Prescription opioids remain the primary treatment for chronic pain. Chronic pain patients often start treatment with immediate release opioids, but change to extended &#8209;release opioids to achieve more convenient dosing with more consistent blood levels of the active drug. Extended &#8209;release opioids incorporate a large amount of opioid with a time &#8209;release mechanism designed to deliver steady amounts of opioid, typically over 12 to 24 hours. 

Annual sales from extended &#8209;release and long &#8209;acting opioids represent approximately $6.0 billion (29 million prescriptions) of the approximately $14 billion U.S. opioid market in 2014. OxyContin OP generated U.S. sales of $2.5 billion in 2014, which represents approximately a 20% U.S. market share of all extended &#8209;release and long &#8209;acting opioid prescriptions. 

Prescription Opioid Abuse is an Epidemic in the United States 

Abusers tamper with extended &#8209;release opioid drugs to achieve the euphoria that results from rapid increases in the blood concentration of the active ingredient, a potentially fatal activity known as dose dumping. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, described abuse of prescription drugs in the United States as a growing and deadly epidemic. Deaths in the United States from prescription opioid overdose have grown from approximately 4,000 in 1999 to approximately 16,000 in 2013. 

According to a 2012 study conducted by the CDC, annually there are 144,000 treatment admissions for abuse or misuse of opioids, 560,000 emergency room visits for misuse or abuse of opioids, over 2.5 million individuals who abuse or are dependent on opioids and over 7.3 million non &#8209;medical users who use opioids without prescriptions or for non &#8209;therapeutic effects. The American Journal of Managed Care estimated in a 2013 report that opioid abuse costs public and private healthcare payors over $72 billion annually in direct healthcare costs, including costs of emergency room visits, rehabilitation and associated health problems. 

The FDA has estimated that nearly 35 million Americans have used prescription pain relievers, including opioid &#8209;containing drugs, for non &#8209;prescription purposes at least once in their lifetime. A 2011 research report from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration estimated that between 1999 and 2009 there was a 430% increase in substance &#8209;abuse treatment facility admissions resulting from the use of prescription pain relievers. According to a 2011 study by the University of Michigan, one in 12 high school seniors reported non &#8209;medical use of Vicodin, a combination of acetaminophen and hydrocodone, and one in 20 high school seniors reported non &#8209;medical use of OxyContin. 

Drug abusers find currently approved extended &#8209;release opioids desirable because of the large amount of drug payload, which they attempt to release quickly into the bloodstream to create euphoria. It is difficult for drug abusers to achieve this rapid release and absorption into the bloodstream by taking multiple intact extended &#8209;release opioid tablets or capsules because doing so often causes sleepiness and/or respiratory distress before euphoria is achieved. Instead, abusers attempt to defeat the extended &#8209;release properties in order to achieve rapid release of the active ingredient. 

&#160;

Despite the introduction of OxyContin OP in 2010 as the first FDA &#8209;approved, abuse &#8209;deterrent extended &#8209;release opioid formulation, abuse of extended &#8209;release opioids, including OxyContin OP, continues to be a major public health issue. OxyContin OP, even with its abuse &#8209;deterrent formulation, remains vulnerable to abuse using common household objects, like pill crushers. Third party studies found that abusers of OxyContin OP use various routes of abuse &#8212; including snorting, injection and oral abuse &#8212; despite its abuse &#8209;deterrent features. In a third party study of OxyContin abusers both before and after OxyContin OP was introduced, researchers found that while the non &#8209;oral route of administration of abuse of OxyContin OP (i.e., injection, snorting and smoking) decreased after its introduction, oral abuse of OxyContin OP increased from approximately 52% to 75% of OxyContin abusers.

&#160; 

Legislative and Regulatory Actions 

In response to widespread prescription opioid abuse, the U.S. government and a number of state legislatures have introduced, and in some cases have enacted, legislation and regulations intended to encourage the development of abuse &#8209;deterrent forms of pain medications. The FDA has stated that addressing prescription drug abuse is a priority, and the development of abuse &#8209;deterrent opioids is a key part of that strategy. 

In 2010, Purdue received approval for a new formulation of OxyContin, named OxyContin OP, designed to make it more difficult to abuse. In April 2013, the FDA approved new product labeling for OxyContin OP, which, for the first time included abuse &#8209;deterrent product label claims consistent with the FDA&#8217;s January 2013 draft abuse &#8209;deterrent product label guidance. At the same time, the FDA withdrew the approval of the original, non &#8209;abuse &#8209;deterrent OxyContin formulation, thus preventing the commercialization of generic versions of the original OxyContin that did not have abuse &#8209;deterrent properties. This decision by the FDA is consistent with its public statement that the development of abuse &#8209;deterrent opioid analgesics is a public health priority. 

Recent actions to address the opioid abuse epidemic include: 

&#183; 

STOPP Act: In July 2012, a bipartisan group of Congressional leaders introduced the STOPP (Stop the Tampering of Prescription Pills) Act. Reintroduced in February 2013, this bill, if approved, would require that non &#8209;abuse &#8209;deterrent opioids be removed from the market if an abuse &#8209;deterrent formulation of that opioid has already been approved for marketing by the FDA. Since being reintroduced in 2013, this bill was referred to the U.S. House of Representatives&#8217; Subcommittee on Health and there has been no further action taken. This bill has since been reintroduced in the U.S. House of Representatives and was referred to the Subcommittee on Health in May 2015, with no further action taken since. 

&#183; 

FDA guidance: In January 2013, the FDA introduced draft guidance regarding studies and clinical trials that should be conducted to demonstrate that a given formulation has abuse &#8209;deterrent properties, how those studies and clinical trials will be evaluated, and what product labeling claims may be approved based on the results of those studies and clinical trials. The draft guidance described four categories of abuse &#8209;deterrence studies and clinical trials: Categories 1, 2 and 3 consist of pre &#8209;marketing studies and clinical trials designed to evaluate a product candidate&#8217;s potentially abuse &#8209;deterrent properties under controlled conditions, while Category 4 post &#8209;marketing clinical trials and studies assess the real &#8209;world impact of a potentially abuse &#8209;deterrent formulation. These requirements were largely adopted in the April 

&#160;

2015 final FDA guidance, which also provides examples of product label claims that may be merited based on the results of the corresponding studies and clinical trials. 

&#183; 

48 state and territorial attorneys general support development of abuse &#8209;deterrent opioids: In March 2013, the National Association of Attorneys General urged the FDA to adopt standards requiring manufacturers and marketers of prescription opioids to develop abuse &#8209;deterrent versions of those products. Their letter, signed by 48 state and territorial attorneys general, commended the FDA for expeditiously proposing guidance that establishes clear standards for manufacturers who develop and market abuse &#8209;resistant opioid products, while considering incentives for undertaking the research and development necessary to bring such products to market. It also encouraged the FDA to ensure that generic versions of such products are designed with similar abuse &#8209;resistant features. 

&#183; 

FDA mandated product label changes: On September 10, 2013, the FDA announced its intention to require product label changes to all approved extended &#8209;release and long &#8209;acting opioids. In particular, the FDA announced its intention to update the indications for these opioids so that they will be indicated only for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around &#8209;the &#8209;clock, long &#8209;term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. On April 16, 2014, the FDA updated these indications. The FDA also requires post &#8209;marketing studies and clinical trials for any such opioids. 

&#183; 

29 state and territorial attorneys general speak out against the approval of non &#8209;abuse &#8209;deterrent narcotics: In December 2013, the attorneys general of 29 states and territories urged the FDA to reconsider its approval of Zohydro&#8482; ER, an extended &#8209;release hydrocodone formulation with no abuse &#8209;deterrent properties, or alternatively to set a rigorous timeline for reformulation of Zohydro ER in an abuse &#8209;deterrent form, with significant limitations on prescriptions of Zohydro ER in the interim. In early 2014, members of Congress from three states introduced a bill to revoke FDA approval of Zohydro ER and prevent the FDA from approving any new opioids that do not have abuse &#8209;deterrent features and the governor of Massachusetts signed an executive order (since overturned by a court) that attempted to ban the dispensing of Zohydro ER in Massachusetts. 

&#183; 

Massachusetts and Maine approved laws to mandate that insurers cover abuse &#8209;deterrent opioids: In August 2014 and June 2015, the governors of Massachusetts and Maine, respectively, signed laws establishing a drug formulary commission charged with identifying drugs with a heightened public health risk due to their potential for abuse and formulations of abuse &#8209;deterrent drugs that may be substituted for these drugs that have a heightened public health risk. When a prescriber writes a prescription for an opioid identified as having a heightened public health risk, the pharmacist must dispense an interchangeable abuse &#8209;deterrent product from the formulary, if one exists, except when the prescriber indicates &#8220;no substitution.&#8221; The Massachusetts and Maine laws also require insurers to cover abuse &#8209;deterrent opioid drugs on a basis not less favorable than corresponding non &#8209;abuse &#8209;deterrent drugs. Several other states have enacted or are in the process of introducing similar legislation. 

&#183; 

FDA held public meeting to discuss abuse &#8209; deterrent opioid formulations: In September 2014, the FDA announced a public meeting to discuss the development, assessment and regulation of opioid medications. In its public notice, the FDA stated that it &#8220;looks forward to a future in which all or substantially all opioid medications are less susceptible to abuse than the conventional formulations that dominate the market today.&#8221; In October 2014, the FDA held the public meeting with key stakeholders to solicit input regarding three primary topics: how to make abuse &#8209;deterrent opioid formulations the standard of care, how to best incentivize the pharmaceutical industry to develop next &#8209;generation opioid products, and how to ensure that patients have access to affordable abuse &#8209;deterrent opioids by implementing guidance for the release of generic abuse &#8209;deterrent opioids. 

&#183; 

Industry group letter to the FDA: In January 2015, two major trade associations of the drug industry, Biotechnology Industry Organization, or BIO, and Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, sent a letter to the FDA urging the agency to take two actions: decline to approve generic formulations of opioid medications that lack abuse &#8209;deterrent properties comparable to those of already &#8209;approved branded formulations, and remove from the market any generic, non &#8209;abuse &#8209;deterrent formulations of opioid medications with abuse &#8209;deterrent formulations. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Health Canada Proposed Legislation Requiring Opioids to be Tamper Resistant Before Sale : In June 201 5 , Health Canada issued a Notice of Intent for Interested Parties on Tamper Resistance under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. If approved, the proposed legislation would require that drugs at high risk for abuse, including extended &#8209;release oxycodone, have tamper &#8209;resistant properties before they can be sold in Canada. 

&#183; 

FDA Opioids Action Plan: In February 2016, the FDA released an action plan to address the opioid abuse epidemic and reassess the FDA&#8217;s approach to opioid medications. &#160; The plan identifies FDA&#8217;s focus on implementing policies to reverse the opioid abuse epidemic, while maintaining access to effective treatments. The actions set forth in the FDA&#8217;s plan include strengthening postmarketing study requirements to evaluate the benefit of long-term opioid use, changing the REMS requirements to provide additional funding for physician education courses, releasing a draft guidance setting forth approval standards for generic abuse-deterrent opioid formulations, and seeking input from the FDA&#8217;s Scientific Board to broaden the understanding of the public risks of opioid abuse. The FDA&#8217;s Scientific Advisory Board met to address these issues on March 1, 2016. The FDA&#8217;s plan is part of a broader initiative led by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, to address opioid-related overdose, death and dependence. The HHS initiative&#8217;s focus is on improving physician&#8217;s use of opioids through education and resources to address opioid over-prescribing, increasing use and development of improved delivery systems for naloxone, which can reverse overdose from both prescription opioids and heroin, to reduce overdose-related deaths, and expanding the use of Medication-Assisted Treatment, which couples counseling and behavioral therapies with medication to address substance abuse. In March 2016, as part of the HHS initiative, the CDC released a new Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. The guideline is intended to assist primary care providers treating adults for chronic pain in outpatient settings. The guideline provides recommendations to improve communications between doctors and patients about the risks and benefits of opioid therapy for chronic pain, improve the safety and effectiveness of pain treatment, and reduce the risks associated with long-term opioid therapy. The guideline states that no treatment recommendations about the use of abuse-deterrent opioids can be made at this time. 

&#183; 

U.S. Senate Passed Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act : &#160; In March 2016, the U.S. Senate passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act to address the national epidemics of prescription opioid abuse and heroin use. Consistent with the initiatives of HHS, this legislation would expand the availability of naloxone, which can counter the effects of opioid overdose, for law enforcement and other first responders. The legislation also calls for HHS to convene an interagency task force to develop best practices for pain management with opioid medications. &#160; The legislation would also provide resources to improve state monitoring of controlled substances, including opioids. Other initiatives include resources for treating opioid addiction in incarcerated persons and expanding opioid abuse prevention education and treatment efforts. &#160; 

Types of Abuse &#8209;Deterrent Technologies 

In response to the opioid abuse epidemic, the pharmaceutical industry has created a number of abuse &#8209;deterrent products and product candidates, using a variety of technologies. These strategies generally fall under the following categories: 

&#183; 

Physical/Chemical Barriers: Physical barriers are formulations designed to prevent chewing, crushing, cutting, grating or grinding for oral or nasal abuse. Physical and chemical barriers can make it difficult to extract the opioid from the formulation for IV abuse using common solvents such as water. For example, OxyContin OP uses a cured, thermoformed polymer to make the tablets harder to crush for oral or nasal abuse. When crushed, the product gels in the presence of small injectable volumes of liquid, making it more difficult to draw into a syringe. 

&#183; 

Agonist/Antagonist Combinations: An opioid antagonist can be co &#8209;formulated with an active opioid ingredient, or agonist, to interfere with or reduce the euphoria associated with abuse. 

&#183; 

The antagonist can be physically sequestered in the tablet (e.g., Pfizer&#8217;s Embeda &#174; ). When taken orally as directed, the majority of the encapsulated antagonist is eliminated in the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract and not absorbed into the bloodstream, allowing the active ingredient to work. However, when crushed or dissolved by an abuser or patient, the antagonist is released with the active ingredient and both are 

&#160;

absorbed into the bloodstream, with the intent of blunting the euphoric effects of the active ingredient. A problem with this approach is that if the tablet is crushed or dissolved, the antagonist can cause the patient or abuser to experience opioid withdrawal, with potentially serious consequences. 

&#183; 

Alternatively, the antagonist can be co &#8209;formulated in a fixed ratio with the active ingredient (e.g., Purdue&#8217;s Targiniq&#8482;). When taken orally as directed, most of the antagonist is circulated directly to the liver and rendered ineffective, allowing the active ingredient to work. However, when snorted or injected, the antagonist is distributed in the bloodstream before it gets to the liver, with the intent of preventing euphoria. A disadvantage with this approach is that it limits the amount of active ingredient a patient can take, which may make it inadequate to control chronic pain. Further, the presence of the antagonist in the co &#8209;formulated drug may precipitate withdrawal, with potentially serious consequences. 

Market research studies performed for us have shown that some physicians prefer not to use an abuse &#8209;deterrent formulation with an opioid antagonist because such formulations may be less useful in addressing chronic pain and because their antagonist components may precipitate withdrawal. 

&#183; 

Prodrug approaches: A prodrug is a drug administered in an inactive, or less active, form designed to enable more effective delivery. The prodrug is then converted by the body into the active ingredient through a normal, metabolic process. In a prodrug opioid, the active ingredient is designed to be released if the drug is taken orally, but if an abuser or patient takes a large amount of the drug, the prodrug is not broken down or absorbed rapidly enough to create euphoria. If injected or snorted, the prodrug is not broken down and the active ingredient is not released. To date, the only extended &#8209;release product candidate using the prodrug approach in late &#8209;stage clinical development did not achieve its primary endpoint of demonstrating adequate pain relief compared to a placebo, in a Phase 2 clinical trial. No opioids using a prodrug approach are currently marketed. 

We believe Xtampza represents the best &#8209;in &#8209;class approach to creating an abuse &#8209;deterrent extended &#8209;release opioid formulation. Xtampza does not incorporate an opioid antagonist, is not a prodrug, and, based on the studies and clinical trials we conducted, is resistant to abuse through physical or chemical manipulation. 

Chronic Pain with Dysphagia 

It is estimated that more than 10% of patients with chronic pain, or approximately 11 million patients, have dysphagia, or difficulty in swallowing, because they have cancer, are elderly, have other medical problems or have difficulty swallowing without a known medical cause. The FDA recognized the unmet medical needs of this growing population in issuing draft guidance in December 2013, in which the FDA cited survey data that suggest that as many as 40% of Americans may have difficulties swallowing tablets and capsules and noted that these difficulties can precipitate a number of adverse events and noncompliance with treatment regimens. 

Currently, all FDA &#8209;approved, orally administered extended &#8209;release opioids have a black box warning product label stating that &#8220;crushing, dissolving or chewing can cause rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of the active drug,&#8221; making them unsuitable or unattractive for patients who suffer from chronic pain with dysphagia, or CPD. OxyContin OP&#8217;s product label states that &#8220;there have been post &#8209;marketing reports of difficulty in swallowing OxyContin tablets. These reports included choking, gagging, regurgitation and tablets stuck in the throat&#8230; Consider use of an alternative analgesic in patients who have difficulty swallowing.&#8221; An external marketing study performed for us in 2013 estimated that Xtampza, if finally approved, has a peak revenue potential for U.S. patients with CPD in excess of $700 million annually. 

Our Solution: The DETERx Platform Technology 

Overview 

DETERx is a novel, proprietary, patented platform technology that is designed to maintain the extended &#8209;release and safety profiles of highly abused drugs in the face of various methods of abuse and tampering, including chewing, crushing and/or dissolving, and then taking them orally or snorting or injecting them. The DETERx formulation consists of wax &#8209;based microspheres that are filled into a capsule. The microspheres are spherical micron &#8209;sized beads that are prepared by combining the active ingredient (oxycodone, in the case of our lead product candidate, Xtampza) with 

&#160;

inactive ingredients. Each microsphere, whether inside or outside the capsule, is designed to be abuse &#8209;deterrent and extended &#8209;release. The active ingredient is solubilized and homogenously dispersed in each microsphere. 

Xtampza microspheres have a median particle size of approximately 300 microns and are comprised of the active ingredient (oxycodone), a fatty acid, and wax and surfactant excipients which are all generally recognized as safe, or GRAS, by the FDA. The microspheres are formulated through a proprietary melt process in which the active ingredient, as a free base, is combined with fatty acid and wax and surfactant excipients to form a molten solution in which the base is solubilized via an ionic interaction with the fatty acid. The resulting homogenous liquid is spray congealed into small droplets using a proprietary spinning disk manufacturing process. The droplets rapidly congeal into solid wax &#8209;based microspheres, which are then filled into capsules. Differing product strengths are achieved by varying the weight of the microspheres loaded into a capsule. When administered orally as directed, the Xtampza formulation is designed to be administered every 12 hours and releases oxycodone over an extended period of time in the GI tract by diffusion from the microspheres into gastrointestinal fluids. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Because of our proprietary technology, each individual microsphere has extended &#8209;release and abuse &#8209;deterrent properties. The microspheres are designed to be administered in capsule form, sprinkled on food or into a cup then directly in the mouth, or administered into the stomach via a gastric or nasogastric tube without compromising their abuse &#8209;deterrent, extended &#8209;release profile. These features may make Xtampza uniquely suited to address the needs of patients suffering from CPD. 

Abuse &#8209;Deterrent Features 

Abusers often seek to accelerate the absorption of opioids into the bloodstream by crushing them in order to swallow, snort or smoke the drug, or dissolving them in order to inject the drug. The wax &#8209;based microspheres produced using the DETERx platform technology have physical and chemical barriers that are intended to reduce the potential for these forms of abuse. We believe that microspheres made using our proprietary technology deter the most common methods of manipulating opioids for abuse because of their features described in the table below.

&#160; 

Advantages 

Oral 

Particle Size, Matrix Composition and Fusing Effect 

The microspheres are small and soft, so chewing or crushing them to further reduce the particle size does not meaningfully reduce the particle size or increase the surface area. The hydrophobic excipient matrix of each microsphere is composed of soft, fatty, and wax &#8209;based inactive ingredients that tend to agglomerate and fuse when crushed. 

&#160; 

Injection 

Less Soluble Salt Form 

We created a novel salt form of the active ingredient, which is less soluble in aqueous solutions (such as water) but readily dissolved in fatty excipients, such as those used in our DETERx formulation. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Matrix Composition 

The hydrophobic excipient matrix is designed to trap the active ingredient, making it difficult for abusers to extract the opioid. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

High Melting Point 

Melting the waxy composition of the microspheres results in quick solidification when heat is removed, clogging a syringe. 

&#160; 

Snorting 

Matrix Composition 

The hydrophobic excipient matrix is designed to trap the active ingredient, preventing the release of the opioid in the nose and causing temporary nasal side effects that make Xtampza undesirable for nasal abuse. 

DETERx Pipeline 

We have applied our DETERx platform technology to Xtampza as well as other product candidates in our pipeline. We recently completed formulation development work for our extended &#8209;release, abuse &#8209;deterrent hydrocodone program. Based upon an assessment of the market opportunity and the potential to differentiate from currently marketed hydrocodone products as well as programs in development, we are prioritizing our abuse deterrent hydrocodone program as our second product in development. We filed an IND with the FDA in December 2015 and initia ted a clinical trial in the first quarter of 2016. We also have an extended &#8209;release, abuse &#8209;deterrent oxymorphone program for the treatment of chronic pain for which we have filed an investigational new drug application, or IND. This program has been granted Fast Track status by the FDA. In addition, we have other extended &#8209;release, abuse &#8209;deterrent product candidates that have completed preliminary preclinical studies, including morphine for pain and methylphenidate for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. All of these product candidates share similar abuse &#8209;deterrent qualities as Xtampza and are designed to be suitable for patients with difficulty swallowing. We own all of the rights to our product candidates. 

&#160;

Each of our product candidates is being developed to seek FDA approval in accordance with Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&#38;C Act. Section 505(b)(2) permits an applicant to file an NDA that relies, in part, on data not developed by or for the applicant and to which the applicant has not received a right of reference, such as the FDA&#8217;s findings of safety and efficacy in the approval of a similar drug, or listed drug, or published literature in support of its application. 

Xtampza 

Overview 

Our lead product candidate, Xtampza, is an abuse &#8209;deterrent, extended &#8209;release, oral formulation of oxycodone tentatively approved by the FDA for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around &#8209;the &#8209;clock, long &#8209;term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. The active ingredient in Xtampza is oxycodone, which is approved by the FDA and other regulators around the world in a number of both immediate &#8209;release and extended &#8209;release drug products. We developed Xtampza using our proprietary, DETERx abuse &#8209;deterrent technology to address common methods of abuse, including chewing, crushing and/or dissolving, and then taking it orally or snorting or injecting Xtampza. On November 6, 2015, the FDA granted tentative approval to the NDA for Xtampza for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around &#8209;the &#8209;clock, long &#8209;term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. The FDA granted tentative approval because Xtampza met the required quality, safety and efficacy standards for approval but was subject , at that time, to an automatic stay of up to 30 months as a result of patent litigation filed by Purdue in March 2015. The FDA may grant final regulatory approval upon the earliest to occur of expiration of the automatic stay, the court invalidating Purdue&#8217;s patents or issuing an opinion of non &#8209;infringement, or expiration of Purdue&#8217;s listed patents. In February 2016, the District Court of Massachusetts entered a judgment in our favor related to Purdue&#8217;s three Orange Book-listed patents that were the cause of the 30 month stay. We submitted our request for final approval of the Xtampza NDA on February 26, 2016. The FDA has set a PDUFA goal date of April 26, 2016. 

We sought approval of Xtampza through the FDA&#8217;s Section 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway using OxyContin OP as our listed drug, with the goal of obtaining abuse &#8209;deterrent claims in our product label based on three categories of our completed abuse &#8209;deterrence studies. In July 2014, we completed our pivotal Phase 3 efficacy and safety clinical trial for Xtampza in patients with moderate &#8209;to &#8209;severe chronic low back pain, which met efficacy and safety endpoints. We also completed Category 1, Category 2 and Category 3 abuse &#8209;deterrent studies and clinical trials designed to follow the January 2013 FDA draft guidance on abuse &#8209;deterrent opioids, and which we believe to be consistent with the April 2015 final FDA guidance, as well as direct guidance received from the FDA in numerous meetings and written communications, including a pre &#8209;NDA meeting in April 2014. 

We also conducted an alternative dosing clinical trial to assess the feasibility of administering Xtampza by sprinkling the microspheres onto applesauce. This clinical trial demonstrated that Xtampza microspheres retain their abuse &#8209;deterrent and extended &#8209;release properties even after being removed from the capsule and mixed with soft food. If Xtampza ultimately receives final regulatory approval, Xtampza could be the only abuse &#8209;deterrent extended &#8209;release oxycodone 

&#160;

product with product labeling features targeting patients with CPD. As part of the FDA&#8217;s tentative approval of our NDA for Xtampza, we have a tentatively approved product label. The key product label characteristics are summarized below:

Market Opportunity 

We believe that Xtampza, if it ultimately receives final regulatory approval, can capture a significant share of the $6 billion U.S. extended &#8209;release opioid market, including a portion of the existing $2.5 billion OxyContin OP market. In addition, we believe that Xtampza can become a market leader for treating patients with chronic pain who have difficulty swallowing. 

OxyContin OP Extended &#8209;Release Market 

Until recently, no product that uses oxycodone as its active ingredient had been approved with product label claims describing the abuse &#8209;deterrent characteristics of its product. Purdue launched OxyContin OP in 2010. In April 2013, the FDA determined that Purdue had been successful in demonstrating OxyContin OP&#8217;s abuse &#8209;deterrent characteristics and permitted Purdue to amend its product label to include certain abuse &#8209;deterrent claims. Since the launch of OxyContin OP, there has been a reduction in the overall abuse of OxyContin, primarily in the snorted and injected routes of administration. 

The FDA also concluded that the benefits of the previously &#8209;approved non &#8209;abuse &#8209;deterrent OxyContin no longer outweighed its risks and removed it from the list of drugs eligible to serve as a reference product for future generic or Section 505(b)(2) approvals. As a result, we expect that all extended &#8209;release oxycodone products, including generic products, will now be required to have abuse &#8209;deterrent claims as part of the FDA approval process. We believe this change in FDA policy creates a significant opportunity for Xtampza, if ultimately approved, to capture a portion of the extended &#8209;release oxycodone market. 

Despite OxyContin OP&#8217;s commercial success, it carries with it a well &#8209;documented abuse stigma both for physicians who prescribe it and for patients who use it to treat chronic pain. In a market research study conducted for us in 2013, 35% of patients surveyed who were taking OxyContin OP indicated concern that their friends or family have a negative perception of OxyContin OP. Of the 1,021 patients surveyed in the study, 11% of chronic pain patients responded that they have had their opioid medication stolen, most often from their home, and 76% indicated an interest in switching to a pain medication similar to OxyContin OP but that was more abuse &#8209;deterrent. A market research study of 30 physicians conducted for us in 2015 concluded that while physicians view OxyContin OP as an effective and valuable option, one third reported prescribing it less often than they would like because of patients&#8217; reticence to use OxyContin OP because of its reputation for addiction and abuse. 

&#160;

Further, in a third party study of post &#8209;marketing data on misuse and diversion of prescription opioid analgesics, the initial decline in abuse of OxyContin OP by patients who reported abusing the non &#8209;abuse &#8209;deterrent OxyContin 30 days prior to entering treatment for opioid abuse disorder, plateaued at 25% to 30%, with no further decreases from 2012 to study conclusion in 2014. A sub &#8209;population of participants was surveyed to investigate their continued abuse of OxyContin. Among the 88 participants who abused both non &#8209;abuse &#8209;deterrent OxyContin and OxyContin OP, their continued abuse of OxyContin OP was explained by: (i) a transition from non &#8209;oral routes of administration to oral use (approximately 43%); (ii) successful efforts to defeat the abuse &#8209;deterrent formulation mechanism leading to a continuation of inhaled or injected use (approximately 34%); and (iii) exclusive use of the oral route independent of formulation type (approximately 23%). Representative comments of participants who continued to abuse OxyContin OP demonstrated that participants were able to identify methods of circumventing the abuse deterrent properties using the internet. 

Other Extended &#8209;Release Opioids 

While OxyContin OP is the largest selling extended &#8209;release opioid in the United States by dollars in 2014, there are approximately 23 million additional prescriptions for non &#8209;abuse &#8209;deterrent extended &#8209;release opioids annually in the United States. Many of these opioids include active ingredients, such as morphine, that are commonly perceived as having greater adverse side effects than oxycodone &#8209;based formulations. Because of the abuse stigma associated with OxyContin OP and non &#8209;abuse &#8209;deterrent opioid formulations, we believe that Xtampza may offer physicians treating chronic pain an attractive alternative to the existing options. Our market research also demonstrates that payors recognize the prevalence of opioid abuse and its corresponding economic burden. This research indicates that &#8220;brand&#8221; prices would be acceptable for products that are differentiated. As such, we aim to achieve broad Tier 3 payor coverage on commercial plans and contract with Medicare and Medicaid. In a market research study conducted for us, 83% of disease specialists (such as oncologists and neurologists) and 67% of pain specialists surveyed indicated that, if approved, they would prescribe Xtampza for patients without dysphagia. 

Chronic Pain with Dysphagia 

In a market research survey conducted for us, of 1,021 patients with chronic pain, 30% of the patients reported that they have trouble swallowing or do not like to swallow pills, and 65% of the patients did not realize that cutting, crushing or grinding extended &#8209;release opioids can change the drug release profile. None of the currently approved abuse &#8209;deterrent opioid drugs has an FDA product label that permits the sprinkling of the product on food or &#160; into a cup, and then directly in the mouth and administration through feeding tubes for use by patients with CPD, creating an unmet medical need due to the lack of adequate treatment options. Further, in an effort to make them easier to swallow, some patients with CPD &#8212; and 47 of the 1,021 patients participating in the survey conducted for us &#8212; crush their prescribed extended &#8209;release opioids and can inadvertently harm themselves because of the rapid immediate &#8209;release of the active ingredient. Because our Xtampza microspheres are designed to be able to be removed from the capsule and still retain their abuse &#8209;deterrent and extended &#8209;release properties, we believe that Xtampza may be an effective pain &#8209;management solution for patients with CPD. An external marketing study performed for us in 2013 estimated that Xtampza, if it ultimately receives final regulatory approval, has a peak revenue potential for U.S. patients with CPD in excess of $700 million annually. 

Clinical Development 

We have completed numerous studies and clinical trials on Xtampza. We submitted an NDA for Xtampza to the FDA on December 12, 2014. On September 11, 2015, the Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee and Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee of the FDA , or the FDA Joint Advisory Committee, voted unanimously (23 &#8209;0) to support the regulatory approval of Xtampza. Xtampza received tentative FDA approval on November 6, 2015. We submitted our request for final approval of the Xtampza NDA on February 26, 2016. The FDA has set a PDUFA goal date of April 26, 2016. We sought approval of Xtampza through the FDA&#8217;s Section 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway using OxyContin OP as our listed drug with the goal of obtaining abuse &#8209;deterrent claims in our product label based on all three categories of our completed abuse &#8209;deterrence studies. To date, we have completed bioequivalence and bioavailability studies, a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of Xtampza in patients with moderate &#8209;to &#8209;severe chronic low back pain, which met safety and efficacy endpoints, as well as Category 1, Category 2 and Category 3 abuse deterrence studies and clinical trials based on the January 2013 FDA draft guidance regarding abuse &#8209;deterrent opioids. 

&#160;

Evaluation of Safety and Efficacy 

Phase 3 Clinical Trial 

After discussions with the FDA, we conducted a single pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial designed to show safety and efficacy of Xtampza in a chronic pain population. The Phase 3 clinical trial was a multi &#8209;center, prospective, double &#8209;blind, enriched enrollment, randomized withdrawal, placebo &#8209;controlled clinical trial that examined the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Xtampza versus placebo in opioid &#8209;experienced and opioid &#8209;na&#239;ve patients with moderate &#8209;to &#8209;severe chronic low back pain. This study was designed with acetaminophen as the rescue medication in order to avoid the potential issue of immediate &#8209;release opioid rescue medication use confounding the effect of the study drug. The trial design is depicted in the figure below. 

&#160; 

Of the 740 patients enrolled in the initial open &#8209;label titration portion of the clinical trial, 389 patients met the criteria for randomization, which included stable and effective pain scores, ability to tolerate the drug at the dose at which effective pain relief was achieved and compliance with all other aspects of the clinical trial protocol. These 389 patients were randomized into a 12 &#8209;week, double &#8209;blind maintenance phase in which they were either maintained on their current dose regimen of Xtampza or were tapered to a placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint of the clinical trial was the change in average pain intensity from baseline to week 12; pain was measured using an 11 &#8209;point pain intensity numerical rating scale. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints in the clinical trial included evaluation of safety and tolerability, quality of life, physical disability, and global impression of change. The graph below shows the daily average pain score in the randomized, intent to treat, or ITT, population. 

&#160; 

&#160;

The clinical trial demonstrated that the estimated marginal mean change in average pain score from Randomization Baseline to Week 12 was greater for the placebo treatment group (1.85) than for the Xtampza treatment group (0.29). The clinical trial successfully met the primary efficacy endpoint by showing that the difference between treatment groups in the estimated marginal mean change in average pain score was statistically significant (p&#60;0.0001). All sensitivity analyses showed statistically significant results (with p values ranging from 0.0002 to &#60;0.0001) supporting the primary endpoint analysis favoring Xtampza compared to placebo. All secondary endpoints were achieved. The p &#8209;value, or probability value, is a measure of statistical significance reflecting the likelihood that an observed result occurred by chance. Generally, p &#8209;values less than or equal to 0.05 are considered to indicate statistical significance. 

Xtampza was well &#8209;tolerated in this study. No new safety concerns were identified. The most common adverse events, or AEs, (&#62;5%) reported by patients in the Phase 3 clinical trial during the titration phase were nausea, headache, constipation, drowsiness, itching, vomiting and dizziness. Each of these AEs declined in frequency with continued treatment. The most common adverse reactions (&#62;5%) reported by patients in the Phase 3 clinical trial comparing Xtampza with placebo are shown in the table below. One subject was hospitalized for a serious adverse event moderate in severity of gastroesophageal reflux and subsequently discharged upon resolution of the event. The investigator at the 

&#160;

clinical trial site assessed this event as possibly related to study drug, but no action was taken with the study drug due to this event.

Phase 1 Clinical Trials 

We performed two Phase 1 bioequivalence and bioavailability clinical trials to compare the blood levels obtained after administration of Xtampza versus OxyContin OP. The first, in which we enrolled 48 patients, compared the pharmacokinetics, or PK, of Xtampza with OxyContin OP in fasted and fed states following single dose administration, with results shown in the figure below. 

&#160; 

The single &#8209;dose PK profiles for Xtampza and OxyContin OP were similar. However, in the fasted state, the total amount of absorption, known as area under the curve, or AUC, was lower when compared with the fed state for Xtampza, suggesting a larger food effect than OxyContin OP. As a result, our tentatively approved product label indicates that Xtampza should be taken with food and should be taken with approximately the same amount of food with every dose to ensure that consistent plasma levels are achieved. 

We performed a second phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety and PK of Xtampza and OxyContin OP in fed and fasted states following multiple &#8209;dose administration. In this clinical trial, which enrolled 45 patients, as shown in the figure below, both products were taken with food twice per day for five days, and the PK profiles &#8212; which were assessed based on two variables, peak plasma level of the drug, or C max , and AUC &#8212; were bioequivalent.

Evaluation of Abuse &#8209;Deterrence of Xtampza 

Xtampza was developed and evaluated in a manner consistent with recommendations described in the January 2013 draft FDA guidance on the evaluation and product labeling of abuse &#8209;deterrent opioids. We believe our development program is consistent with the April 2015 final FDA guidance. Listed below is an overview of the studies and clinical trials needed for FDA abuse &#8209;deterrent product labeling.

Category 1: In Vitro Studies 

We demonstrated abuse &#8209;deterrent properties of Xtampza in each mode of physical, chemical and route specific manipulations. 

Physical Manipulations 

One of the key objectives of our Category 1 studies was to determine the most effective tool to crush Xtampza microspheres and OxyContin OP tablets as part of a particle size reduction, or PSR, study. The results of this PSR study informed the design of our PK clinical trials. A range of household tools was selected based upon the review of the literature and researching the internet for common methods used by abusers. Based upon this, 10 tools were selected that cut, broke, ground and crushed the Xtampza microspheres and/or OxyContin OP tablets. For OxyContin OP, five of these tools were effective in laboratory tests at substantially increasing the rate of drug release, resulting in &#8220;dose dumping&#8221; of the active ingredient. For Xtampza, none of these tools was effective at causing dose dumping. A subset of these tools were also applied to the Xtampza microspheres after pre &#8209;treatment by freezing or heating, but were still unable to cause dose dumping. Consistent with FDA guidance, results of the physical manipulation study were replicated by an independent third party analytical laboratory registered with the FDA. 

Chemical Extraction 

Our chemical extraction studies were completed using the optimal method of crushing for Xtampza and OxyContin OP as identified in the above Category 1 study. We conducted a series of laboratory &#8209;based Category 1 chemical manipulation studies to investigate simple and complex extraction methods and dissolution of Xtampza and OxyContin OP in a variety of commonly used beverages, solvents, and soft foods. Results from these studies show that Xtampza microspheres resist extraction of the oxycodone active ingredient into a usable non &#8209;toxic form that could be abused. By contrast, after crushing, the active ingredient was readily extracted from OxyContin OP. Results from these studies show that Xtampza has a greater resistance to a wide variety of solvents used for extraction than OxyContin OP. 

Route Specific &#8212; Injection 

To assess the ability for abusers to inject Xtampza, the microspheres were crushed, suspended in water and the resulting suspension was attempted to be expelled with needles and syringes. Only negligible amounts of the microspheres were able to pass through any size needle, including an 18 gauge needle (which was the largest needle size tested). By contrast, crushing OxyContin OP and mixing it in water resulted in a gel where a substantial amount, up to 54% of the active ingredient, could be passed through an 18 gauge needle, as well as smaller 25 and 27 gauge needles. 

&#160;

The Xtampza microspheres were then melted at approximately 75&#176;C and the resulting molten material was attempted to be drawn through a needle into a syringe and then expelled through the needle. As the liquid was drawn into the syringe, it immediately solidified, making injection impossible. A comparable procedure on OxyContin OP was not performed because a substantial portion of the crushed and dissolved OxyContin OP mixture, without melting, could be passed through an 18 gauge needle. 

Finally, attempts were made to extract the active drug from Xtampza microspheres and OxyContin OP in injectable amounts of water. Both drugs were subjected to three manipulation techniques prior to extraction in water, consisting of crushing alone, crushing and heating them on a hot plate, and crushing and microwaving them. For Xtampza, less than 10% of the oxycodone could be extracted for injection regardless of the manipulation applied. By contrast, the amount of oxycodone extracted from OxyContin OP ranged from 17 &#8209;84%, depending on the method. Approximately 17% of oxycodone was extracted when crushed, 68% was extracted when crushed and subjected to pretreatment on a heating plate and 84% was extracted when crushed and subjected to heating in a microwave. 

Route Specific &#8212; Smoking 

Studies have shown that less than 5% of OxyContin OP abuse is by smoking. We conducted a study comparing the ability to vaporize Xtampza, OxyContin OP, and a marketed immediate &#8209;release form of oxycodone. The average amount of oxycodone recovered from vapor after 3 minutes, as a percentage of the total available in the smoked capsule or pill, was approximately 17% for Xtampza, 23% for OxyContin OP and 30% for the marketed immediate &#8209;release oxycodone suggesting that Xtampza is unlikely to be abused by smoking more often than existing oxycodone products. In addition, when Xtampza is heated in order to vaporize the oxycodone, inactive excipients are also vaporized, which may be unpleasant to an abuser. 

&#160;

Category 2: Oral PK Clinical Trials 

To support oral abuse &#8209;deterrent product labeling for Xtampza we performed five separate PK clinical trials, three by the oral route of administration and two by the nasal route. The oral clinical trials were as follows:

Oral Crushed/Chewed PK Clinical Trial (CP &#8209;OXYDET &#8209;17) 

Our oral crushed/chewed PK clinical trial (CP &#8209;OXYDET &#8209;17) was an open &#8209;label, randomized, active &#8209;controlled, crossover clinical trial to evaluate the effect of tampering (crushing and chewing) on Xtampza microspheres compared with immediate &#8209;release oxycodone solution. The clinical trial had seven treatment arms, consisting of three fasted &#8209;state treatment arms and four fed &#8209;state treatment arms. Because Xtampza has a food effect, the tentative product label for Xtampza instructs patients to take Xtampza capsules with approximately the same amount of food for every dose in order to ensure consistent plasma levels are achieved. Accordingly, the graph below provides only the results of the clinical trial for the fed &#8209;state treatment arms. 

Mean Concentrations of Oxycodone 

&#160;

As demonstrated above, crushing or chewing Xtampza did not increase its C max as compared to the intact Xtampza capsules. All treatment groups had substantially lower peak plasma levels and longer time to peak plasma level, or T max , than the immediate &#8209;release oxycodone solution. The absorption of oxycodone, as measured by AUC, was substantially equivalent among the crushed, chewed and intact Xtampza treatment groups. In all Xtampza treatment groups, the extended &#8209;release properties remained intact and there was no evidence of dose dumping. 

C max Ratios Relative to Xtampza Intact Capsules Baseline 

Substantial early increases in plasma concentrations after crushing or chewing, compared to intact capsules are indicative of dose dumping. As a result, the product labels for all currently available orally administered extended &#8209;release opioids include a black box warning instructing patients that &#8220;crushing, dissolving or chewing the tablet can cause rapid release and absorption of a potential fatal dose&#8221; of the respective opioid. The results of the clinical trial shown in the graph below demonstrate that crushing and chewing, two common methods of manipulation used by abusers, did not increase the early plasma concentration of Xtampza when taken orally.

&#160; 

&#160;

Another measure used to assess the potential &#8220;likability&#8221; of a drug for abusers is the &#8220;abuse quotient,&#8221; or AQ, which characterizes the rate at which the peak plasma rises after ingestion and is calculated by dividing C max by T max . By manipulating a formulation, an abuser seeks to create euphoria by maximizing AQ. As shown in the graph below, the AQ values for Xtampza after crushing or chewing were the same as taking the product intact and meaningfully lower than for the immediate &#8209;release oxycodone solution. 

Mean AQ Values for Each Treatment 

&#160; 

In summary, in this clinical trial, manipulation of Xtampza microspheres by crushing or chewing did not alter the extended &#8209;release properties of the Xtampza formulation in the fed &#8209;state treatment arms. 

Oral Chewed PK and HAP Clinical Trial (CP &#8209;OXYDET &#8209;24) 

Our oral chewed PK and HAP clinical trial was designed to assess the PK of Xtampza following chewing as compared to taking the product candidate intact and also as compared to crushing an immediate &#8209;release oxycodone tablet. The clinical trial design was consistent with FDA guidance. 

The results shown in the figure below indicate that for C max and AUC, Xtampza intact and Xtampza chewed are bioequivalent with equivalent T max . These results indicate that chewing Xtampza does not affect the peak and overall exposure to oxycodone. 

&#160;

Mean Concentrations of Oxycodone 

The figure below further demonstrates that chewing Xtampza does not affect C max relative to intact Xtampza capsules. Ratios below 100% indicate chewing does not increase peak plasma exposure versus baseline (taking Xtampza intact). 

C max Ratios Relative to Intact Xtampza Capsules 

&#160; 

To better characterize early plasma exposure, partial area under the curve, or PAUC (which measures cumulative absorption over an initial period, in this case five hours, after dosage), and AQ values were calculated for each treatment arm. Over the timeframe of the first sampling time to five hours after dosing, the PAUC values for all Xtampza treatments were substantially lower than the immediate &#8209;release oxycodone crushed solution PAUC values. The small increase in PAUC for the manipulated Xtampza capsules relative to intact capsules was anticipated because the microspheres were removed from the capsules prior to oral administration and were therefore more rapidly exposed to 

&#160;

the gastric environment for absorption. As shown in the figures below, the mean PAUC and AQ values for all Xtampza treatments were substantially lower than the immediate &#8209;release oxycodone crushed solution AQ.

&#160; 

Mean AQ Values for Each Treatment 

&#160; 

In summary, the PK data from this clinical trial indicate that there is no material increase in plasma exposure or dose dumping when Xtampza is administered after chewing, when compared to intact Xtampza. Similar to our oral crushed/chewed PK clinical trial, our oral chewed PK and HAP clinical trial demonstrated that intact and manipulated Xtampza are bioequivalent to each other. 

&#160;

Comparative Crushing/Tampering PK Clinical Trial (CP &#8209;OXYDET &#8209;25) 

Our comparative crushing/tampering PK clinical trial was an open &#8209;label, randomized, active &#8209;controlled, cross &#8209;over, single &#8209;dose clinical trial that evaluated the effect of crushing Xtampza, OxyContin OP and immediate &#8209;release oxycodone tablets. 

The figure on the left below indicates that crushing does not materially increase the C max or materially change the AUC of Xtampza compared with the intact product, which retains its oral extended &#8209;release properties when crushed, confirming observations from our oral crushed/chewed PK clinical trial. By contrast, the OxyContin OP data in the figure on the right below show that OxyContin OP exhibits a higher C max and shorter T max when administered orally in the crushed state, as compared with the intact state, essentially converting OxyContin OP from an extended &#8209;release to an immediate &#8209;release formulation. This in vivo observation is consistent with in vitro studies on OxyContin OP, which showed that the amount of drug released in one hour increased from 17% in the intact state to 77% following crushing. 

Mean Concentrations of Oxycodone 

The figure below shows the mean PAUC values from the first sampling time to two hours for all treatments. Over the first two hours after dosing, the PAUC values for intact and crushed Xtampza, as well as intact OxyContin OP, treatments were substantially lower than the corresponding crushed immediate &#8209;release oxycodone values. Over this same timeframe, the PAUC values for crushed OxyContin OP overlapped with those of crushed immediate &#8209;release oxycodone. The small increase in PAUC for the crushed Xtampza treatment relative to intact Xtampza was anticipated because the microspheres were removed from the capsules prior to oral administration and were therefore more rapidly exposed to the gastric environment for absorption. 

&#160;

Graphical Display of Mean Oxycodone Partial AUC Values from 0.25 to 2 hours 

As shown in the figure below, mean AQ values were comparable for crushed and intact Xtampza treatments and substantially lower than crushed immediate &#8209;release oxycodone. In contrast to Xtampza, crushing OxyContin OP compromises its extended &#8209;release profile such that the AQ value of crushed OxyContin OP increases by nearly four times and is similar to that of immediate &#8209;release oxycodone. 

Graphical Display of Mean (SD) AQ Values for Each Treatment 

&#160; 

In summary, crushing Xtampza microspheres does not materially change the extended &#8209;release properties of the product. By contrast, crushing OxyContin OP with common household tools causes it to completely lose its extended &#8209;release properties, turning it into an immediate &#8209;release and readily abuseable formulation. The data in this clinical trial confirm and extend the findings from previous studies, demonstrating that crushing or chewing Xtampza should not lead to a 

&#160;

potentially fatal rapid release of oxycodone via &#8220;dose dumping&#8221; should a patient or a drug abuser crush, break or grind Xtampza. 

Category 2: Intranasal PK Clinical Trials 

We completed two intranasal PK clinical trials to support abuse &#8209;deterrent product labeling for Xtampza.

Intranasal PK Clinical Trial (CP &#8209;OXYDET &#8209;19) 

Our intranasal PK clinical trial was a randomized, open &#8209;label, active &#8209;controlled, cross &#8209;over comparison trial. The primary objective was to compare the safety and PK of crushed and snorted Xtampza, intact Xtampza capsules taken orally, and snorted immediate &#8209;release oxycodone powder. 

Data from this clinical trial demonstrated that administration of crushed and snorted Xtampza resulted in a lower C max than both intact Xtampza taken orally and snorted immediate &#8209;release oxycodone powder; the C max for crushed and snorted Xtampza was approximately 80% of intact Xtampza taken orally and 60% of snorted immediate &#8209;release oxycodone powder. The median T max following crushed and snorted Xtampza was equivalent to the median T max for intact Xtampza taken orally, and both demonstrated longer median T max values than snorted immediate &#8209;release oxycodone powder. Crushed and snorted Xtampza, intact Xtampza taken orally, and snorted immediate &#8209;release oxycodone powder were all bioequivalent with respect to AUC parameters. 

Mean Concentrations of Oxycodone 

&#160;

The figure below shows the mean PAUC values from the first sampling time to two hours for two treatments. Over the first two hours after dosing, the PAUC values for crushed and snorted Xtampza treatments were substantially lower than the crushed and snorted immediate &#8209;release oxycodone powder values. 

Graphical Display of Mean Oxycodone Partial AUC Values from 0.1 to 2 hours 

As shown in the figure below, the mean AQ values for crushed and snorted Xtampza and intact Xtampza taken orally were comparable. In this clinical trial, no increase in AQ was observed with crushed and snorted Xtampza relative to intact Xtampza taken orally. In contrast, the AQ value for snorted immediate &#8209;release oxycodone powder was approximately five &#8209;fold higher, on average, than that for crushed and snorted Xtampza. 

Mean AQ Values for Each Treatment 

In summary, crushed and snorted Xtampza microspheres demonstrated a lower C max and an equivalent T max compared to taking the intact product orally as directed. The C max of both crushed and snorted Xtampza and intact Xtampza taken orally are substantially lower than the C max of snorted immediate &#8209;release oxycodone powder. Crushing and snorting Xtampza microspheres did not produce the rapid, high plasma concentrations that abusers might seek for euphoria. Additionally, crushed and snorted Xtampza produced a higher percentage of mild respiratory AEs (e.g., nasal discomfort and congestion) and associated transient nasal events including burning, and facial pain/pressure compared with the immediate &#8209;release comparator. 

&#160;

Intranasal PK and HAP Clinical Trial (CP &#8209;OXYDET &#8209;21) 

Our intranasal PK and HAP clinical trial was a randomized, open &#8209;label, active &#8209;controlled, cross &#8209;over comparison clinical trial. The primary objective was to compare the safety and PK of crushed and snorted Xtampza, intact Xtampza capsules taken orally, and snorted crushed immediate &#8209;release oxycodone tablets. 

The PK results from our intranasal PK and HAP clinical trial are similar to those observed in our intranasal PK clinical trial. With respect to AUC, crushed and snorted Xtampza was bioequivalent to intact Xtampza taken orally. However, crushed and snorted Xtampza microspheres resulted in approximately 70% of the peak exposure of intact Xtampza taken orally and approximately 50% of the peak exposure of crushed and snorted immediate &#8209;release oxycodone. Median T max was equivalent when comparing crushed and snorted Xtampza relative to intact Xtampza taken orally. Both Xtampza treatments had substantially longer median T max values in comparison to crushed and snorted immediate &#8209;release oxycodone. 

Mean Concentrations of Oxycodone 

The figure below shows the mean PAUC values from the first sampling time to five hours for all three treatment arms. Over the first five hours after dosing, the PAUC values for intact Xtampza and crushed and snorted Xtampza treatments were substantially lower than those of the crushed and snorted immediate &#8209;release oxycodone treatment. 

&#160;

Graphical Display of Mean Oxycodone Partial AUC Values from 0.25 to 5 hours 

&#160; 

The mean AQ value for crushed and snorted Xtampza was similar to (and slightly lower than) that of intact Xtampza taken orally. By contrast, the mean AQ value for the crushed and snorted immediate &#8209;release oxycodone treatment was approximately 11 &#8209;fold greater than that of crushed and snorted Xtampza. These data indicate that crushed and snorted Xtampza may potentially be less desirable to (i.e., less liked by) drug abusers seeking to achieve a rapid, euphoric effect. 

Mean AQ Values for Each Treatment 

In summary, data from our intranasal PK and HAP clinical trial corroborate the findings from our intranasal PK clinical trial. Both clinical trials indicate that crushed and snorted Xtampza microspheres do not produce the rapid rise in peak plasma drug concentrations that abusers might seek for euphoria when manipulating and administering dosage forms by the nasal route. Additionally, crushed and snorted Xtampza produced a higher percentage of mild respiratory AEs (e.g., nasal discomfort, nasal congestion and nose bleeds) and associated transient nasal events including irritation, burning, and facial pain compared with the immediate &#8209;release comparator. The AEs following crushed and snorting Xtampza microspheres, without the addition of potentially harmful antagonist or aversive agents, may serve as a nuisance to an abuser who wants to snort Xtampza. 

&#160;

Category 3: Human Abuse Potential Clinical Trials 

We conducted two clinical trials &#8212; our intranasal and oral PK and HAP clinical trial and our oral chewed PK and HAP clinical trial &#8212; to evaluate the HAP of crushed Xtampza microspheres taken orally and snorted, as described in the table below.

Intranasal PK and HAP Clinical Trial (CP &#8209;OXYDET &#8209;21) 

Our intranasal PK and HAP clinical trial assessed the human abuse potential of crushing and snorting Xtampza compared with taking intact Xtampza orally and with crushed and snorting immediate &#8209;release oxycodone tablets. 

HAP trials are clinical trials that determine the intrinsic potential for abuse of a drug formulation. These clinical trials are conducted in a non &#8209;dependent, recreational drug abuser population and are designed to predict how probable it is that a particular drug formulation will be attractive to abusers (i.e., &#8220;liked&#8221;). 

This clinical trial measured drug liking, by which a drug abuser assesses how much he or she likes taking a drug using a visual analogue scale, or VAS, measured from 0 to 100, where 0 means the abuser significantly dislikes the drug, 50 means neutral, and 100 means the abuser significantly likes the drug. The primary endpoint of this clinical trial was maximum effect, or Drug Liking E max , which is the maximum VAS score recorded over the 24 &#8209;hour period following administration. 

Results of the primary analysis for the Xtampza treatments (crushed and snorted Xtampza compared to intact Xtampza taken orally) were both significantly lower Drug Liking E max when compared with the control, crushed and snorted immediate &#8209;release oxycodone (p&#60;0.0001 and p=0.0292, respectively). Additionally, a statistically significant reduction in Drug Liking E max was also found when comparing crushed and snorted Xtampza microspheres with intact Xtampza capsules taken orally (p=0.037). 

&#160;

Mean Drug Liking E max (Peak Effect) 

As demonstrated in the figure below, analysis of the percentage reduction in Drug Liking E max score for crushed and snorted Xtampza relative to crushed and snorted immediate &#8209;release oxycodone demonstrated a significant response for individual patients, with approximately 58% of patients showing at least a 50% reduction in Drug Liking E max and approximately 78% of patients showing at least a 30% reduction in Drug Liking E max . 

Percentage of Subjects Showing Reduced Drug Liking of Crushed and Snorted Xtampza Relative to Crushed and Snorted Immediate &#8209;Release Oxycodone 

In summary, drug abusers liked crushed and snorted Xtampza microspheres significantly less than swallowing intact Xtampza capsules (p=0.037), and they liked swallowing intact Xtampza capsules significantly less than snorting immediate &#8209;release oxycodone powder (p=0.0292). Furthermore, crushing and snorting Xtampza was associated with the increased incidence of mild respiratory adverse events and associated transient nasal events including irritation, burning, and facial pain among patients who crushed and snorted Xtampza microspheres. These AEs following snorting Xtampza microspheres, without the addition of potentially harmful antagonist or aversive agents, may serve as a nuisance to an abuser who attempts snorting the drug. 

&#160;

Oral Chewed PK and HAP Clinical Trial (CP &#8209;OXYDET &#8209;24) 

Our oral chewed PK and HAP clinical trial assessed the HAP of chewing Xtampza capsule contents compared with taking the intact Xtampza orally and with taking crushed immediate &#8209;release oxycodone tablets orally. 

Similar to our intranasal and PK and HAP clinical trial, the primary endpoint for this clinical trial was Drug Liking E max over the 24 &#8209;hour period after dosing. Results of the primary analysis demonstrated that chewed Xtampza had significantly lower peak Drug Liking E max when compared with crushed immediate &#8209;release oxycodone (p&#60;0.0001). Similarly, Drug Liking E max was significantly lower for intact Xtampza when compared with crushed immediate &#8209;release oxycodone (p&#60;0.0001). 

Mean Drug Liking E max (Peak Effect) 

&#160; 

The percentage reduction for intact and chewed Xtampza relative to crushed immediate &#8209;release oxycodone as measured by Drug Liking E max is presented below. This figure shows that relative to crushed immediate &#8209;release oxycodone, chewing Xtampza does not markedly impact reduction in Drug Liking E max compared with swallowing Xtampza intact. For both Xtampza treatments (intact and chewed), approximately 29 &#8209;37% of patients showed at least a 50% reduction in Drug Liking E max relative to crushed immediate &#8209;release oxycodone, and approximately 48% of patients showed at least a 30% reduction in Drug Liking E max relative to crushed immediate &#8209;release oxycodone. 

&#160;

Percentage Reduction for Xtampza Intact and Chewed, Relative to Crushed Immediate &#8209;Release Oxycodone for Drug Liking VAS 

This clinical trial demonstrated that administration of chewed Xtampza resulted in lower Drug Liking E max than swallowing crushed immediate &#8209;release oxycodone. Similarly, swallowing intact Xtampza resulted in lower Drug Liking E max than swallowing crushed immediate &#8209;release oxycodone. This decrease in Drug Liking E max for both chewed and intact oral administration of Xtampza suggests that the relative abuse potential of Xtampza is significantly lower than that of a non &#8209;abuse &#8209;deterrent formulation of crushed immediate &#8209;release oxycodone (p&#60;0.0001). 

In conclusion, data from these Category 3 human abuse potential clinical trials demonstrated that Xtampza resulted in reduced Drug Liking when the drug product is chewed prior to oral administration, or when Xtampza is crushed and snorted, relative to immediate &#8209;release oxycodone administered by the same routes. 

Alternative Dosing PK Clinical Trial (CP &#8209;OXYDET &#8209;27) 

CP &#8209;OXYDET &#8209;27 was an open &#8209;label, randomized, single &#8209;dose, cross &#8209;over comparison clinical trial designed to assess the safety and PK profile of Xtampza administered by sprinkling the Xtampza microspheres onto applesauce compared with administration of intact Xtampza. As shown in the graph below, the administration of Xtampza microspheres sprinkled onto applesauce did not lead to any change in their PK profile compared to intact Xtampza. 

&#160;

Manufacturing 

Overview 

Our product candidates are manufactured using a proprietary process. This process is reproducible, scalable and cost &#8209;efficient, and we believe that the microsphere formulation &#8212; and the related manufacturing process &#8212; is unique in the extended &#8209;release opioid market. To date, we have manufactured three registration batches of Xtampza and have 24 months of stability data to support a proposed two &#8209;year shelf life. &#160; 

To date, we have produced Xtampza for use in our clinical trials, abuse &#8209;deterrence studies and clinical trials, and our preclinical studies at our contract manufacturing organization, Patheon. The existing Patheon facility has the capacity to support production of commercial quantities of Xtampza during the first several years after commercial launch. We are currently conducting a commercial validation program in preparation for commercial launch of Xtampza. As needed, we anticipate working with Patheon to build additional and dedicated manufacturing capacity at Patheon&#8217;s existing facility. Patheon has an established record of manufacturing products approved in the United States, including controlled substances. 

We own all of the intellectual property, including know &#8209;how and specialized manufacturing equipment, necessary to be able to replicate the manufacturing equipment currently located at Patheon&#8217;s facility at an alternative location (and with an alternative vendor) if necessary. 

Drug Substances 

The active ingredient used in Xtampza, oxycodone base, is an odorless white crystalline powder. We currently procure this active ingredient pursuant to a commercial supply agreement with a U.S. &#8209;based manufacturer and expect to continue to do so as we scale up production in anticipation of commercialization. If our current supplier is unable to supply oxycodone base in the quantities and at the times we require it, we are aware of other suppliers who we would expect to be able to satisfy our commercial orders. 

Oxycodone base is classified as a narcotic controlled substance under U.S. federal law. We expect that Xtampza and our other product candidates will be classified by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, as Schedule II controlled substances, meaning that they have a high potential for abuse and dependence among drugs that are recognized as having an accepted medical use. Consequently, we expect that the manufacturing, shipping, dispensing and storing of our product candidates will be subject to a high degree of regulation, as described in more detail under the caption &#8220;&#8212; Governmental Regulation &#8212; DEA Regulation.&#8221; 

&#160;

Marketing and Commercialization 

We intend to commercialize Xtampza and our other product candidates in the United States, if approved, with a direct sales force. We plan to explore out &#8209;licensing partnerships for Xtampza in other international markets, such as Canada, Australia and Japan, as well as countries in Latin America and Europe. 

The members of our management team, who will lead the commercialization of Xtampza, if we receive final regulatory approval, have substantial experience in pharmaceutical sales and marketing. If Xtampza receives final regulatory approval in the United States, we intend to hire a dedicated field sales force, initially consisting of approximately 120 sales professionals, to target the approximately 11,000 physicians who write approximately 55% of the branded extended &#8209;release oral opioid prescriptions in the United States, with a primary focus on pain specialists. In addition, we plan to deploy a focused sales force of approximately 25 specialty sales representatives to call on institutions where patients require extended &#8209;release opioids, such as skilled nursing or hospice facilities. In addition, we have employed medical sales liaisons, or MSLs, to respond to clinician inquiries about Xtampza. We have also employed a market &#8209;access team to support our formulary approval and payor contracting. 

We are continuing to develop our commercialization strategy with the input of key opinion leaders in the field of pain management, as well as healthcare practitioners. Internally, we have advanced pre &#8209;commercialization activities for Xtampza, such as developing positioning and messaging campaigns, a publication strategy, initiatives with payor organizations, and distribution and national accounts strategies. Our marketing strategy is expected to include increasing awareness of the differentiated features of Xtampza, the hazards of opioids that are not abuse &#8209;deterrent, and increasing awareness of solutions for patients with CPD who require or would benefit from extended &#8209;release opioids. 

Intellectual Property &#160; 

We regard the protection of patents, designs, trademarks and other proprietary rights that we own or license as critical to our success and competitive position. Our patent portfolio directed toward Xtampza and our DETERx technology consists of eight issued patents in the United States (five of which claim compositions of matter, one of which claims both compositions of matter and methods of use, and two that claim methods of use), two pending applications in the European Union and one issued patent in each of Canada, Japan and Australia. In addition, we were granted Notice of Allowances for one patent in Canada. Finally, we have six patent applications pending in the United States, and one pending patent application in Japan. Our issued U.S. patents are projected to expire in 2023 and 2025, and our pending patent applications in the United States, if issued, would be projected to expire in 2023, 2025 and 2030. In addition, we use a unique and proprietary process to manufacture our products that requires significant know &#8209;how, which we currently protect as trade secrets. 

Our policy is to patent the technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business, but only in those cases in which we believe that the costs of obtaining patent protection is justified by the commercial potential of the technology, and typically only in those jurisdictions that we believe present significant commercial opportunities to us. We have concluded that some of our technology is best protected as proprietary know &#8209;how, rather than through obtaining patents. In some cases, we publish the invention such that it becomes prior art in order for us to secure freedom to operate and to prevent a third party from patenting the invention before us. Our technology and products are not in &#8209;licensed from any third party, and we own all of the rights to our product candidates. We believe we have freedom to operate in the United States and other countries, but there can be no assurance that other companies, known and unknown, will not attempt to assert their intellectual property against us. 

We also rely on trademarks and trade designs to develop and maintain our competitive position. We have received trademark registration for Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc., DETERx, and Xtampza ER in the United States. 

We also depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know &#8209;how that is not patentable, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we generally require our employees, consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information and, in some cases, requiring disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. Additionally, these confidentiality agreements require that our employees, consultants and advisors do not bring to us, or use without proper authorization, any third party&#8217;s proprietary technology. 

&#160;

Patent Litigation Strategy 

We filed the NDA for Xtampza as a 505(b)(2) application, which allows us to reference data from an approved drug listed in the FDA&#8217;s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (commonly known as the Orange Book), in this case OxyContin OP. The 505(b)(2) process requires that we certify to the FDA and notify Purdue, as the holder of the NDA and any other Orange Book &#8209;listed patent owners, that we do not infringe any of the patents listed for OxyContin OP in the Orange Book, or that the patents are invalid. We made such certification and provided such notice on February 11, 2015 and such certification documented why Xtampza does not infringe any of the 11 Orange Book listed patents for OxyContin OP, five of which st ood invalidated , at such time, by the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, subject to a then pending appeal. Under the Hatch &#8209;Waxman Act of 1984, Purdue had the option to sue us for infringement and receive a stay of up to 30 months before the FDA can issue a final regulatory approval for Xtampza, unless the stay is earlier terminated. 

Purdue exercised its option and elected to sue us for infringement in the District of Delaware on March 24, 2015 asserting infringement of three of Purdue&#8217;s Orange Book &#8209;listed patents (all of which st ood invalidated , at such time, subject to a then pending appeal by Purdue) and a non &#8209;Orange Book &#8209;listed patent, and accordingly, received a stay of up to 30 months before the FDA can issue a final regulatory approval for Xtampza, unless the stay is earlier terminated. On March 26, 2015, Purdue filed a second suit against us in the District of Massachusetts asserting infringement of the same four patents. 

On July 23, 2015, Purdue voluntarily dismissed the Massachusetts case and on August 6, 2015, Purdue filed another case in Massachusetts asserting the same four patents as in the Delaware case and the original Massachusetts case. On October 7, 2015, the Delaware case was transferred to Massachusetts and on November 4, 2015, the two cases pending in Massachusetts were consolidated. On November 9, 2015, we filed a motion for partial judgment on the pleadings in relation to three of the four patents asserted against us which, had been previously invalidated by the court in the Southern District of New York in Purdue&#8217;s suit against Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., or Teva. On the same date, we moved for entry of final judgment and to expedite hearing on our motions. On November 6, 2015, Purdue filed another patent infringement suit against us in Massachusetts asserting the infringement of another patent that is a continuation of the three patents previously asserted by Purdue against us that were invalidated by the court in the Southern District of New York. On December 1, 2015, we filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, arguing that the patent asserted by Purdue is invalid based on collateral estoppel. Purdue filed its opposition response on December 15, 2015. That action was consolidated into the other Massachusetts actions, and our motion remains pending. On November 23, 2015, Purdue filed a motion to stay proceedings until resolution of its appeal against Teva. The hearing regarding our motion for partial judgment and entry of judgment and Purdue&#8217;s motion to stay was held on December 22, 2015. On December 23, 2015, the District Court of Massachusetts issued an order staying proceedings in relation to the three Orange Book &#8209;listed patents asserted against us until February 25, 2016, which wa s the date scheduled by the Court for a status conference. The Court reserved the decision to grant our motion for judgment on the three Orange Book &#8209;listed patents to be taken up again at the February 25th status conference, at which time the Court indicated it may grant our motion for judgment or may consider extending the stay. The Court further indicated that it w ould consider an earlier hearing if the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issue d a decision on the appeal of the New York judgment of invalidity prior to the February 25th status conference. &#160; On February 1, 2016, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the New York judgment of invalidity. On February 9, 2016, the District Court of Massachusetts ordered judgment in our favor on the three Orange Book listed patents that were the basis of the 30-month stay (Patent Nos. 7,674,799, 7,674,800, and 7,683,072) and dismissed the claims asserting infringement of those patents with prejudice. Purdue has reserved its right to appeal the judgment and dismissal and continues to assert infringement of the non-Orange Book listed patents against us, neither of which is associated with any stay of FDA approval. We have moved for judgment of invalidity of one of those patents based on collateral estoppel and that motion remains pending. 

The FDA&#8217;s tentative approval of Xtampza means that the product, with its product labeling, is tentatively approved based upon the information available to the FDA at the time of tentative approval. The FDA can grant final approval following the expiration of the 30 &#8209;month stay period or termination of the stay. If we receive a court order that the listed patents are invalid or not infringed, or if we settle the Purdue litigation before the 30 &#8209;month stay period expires, the FDA could then provide final regulatory approval of Xtampza prior to the expiration of the 30 &#8209;month period, at which point 

&#160;

the product can be marketed. In February 2016, the District Court of Massachusetts entered a judgment in our favor related to Purdue&#8217;s three Orange Book-listed patents that were the cause of the 30 month stay. 

We do not believe we infringe Purdue&#8217;s patents and intend to vigorously defend the suit. Our certification letter to Purdue and the other Orange Book &#8209;listed patent owners documents why Xtampza does not infringe any of the Orange Book &#8209;listed patents for OxyContin OP, or the OxyContin Patents, which fall into three general categories, as follows: 

&#183; 

High molecular weight poly(ethylene oxide)/polymer patents: Some of the OxyContin Patents describe a formulation containing a significant amount of high molecular weight poly(ethylene oxide) or polyalkalene oxide, which creates a hard tablet that is difficult to crush. Some of these OxyContin Patents claim specific manufacturing methods and curing conditions that are intended to create hard tablets. The formulation described in our NDA for Xtampza does not contain any high molecular weight component and is manufactured under different conditions from those claimed by the OxyContin Patents. 

&#183; 

Oxycodone HCl or preferential removal of 14 &#8209;hydroxycodeinione patents: Some of the OxyContin Patents describe oxycodone compositions, formulations and manufacturing processes that use oxycodone HCl as the active ingredient and thus require preferential removal of the toxic intermediary 14 &#8209;hydroxycodeinone. The formulation described in our NDA uses an oxycodone base rather than oxycodone HCl, and does not require the preferential removal of 14 &#8209;hydroxycodeinone. 

&#183; 

Viscosity &#8209;increasing patents: Some of the OxyContin Patents describe the addition of viscosity &#8209;increasing agents as a method of abuse deterrence. The formulation described in our NDA does not contain any viscosity &#8209;increasing agent and, unlike OxyContin OP, does not form a gel when placed in an aqueous liquid. 

Our certification letter to Purdue also noted that five of the 11 Orange Book &#8209;listed patents for OxyContin OP st ood invalidated by the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, which invalidity was affirmed by the Court of Appeals on February 1, 2016. 

Because we anticipated that Purdue would sue us for patent infringement as a possible means to delay the launch of Xtampza, we have engaged experienced litigation counsel, who worked carefully with us to construct a strategy to prevail in any litigation that arises as expeditiously as possible. We are now in the process of implementing this litigation strategy and plan to take all steps necessary to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims. 

Our Strategy 

Our goal is to become the leading marketer of abuse &#8209;deterrent extended &#8209;release opioids and other commonly abused products. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are to: 

&#183; 

Establish our leadership position by obtaining final regulatory approval to market Xtampza with a best &#8209;in &#8209;class abuse &#8209;deterrent product label. Our tentatively approved product label contains differentiated abuse &#8209;deterrent claims for Xtampza. If Xtampza receives final regulatory approval, this product label may allow us to detail Xtampza to physicians and highlight its unique abuse &#8209;deterrent characteristics. 

&#183; 

Commercialize Xtampza in the United States ourselves. We are currently building our commercial organization, including our sales force and commercial manufacturing capacity, in preparation for a potential U.S. commercial launch of Xtampza in the second quarter of 2016, although the timing of a potential commercial launch is subject to whether and when we receive final regulatory approval for Xtampza. Our management team has extensive experience commercializing pharmaceutical products, and we are in the process of establishing sales, marketing and reimbursement functions to commercialize Xtampza in the United States. Initially, we plan to detail Xtampza to approximately 11,000 physicians who write approximately 55% of the branded extended &#8209;release oral opioid prescriptions in the United States with a sales team of approximately 120 sales representatives. We believe that this physician group also represents a significant portion of the top prescribers of extended &#8209;release and long &#8209;acting opioids (including drugs formulated with fentanyl and methadone) currently used to treat patients with CPD. In addition, we plan to deploy a separate, focused sales team of approximately 25 specialty sales 

&#160;

representatives to detail Xtampza to nursing homes, hospices, and other institutions treating large populations of the elderly and other patients who need chronic pain relief and have difficulty swallowing. 

&#183; 

Establish Xtampza as the treatment of choice for patients with CPD. Xtampza has been tentatively approved with product labeling for sprinkling Xtampza microspheres on soft foods or into a cup, and then directly into the mouth, or through a gastrostomy or nasogastric feeding tube. If Xtampza receives final regulatory approval, Xtampza could be the only extended &#8209;release oxycodone product designed to be suitable for this approximately 11 million patient segment. 

&#183; 

Establish strategic collaborations to accelerate and maximize the potential of our product candidates worldwide. We intend to seek strategic collaborations with other pharmaceutical companies to commercialize our product candidates outside the United States and to develop certain of our product candidates that are outside of our core therapeutic focus. We believe that we are an attractive collaborator for pharmaceutical companies due to the strength of our abuse &#8209;deterrent technology. 

&#183; 

Advance other product candidates that incorporate our DETERx platform technology. We have begun advancing our development program for COL &#8209;195, an abuse &#8209;deterrent, extended &#8209;release hydrocodone for the treatment of chronic pain. We initiated clinical trials for our hydrocodone product candidate in the first quarter of 2016. We also have an IND application on file for COL &#8209;172, an abuse &#8209;deterrent, extended &#8209;release oxymorphone for the treatment of chronic pain, which has been granted Fast Track status by the FDA. In addition, we have COL &#8209;171, a proprietary preclinical DETERx extended &#8209;release, abuse &#8209;deterrent methylphenidate formulation for the treatment of ADHD. 

&#183; 

Acquire additional products and product candidates. We may identify and license, co &#8209;promote or acquire products or product candidates being developed for pain indications and other complementary products. 

We are continuing to develop our commercialization strategy with the input of key opinion leaders in the field of pain management, as well as healthcare practitioners. Internally, we have advanced pre &#8209;commercialization initiatives for Xtampza, such as developing positioning and messaging campaigns, a publication strategy, initiatives with payor organizations, and distribution and national accounts strategies. 

Competition 

Our industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face competition and potential competition from a number of sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, generic drug companies, drug delivery companies and academic and research institutions. Most of the existing and potential competitors have significantly more financial and other resources than we do. 

Currently, the only opioid drugs on the market for chronic pain relief that have an abuse &#8209;deterrent product label are OxyContin OP and Hysingla &#174; , both of which are marketed by Purdue, and Embeda, which is marketed by Pfizer. In addition, there are two other approved extended &#8209;release opioids that have abuse &#8209;deterrent product labeling, Targiniq from Purdue and MorphaBond&#8482; ER from Inspirion Delivery Technologies, LLC, neither of which is currently on the market. Hysingla is a once a day hydrocodone extended &#8209;release product. Embeda is a combination of morphine and naltrexone, an opioid antagonist that can be sprinkled on soft food but contains a black box warning product label stating that &#8220;crushing, dissolving or chewing can cause rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of the active drug.&#8221; Also, according to the warning labels of OxyContin OP and other extended &#8209;release opioids, administration of the active ingredients by injection may result in necrosis, infection and increased risk of heart disease. Targiniq is a combination of oxycodone and naloxone, an opioid antagonist. MorphaBond ER is a twice daily morphine product formulated with a hard tablet and gelling polymers. In 2014, sales of extended &#8209;release opioids in the United States were $6 billion, consisting of a number of large and small companies, including Purdue, Pfizer, Actavis, Endo Pharmaceuticals, Pernix, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Mallinckrodt and several generic drug companies. A number of other large and small companies are developing abuse &#8209;deterrent drugs for chronic pain, including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Endo Health Solutions Inc., Nektar Therapeutics, Egalet Corporation, and KemPharm, Inc. 

We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates include their degree of abuse deterrence, bioavailability, therapeutic efficacy, and convenience of dosing and 

&#160;

distribution, as well as their safety, cost and tolerability profiles. Xtampza may also face competition from commercially available generic and branded extended &#8209;release and long &#8209;acting opioid drugs other than oxycodone, including fentanyl, hydromorphone, oxymorphone and methadone, as well as opioids that are currently in clinical development. 

If it ultimately receives final regulatory approval, Xtampza would compete against all extended &#8209;release opioids, including Purdue&#8217;s OxyContin OP for the treatment of patients experiencing pain severe enough to require around &#8209;the &#8209;clock analgesia. Although no generic oxycodone extended &#8209;release products are currently commercially available, and although the FDA has not issued guidance on the regulatory pathway for generic abuse &#8209;deterrent products, it is possible that generic forms of OxyContin OP could become available, in which case Xtampza would compete with any such generic oxycodone extended &#8209;release products. 

Additionally, we are aware of companies in late &#8209;stage development of abuse &#8209;deterrent oxycodone product candidates, including Pain Therapeutics&#8217; Remoxy &#174; , a formulation of oxycodone, and Pfizer&#8217;s ALO &#8209;02, a formulation of oxycodone and naltrexone. If these products are successfully developed and approved for marketing, they could represent significant competition for Xtampza. It is also possible that a company that has developed an abuse &#8209;deterrent technology could initiate an abuse &#8209;deterrent oxycodone program at any time. 

Government Regulation 

FDA Approval Process 

In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The FD&#38;C Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post &#8209;approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of the product from the market, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. Failure to meet FDA requirements for approval would also result in a medication not being approved for marketing. 

The process of developing a pharmaceutical and obtaining FDA approval to market the medication in the United States typically involves: 

&#183; 

completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s good laboratory practices, or GLP, regulation; 

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States; 

&#183; 

approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; 

&#183; 

performance of adequate and well &#8209;controlled human clinical trials in accordance with current good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication for which FDA approval is sought; 

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA pre &#8209;approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDA&#8217;s cGMP regulations; 

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an NDA; 

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of a potential review by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable; and 

&#183; 

FDA review and approval of the NDA. 

&#160;

Satisfaction of FDA pre &#8209;market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease. 

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long &#8209;term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 

The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by FDA unless, within the 30 &#8209;day time period, the FDA raises concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations, including GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights, safety and wellbeing of subjects and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; and (ii) under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and any effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. subjects and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 

GCP requirements include that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. An independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the informed consent information as well as the clinical trial protocol before the trial commences at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. The FDA or the IRB may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time and on various grounds, particularly upon the belief that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects, or impose other conditions. 

Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients, and is tested to assess safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, PK, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common AEs and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more extensive Phase 3 clinical trials. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of subjects, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit &#8209;risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the clinical trial is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible. Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report key parameters of certain clinical trials at the NIH &#8209;maintained website ClinicalTrials.gov. 

After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product&#8217;s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently set at $2,374,200, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved new drug application are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently set at $114,450 per product and $585,200 per establishment. These fees are typically increased annually. 

&#160;

The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency&#8217;s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Rather than accept an NDA for filing, then FDA may request additional information. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and may be subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in &#8209;depth substantive review. The FDA has established certain performance goals for the review of new drug applications. The agency endeavors to review applications for standard review drug products within 10 to 12 months of the acceptance for filing, and aims to review applications for drugs granted priority review, which may apply to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists, within six to eight months. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider certain late &#8209;submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. 

The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee &#8212; typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts &#8212; for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied. 

After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that an application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If, and when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. 

An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. Changes to certain of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses similar procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. 

REMS 

The FDA has the authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, as a condition of the approval of an NDA or after approval to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. In determining whether a REMS is necessary, the FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is a new molecular entity. If the FDA determines a REMS is necessary for a new drug, the drug sponsor must submit a proposed REMS plan as part of its NDA prior to approval. The FDA may also impose a REMS requirement on a drug already on the market if the FDA determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the drug&#8217;s benefits continue to outweigh its risks. A REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. In addition, the REMS must include a timetable to periodically assess the strategy, at a minimum, at 18 months, three years, and seven years after the REMS approval. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a drug. 

&#160;

In February 2009, the FDA informed manufacturers of certain opioid products that it would require a REMS for their opioid drug products. Subsequently, the FDA initiated efforts to develop a new standardized REMS for these opioid medications to ensure their safe use, and in July 2012, approved a class &#8209;wide REMS for extended &#8209;release and long &#8209;acting opioid products. Extended &#8209;release formulations of oxycodone, morphine, hydrocodone and hydromorphone, for example, are required to have a REMS. Manufacturers subject to this class &#8209;wide REMS must work together to implement the REMS as part of a single shared system to reduce the burden of the REMS on the healthcare system. The central component of the extended release/long acting opioid REMS program is an education program for prescribers and patients. Specifically, the REMS includes a Medication Guide available for distribution to patients who are dispensed the drug, as well as a number of ETASU. These ETASU include training for healthcare professionals who prescribe the drug; information provided to prescribers that they can use to educate patients in the safe use, storage, and disposal of opioids; and information provided to prescribers of the existence of the REMS and the need to successfully complete the necessary training. Prescriber training required as part of the REMS is conducted by accredited, independent continuing education providers, without cost to healthcare professionals, under unrestricted grants funded by the opioid analgesic manufacturers. Moreover, REMS assessments must be submitted on an annual basis to assess the extent to which the ETASU are meeting the goals of the REMS and whether the goals or elements should be modified. 

Advertising and Promotion 

The FDA and other federal regulatory agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs through, among other things, standards and regulations for direct &#8209;to &#8209;consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry &#8209;sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved. After approval, product promotion can include only those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA. Healthcare providers are permitted to prescribe drugs for &#8220;off &#8209;label&#8221; uses &#8212; that is, uses not approved by the FDA and therefore not described in the drug&#8217;s labeling &#8212; because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers&#8217; communications regarding off &#8209;label uses. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Justice, or the Office of the Inspector General of the HHS, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. 

Fast Track Designation 

The FDA has various programs to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life &#8209;threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track designation program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the submission of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days after receipt of the sponsor&#8217;s request. 

In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product&#8217;s NDA before the application is complete. The FDA&#8217;s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 

Post &#8209;Approval Requirements 

Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug listing and registration, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, adverse event reporting and advertising, marketing and promotion restrictions. 

Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post &#8209;market testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to 

&#160;

cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration subjects entities to periodic announced or unannounced inspections by the FDA or these state agencies, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. In addition, other regulatory actions may be taken, including, among other things, warning letters, the seizure of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. 

As part of the sales and marketing process, pharmaceutical companies frequently provide samples of approved drugs to physicians. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and associated regulations, impose certain recordkeeping and reporting requirements and other limitations on the distribution of drug samples to physicians. The PDMA also requires that state licensing of distributors who distribute prescription drugs meet certain federal guidelines that include minimum standards for storage, handling and record keeping. In addition, the PDMA and a growing majority of states also impose certain drug pedigree requirements on the sale and distribution of prescription drugs. The PDMA sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations. In 2010, a statutory provision was enacted that required manufacturers and authorized distributors of record to report on an annual basis certain information about prescription drug samples they distributed. The FDA issued a draft compliance policy guide on the reporting requirement. The FDA stated that it would exercise enforcement discretion with regard to companies that have not submitted reports until the FDA finalizes the reporting requirement and/or provides notice that it is revising its exercise of enforcement discretion. 

The FDA may require post &#8209;approval studies and clinical trials if the FDA finds that scientific data, including information regarding related drugs, deem it appropriate. The purpose of such studies would be to assess a known serious risk or signals of serious risk related to the drug or to identify an unexpected serious risk when available data indicate the potential for a serious risk. The FDA may also require a labeling change if it becomes aware of new safety information that it believes should be included in the labeling of a drug. 

The Hatch &#8209;Waxman Amendments 

Orange Book Listing 

In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant&#8217;s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA&#8217;s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated NDA, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredient in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or efficacy of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as &#8220;generic equivalents&#8221; to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 

The ANDA applicant is required to make certain certifications to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA&#8217;s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method &#8209;of &#8209;use rather than make certifications concerning a listed method &#8209;of &#8209;use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 

A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product&#8217;s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement 

&#160;

lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 

The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non &#8209;patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. 

Exclusivity 

Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity, or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug or any Section 505(b)(2) NDA, discussed in more detail below, that relies on the FDA&#8217;s findings regarding that drug. A drug may obtain a three &#8209;year period of exclusivity for a change to the drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the labeling or a new formulation, during which FDA cannot approve an ANDA or any Section 505(b)(2) NDA, if the supplement includes reports of new clinical trials (other than bioavailability clinical trials) essential to the approval of the supplement. 

An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. 

Section 505(b)(2) NDAs 

Generally, drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA or an ANDA. A third alternative is a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on data not developed by the applicant, such as the FDA&#8217;s findings of safety and efficacy in the approval of a similar product or published literature in support of its application. 

Section 505(b)(2) NDAs may provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from clinical trials not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the Section 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on FDA&#8217;s previous findings of safety and efficacy is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical trials of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional clinical trials or provide additional materials to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 

To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on the FDA&#8217;s findings of safety and effectiveness for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. Thus approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired; until any non &#8209;patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired; and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. In the interim period, the FDA may grant tentative approval. Tentative approval indicates that the FDA has determined that the applicant meets the standards for approval as of the date that the tentative approval is granted. Final regulatory approval can only be granted if the FDA is assured that there is no new information that would affect final regulatory approval. As with traditional NDAs, a Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be eligible for three &#8209;year marketing exclusivity, assuming the NDA includes reports of new clinical trials (other than bioavailability clinical trials) essential to the approval of the NDA. 

Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information 

Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA &#8209;regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, clinical trial sites 

&#160;

and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to post certain information regarding the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. 

DEA Regulation 

Our lead product candidate, Xtampza, if it ultimately receives final regulatory approval, will be regulated as a &#8220;controlled substance&#8221; as defined in the Controlled Substances Act, or CSA, which establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution, importation, exportation and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA regulates the handling of controlled substances through a closed chain of distribution. This control extends to the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce. 

The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use, and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Schedule II drugs are those that meet the following characteristics: 

&#183; 

high potential for abuse; 

&#183; 

currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States or a currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions; 

&#183; 

abuse may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence; and 

&#183; 

are considered &#8220;dangerous.&#8221; 

We expect that Xtampza, an abuse &#8209;deterrent oral formulation of oxycodone, will be listed by the DEA as a Schedule II controlled substance under the CSA. Consequently, the manufacturing, shipping, storing, selling and using of the products will be subject to a high degree of regulation. Schedule II drugs are subject to the strictest requirements for registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting. Also, distribution and dispensing of these drugs are highly regulated. For example, all Schedule II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician, physically presented to a pharmacist and may not be refilled without a new prescription. 

Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. For example, separate registrations are needed for import and manufacturing, and each registration will specify which schedules of controlled substances are authorized. 

The DEA typically inspects a facility to review its security measures prior to issuing a registration. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances, and periodic reports made to the DEA, for example distribution reports for Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics, and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance, and to obtain authorization to destroy any controlled substance. In addition, special permits and notification requirements apply to imports and exports of narcotic drugs. 

In addition, a DEA quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. Distributions of any Schedule I or II controlled substance must also be accompanied by special order forms, with copies provided to the DEA. Because Xtampza is expected to be regulated as a Schedule II controlled substance, it will be subject to the DEA&#8217;s production and procurement quota scheme. The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much oxycodone may be produced in total in the United States based on the DEA&#8217;s estimate of 

&#160;

the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. The limited aggregate amount of opioids that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States each year is allocated among individual companies, who must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual production and procurement quotas. We and our contract manufacturers must receive an annual quota from the DEA in order to produce or procure any Schedule I or Schedule II substance, including oxycodone base for use in manufacturing Xtampza. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. 

To enforce these requirements, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in loss or diversion, can result in administrative, civil or criminal enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate administrative proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings. 

Individual states also independently regulate controlled substances. We and our contract manufacturers will be subject to state regulation on distribution of these products. 

International Regulation 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional review periods, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval and, if applicable, DEA classification. The requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 

Many foreign countries are also signatories to the internal drug control treaties and have implemented regulations of controlled substances similar to those in the United States. Our products will be subject to such regulation which may impose certain regulatory and reporting requirements and restrict sales of these products in those countries. 

Under European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. 

In addition to regulations in Europe and the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, pricing and reimbursement and commercial distribution of our products. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 

In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, other divisions of HHS (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the DOJ, state Attorneys General and other state and local government agencies. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with fraud and abuse laws such as the federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, as amended and similar state laws. In order to participate in the Medicaid program, existing federal law requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates to state governments, based on a statutory formula, on covered outpatient 

&#160;

drugs reimbursed by the Medicaid program as a condition of having their drugs paid for by Medicaid. Manufacturers are required to report AMP and best price for each of their covered outpatient drugs to the government on a regular basis. Additionally, some state Medicaid programs have imposed a requirement for supplemental rebates over and above the formula set forth in federal law, as a condition for coverage. In addition to the Medicaid Rebate Program, federal law also requires that if a pharmaceutical manufacturer wishes to have its outpatient drugs covered under Medicaid as well as under Medicare Part B, it must sign a &#8220;Master Agreement&#8221; obligating it to provide a formulaic discount that results in a federal ceiling price, or maximum price that participating manufacturers may charge for covered drugs sold to the U.S. Departments of Defense (including the TRICARE retail pharmacy program), Veterans Affairs, the Public Health Service and the Coast Guard, and also provide discounts through a drug pricing agreement meeting the requirements of Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act, for outpatient drugs sold to certain specified eligible health care organizations. The formula for determining the discounted purchase price under the 340B drug pricing program is defined by statute and is based on the AMP and rebate amount for a particular product as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, discussed above. 

The federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute prohibits any person from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers, on one hand, and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers, on the other. The term &#8220;remuneration&#8221; is not defined in the federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include the transfer of anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at other than its fair market value. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute liability in all cases. The reach of the federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute was broadened by the recently enacted Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Additionally, many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute, some of which apply to referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third &#8209;party payor, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs in at least some cases, and do not contain safe harbors. 

The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The &#8220; qui tam &#8221; provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third &#8209;party payor and not merely a federal healthcare program. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of inadequate care, kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper promotion of off &#8209;label uses not expressly approved by FDA in a drug&#8217;s label, and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. To the extent we participate in government healthcare programs, our future activities relating to the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third party reimbursement of our products, and the sale and marketing of our products and our service arrangements or data purchases, among other activities, may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. We are unable to predict whether we would be subject to actions under the False Claims Act or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions. However, the cost of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could adversely affect our financial performance. Also, HIPAA created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and 

&#160;

willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third &#8209;party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 

In addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities in the future may be limited by, data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA and its implementing regulations established uniform standards for certain &#8220;covered entities,&#8221; which are healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, governing the conduct of specified electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly referred to as the economic stimulus package, included expansion of HIPAA&#8217;s privacy and security standards through HITECH, which became effective on February 17, 2010. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA&#8217;s privacy and security standards directly applicable to &#8220;business associates,&#8221; which are independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney&#8217;s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 

Additionally, under the federal Open Payments program, created under Section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations, manufacturers of drugs for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) must report information related to &#8220;payments or other transfers of value&#8221; made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations must report ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members. Such reports are to be made to the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, or CMS, by the 90th day following the end of each subsequent year and CMS subsequently is to publish the reported information on a publicly available website. 

There are also an increasing number of state &#8220;sunshine&#8221; laws that require manufacturers to file reports with states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities and/or register their sales representatives. Such legislation also prohibits pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing and prohibits certain other sales and marketing practices. These laws may affect our future sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities. 

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre &#8209;marketing product approvals, private qui tam actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are approved and sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post &#8209;marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti &#8209;fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 

Third &#8209;Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement 

The commercial success of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third &#8209;party payors at the federal, state and private levels. Third &#8209;party payors include 

&#160;

governmental programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care plans. These third &#8209;party payors may deny coverage or reimbursement for a product or therapy in whole or in part if they determine that the product or therapy was not medically appropriate or necessary. Also, third &#8209;party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage through the use of formularies and other cost &#8209;containment mechanisms and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments. 

The cost of pharmaceuticals and devices continues to generate substantial governmental and third &#8209;party payor interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Our results of operations and business could be adversely affected by current and future third &#8209;party payor policies as well as healthcare legislative reforms. 

Some third &#8209;party payors also require pre &#8209;approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost &#8209;containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, these requirements or any announcement or adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and to operate profitably. 

In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. 

Healthcare Reform 

In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. The Medicare Modernization Act imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand &#8209;alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for our products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the Medicare Modernization Act applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from Medicare Part D may result in a similar reduction in payments from non &#8209;governmental payors. 

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research will be developed by HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes for Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures will be made to Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness clinical trials are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor&#8217;s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third &#8209;party payors do not consider our products to be cost &#8209;effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. 

&#160;

In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which includes measures to significantly change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are the following: 

&#183; 

an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs; 

&#183; 

an increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively; 

&#183; 

a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point &#8209;of &#8209;sale discounts to negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer&#8217;s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; 

&#183; 

extension of manufacturers&#8217; Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; 

&#183; 

expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers&#8217; Medicaid rebate liability; 

&#183; 

expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; 

&#183; 

a licensure framework for follow &#8209;on biologic products; 

&#183; 

a new Patient &#8209;Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; 

&#183; 

a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; 

&#183; 

creation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs and those recommendations could have the effect of law even if Congress does not act on the recommendations (the IPAB has not yet been called upon to act as the annual determinations by the CMS Office of the Actuary have not identified a savings target for implementation in years 2015 or 2016); and 

&#183; 

establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending that began on January 1, 2011. 

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation&#8217;s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional action is taken by Congress. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other 

&#160;

healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and, accordingly, our financial operations. 

Other Regulatory Requirements 

We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on us. 

Research and Development 

We incurred research and development expenses of $8.0 million, $15.0 million and $14.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had a total of 46 full &#8209;time employees. Of these, 11 were engaged in full &#8209;time research and development activities. None of our employees are represented by a labor organization or under any collective &#8209;bargaining arrangements. We consider our employee relations to be good .
