Our Company 

&#160; 

Since July 2014, we were a diversified company engaged in hog farming, the manufacture and marketing of electro-hydraulic servo-valves and the development of optical fiber hardware and software solutions for the security and protection industry. However, in the fourth quarter of 2015, management decided to focus on our hog farming operations and sell our operations in electro-hydraulic servo-valves and optical fiber based security &#38; protection conducted through our 2 subsidiaries, Hang-ao and OV Orange, respectively. Before the end of 2015, we had disposed of our optical fiber based security &#38; protection business (OV Orange) and restructured our electro-hydraulic servo-valves business (Hang-ao) into discontinued operations. 

&#160;

Prior to July 2014, we were engaged exclusively in the business of breeding, raising, and selling hogs in the Wuhan City area of the PRC. We also distributed specialty processed black hog products under our self-developed trademark Xiduhei, through supermarkets and to restaurants, hotels and other outlets, and sold specialty processed black hog meat through the internet. We conduct our hog breeding operations through Wuhan Fengze Agricultural Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Fengze&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wuhan Aoxin Tianli Enterprise Investment Management Co., Ltd., our wholly foreign-owned enterprise, or WFOE, and its subsidiaries, Hubei Tianzhili Breeder Hog Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Tianzhili&#8221;), and Hefeng. Our efforts are focused on growing healthy, hearty hogs, including regular hogs and black hogs, for sale for breeding and meat purposes. 

&#160;

During 2014, Fengze owned and operated nine commercial farms in the Wuhan City area and one commercial farm in Enshi Autonomous Prefecture, Hubei Province. In addition, one of Fengze&#8217;s subsidiaries, Tianzhili, operates in the Enshi Autonomous Prefecture (&#8220;Enshi&#8221;). On March 22, 2014, Fengze entered into an equity purchase agreement with Tianzhili&#8217;s 40% interest holder, XMRJ LLP, to purchase the 40% interest of Tianzhili for RMB 6,666,700 or $1,083,100. As a result of this purchase, Tianzhili became Fengze&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiary. Tianzhili mainly raises and sells black hogs in conjunction with local hog farmers in Enshi. In addition, it distributes black hog meat products through supermarkets, including Zhongbai, Xinyijia and Wushang Mart, and to restaurants, hotels and other outlets in the greater Wuhan City area. 

&#160;

Prior to June 20, 2014, we controlled and consolidated the operations of Fengze through a series of contractual agreements as a variable interest entity or VIE. 

&#160;

On June 6, 2014, WFOE entered into a share purchase agreement with the principal stockholders of Fengze whereby WFOE acquired 100% of the equity of Fengze. On June 20, 2014, the Wuhan Municipal Commission of Commerce approved the ownership change and it was declared effective by the Wuhan Administrator for Industry &#38; Commerce. WFOE acquired Fengze and became the holder of 100% of the equity interest of Fengze, and Fengze effectively became the wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. 

&#160;

On June 20, 2014, WFOE, Fengze, and Fengze&#8217;s former principal stockholders entered into an agreement to terminate the Entrusted Management Agreement, Pledge of Equity Agreement, and Option Agreement made on December 1, 2009, pursuant to which WFOE previously controlled Fengze. For a description of these agreements, see &#8220;Item 13 -Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.&#8221; 

&#160;

In July 2014, our management determined to diversify our operations by acquiring various emerging high technology companies. 

&#160;

On July 15, 2014, we acquired 88% of the equity of Hubei Hang-ao Servo-valve Manufacturing Technology Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Hang-ao&#8221;), a Chinese limited liability company engaged in the manufacture and marketing of electro-hydraulic servo-valves and related servo systems and components located in Xiangyang, Hubei Province, from the former owners of Hang-ao, for consideration of $9,055,605, including RMB 42 million or approximately $6.8 million in cash and 1,047,000 of our common shares. The acquisition agreement includes a three year &#8220;earn out payment&#8221; provision which requires Hang-ao to reach certain levels of net income for the years 2014, 2015, and 2016 for the sellers to retain the 1,047,000 common shares. The target net incomes are RMB 4.5 million ($733,000), RMB 9 million ($1.5 million), and RMB 15 million ($2.4 million) for the years 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. On November 11, 2014, we sold 100% of the equity of Hang-ao&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Beijing Sanqiang Tongwei Electromechanical Hydraulic Technology Development Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Sanqiang&#8221;) to Mr. Fawei Qiu, who previously held 12% of the equity of Hang-ao, for RMB 24 million or $3,906,759 in cash. Since Aoxin Tianli acquired Hang-ao, Hang-ao reported net income of $1,015,128 for its operations in 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Hang-ao reported a net loss of $287,609. According to the earn out payment term in Hang-ao&#8217;s acquisition agreement dated July 15, 2014, if Hang-ao incurred a net loss during any of 2014, 2015 or 2016, part of the acquisition consideration, 1,047,000 Aoxin Tianli common shares, will be fully cancelled. As a result of Hang-ao&#8217;s 2015 net loss from its operations, the 1,047,000 common shares of Aoxin Tianli may be cancelled by the Company.

&#160;

On August 26, 2014, we acquired 95% of the equity of Wuhan Optical Valley Orange Technology Co., Ltd. (&#8220;OV Orange&#8221;), a corporation organized under the laws of the People&#8217;s Republic of China focused on delivering next-generation optical fiber hardware and software solutions for the security and protection industry located in Wuhan, from the former owners of OV Orange, for 2,552,000 of our common shares, valued at $4,976,400. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, 403,000 of those shares, which were to be issued to Mr. Hai Liu, CEO of OV Orange and the former beneficial owner of 7,500,000 (representing 15% of the outstanding) OV Orange shares, were deposited in escrow (the &#8220;Escrow Shares&#8221;), subject to the attainment by OV Orange of certain agreed upon net profit targets for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016. Specifically, Mr. Liu will be entitled to the Escrow Shares only if OV Orange achieves net profits equal to not less than 90% of RMB 2.6 million, RMB 6.8 million and RMB 10.5 million for the years ending December 31, 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. If the net profits of OV Orange in any of the three target years are less than 90% of the target, the number of Escrow Shares to be issued to Mr. Liu will be reduced in accordance with a formula set forth in the acquisition agreement. 

&#160;

If the net profit targets set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement are achieved for all three years Mr. Liu and Mr. Jin Wu, the record holder of 806,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock issued in exchange for 30% of the OV Orange shares, shall have the right to exchange shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock received in the acquisition for up to 7,500,000 and 15,000,000 shares, respectively, of OV Orange purchased by the Company during the three month period (the &#8220;Option Period&#8221;) commencing March 16 and terminating June 15, 2017. The ratio at which the OV Orange shares may be acquired by Mr. Liu or Mr. Wu is based upon the relative fair market values of the shares of the Company and OV Orange at the time of the re-purchase, except that if the value of the shares of the Company issued to Mr. Liu or Mr. Wu is less than the value of the shares of OV Orange he is entitled to receive, he can receive all of the OV Orange shares by delivering all of his Company shares but no additional consideration will be given to him. 

&#160;

As a result of the completion of the transaction, OV Orange became a 95% owned subsidiary of the Company, with the remaining 5% equity interest owned by Hubei Aoxin Science &#38; Technology Group Co. Ltd., a company whose Chairman and principal shareholder is Ping Wang, the Company&#8217;s former Chairman and CEO. As a result of its acquisition of 1,075,000 common shares of the Company in exchange for the 22,500,000 (representing 40% of the outstanding) OV Orange shares pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement and its purchase from the Company of an additional 3,000,000 common shares on August 21, 2014 for a purchase price of $7,200,000, or $2.40 per share, Hubei Aoxin Science &#38; Technology Group Co. Ltd. owns a total of 4,075,000 common shares, representing approximately 14.68% of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common shares. 

&#160;

On November 12, 2014, we sold 100% of the equity of OV Orange&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Wuhan Orange Optical Networking Technology Development Co., Ltd., to Mr. Deming Liu and Hubei Aoxin Science and Technology Group Co., Ltd., for RMB 1,000,000, or $161,030 in cash. 

&#160;

As mentioned above, we determined to sell Hang-ao and OV Orange during the fourth quarter of 2015. Subsequently, on November 13, 2015 and December 29, 2015, the Company entered into equity transfer agreements for the sale of its 88% equity interest in Hang-ao and 95% equity interest in OV Orange for a purchase price of RMB 48.4 million ($7.5 million) and RMB 47.5 million ($7.3 million), respectively. The equity transfer agreement for the sale of OV Orange was completed with the former shareholders of OV Orange, Mr. Jin Wu, Ms. Lina Deng, and Mr. Deming Liu. On December 25, 2015, the Company terminated the equity transfer agreement entered into on November 13, 2015 for the sale of its 88% equity interest in Hang-ao due to the inability to obtain proper land use permits and deeds for its properties. The Company will keep seeking for other opportunities to sell its equity in Hang-ao As a consequence of the sale of OV Orange and our intention to sell Hang-ao, the results of operations of Hang-ao and OV Orange were reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements.

Our current corporate structure is as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; 

Hog Farming Business 

Fengze entered the hog breeding and production business in 2005 when it built its first hog farm. Fengze now currently owns and operates seven commercial farms in Wuhan and one farm in Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture of Hubei Province. Our farms, in the aggregate, have an annual production capacity of approximately 130,000 hogs. We conduct genetic, breeding and nutrition research to improve our hog production capabilities. Our animal nutrition research consists of the development of a premix we feed our hogs. In coordination with a local institute, we developed this product to improve our feed to meat conversion ratio, thus reducing our feed costs, and to improve the health of our hogs. 

&#160; 

Beginning in the second quarter of 2013, we also started to market and distribute fresh black hog meat products through supermarkets and to hotels, restaurants and other retailers. In July 2014, we initiated sales of specialty processed black hog meat through the internet. We market our fresh black hog meat products through Hubei Tianzhili Breeder Hog Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Tianzhili&#8221;), a wholly owned subsidiary of WFOE, and use a self-developed trademark, Xiduhei. 

&#160; 

We believe we have developed a reputation for quality in our market by investing in high quality breeding stock and in technology to improve the health of our hogs by, for example, using temperature controls to increase comfort and to speed piglet rearing, and by creating a biofeed premix that has improved our success in growing hogs while reducing costs. We believe we have a reputation for low pollution by virtue of receiving a certificate of pollution-free agricultural product from Hubei province. We believe we have a reputation for low-additive pork products as a result of the use of our biofeed premix, which allows us to reduce our reliance on antibiotics, and by efforts we have undertaken to reduce disease risks among our hogs without relying upon chemicals, such as maintaining geographic separation between our farms to prevent cross-contamination. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Contents 

&#160; 

In an effort to significantly increase the scale of our operations, in 2012 we concluded a series of agreements (the &#8220;Exclusivity Agreements&#8221;) with the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau of Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture of Hubei Province, the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau of Xianfeng County of Hubei Province, the Xuwang Hog Farming Professional Cooperatives of Xianfeng County, and the Qiming Hog Farming Professional Cooperatives of Xianfeng County, whereby we were granted the exclusive right to breed and sell Enshi black hogs in Enshi Autonomous Prefecture in Hubei Province. The agreements call for the joint development, funding and operation of local cooperatives in the Enshi Autonomous Prefecture in Hubei Province whereby the Company, the relevant governmental agencies and the cooperatives will assist participating farmers to breed and raise Enshi black hogs which will be purchased by the Company for resale as meat hogs or retained or sold as breeders at the Company&#8217;s discretion. If successfully implemented, this program should allow us to profit from the black hogs grown by the participating farmers who will be obligated to purchase feed, vaccines and other supplies from us and then sell us their hogs at a price which is comparable to the costs at which we currently grow our own hogs. 

The Exclusivity Agreements envision that we will work with the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureaus of Xianfeng County and Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, respectively, to develop a regional breeding and distribution program whereby local farmers will be trained and supervised by us, the relevant governmental agencies and their cooperatives in raising a breed of black hogs genetically developed and monitored by us with the approval of the local government agency. By the end of the first quarter of 2014 we had funded and completed the construction of 798 farms for local farmers. Achievement of any of the program&#8217;s goals and the need for financing are dependent upon the participation, cooperation and skills of local farmers. Given the long term of this project, it is likely that there will be continued negotiation of various issues that arise during the life of the project. After providing the financing necessary for completion of the construction for 798 farms, we decided to temporarily stop providing capital to the program and focus on our black hog retail operations. 

China&#8217;s Hog Industry 

China&#8217;s hog industry is in the midst of a transition from a large number of relatively small farms, to larger, more commercial farms. Meat hog production in the PRC is currently dominated by backyard farms (those that sell 5-10 hogs annually) and small farms (those that sell less than 100 hogs annually). We believe that farms that sell less than 100 hogs per year comprise approximately 75% of the hog farms in China and account for approximately one-third of the hogs sold annually in China. Farms that sell between 100 and 500 head a year account for approximately 21% of China&#8217;s hog farms and approximately one-third of the hogs sold annually in China. Farms that sell between 500 and 3,000 hogs annually represent less than 3% of China&#8217;s hog farms but account for approximately 19% of the hogs sold in China. Those that sell more than 3,000 hogs annually account for less than one-half of one percent of all hog farms but sell more than 15% of China&#8217;s hogs annually. 

According to the USDA, China&#8217;s hog industry is transitioning toward larger commercial farms partly as a result of government policies and incentives. We believe that the Company is well positioned to benefit from this trend. 

Our Geographic Market 

Our farms are located in Wuhan City, which is the capital of and largest city in Hubei Province. With a population of nearly 10 million, Wuhan City is one of China&#8217;s ten largest cities, and is considered an important center for economy, trade, finance, transportation, information technology and education in Central China. Wuhan City is located less than 800 miles from Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Chongqing and Xi&#8217;an, some of China&#8217;s largest cities. Hubei Province includes thirteen cities that range in population from approximately 300,000 to nearly 10 million residents. 

&#160; 

Due to its central location, Hubei is well-known in China for the adaptability of its breeder hogs. Breeder hogs from the southern part of China tend to not tolerate the cold weather in northern China; similarly, breeder hogs from the northern part of China tend not to tolerate the heat of southern China. We have found that breeder hogs raised in Hubei tend to adapt well to variations in both north and south of China. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Contents 

&#160; 

Wuhan City&#8217;s government was one of the first local governments to provide economic incentives to hog farms that reached certain production levels. Farms located within Wuhan Area that reach an annual production capacity of 10,000 hogs are eligible for a one-time grant of RMB 1.5 million (approximately $230,000). When a farm reaches an annual capacity of 20,000 hogs, it is eligible for a grant of RMB 3 million (approximately $460,000), less any grant it received when its capacity reached 10,000 hogs. 

&#160; 

Breeder Hogs and Market Hogs 

&#160; 

We utilize a variety of purebred hogs at our farms. The primary purebred varieties that we utilize are the Yorkshire, Landrace and Duroc. We breed both purebred and cross-bred hogs in order to attain what we feel are the most desirable traits in the hogs produced in our farms. 

&#160; 

In 2015 and 2014, 19% of our hog revenues were derived from regular breeder hog sales, 43% were from regular market hog sales. In 2015, we generated 32%, 2%, and 4% of our revenues from black market hogs, black breeder hogs, and processed black pork products. In 2014, 33%, 2%, and 3% of our revenues were from black market hogs, black breeder hogs, and processed black pork products. Breeder hogs are sold to other hog farms throughout China for use in their reproductive programs, and used in our own farms as breeder sows. We prefer to sell hogs as breeders, as they command a higher price and are sold when they are younger and have consumed less feed and other resources, leading to a higher profit margin than market hogs. Breeder hogs weigh approximately 110 &#8211; 120 pounds at the time of sale while market hogs weigh about 220 &#8211; 240 pounds. 

&#160; 

Male hogs are nearly always sold as market hogs as substantially fewer boars are required than sows for breeding purposes. Female hogs that do not meet breeder hog standards are also sold as market hogs. 

Our Breeding Efforts 

&#160; 

A key element of breeding hogs is to utilize sows which are most likely to give birth frequently to large, healthy litters that display the attributes that customers prefer. As a result, we genetically catalogue our sows, so that we can identify purebred and first-cross hogs to maintain our purebred nucleus herd for fidelity to breed standards and to develop the most favorable parent line sows and boars for commercial market hog production. 

&#160; 

We screen all potential breeders for favorable qualities. We rely on a combination of performance data and visual appraisals of breeder hogs for selection purposes. We index purebred sows monthly and select the top 20% to maintain our nucleus herd. Having established the baseline herd level, we experiment with combinations of boars and sows to continue to improve the characteristics of our hogs. 

&#160; 

In addition to selecting the most favorable breeding stock, we constantly monitor our breeding sows and replace any that have disease related problems or that display other unfavorable breeding characteristics. A quality sow can give birth for 3 to 4 years, and can give birth 6 to 8.5 times during her life typically to a litter of 10-12 piglets each time. If a sow consistently gives birth to small litters, we remove it from the breeding stock. Likewise, if a sow repeatedly fails to get pregnant during fertile periods or displays false pregnancy (a condition that can last for up to two months) we will remove it from the breeding herd and replace it with a more productive sow. 

&#160; 

Our Premix 

&#160; 

We believe one of the most challenging issues in the hog production industry is the growing variety and variability of swine diseases. Many hog farms manage diseases through the use of antibiotic drugs. In addition to administering antibiotics directly, many commercial hog farms also use antibiotics in premix feed, without regard to whether particular hogs require treatment. Heavy use of these drugs in China has resulted in pork with drug residues and excess levels of heavy metals and other contaminants. 

&#160; 

We seek to avoid the use of what we view as excessive amounts of antibiotics in our hogs. After years of research and development in cooperation with our consultant, Professor Ming Li of Central China Normal University, we have developed our own premix, which we use instead of commercially available biofeed premixes. Our premix contains no antibiotics and, according to testing by Hubei Province Import and Export Commodity Inspection and Quarantine Bureau, our pork products test negative for drug residues and meet the industry limits for heavy metals. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Contents 

&#160; 

By developing our own premix, we reduced our feed costs. Our premix adds live microbes to swine feed, which we believe result in better absorption of feed and a generally healthier intestinal system. Better absorption of feed results in lower waste and we believe that we have realized a 10% to 12% reduction in feed costs as a result. In addition, because these bacteria improve the hogs&#8217; health, we have seen savings on drug costs of approximately RMB 10 (approximately $1.50) per hog. 

&#160; 

Our Retailing Efforts 

&#160; 

Starting in 2013, we expanded our operations to include retail sales of our boxed fresh black hog meat through facilities we maintain at supermarkets and to hotels, restaurants and other retailers. More recently we initiated sales of specialty processed black hog meat through the internet. We sell our products under our &#8220;Xiduhei&#8221; trademark through more than 8 supermarkets in Wuhan City and over 4 direct sale outlets. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our sales and marketing force consisted of approximately 38 and 60 employees in Wuhan City. Our direct sales force is also supplemented by independent distributors, sales representatives and agents. 

Our Hog Farms 

&#160; 

Fengze built its first hog farm in 2005. At present, we, through Fengze, operate five hog farms with an annual capacity of 20,000 hogs each and three hog farms with an annual capacity of 10,000 hogs each. 

Each of our hog farms is designed to raise hogs from breeding through preparation for sale as breeder or market hogs. While there are differences among our farms, they follow the same basic organizational model, with separate buildings dedicated to sow operations, nursery operations and finishing operations. In addition to these specific functional buildings, our farms also feature housing for some of our farmers for the benefit of our farm operations. To minimize the risk of contamination, access to our farms is very limited to outsiders, including Company staff. To limit the number of personnel that enter our farms, and thus the risk of contamination, we provide on-site housing to a large portion of our farm employees. 

&#160; 

Each farm has a farm manager who is responsible for monitoring animal care, animal health and equipment. Specialized crews trained in moving hogs assist with the loading, unloading, health care and sanitation for each unit. 

Servo-Valves Business 

We operate our electro-hydraulic servo-valves business through our 88% owned subsidiary, Hubei Hang-ao Servo-valve Manufacturing Technology Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Hang-ao&#8221;), which we acquired in July 2014. Hang-ao, established in January 2013, is the largest privately-owned electro-hydraulic servo-valve manufacturer in Hubei Province. Electro-hydraulic servo-valves are extensively used in metallurgical machinery, engineering machinery, aviation, numerically-controlled machine tools, thermal power, military projects, petrochemical engineering, plastic products, experimental apparatus and other critical performance devices. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we determined to focus our resources on the development of our operations in the hog farming industry. Consequently, we sought to sell Hang-ao and OV Orange. On November 13, 2015, the Company entered into an equity transfer agreement for the sale of its 88% equity interest in Hang-ao for a purchase price of RMB 48.4 million ($7.5 million). On December 25, 2015, the Company terminated the equity transfer agreement entered into on November 13, 2015 for the sale of its 88% equity interest in Hang-ao due to the inability to obtain proper land use permits and deeds for its properties.

Our Strategies 

We plan to enhance our position as one of Wuhan&#8217;s largest hog farming companies. We intend to achieve this goal by implementing the following strategies: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

We plan to increase hog production quality and capacity by continuing to upgrade our genetic breeding base. We plan to purchase and import purebred hogs to improve the genetic strength and diversity of our breeding pool, increasing our ability to maintain quality purebred stock within our breeding operations. This will enable us to breed superior breeding hogs that can be used in our operations or sold to other breeder farms, resulting in improved margins. 

&#183; 

We intend to develop our sow replacement program to continually replace less-productive sows with more productive ones. It requires significant effort to identify, track and measure the attributes of our breeder hogs. We have found that the more data we capture, the greater the rewards of our breeding program and the more successful we are in implementing sow replacement strategies, with resulting improvement in operations. 

Customers 

Our main customers for breeder hogs consist of farmers who purchase for their own accounts and brokers who sell the hogs to other hog farms and our main customers for market hogs include slaughterhouses and brokers who sell the hogs to slaughterhouses. In 2015 and 2014, none of our customers accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues or segment revenues. 

Sales and Marketing 

Purchasers come to our farms to purchase breeder and market hogs. The purchasers of breeder hogs consist of farmers who purchase for their own accounts and brokers who sell the hogs to other hog farms. The purchasers of market hogs include slaughterhouses and brokers who sell the hogs to slaughterhouses. Purchases are paid for at the time of the sale. Purchasers are responsible for transporting hogs from our farms. In this way, we have been able to reduce our transportation costs and risks associated with delivering hogs. Return of product is not permitted. 

Because we have primarily relied upon having purchasers come to our farms, to date our expenditures on marketing and advertising have not been significant. If our capacity should grow or we should otherwise determine it is in our interests to do so, we may rely more upon advertising and marketing in the future and our expenditures for such efforts will increase. 

Principal Suppliers 

The following are the principal suppliers we rely upon to obtain raw materials for hog feed and veterinary supplies. We believe the materials provided by these suppliers are widely available and do not anticipate that we would be unable to obtain these materials from other suppliers in the event they are unable or unwilling to supply our needs. 

Supplier 

&#160; Item

&#160; Feed supplies (corn, beans, bran and other commodities) 

Purchases from Wuhan Zhu Brothers Feed Technology Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Wuhan Zhu Brothers&#8221;) accounted for approximately 33% and 39% of our inventory purchases for our hog businesses in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Purchases from Wuhan Jintudi Feed Co. (&#8220;Jintudi&#8221;), Ltd. and Wuhan Yukang Food Oil and Feed Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Yukang&#8221;) in 2015 accounted for 7% and 10%, respectively, of our inventory purchases, as compared to 7% and 14%, respectively, of our 2014 inventory purchases. Purchases from Wuhan Maozhu Agritech Research Co., Ltd. accounted for approximately 36% and 23% of our inventory purchases during 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Research and Development 

We focus our research and development efforts on improving the genetic composition of our hogs and the quality of the feed provided to the hogs. As of December 31, 2015, our research and development team consisted of 33 employees who also participate in general administrative functions. In addition, some of our operating employees regularly participate in our research and development programs. 

In the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we spent $61,552 and $65,465, respectively, on research and development activities. 

Competition 

We compete based on the price and quality of our products, especially as it pertains to breeder hogs 

We believe that Wuhan has 75 farms with annual production capacities of at least 10,000 hogs and, of these, 21 farms have annual production capacities of at least 20,000 hogs. Inclusive of the farms in Wuhan, we believe that Hubei province has approximately 439 hog farms with annual production capacities of 10,000 or more hogs. We believe our annual capacity of approximately 130,000 hogs and our black hog production program makes us one of Hubei province&#8217;s largest hog farming companies. 

Regulation 

Restriction on Foreign Ownership 

The principal regulation governing foreign ownership of businesses in the PRC is the Foreign Investment Industrial Guidance Catalogue, effective December 11, 2007 (the &#8220;Catalogue&#8221;). The Catalogue classifies various industries into four categories: encouraged, permitted, restricted and prohibited. Hog farming is an encouraged industry. Such a designation offers businesses distinct advantages. For example, businesses engaged in encouraged industries: 

&#183; 

are not subject to restrictions on foreign investment, and, as such, foreigners can own a majority in Sino-foreign joint ventures or establish wholly-owned foreign enterprises in the PRC; 

&#183; 

with total investment of less than $100 million, are subject to regional (not central) government examination and approval which are generally more efficient and less time-consuming; and 

&#183; 

may import certain equipment while enjoying a tariff and import-stage value-added tax exemption. 

The National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce periodically jointly revise the Catalogue. As such, there is a possibility that our company&#8217;s business may fall outside the scope of the definition of an encouraged industry in the future. Should this occur, we would no longer benefit from such designation. 

Taxation and Subsidies 

&#160; 

The PRC government has provided tax incentives and subsidies to domestic companies in our industries to encourage the development of agricultural and high technology businesses in China. We have received business tax exemptions or reductions, subsidies, and government incentives in connection with Fengze&#8217;s ownership of hog farms and WFOE&#8217;s management of those operations. Both Fengze and WFOE were exempted from income taxes for 2015 and prior years. 

The PRC government authorities may reduce or eliminate these incentives through new legislation or other regulatory actions at any time in the future. In the event that we are no longer exempt from income taxation, our applicable tax rate would increase from 0% to up to 25%, the standard business income tax rate in the PRC.

Regulation of Foreign Currency Exchange and Dividend Distribution 

Foreign Currency Exchange. The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations (1996), as amended, and the Administration Rules of the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange (1996). Under these regulations, Renminbi are freely convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not for most capital account items, such as direct investment, loans, repatriation of investment and investment in securities outside China, unless the prior approval of SAFE or its local counterpart is obtained. In addition, any loans to an operating subsidiary in China that is a foreign invested enterprise, cannot, in the aggregate, exceed the difference between its respective approved total investment amount and its respective approved registered capital amount. Furthermore, any foreign loan must be registered with SAFE or its local counterparts for the loan to be valid. Any increase in the amount of the total investment and registered capital must be approved by the PRC Ministry of Commerce or its local counterpart. We may not be able to obtain these government approvals or registrations on a timely basis, if at all, which could result in a delay in the process of making loans to our subsidiaries. 

Dividend Distribution. The principal regulations governing the distribution of dividends by foreign holding companies include the Foreign Investment Enterprise Law (1986), as amended, and the Administrative Rules under the Foreign Investment Enterprise Law (2001). 

Under these regulations, foreign investment enterprises in China may pay dividends only out of their retained profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, foreign investment enterprises in China are required to allocate at least 10% of their respective retained profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds unless these reserves have reached 50% of the registered capital of the enterprise. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. 

Notice 75. On October 21, 2005, SAFE issued Notice 75, which became effective as of November 1, 2005. According to Notice 75, prior registration with the local SAFE branch is required for PRC residents to establish or to control an offshore company for the purposes of financing that offshore company with assets or equity interests in an enterprise located in the PRC. An amendment to registration or filing with the local SAFE branch by such PRC resident is also required for the injection of equity interests or assets of an onshore enterprise in the offshore company or overseas funds raised by such offshore company, or any other material change involving a change in the capital of the offshore company. 

Under the relevant rules, failure to comply with the registration procedures set forth in Notice 75 may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant onshore company, including the increase of its registered capital, the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent or affiliate and capital inflow from the offshore entity, and may also subject relevant PRC residents to penalties under PRC foreign exchange administration regulations. 

PRC residents who control our company are required to register with SAFE in connection with their investments in us. Such individuals began this registration process on March 8, 2010. If we use our stock or other equity interest to purchase the assets or equity interest of a PRC company owned by PRC residents in the future, such PRC residents will be subject to the registration procedures described in Notice 75. 

New M &#38; A Regulations and Overseas Listings. On August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including the Ministry of Commerce, the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration for Taxation, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, CSRC and SAFE, jointly issued Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the New M&#38;A Rule, which became effective on September 8, 2006. This New M&#38;A Rule, among other things, includes provisions that purport to require that an offshore special purpose vehicle formed for purposes of overseas listing of equity interests in PRC companies and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals obtain the approval of CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle&#8217;s securities on an overseas stock exchange. 

On September 21, 2006, CSRC published on its official website procedures regarding its approval of overseas listings by special purpose vehicles. The CSRC approval procedures require the filing of a number of documents with the CSRC and it would take several months to complete the approval process. The application of this new PRC regulation remains unclear with no consensus currently existing among leading PRC law firms regarding the scope or the applicability of the CSRC approval requirement.

Regulations on Offshore Parent Holding Companies&#8217; Direct Investment in and Loans to Their PRC Subsidiaries. An offshore company may invest equity in a PRC company which will become the PRC subsidiary of the offshore holding company after investment. Such equity investment is subject to a series of laws and regulations generally applicable to any foreign-invested enterprise in China, which include the Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Contractual Joint Venture Enterprise Law, all as amended from time to time, and their respective implementing rules; the Tentative Provisions on the Foreign Exchange Registration Administration of Foreign-Invested Enterprise; and the Notice on Certain Matters Relating to the Change of Registered Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises. 

Under the aforesaid laws and regulations, the increase of the registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise is subject to the prior approval of the authority which approved the initial investment. In addition, the increase in registered capital and the total investment amount must both be registered with SAIC and SAFE. 

Shareholder loans made by offshore parent holding companies to their PRC subsidiaries are regarded as foreign debts in China for regulatory purposes which are subject to a number of PRC laws and regulations, including the PRC Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations, the Interim Measures on Administration on Foreign Debts, the Tentative Provisions on the Statistics Monitoring of Foreign Debts and the Administration Rules on the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange. 

Under these regulations, shareholder loans made by offshore parent holding companies to their PRC subsidiaries are to be registered with SAFE. Furthermore, the total amount of foreign debts that can be incurred by such PRC subsidiaries, including any shareholder loans, shall not exceed the difference between the total investment amount and the registered capital amount of the PRC subsidiaries, both of which are subject to governmental approval. 

Intellectual Property Rights 

Trademarks. The PRC has domestic laws for the protection of rights in copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets. The PRC is also a signatory to all of the world&#8217;s major intellectual property conventions, including: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Convention establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO Convention) (June 4, 1980); 

&#183; 

Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (March 19, 1985); 

&#183; 

Patent Cooperation Treaty (January 1, 1994); and 

&#183; 

The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) (November 11, 2001). 

The PRC Trademark Law, adopted in 1982 and revised in 2001, and implementation rules adopted in 2002, protect registered trademarks. The Trademark Office of the State Administration of Industry and Commerce (&#8220;SAIC&#8221;) handles trademark registrations and grants trademark registrations for a term of ten years. 

We, through Fengze, have used &#8220;Hanxi&#8221; for years on swine products. In 2009, Fengze applied for and registered &#8220;Hanxi&#8221; as a trademark with China&#8217;s SAIC Trademark Office, in Class No. 31, which relates to live animals, live poultry, live fish, trees, cereals, plants, fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, fodder and crustaceans. The registration is valid from April 21, 2009 to April 20, 2019. As a registered trademark &#8220;Hanxi&#8221; is exclusively owned by Fengze for products within the range limited by Class No. 31; any identical or similar trademark may not be used on commodities involved in Class No. 31. Fengze does not currently own any trademark on &#8220;Hanxi&#8221; outside of Class No. 31. In the event of trademark infringement, the SAIC has the authority to fine the infringer and to confiscate or destroy the infringing products. In addition to actions taken by SAIC, Fengze would be entitled to sue an infringer for compensation.

On August 1 and August 30, 2011, we entered into a collaborative agreement and a supplemental agreement (the &#8220;Agreements&#8221;) with An Puluo Food Processing Co., Ltd. (&#8220;An Puluo&#8221;) to pursue retail business. Pursuant to the Agreements we were allowed to apply to register &#8220;Tianli An Puluo&#8221; as an exclusive trademark with China&#8217;s SAIC Trademark Office and began to use &#8220;Tianli An Puluo&#8221; at our retail sales departments in local major supermarkets in greater Wuhan City. After we terminated the collaborative agreement with An Puluo, we registered a new trademark to market our fresh black hog meat, &#8220;Xiduhei.&#8221; 

We hold 7 Chinese patents through our 88% owned subsidiary, Hang-ao (Patent Nos. ZL 2011 2 0360507.X, ZL 2012 2 0361072.0 and ZL 2012 2 0360508.4 were issued on May 30, 2012; Patent Nos. ZL 2011 2 0360512.0, ZL 2011 2 0360511.6 and ZL 2011 2 0360510.1 were issued on May 23, 2012 and Patent No. ZL 2011 2 0301607.5 was issued on April 25, 2012.) These patents cover innovative production techniques and were issued by the State Intellectual Property Office of the People&#8217;s Republic of China. Under the PRC patent laws, the patents give us the exclusive right to use the patented process or product for a period of ten years. 

Business Trade Secrets. We have not applied for any patent protection for our premix; however, we rely on Chinese business secret laws to protect our interest in this premix. 

Our premix was developed in conjunction with Professor Ming Li of China Central Normal University. In return for providing financial and other support to Professor Li&#8217;s research, Professor Li assigned the rights to the results of his research and development (specifically, the premix) to us. In connection with this assignment, Professor Li agreed to protect the secrecy of our premix formula and to indemnify us against any damages caused if he discloses that information to third parties. 

In addition to the terms under which we obtained rights to the premix, we have taken a number of measures to maintain the premix as a business secret under Chinese law. 

Notwithstanding these measures, if we are required to sue to protect our rights in the premix, the ultimate determination of whether the premix constitutes a business secret protected under Chinese law will be made on the facts of the case itself. We cannot guarantee that we will be found to have a business secret or that any court will protect our rights in the premix formula. 

Stringent Environmental Regulations. Our operations and properties are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent laws and regulations pertaining to, among other things, the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes (including solid and hazardous wastes) or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. 

Fengze has incurred, and we will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations. We typically expend approximately $150,000 or more to construct hog waste systems at each hog farm we build and there are also ongoing expenses to comply with environmental regulations. If we were to build a farm, or purchase a farm without the necessary waste equipment, we would expect to spend $150,000 or more in connection with such farm for environmental compliance purposes in addition to ongoing maintenance. 

Regulation of the Hog Farming Industry. The hog farming industry in the PRC is regulated by a number of governmental agencies, including the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Health, the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, and the State Environmental Protection Administration. These regulatory bodies have broad discretion and authority to regulate many aspects of the hog farming industry in the PRC, including, without limitation, setting hygiene and quality standards. In addition, the regulatory framework in the PRC is evolving. If the relevant regulatory authorities set standards with which we are unable to comply or which increase our costs so as to render our products non-competitive, our profitability and our ability to sell products in the PRC may be impacted. 

Each province in the PRC requires hog farmers to obtain and maintain a license for each hog farm owned and operated in that province. Currently, all of our hog farms are located in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, and we have obtained a license to own and operate each of our hog farms. We need to maintain our licenses to operate our current hog farms. If we pursue acquisitions of other hog farms, we will need to obtain additional licenses to operate those farms.

Employees 

As of March 18, 2016 we had approximately 310 employees, all of whom were based in China. Of these employees, 29 were in management and administration in our headquarters. 

Hog Farming Segment 

As of March 18, 2016 we had approximately 233 employees in our hog farming operations; 8 were farm managers, 13 served as deputy farm managers, 32 were in technical support (including the research and development staff, and veterinarians located on the farms), and 180 were in farming and sales. 

Retail Segment 

As of March 18, 2016 we had approximately 38 employees in our black hog retail operations. Of these employees, 3 were in management and administration and 35 were in sales. 

We believe that our relations with our employees are good. We have never had a work stoppage, and our employees are not subject to a collective bargaining agreement. For our employees in China, we are required to contribute a portion of their total salaries to the Chinese government&#8217;s social insurance funds, including medical insurance, unemployment insurance and job injuries insurance, as well as a housing assistance fund, in accordance with relevant regulations. We expect the amount of our contribution to the government&#8217;s social insurance funds to increase in the future as we expand our workforce and operations.
