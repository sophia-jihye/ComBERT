 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Back to Table of Contents 

Overview

Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Emerald Medical Applications Ltd., was organized as a privately-owned company under the laws of the State of Israel on February 17, 2010. Emerald is digital health startup company engaged in the development, sale and service of imaging solutions utilizing its proprietary DermaCompare software that it developed for use in derma imaging and analytics (&#34;DermaCompare&#34;). Emerald believes that its proprietary DermaCompare software represents an advancement in skin cancer screening that should enable physicians to more readily identify and monitor changes in their patients&#8217; skin characteristics. 

&#160; 

Emerald&#8217;s DermaCompare solution allows dermatologists and other medical care professionals, using a set of 25 total body photography (&#34;TBP&#34;), to capture sets of skin lesion images with, among other devices, digital cameras, camera-equipped smart phones or tablets. These images are then transmitted online and are remotely analyzed by professionals using our DermaCompare software. 

&#160; 

Our sales and marketing plan, which has already commenced, is to sell licenses for our DermaCompare imaging software to: NHSs, HMOs, health insurance companies, hospitals and medical clinics through distributers, health care channel partners or directly through independent salespersons and/or web purchase to dermatologists and other physicians (GPs) that we expect to purchase licenses based on the number of potential numbers of patients. 

In furtherance of our business plan, which has resulted in us becoming an operating company, Emerald has entered into a series of agreements with unaffiliated third parties for the distribution of its DermaCompare Technology, as follows: 1. On August 12, 2013, Emerald entered into an exclusive distribution with Derma Italy Sri, organized under the laws of the Italy (&#34;Derma Italy&#34;), pursuant to which Derma Italy was granted exclusive distribution rights in Italy; 2. On December 1, 2013, Emerald entered into a distribution agreement with S. Bokhorst - Creatiekracht, organized under the laws of the Netherlands, pursuant to which S. Bokhorst was granted exclusive distribution in the Netherlands; 3. On February 6, 2014, Emerald entered into a distribution agreement with Medical Edge Pty Ltd, organized under the laws of Australia (&#34;Medical Edge&#34;), pursuant to which Medical Edge was granted exclusive distribution rights in the markets of Australia, New Zealand and Oceania; 4. On January 14, 2015, Emerald entered into a Project Agreement with Realize S.A. and Ubitech, entities engaged in IT related to medical technology in Greece, and MEDISP and MPUoP, academic and research institutes in Greece (collectively, the &#34;Greek Partners&#34;). Emerald and the Greek Partners anticipate imminent grants from the Office of Chief Scientist of the State of Israel and the General Secretariat for Research and Technology of Greece, respectively, the proceeds of which will be used for development of enhanced smartphone applications for diagnosis of early stage Melanoma.

Utilizing capital raised prior to and subsequent to the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement, Emerald completed the development of a commercial model of its DermaCompare Product and has commenced marketing efforts. Emerald is continuing to negotiate additional distribution agreements for territories including North America, Latin America, Southern Africa, Israel and elsewhere in Europe, among other countries and regions. We believe to generate revenues from our DermaCompare Technology during the first half of fiscal 2016. Emerald is continuing to work on development of the &#34;next generation&#34; DermaCompare Technology, with enhanced features.

Notwithstanding our belief that DermaCompare represents a significant advance on existing technologies, there are a number of potential difficulties that we might face, including the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; We may not be able to raise sufficient additional funds to fully implement our business plan; &#160; &#9679; Competitors may develop alternatives that render our DermaCompare software solution redundant or unnecessary; &#160; &#9679; We may not obtain and maintain sufficient protection of our intellectual property; &#160; &#9679; Our DermaCompare software may be shown to have characteristics that indicate it may be ineffective; &#160; &#9679; Our DermaCompare may not be accepted by physicians including dermatologists and the medical community in general; and &#160; &#9679; Strict government regulations and inappropriate reimbursement policies, especially in emerging economies, may hinder the growth of the dermatology device market. &#160; 

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we raised $989,974 in equity and debt capital and we may be expected to require up to an additional $1.5 million in capital during the next 12 months to fully implement our business plan and fund our operations. 

&#160; 

Overview of Melanoma 

&#160; 

Melanoma is a type of skin cancer which forms from melanocytes (pigment-containing cells in the skin), is very aggressive cancer and, at present, there is no cure for Melanoma. 

&#160; 

In women, the most common location is the legs. Melanomas in men are most commonly located on the back. It is particularly common among Caucasians, especially northern Europeans and northwestern Europeans, as well as those living in sunny climates. Melanoma rates are higher in Oceania, North America, Europe, Southern Africa, and Latin America. This geographic pattern reflects the primary cause of Melanoma, ultraviolet light (UV) exposure in conjunction with the amount of skin pigmentation in the population. Melanocytes produce the dark pigment, melanin, which is responsible for the color of skin. These cells predominantly occur in skin, but are also found in other parts of the body, including the bowel and the eye. Melanoma can originate in any part of the body that contains melanocytes. 

&#160; 

The treatment includes surgical removal of the tumor. If Melanoma is detected early, while it is still relatively small and thin in depth, and provided that it is timely removed or otherwise treated, the cure rates are very high. The likelihood that the Melanoma will reoccur or spread depends on how deeply it has penetrated into the layers of the skin. For Melanomas that come back or spread, treatments include chemo- and immunotherapy and/or radiation therapy. According to National Cancer Institute statistics, the survival rates in the US after five years are is on average 91%. 

&#160; 

While Melanoma is less common than other types of skin cancer, it is far more serious if it is not detected in its early stages. Melanoma causes the vast majority of deaths related to skin cancer. Globally, in 2012, that most recent year for which statistics have been reported, Melanoma occurred in 232,000 people and resulted in 55,000 deaths according to the World Cancer Report 2014 of the World Health Organization (&#34;WHO&#34;). 

&#160; 

It is estimated that 420 million people across the globe are at high risk of Melanoma (See RED in Image). 

The Dermatology Device Market 

&#160; 

Various devices are used by dermatologists and surgeons to diagnose skin disorders and accurately determine the types of conditions and the treatments required. At present, the dermatology devices market consists of two segments:(i) diagnostic devices market; and (ii) treatment devices market. Our Product is part of the diagnostic device market aimed at increasing the speed and accuracy of skin disorder diagnosis at an early stage. 

&#160; 

The respected research firm, &#34;MarketsandMarkets.com,&#34; has forecast that the global market for dermatology devices to grow from $6.6 billion in 2014 to $11.3 billion by 2019 and the market in North America, a primary market that we hope to compete in, is expected to reach approximately $5.2 billion by 2019. The key factors expected to drive the forecasted growth are: (i) a rise in skin disorder incidence; (ii) an increase in awareness of available aesthetic procedures; (iii) advances in technology and rising prices; and (iv) the recognition by the population of the harmful effects of to exposure to the sun on skin. All of the forgoing are major contributing factors towards the increasing number of people that become more skin and health conscious. 

The global dermatology devices market includes two distinct segments: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Diagnostic devices, such as dermatoscopes, microscopes and imaging techniques; and &#160; &#9679; Applications of these diagnostic devices, such as imaging processing software, skin cancer diagnosis technology, hair removal and wrinkle removal &#160; 

Based on the 2014 MarketsandMarkets.com report, imaging techniques accounted for the largest share of the diagnostic devices segment. Skin cancer diagnosis technologies represents the largest share of the device applications market. 

&#160; 

The global dermatology devices market is expected to grow faster due to the increasing number of people suffering from skin-related disorders and the number of people opting for less invasive cosmetic surgeries. These are important factors contributing to the increasing demand of dermatology devices, which, in turn, is expected to contribute to demand for our DermaCompare software solution. 

&#160; 

Dermatology devices and respective applications are rapidly gaining popularity not only due to their major role in aesthetic but also the rising numbers of skin disorders such as vascular and pigmented lesions, skin cancer, acne problems and others conditions that vary in different regions of the world. 

&#160; 

Geographically, we plan to cover four major regions including North America, Europe, Australia and the increasing market in major Asian countries including China, India and Japan, among others. Rising occurrence of skin related ailments along with technological advancements and higher healthcare expenditures have resulted in North America being the largest market for dermatology devices. This trend is expected to continue. In Australia, Melanoma is the fourth most common cancer with 1 in 14 males and 1 in 23 females expected to develop melanomas during their life time. Its incidence has been increasing by approximately 16% in males and approximately 24% in females over the next decade, according to a report by National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and New Zealand Guidelines Group (NZGG). The Asian-Pacific market is anticipated to be most profitable due to highly untapped opportunities, rising public and physician awareness and improvement in healthcare infrastructure. Skin disorders such as acne, Melasma, dermatitis, skin warts, lesions and moles, especially in China and India, are projected to drive the Asian market. 

&#160; 

Our Market Opportunity 

&#160; 

The challenge for dermatologists is the detection of skin cancer in its early stages, which is crucial for patient survival. Approximately 60% of melanomas occur as a result of a new mole, while the remaining 40% are the result of a mole that has changed. Since the human body dynamically changes over time, dermatologists are still using manual techniques, which are time-consuming and, as a result, costly, often inaccurate and not readily available for population-wide screening. The most recent innovation in the skin cancer detection field is Total Body Photography (&#34;TBP&#34;), typically a set of 25 photos that cover the entire skin surface of the patient, and was adopted by dermatologists approximately fifteen years ago. At present, dermatologists recommend doing TBP on a yearly basis, comparing the photographs and detecting the key differences. 

We believe that the most significant research in skin cancer detection over the last decade has been conducted principally in the state of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. This has involved the use of manually taken TBP which, from an efficacy study performed for the early detection of skin cancer, found a 30% increase in the early discovery of skin cancer, resulting in approximately 90% of melanomas being diagnosed at an early stage and with mortality rates decreasing by approximately 50% of that expected five years after the study. As a result of the study, since 2008, the country has mandated a nationwide statutory plan for a bi-annual early screening of skin cancer for citizens aged 35. 

&#160; 

Based on our estimates, there are approximately 420 million people, representing 7% of the total world population, that can be defined as within the Melanoma high risk group; the majority of which are living in the Western hemisphere. Melanoma patients are more likely to be found in countries with warm and sunny weather. The disease is, however, also prevalent in other regions such as China, India and elsewhere in the Far-East. 

It is estimated that approximately 250,000 new cases of Melanoma are diagnosed worldwide each year. Based upon studies conducted by the National Institutes of Health (&#34;NIH&#34;) and the Skin Cancer Foundation, an estimated 74,000 new cases of invasive Melanoma will be diagnosed in the US in 2015 with detection more frequently in male Caucasians. At present, Melanoma is the sixth leading cause of cancer mortality in men and the seventh leading cause of cancer fatalities in women. Based on these data, we believe that skin lesion imaging is expected to continue to be a growing market. We believe that current market potential is over $1 billion, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to commercially exploit this large and growing demand. 

&#160; 

At present, the most conventional and widely-used visualization method is a standard photograph followed by manual image analysis and then comparing these images with previously taken photographic images to reach a diagnosis. This traditional method has several disadvantages, including the fact that only the outermost layer of skin is imaged and subjected to diagnosis, the visual comparison process is time-consuming, expensive, and often inaccurate because it is dependent on the dermatologists eyes only. The standard conventional photograph method, although inexpensive, is inefficient and laborious for examination purposes and limits the market to dermatologists and specialized physicians. 

&#160; 

By revolutionizing the fundamental approach in which skin lesions and/or Melanoma is diagnosed, especially in the early stages, we reasonably expect that our DermaCompare product should be well-positioned to become one of the leading applications in the market, although there can be no such assurance. We hope that this will be achievable by replacing the need for manual photo image analysis with automated image analytics software using advanced algorithms of our DermaCompare process for anchoring, identifying and detecting changes in the shapes, color and sizes of skin lesions. We also plan to utilize available large data bases together with new &#34;computer learning&#34; and &#34;artificial intelligence&#34; techniques to learn from the &#34;wisdom of the crowd&#34; and, based on business analytic tools, we will use as a DSS (Decision Support System) for all range of physicians. 

&#160; 

Our DermaCompare imaging software solution should provide several benefits including, but not limited to: 

&#160; 

&#9679; shortening the physician&#8217;s diagnostic procedure, which is both time-consuming and limits care only to those with very high expertise; &#9679; replacing manual photo analysis with our DermaCompare application that enables a more in-depth diagnosis; and &#9679; opening the market to less experienced physicians in less served markets outside of urban and suburban areas, thereby increasing the potential clientele and patient base significantly. &#160; 

With the rise of the incidences of skin cancer, we believe that the medical community and the general population recognize that it is not only vital to monitor the skin on a regular basis, but it also important to have new means of diagnosing skin lesions more rapidly and accurately. One of the best early indicators of Melanoma is a new or changing mole. If detected in its early stage, Melanoma is almost always treatable. If left untreated for too long, skin Melanoma can become terminal and very difficult or virtually impossible to treat. In addition, if the skin is not monitored on a regular basis, it may be difficult for the patient or doctor to detect new moles or identify changes in existing ones. 

&#160; 

Total body photography or TBP, which is part of the procedure used with our DermaCompare technology, is intended for use in detecting and monitoring skin moles and lesions, particularly for individuals considered at high risk for Melanoma. Early detection improves treatment and survival and increases the chance of a full recovery. Our DermaCompare application software is designed to assist dermatologists and other medical practitioners in diagnosing Melanoma quickly and with less effort. 

&#160; 

Moreover, the use of computerized technologies with our DermaCompare provides an opportunity to compile, process and store data, thereby creating an extensive database for treating physicians as well as medical researchers. Availability of the data in Internet based SaaS and cloud networks can also provide cross linking between dermatologists, general physicians and/or oncologists. 

&#160; 

We believe that this should help to alleviate the relative limited availability or even complete unavailability of suitable data in certain regions and for certain populations and may shed light on skin lesion development into Melanoma. 

Our DermaCompare Solution 

&#160; 

Our DermaCompare imaging solution is provided as a software platform aimed at early detection of Melanoma based on ABCD Rule for classification of dermatological lesions as published by the National Institute of Health (&#34;NIH&#34;) for analysis of moles. The ABCD Rule is defined as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; A &#9679; Asymmetry, a benign mole that is not asymmetrical ; &#160; B &#9679; Border, a benign mole has smooth, even borders , unlike melanomas; &#160; C &#9679; Color. Most benign moles are all one color , often a single shade of brown; and &#160; D &#9679; Diameter . &#160; 

Benign moles usually have a smaller diameter than malignant ones. Our software processes and analyzes derma images of skin lesions, moles or total body images. Our DermaCompare imaging software solution is able to read and extract data from those images and in essence turning digital camera, camera-equipped smart phones and tablets into virtual scanning devices. 

&#160; 

Our imaging software can be installed on any desktop computer, smart phone or tablet with either iOS or Android operating systems. The software&#8217;s imaging capabilities include image recognition, repair and optimization, dynamic data extraction and several image-specific capabilities. 

&#160; 

Our proprietary DermaCompare software combines our core image character recognition technology with advanced image processing capabilities that transform a color skin photograph or total body photograph into a digital image of various sizes and resolutions. Photographs taken by digital cameras or photographs of skin lesions captured by camera-equipped smart phones and tablets are exposed to variable lighting conditions and various angles and focal distances. Raw photos of skin lesions taken by a camera-equipped smart phone or tablet may be of an unknown size and resolution and may often be geometrically distorted, skewed or warped. As a result, an unedited mobile image of a skin lesion may be virtually unusable without the use of our DermaCompare imaging technology. 

&#160; 

Our DermaCompare software solution uses advanced algorithms designed to identify and correct geometric and optical distortions and automatically correct each image, zoom in and manipulate both new and old images simultaneously in a corresponding manner to facilitate correct and timely diagnosis. In addition, our DermaCompare software is designed to enable dermatologists and other medical practitioners to review the skin lesion images and digital processing results in a graphical and analytic way. 

&#160; 

These images can then be stored on our managed cloud-based servers and our licensee/users will be able to safely access their patients&#8217; images via mobile access or Internet login. We believe that our central image storage solution insures that images and data are secured and kept confidential. We are compliant with HIPAA, the United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, sets the standard for protecting sensitive patient data. Any company that deals with protected health information must ensure that all the required physical, network, and process security measures are in place and followed. 

This includes covered entities, anyone who provides treatment, payment and operations in healthcare, and business associates, anyone with access to patient information and provides support in treatment, payment or operations. Subcontractors, or business associates of business associates, must also be in compliance. Emerald has recently been as a HIPAA compliant company and also using the IBM SoftLayer cloud that already HIPAA compliance. 

&#160; 

Practice and Pricing 

Our pricing will be based on a fixed-price model, which fees will be charged directly by the App or collected either by the dermatologists, other physicians or medical centers. The process will start with the dermatologist or medical center charging the patient for the total body photography and upload the images through the Internet to a secure, company-owned server. We will invoice the dermatologist or medical center directly on a monthly, per-patient basis. If a patient is to be found to have Melanoma, our pricing model is to waive the fee for this particular patient. We believe that this should serve to incentivize physicians to use our DermaCompare software and encourage patient acceptance of its use. 

Our physician/licensees can add new patient accounts to their online account and, at present, our pricing model contemplates that each patient registration will cost US$95 annually. 

&#160; 

We will offer our dermatologist/licensees unlimited access to their patients&#8217; images during the one-year period. Each registered patient will also receive a user and password to enable secure access to his/her images through the website or mobile access and enable any other physician to review the images with that patient&#8217;s consent (&#34;2nd opinion&#34; model). 

&#160; 

We believe that our pricing strategy should make us competitive and is based on the fact that we do not plan on being directly engaged with the end-user and taking and transmitting images to the server. Our strategy is to provide imaging software as a service to dermatologists and medical centers that analyze their own patient&#8217;s images. 

&#160; 

Maintenance and Product Support 

&#160; 

We plan to provide ongoing software support services to assist our medical professional licensees with answers to technical questions and will also maintain customer service department for support with respect to DermaCompare software installation and system maintenance. The majority of the inquiries that we expect to receive will be handled by us via telephone and email. We will maintain our licensees&#8217; software largely through online releases via the Internet that may be downloaded by our licensees with technology enhancements and updated software features. We plan to offer our licensees post-contract support. All of these services are expected to generate significant recurring revenues and shall be typically offered under contract on an annual basis. 

&#160; 

Maintenance and support service fees will be deferred and recognized over the contract period on a straight-line basis. Costs incurred by us to provide maintenance and support services will be charged to cost of revenue as incurred. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Our success will in large part depend upon our ability to protect our proprietary DermaCompare technology. We plan to protect our intellectual property rights primarily through patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other measures. 

&#160; 

If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or our intellectual property infringes, for any reason that we do not presently contemplate, on the intellectual property rights of a third party, our operating results would, in all likelihood be materially, adversely affected. 

&#160; 

To date, we have not filed for domestic and international patents. Further, we have no registered trademarks, but will continue to evaluate advisability and the costs associated with the registration of trademarks as our management deems appropriate, from time to time. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing Strategy 

&#160; 

Our sales and marketing plan, which has already commenced, is to sell licenses for our DermaCompare imaging software to: NHSs, HMOs, health insurance companies, hospitals and medical clinics through distributers, health care channel partners or directly through independent salespersons and/or web purchase to dermatologists and other physicians (GPs) that we expect to purchase licenses based on the number of potential numbers of patients. 

&#160; 

Initially, our marketing strategy for our product is based on a pilot program with worldwide leading dermatologists and medical centers in Israel and Europe in order to improve our DermaCompare software application further. 

&#160; 

Subsequently, we plan to market our product worldwide through channel partners, via the Internet as well as through our direct sales force. 

&#160; 

We intent to have an internal marketing group that develops our product marketing strategies and executes marketing plans with the support of external resources as needed. We will employ a technically oriented sales force that works with management to identify prospective customers. 

Our indirect sales strategy concentrates on distributors and software solution companies that build, integrate and sell software solutions. 

&#160;

Our direct sales strategy will concentrate on health insurance companies, NHS, HMOs, medical centers, dermatologists and other physicians that want to provide our software to their patients. Our sales process will additionally be supported by a broad range of marketing programs, including trade shows, public relations and digital advertising. 

In addition, we plan to utilize the following low-cost methods in order to maximize our marketing budget, such as: 

&#160; 

&#9679; Internet promotion to support public relationships. &#9679; Publicity adds at pools, golf clubs and beaches. &#9679; Collaborating with leading companies that manufacture sun-screen lotions, swimming-suits, etc. &#9679; Taking advantage of public awareness at special opportunities through product placements. &#9679; Social networking, utilizing web sites for PR needs. &#9679; Presentation at scientific and medical conferences and highly publicized patient organization meetings. &#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The market for derma image processing software products is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change, and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. We face direct and indirect competition from a broad range of competitors who offer a variety of competitive products and solutions to our target markets. Our principal competition will come from: (i) manufacturers of custom-developed solutions; (ii) companies offering automated derma imaging processing systems; and (iii) companies offering competing technologies capable of recognizing and analyzing derma images. Many, if not all of these competing companies will have far greater financial and other resources, established name recognition and lengthy operating histories, any of which could make it difficult for us to compete effectively. 

&#160; 

It is also possible that we will face competition from new industry participants and/or alternative technologies. Moreover, as the market for derma imaging software further evolves and develops, a number of companies with significantly greater resources than we have could attempt to enter or increase their presence in our industry, either independently or by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our competitors, or otherwise increase their focus on the industry. In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address the needs of our potential customers. 

&#160; 

Our DermaCompare product competes, to various degrees, with products produced by a number of substantial competitors, many of which have far greater financial and other resources and established operating histories with name recognition. Competition among product providers in this market generally focuses on price, accuracy, reliability and technical support. We believe our primary competitive advantages in this market are: (i) flexibility resulting from the ability of our product to operate in Internet based web services environments; (ii) an architectural software design that allows our product to be more readily modified, improved with added functionality and configured for new products, thereby allowing our software to be easily upgraded ; and (iii) combined methodologies of &#34;Big Data and wisdom of the crowd&#34; (which means analyzing tens of thousands of electronic medical records, whereby investigators can uncover new risk factors, novel preventive measures and treatments that are the most effective for a range of diseases and conditions) with machine learning and artificial intelligence together with high end machine vision capabilities. 

&#160; 

As a result, we believe that our DermaCompare software Product should differ substantially from what is currently available in the market and heretofore has been known as &#34;gold standard.&#34; Imaging and analytics is a major sector in the medical device industry and competition is expected to be broad-based and intense. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 

&#160; 

The following list of competitors is not intended to be exhaustive, and there are other existing competitors and there likely will be new potential competitors in the future: 

DermAlert: The DermAlert software, as presently constituted, is designed to compare images taken by digital camera obtained during a 6 to 12 month period in order to detect new or changing moles through total body photography, by monitoring a specific mole or moles. We believe that their software, at present, cannot define whether a mole is a new one or not. 

&#160; 

Canfield Scientific: Canfield Scientific provides custom photographic systems, image monitoring and centralized analysis services for the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and cosmetics industries. Canfield software is a local based installation and is also expensive to purchase and for this reason is not truly competitive with our DermaCompare software. 

&#160; 

DigitalDerm: DigitalDerm&#8217;s MoleMap CD technology is a baseline system for early Melanoma detection. Their technology is unique in that it combines total body photography and patented software into a CD-based imaging record that runs on any personal computer with a Windows-based operating system. DigitalDerm&#8217;s MoleMap CD applies 35 images as a baseline to compare new moles and moles that are changing or have changed and is based on a local DB, which is considered on older, conventional manually-based solution, not using the &#34;wisdom of the crowd&#34; 

&#160; 

FotoFinder Systems: FotoFinder Systems&#8217; Dermoscope is a system for digital dermoscopy, fluorescence diagnosis and standardized photo documentation in dermatology. We do not believe that any of these technologies are used by or are competitive with our DermaCompare software .

&#160; 

Notwithstanding our determination that the above-referenced companies are not actual competitors with our DermaCompare technology, they all have substantially far greater capital, marketing, personnel and other resources, and greater experience in commercializing products and services than we have. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s DermaCompare software Product and systems are not subject to FDA or other governmental approval. Any change in current regulatory requirements or related interpretations by or the positions of, governmental agencies, federal or state officials where we plan to market out product could adversely affect our operations. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

Mr. Lior Wyan, CEO and director, and Mr. Oded Gilboa, CFO, constitute our Management team. Mr. Yair Fudim is the Chairman of our board of directors. They are not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours per week to our operations and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to the Company&#8217;s affairs until such time that we begin marketing our products and generate revenues. We have entered into employment agreements with Lior Wayn and with Oded Gilboa, Emerald&#8217;s CEO and CFO, respectively. Reference is made to the disclosure under Item 11. &#34;Executive Compensation&#34; which contains a summary of the material terms of the respective employment agreements. 

&#160; 

At present, Emerald has 10 employees including its CEO, Lior Wayn. 

&#160;
