Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements contained in this report, including statements regarding our business, financial condition, our intent, belief or current expectations, primarily with respect to the future operating performance of the Company and other statements contained herein regarding matters that are not historical facts, are "forward-looking" statements. You can identify forward-looking statements by those that are not historical in nature, particularly those that use terminology such as &#8220;may,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;should,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;contemplates,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;projected,&#8221; &#8220;predicts,&#8221; &#8220;potential,&#8221; or &#8220;continue&#8221; or the negative of these similar terms. Future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, future press releases and future oral or written statements made by us or with our approval, which are not statements of historical fact, may contain forward-looking statements.

We undertake no obligation to update such statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they are made, except as required by federal securities and any other applicable law.

Overview

The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 10, 2012 to be in the power sports business.

On July 29, 2014, Vladimir Nedrygaylo, the principal shareholder of Drimex Inc. consummated the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of June 24, 2014 which provided for the sale of 5,000,000 shares of common stock (not adjusted for the forward split described below) of the Company (the &#8220;Shares&#8221;) to Juanzi Cui. The consideration paid for the Shares, which represented 84.7% of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Company on a fully-diluted basis, was $325,000. The source of the cash consideration for the Shares was the personal funds of Mrs. Cui. In connection with the transaction, Mr. Nedrygaylo released the Company from all debts owed to him.

Mrs. Cui became the Company&#8217;s sole officer and director.

On August 22, 2014, the Company amended and restated Articles of Incorporation, changed the name of the Company from &#8220;Drimex, Inc.&#8221; to &#8220;MakingORG, Inc.&#8221; and increased the amount of authorized shares of common stock from 75,000,000 to 150,000,000, with a par value of $0.001 per share.

&#160;

Effective August 22, 2014, the Company effected a 6 for 1 forward split on its common stock outstanding in the form of a dividend, under which each stockholder of record on that date received 5 additional shares of the Corporation's $0.001 par value common stock for every 1 share owned. All share and per share amounts presented in this Annual Report and the financial statements and notes thereto have been adjusted for the stock split.

Juanzi Cui, who took control of the Company as described above, intends that the Company open a line of organic food stores or stores-in-stores within the Asian communities in the United States. This transaction will occur when the requisite approvals and authorizations, if any, are obtained, and the appropriate disclosure is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, w e are now considered a blank check company. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) defines those companies as &#8220;any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3(a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies.&#8221; Under SEC Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;), we also qualify as a &#8220;shell company,&#8221; because we have no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of &#8220;blank check&#8221; companies in their respective jurisdictions. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination. We intend to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as we are subject to those requirements.

Our current business plan is to attempt to open a line of organic food stores or stores-in-stores within the Asian communities in the United States. Alternatively, we might identify and negotiate with a business target for the merger of that entity with and into the Company. In certain instances, a target company may wish to become a subsidiary of the Company or may wish to contribute or sell assets to the Company rather than to merge. No assurances can be given that we will be successful in identifying or negotiating with any target company. We can provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting or public company whose securities are qualified for trading in the United States secondary markets.

A business combination with a target company normally will involve the transfer to the target company of the majority of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company, and the substitution by the target company of its own management and board of directors. No assurances can be given that we will be able to enter into a business combination, or, if we do enter into such a business combination, no assurances can be given as to the terms of a business combination, or as to the nature of the target company.

Competition

The Company is an insignificant participant among firms which engage in business combinations with development stage enterprises. There are many established management and financial consulting companies and venture capital firms which have significantly greater financial and personnel resources, technical expertise and experience than the Company. In view of the Company's limited financial resources and management availability, the Company will continue to be at a significant competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis the Company's competitors.

Regulation and Taxation

The Investment Company Act of 1940 defines an "investment company" as an issuer which is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading of securities. While the Company does not intend to engage in such activities, the Company could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940 in the event the Company obtains or continues to hold a minority interest in a number of development stage enterprises. The Company could be expected to incur significant registration and compliance costs if required to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Accordingly, management will continue to review the Company's activities from time to time with a view toward reducing the likelihood the Company could be classified as an "investment company."

The Company intends to structure a merger or acquisition in such manner as to minimize Federal and state tax consequences to the Company and to any target company.

Employees

We currently have no full time employees. All functions including development, strategy, negotiations and administration are currently being provided by Mrs. Cui, our sole executive officer and director, on a voluntary basis.
