 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

&#160;

Turbine Truck Engines, Inc. ("TTE" or "the Company") was incorporated in Delaware on November 27, 2000. On February 20, 2008, the Company was re-domiciled to the State of Nevada. To date, the Company's activities have been limited to raising capital, organizational matters, engaging in research and development, testing its technology, and the structuring of its business plan. The corporate headquarters are located in Bellevue, Washington. The Company has not yet generated any revenues since inception. 

&#160;

To date, the Company's principal research and development operations have been directed at the potential commercialization, of its (a) Detonation Cycle Gas Turbine Engine technology ("DCGT"); its (b) Gas to Liquid Conversion Process technology ("GTL"); and the (c) Hydrogen Production Burner System ("HPBS"). 

&#160;

In addition, the Company continues to conduct diligence to either purchase or merge an intellectual property asset and/or an existing operational company asset. To date, TTE has not entered into a contractual commitment to complete an asset purchase or merger. 

&#160;

On November 14, 2014, the Company closed the Asset Purchase Agreement and Technology Sale/Transfer/Assignment for all Intellectual Property (IP) Agreement, with Robert &#38; Barbara Scragg and Alpha Engines Corporation to obtain ownership of all rights, title, interest, patents, trademarks, and inventor notes for both the Detonation Cycle Gas Turbine Engine (DCGT) and Gas-to-Liquid (GTL) technologies. 

&#160;

On May 5, 2015 TTE completed a one-for-twenty (1:20) reverse split of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share. 

&#160;

On May 10, 2015, Michael Rouse, TTE's founder, resigned as the Company's President and member of the Board of Directors, and Christopher David, was appointed to serve as the Company's President, while remaining the Company's Secretary, Treasurer and member of the Board of Directors. To date, Mr. Rouse's seat on the Company's Board of Directors has not be filled. 

&#160;

On September 8, 2015, the Company adopted the 2015 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2015 Plan") which authorizes up to 5,000,000 shares of common stock to be available for issuance to certain employees and consultants as defined in the 2015 Plan. The 2015 Incentive Compensation Plan supersedes the 2011 Compensation Plan. 

&#160;

The Company will need to raise capital over the coming 12 months to support its activities. The Company's activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure additional funding to commercialize the Company's current technology before another company develops similar technology. &#160;

PRODUCT STATUS AND DESCRIPTION 

&#160;

I. THE DCGT ENGINE TECHNOLOGY 

&#160;

COMPANY HISTORY OF THE DETONATION CYCLE GAS TURBINE ENGINE 

&#160;

Since the formation of Turbine Truck Engines, Inc., on November 27, 2000, the development of the Detonation Cycle Gas Turbine Engine technology ("DCGT"), for the application of heavy-duty highway trucks, has been at the core of the Company's business operations. Up until August 13, 2014, the Company had funded the building and testing of Prototype #5, a 540HP 12-cylinder engine and Prototype #6, a 70HP 4-cylinder engine for the purpose of sufficiently advancing the research and development of the DCGT engine technology to a point of entering into a joint venture agreement with a heavy-duty truck engine manufacturer for advanced research and development. To date, however, the DCGT engine technology is not ready for commercialization, for any application, and remains in the research and development phase. 

&#160;

The ("DCGT") was successfully patented in December 1999 by the inventor, Robert Scragg ("Mr. Scragg"), whom had earlier issued a master license for all rights and potential applications for the DCGT to Alpha Engines, Inc., ("Alpha"), a company owned by he and his wife, Barbara Scragg. On December 15, 2000, TTE acquired the option rights for an exclusive License from Alpha for manufacturing and marketing heavy-duty highway truck engines utilizing Alpha's DCGT engine technology embodied in U.S. Patent No. 6,000,214 and other proprietary technology and rights owned by Alpha, at that time, including Marketing Survey Data in the highway trucking industry. TTE exercised its option and acquired the licensing rights on July 22, 2002. 

&#160;

In August, 2014, the Company changed a majority of its Board of Directors, management and corporate officer personnel, and undertook a revised look at the Company's business operations. While TTE's new management and Board of Directors, in coordination with Mr. Scragg, continued to believe the patented DCGT technology can be developed for commercialization, they determined that the Company should shift its research and development focus to designing a DCGT engine for applications directly related to power generation. Based on this new focus, TTE no longer intends to expend resources on the development of the DCGT engine technology for the heavy-duty truck engine applications and instead is pursuing a path forward to the development of the DCGT engine technology for other commercial applications specifically related to power generation. 

&#160;

On November 14, 2014, TTE executed an Asset Purchase Agreement and a Technology Sale, Transfer, Assignment Agreement for all Intellectual Property, dated October 14, 2014 (the "Asset Purchase Agreements") between the Company, Robert and Barbara Scragg and Alpha Engines Corporation, settling and ending all licensing agreements between TTE and Alpha Engines Corporation and completing the purchase by the Company of all patents, Intellectual Property, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, rights, title, and interest for both (1) the DCGT engine technology; and (2) the electromagnetic process and apparatus for converting methane gas to liquid methanol, on a low-volume scale, also referred to as the Gas-to-Liquid process technology. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreements, all royalty payments due by TTE to Alpha Engines were settled with no future royalty payments due. TTE owns the DCGT engine technology free and clear. 

&#160;

Since taking ownership of the DCGT technology, TTE has had discussions with several North American based engineering firms to re-initiate research and development of the DCGT engine technology for applications directly related to turning a shaft for power generation; however, the Company is not currently engaged in a research and development contract. &#160; ABOUT THE DCGT ENGINE TECHNOLOGY 

&#160;

This patent in its simplicity makes it very unique. A detonation cycle gas turbine engine includes a turbine rotor contained in a housing. The exhaust ports of respective valve-less combustion chambers are located on opposite sides of the rotor directing combustion gases toward the turbine. The chambers are connected by a valve-less manifold fed with fuel and oxidizer. When combustible gases are detonated by an igniter in one of the combustion chambers, the back pressure from the detonation shuts off the fuel and oxidizer flow to that chamber and redirects the fuel and oxidizer to the opposite chamber, where detonation occurs. The process repeats cyclically. Power is taken off the rotor shaft mechanically or electrically. The invention utilizes a water wheel as the turbine wheel which has blades that are positively displaced, through a blade race, by the rapid expansion of gases exiting from combustion chambers via nozzles, rather than pistons or gas turbines. &#160; 

&#160; 4 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our engine has a blower, rather than a compressor, to supply less air per horsepower hour than required by existing gas turbines or piston engines, thereby producing less exhaust gases per horsepower hour. 

&#160;

The blower supplies low pressure air via a single manifold to two combustion chambers simultaneously thereby requiring less work to complete a detonation cycle, resulting in higher thermos-mechanical efficiencies than gas turbines or piston engines. 

&#160;

The engine manifolds, combustion chambers, and ignition system has the capability of cyclically detonating fuel-air mixtures without using valves. The engine uses a fuel pump and vaporizers to gasify wet fuels prior to mixing with combustion air in the manifolds to produce complete combustion of all fuel-air mixtures in the detonation process. The engine uses a plasma arc ignition, a visibly constant illuminating plasma flame between two electrodes to detonate fuel-air mixtures and does not require critical ignition timing. 

&#160;

Low pressure air and fuel mixtures are detonated instantaneously&#8211;in less than one millisecond&#8211;producing high velocity shock waves that kinetically compress inert gases resulting in higher working pressures than the pressures produced in constant pressure heating utilized in gas turbine engines, and Otto and Diesel cycle piston engines. 

&#160;

The detonation cycle engine uses less working fluid and produces less exhaust gas per horsepower hour than Brayton cycle turbines and Otto or Diesel cycle piston engines. 

&#160;

Six working prototypes have been developed and constructed over the course of the last 20 years, culminating in the development of the 6th generation prototype engine which consists of two 7-inch, 8-pound turbine wheels mounted on a single shaft, driven by 4 horizontally opposed combustion chambers producing an estimated 70 horsepower at 20,000 rpm. 

&#160;

The DCGT engine technology includes an Electromagnetic Isothermal Combustion ("EIC") process that powers the engine. The EIC process produces complete combustion of fuel-oxidizer mixtures in cyclic detonations that negate unwanted nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide emissions. The high pressure gases produced by the detonations drive a unique turbine, producing shaft horsepower. 

&#160;

The EIC process enables the DCGT to operate with blower air at low static pressure, negating the necessity of compressing and preheating fuel-oxidizer mixtures prior to combustion. By eliminating the compression of fuel-oxidizer mixtures, the DCGT engine achieves higher thermal efficiencies in a simplified mechanical structure. The DCGT engine offers the following proprietary and competitive advantages over current diesel, gasoline and gas turbine engines: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Air cooled - less than 2 pounds per horsepower 

&#160; &#9679; 

Fewer moving parts - less maintenance 

&#160; &#9679; 

Flex-fuel and mixed fuels capability 

&#160; &#9679; 

Operates on all hydrocarbon fuels, hydrogen and synthetic fuels 

&#160; &#9679; 

Cold start capability with any fuels 

&#160; &#9679; 

Burns 30% less fuel "Greenhouse exhaust gases" 

&#160; &#9679; 

Less nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide exhaust emissions 

&#160; &#9679; 

Less hydrocarbon exhaust emissions 

&#160; &#9679; 

No lube oil, filters or pumps 

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

COMPETITION FOR THE DCGT ENGINE TECHNOLOGY FOR POWER GENRATION 

&#160;

Given that certain aspects of the Company's DCGT engine technology is still under U.S. patent protection, the Company is not aware of any entity that has successfully commercialized pulse detonation cycle technology for power generation applications. Additionally, until TTE is able to successfully produce data from a prototype of an operational DCGT engine turning a shaft for power generation, it is difficult to provide qualitative comparisons of the DCGT engine technology to the myriad of other technologies available to both residential and business consumers today. Once TTE is able to successfully complete a working bench prototype and collect a myriad of acceptable data on items such as horsepower, torque, efficiency, temperatures, pressures and more, TTE will then be better positioned to identify the target market for commercialization of the DCGT engine technology for power production. At that time, TTE can then provide clarity and direction on competition considerations for our product and its target market. 

&#160;

PATENTS FOR THE DCGT ENGINE TECHNOLOGY 

&#160;

The DCGT engine technology currently has a single U. S. Patent No. 6,000,214, a novel patent with a 20-year life from the filing date of December 16, 1997. The patent was based on research and development beginning in 1984, which included the design, construction, and testing of working prototypes #1, #2, #3 and #4. The patent attorneys were Schoemaker &#38; Mattare Ltd. TTE intends to file additional patents to protect any new developments in the engine technology. 

&#160;

II. GAS-TO-LIQUID PROCESS TECHNOLOGY 

&#160;

COMPANY HISTORY OF THE GAS TO LIQUID PROCESS TECHNOLOGY 

&#160;

In addition to the DCGT engine technology, Robert Scragg is also the inventor of an expired patent for a process in which methane gas, the primary component of natural gas, is converted into liquid methanol at low-volume production rates. Low volume is defined as 50 gallons per minute or less. This process is referred to as Gas-to-Liquid ("GTL" or "the Scragg Process"). 

&#160;

In 1983, Robert Scragg received patent protection for his "Electromagnetic Process and Apparatus for Making Methanol". While this patent has expired, certain intellectual property and trade secrets remain intact and protected and are now owned by TTE. Mr. Scragg's 1983 patent proved that gentle oxidation of methane gas, a hydrocarbon, using precise electromagnetic activation produces methanol gas which is then condensed in the reactor chamber to form liquid methanol. The Scragg process for gas to liquid conversion provides for production of methanol on a low-volume scale using an easily transportable apparatus and system. When the inventor received his patent for the GTL process technology, he created a working GTL prototype for presentation to the U.S. Patent office. Today, that prototype no longer exists and a new prototype has to be built using the inventor's notes, drawings and data collection, along with newly gathered research information, to prove the viability of the GTL technology. 

&#160;

As noted in Section I above, titled Company History of the DCGT Engine Technology, on November 14, 2014, the Company closed an Asset Purchase Agreement, with Robert and Barbara Scragg and Alpha Engines Corporation, completing the purchase, by Turbine Truck Engines, Inc. of all patents, intellectual property, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, rights, title, and interest for an electromagnetic process and apparatus for converting methane gas to methanol, the Scragg Process. While the Scragg Process patent has expired, certain intellectual property and trade secrets remain intact and protected and are now owned by TTE. &#160; &#160; 6 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Prior to TTE completing its acquisition of Robert Scragg's GTL process technology, TTE always had an open invitation to pursue a licensing contract, with Alpha, for the development of the Scragg Process. While TTE never completed a licensing agreement for the Scragg Process, TTE's prior management did periodically pursue potential development partners. 

&#160;

On January 23, 2013, the Company entered into a Binding Letter of Intent ("BluGen LOI") with BluGen, Inc., a California corporation ("BluGen"), for the purpose of the joint development of a GTL bench prototype, using the trade secrets of the Scragg Process. Under the terms of the BluGen LOI, BluGen was to work with TTE, and the inventor, Robert Scragg, to recreate and expand upon the original designs created by Mr. Scragg. The BluGen LOI allowed for certain of the Scragg processes' trade secrets and data to be made available to BluGen in a phased manner as certain development milestones were achieved by BluGen. TTE never received notice, from BluGen, that the first milestone had been achieved with no real indication BluGen even undertook a coordinated effort to advance the Scragg Process technology. On October 24, 2014, TTE sent notice to BluGen terminating the January 23, 2013 Binding LOI based on non-performance by BluGen. 

&#160;

On June 3, 2015, TTE signed and executed a Consulting Services Agreement with Justin Dean, an individual, to retain Mr. Dean as the Project and Program Manager for Phase 1 of TTE's product development of its GTL process technology. This agreement further defined Mr. Dean's responsibilities to include conceptual design analysis, product development analysis, product commercialization analysis, business plan analysis, product application analysis, and industry use &#38; application analysis. 

&#160;

On June 3, 2015, TTE signed and executed a Services Agreement with Sahoma Controlware, LLC (the "Sahoma Agreement") to provide the Company with services for the design, modeling and simulation of TTE's Gas-to-Liquid Process technology, to include the Electromagnetic Generator, Chemical Reactor and Process Gas Feed Systems products. The Sahoma Agreement's scope of work included developing individual product simulation models &#38; analysis for flow, thermal, vibration, structural/stress and electrical while also developing simulation models for the entire GTL Reactor Process to determine maximum operational effectiveness and efficiency. 

&#160;

Collectively, both the Sahoma Agreement and the Dean Consulting Services Agreement were executed to provide the Company with engineering, technical and analytical expertise to validate the Company expending additional resources on the development of its Gas-to-Liquid process technology for converting methane and oxygen gas into methanol liquid at low-volume production rates. 

&#160;

On February 19, 2016, the Company executed Settlement Agreements with both Sahoma Controlware, LLC and Justin Dean mutually concluding both the Engineering Services Agreement, dated June 3, 2015, with Sahoma and the Consulting Services Agreement, dated June 3, 2015, with Dean. Under both Services Agreements, the Company has received certain 3D modeling, design and data sets that, while not conclusive, do provide a working baseline for continuing additional research and development to validate the GTL process technologies' operational capacity and efficiency. 

&#160;

Under the terms of the Settlement Agreements, the Company has no further obligation to pay Sahoma the final milestone payment of $10,824 and Dean will retain his 250,000 Rule 144 common shares issued to him under the Consulting Services Agreement. 

&#160;

Since executing the Settlement Agreements, the Company is in ongoing discussions with a U.S. based engineering entity as it considers the best path forward to continue research and development of its GTL low-volume production process technology. The next phase of research to validate the operational and commercial viability of the GTL process technology will require conducting additional modeling and the build of a bench prototype to collect data sets on a multitude of items including, but not limited to, yield rates, species analysis and energy balance calculations. 

&#160;

WHY LOW VOLUME PRODUCTION OF GAS TO LIQUID 

&#160;

Throughout the United States and the world, at sites where drilling operations are producing natural gas as a by-product, a large portion of the natural gas is being flare burned, instead of being sold, as the site is either too far from a pipeline or the accessible pipeline has no additional capacity. When taking into account cost analysis, environmental considerations and commodity pricing in today's marketplace, TTE believes the demand for an easily transportable, self-sustaining apparatus capable of converting gas to liquid, on a low-volume scale, has elevated. &#160; &#160; 7 

&#160; 

&#160; 

As a result of the market's willingness to consider other options, besides flare burning the on-site natural gas, several companies are working to develop a low-volume, easily transportable GTL apparatus for commercialization. To date, TTE is not aware of any company that has commercialized a low-volume, unmanned, remote GTL system which has proved viable as a self-supporting, profitable business. 

&#160;

TTE believes today's marketplace dynamics allow for a lower volume, easily transportable GTL apparatus to address an enormous, unmet need of redirecting flare burn natural gas for conversion to methanol for commercial resale or reuse onsite even at low-volume production rates. 

&#160;

COMPETITION FOR THE SCRAGG PROCESS GAS TO LIQUID 

&#160;

To date, companies invested in converting natural gas to methanol are primarily engaged in high-volume scale production operations. The current state-of-the-art method of producing liquid methanol involves a low pressure process of preparing synthesis gas by steam reforming or partial oxidation of a gaseous hydrocarbon feedstock or by direct combination of carbon dioxide with purified hydrogen rich gases. Typically, naphtha or a natural gas feedstock is desulfurized, preheated and mixed with a superheated steam, and then reacted over a conventional catalyst in a multi-tubular reformer. After cooling, the synthesis gas is compressed to the required pressure and passed into a hot-wall converter over a low pressure methanol synthesis catalyst at a temperature ranging from 250 to 270 degrees centigrade. The crude methanol that is formed is condensed and separated from the uncondensed gases which are recycled with makeup synthesis gas and fed back into the converter. 

&#160;

Methanex Corp. is the world's largest producer of Methanol. To date, facilities converting gas to liquid are only focused on large scale production. The dollar cost to build and operate a high-volume scale GTL production facility is significant. 

&#160;

PATENTS FOR THE GAS TO LIQUID SCRAGG PROCESS 

&#160;

To date there are no patents or patents pending for the Gas to Liquid Scragg Process. On Feb 15, 1983, the Scragg Process for converting methane to methanol was granted patent protection under US Patent # 4,374,288. The patent has expired, however the process remains protected under Trade Secrets law. 

&#160;

III. THE HYDROGEN PRODUCTION BURNER SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY 

&#160;

COMPANY HISTORY OF THE HYDROGEN PRODUCTION BURNER SYSTEM 

&#160;

In 2010, TTE was working with various Chinese based partners to develop its licensed DCGT engine technology for use in various applications in Asia. At that time, TTE's CEO was introduced to Falcon Power Co. Ltd. ("Falcon"), a Taiwan based business, that was developing a technology focused on converting methanol to hydrogen, on-demand, using a proprietary technology now known as the Hydrogen Production Burner System ("HPBS"). One of the potential fuel sources for the DCGT engine technology is hydrogen, thus TTE and Falcon began a diligence phase to consider a collaborative effort to blend the 2 technologies having the HPBS produce hydrogen that could then provide a hydrogen fuel source for the DCGT engine. 

&#160;

Commencing in the spring of 2010 and through February 2014, the Company conducted diligence, negotiated, executed, and ultimately terminated certain contractual obligations with certain Taiwanese and/or Chinese based individuals and corporations. The Company's intentions throughout this defined period was to directly participate in commercializing the Hydrogen Production Burner System worldwide through either licensing rights or a Technology Purchase Agreement of the HPBS technology. &#160; &#160; 8 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In September 2013, the Company was engaged in certain contracts with Energy Technology Services Co. Ltd ("ETS"), a Taiwan based corporation, for business development of the HPBS technology in Asia. Under the terms of these contracts, the Company provided ETS a total of $300,000 (CAN) to fulfill TTE's June 2013 Purchase Order with ETS, for the manufacture of a new 200m3 HPBS unit. 

&#160;

Throughout the fall of 2013 and into January 2014, ETS provided TTE with positive written and video status reports on the progress of the building, completion and delivery of its 200m3 HPBS unit as defined and paid for under the June 2013 Purchase Order. To date, ETS has not fulfilled its contractual obligation to deliver a new 200m3 HPBS. 

&#160;

In February 2014, TTE hired a Taiwan based law firm, Formosan Brothers, to represent the Company, in its pursuit of criminal fraud charges against ETS' principal partners, Chen, Chong-Ping ("Alan Chen") and Huang, Ren-Ju ("Mr. Huang"), both Taiwan citizens, for failure to deliver the newly built 200m3 HPBS unit as provided for under contract. ETS was represented to the Company as the business partners for the inventor Dr. Ching-Chang Chang ("Dr. Chang"). 

&#160;

In Spring 2014, given that no direct evidence existed indicating Dr. Chang had knowledge of the fraud against TTE, the Company engaged in negotiations directly with the HPBS inventor for the purchase of the HPBS technology. To date, Dr. Chang claims to have title ownership of the HPBS technology. In October 2014, Dr. Chang presented TTE with both pictures and video of a new 60m3 HPBS unit he completed building, at his own expense. While TTE and Dr. Chang have negotiated proposed terms and conditions for TTE to acquire the HPBS technology, TTE is continuing to undergo extensive due diligence to validate and verify title ownership of the HPBS technology. Until the Company is satisfied with both (a) title ownership of the HPBS; and (b) exactly which Taiwan individuals were engaged in fraud against the Company, any final agreement to purchase the HPBS technology is pending. 

&#160;

On December 25, 2015, TTE received a written ruling from the Taiwan District Prosecutor's Office declining to prosecute Alan Chen and Mr. Huang for criminal fraud. 

&#160;

On January 4, 2016, Formosan Brothers, on behalf of TTE, filed an appeal to the Taiwan High Prosecution Office requesting the High Court review the facts and evidence of the case and grant TTE an appeal of the lower court's decision and send the matter back to the Taiwan District Prosecutor's Office for a new investigation of the facts and evidence. 

&#160;

On February 1, 2016, TTE received notice that the Companies' appeal was granted and that the initial decision, dated December 25, 2015, by the Taiwan District Court prosecutor not to prosecute Alan Chen and Mr. Huang was overturned and rescinded. The case was returned to the Taiwan District Court Prosecutor with instructions to conduct a new investigation of the facts and evidence. TTE and its counsel intend to continue to pursue these charges until a satisfactory resolution is obtained. 

&#160;

ABOUT THE HYDROGEN PRODUCTION BURNER SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY 

&#160;

Hydrogen (H2) is an ideal fuel for combustion &#8212; it burns easily and efficiently at very high temperatures and emits pure water vapor (H2O) as its only by-product. But the gas is a difficult fuel to work with. Existing methods for transporting and storing hydrogen (namely high-pressure compression and liquefaction) are complex, inefficient, and expensive. It's also the smallest molecule in existence and tends naturally to leak; only exacerbating these problems. 

&#160;

The Hydrogen Production Burner System is an efficient methanol-to-hydrogen production and burner integrated technology which utilizes a steam reformation process, employs a proprietary chemical catalyst and a unique low temperature pyrolytic reaction to convert common methanol into clean-burning hydrogen gas, on-demand, for use as a fuel source to a proprietary burner assembly. The inventor of the HPBS is located in Taiwan and has been developing the technology for over 9 years. &#160; &#160; 9 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Having a technology available that can produce hydrogen on-demand and on-site eliminates the costly and difficult issues that surround the transportation and storage of hydrogen. Additionally, methanol (CH4O, also known as methyl alcohol or wood alcohol) is inexpensive, widely accessible, and easier to store, handle and transport. The HPBS technology provides a unique and marketable solution for those entities wanting to burn hydrogen as a thermal heat source. &#160; The HPBS system is applicable to a wide array of industrial boilers and steam generators as well as other various residential and commercial applications. The efficiency of the HPBS technology could save the end user 30-60% on energy costs as compared to current sources of energy such as electricity, heavy oils, coal, and natural gas. 

&#160;

COMPETITION FOR THE HPBS TECHNOLOGY 

&#160;

The Company has identified a handful of competitors, including Air-Gas, that manufacture hydrogen producing generators. There are three main types of hydrogen generators, those that (a) convert methane to hydrogen through a catalyst; (b) convert water through electrolysis; and (c) convert methanol through catalysis. There are commercialized units for each method, however, to our knowledge; there are no commercialized units, like the HPBS technology that produce hydrogen from methanol, on demand, for on-site use. In that regard, the Company considers itself uniquely positioned to provide the market with a hydrogen production and burner system that is uniquely different than its competitors. 

&#160;

PATENTS FOR THE HPBS TECHNOLOGY 

&#160;

To date, the Company has no patents (nor does TTE know of any patents pending) for the HPBS technology. The catalytic process used to covert methanol to hydrogen is proprietary and to the best of the companies' knowledge stands alone in marketplace. If TTE is able to secure ownership of the HPBS technology, TTE intends to continue to develop the technology with an eye toward submitting patents for those items that are able to be patented. 

&#160;

EMPLOYEES 

&#160;

We presently have no employees. Staffing levels will be determined as we progress and grow. The level of employees is primarily contingent on the funds available for operations. TTE's Board of Directors will determine the compensation of all new employees based upon job description. 

&#160;
