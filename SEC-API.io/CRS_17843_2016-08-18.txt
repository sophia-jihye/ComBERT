 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

(a) &#160; &#32; General Development of Business: 

&#160; 

Carpenter Technology Corporation, incorporated in 1904, is engaged in the manufacturing, fabrication and distribution of specialty metals. As used throughout this report, unless the context requires otherwise, the terms &#8220;Carpenter&#8221;, &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;Registrant&#8221;, &#8220;Issuer&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to Carpenter Technology Corporation. 

&#160; 

(b) &#160; &#32; Financial Information About Segments: 

&#160; 

We are organized in two reportable business segments: Specialty Alloys Operations (&#8220;SAO&#8221;) and Performance Engineered Products (&#8220;PEP&#8221;). See Note 18 &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; for additional segment reporting information. 

&#160; 

(c) &#160; &#32; Narrative Description of Business: 

&#160; (1) &#160; &#32; General: 

&#160; 

We develop, manufacture and distribute cast/wrought and powder metal stainless steels and special alloys including high temperature (iron-nickel-cobalt base), stainless, superior corrosion resistant, controlled expansion alloys, ultra-high strength and implantable alloys, tool and die steels and other specialty metals, as well as cast/wrought titanium alloys. We also manufacture and rent down-hole drilling tools and components used in the oil and gas industry. 

&#160; 

We provide material solutions to the changing needs of the aerospace and defense, energy, transportation, medical and industrial and consumer industries. We have continued to increase our global manufacturing capacity as well as expand our operations to provide customers with solutions to today&#8217;s changing materials challenges. 

&#160; 

Reportable Segments 

&#160; 

The SAO segment is comprised of the Company&#8217;s major premium alloy and stainless steel manufacturing operations. This includes operations performed at mills primarily in Reading and Latrobe and surrounding areas in Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Alabama. The combined assets of the SAO operations are being managed in an integrated manner to optimize efficiency and profitability across the total system. 

&#160; 

The PEP segment is comprised of the Company&#8217;s differentiated operations. This segment includes the Dynamet titanium business, the Carpenter Powder Products business, the Amega West business, the Specialty Steel Supply business and the Latrobe and Mexico distribution businesses. The businesses in the PEP segment are managed with an entrepreneurial structure to promote speed and flexibility, and drive overall revenue and profit growth. 

(2) &#160; &#32; Raw Materials: 

&#160; 

Our business depends on continued delivery of critical raw materials for our day-to-day operations. These raw materials include nickel, cobalt, chromium, manganese, molybdenum, titanium, iron and scrap containing iron and nickel. Some of the sources of these raw materials, many of which are international, could be subject to potential interruptions of supply as a result of political events, labor unrest or other reasons. These potential interruptions could cause material shortages and affect availability and price. We have arrangements with certain vendors to provide consigned materials at our manufacturing facilities available for our consumption as necessary. 

&#160; 

We have long-term relationships with major suppliers who provide availability of material at competitive prices. Purchase prices of certain raw materials have historically been volatile. We use pricing surcharges, indexing mechanisms, base price adjustments and raw material forward contracts to reduce the impact of increased costs for the most significant of these materials. There can be delays between the time of the increase in the price of raw materials and the realization of the benefits of such mechanisms or actions that could have a short-term impact on our results and could affect the comparability of our results from period to period. 

&#160; 

(3) &#160; &#32; Patents and Licenses: 

&#160; 

We own a number of United States and international patents and have granted licenses under some of them. In addition, certain products that we produce are covered by patents held or owned by other companies from whom licenses have been obtained. The duration of a patent issued in the United States is between 14 and 20 years from the date of filing a patent application or issuance of the patents. The duration of patents issued outside of the United States vary from country to country. Generally, patent licenses are structured to match the duration of the underlying patent. Although these patents and licenses are believed to be of value, we do not consider our business to be materially dependent upon any single such item or related group of such items. 

&#160; 

(4) &#160; &#32; Seasonality of Business: 

&#160; 

Our sales are normally influenced by seasonal factors. Historically, our sales in the first two fiscal quarters (the respective three months ending September 30 and December 31) are typically the lowest &#8212; principally because of annual plant vacation and maintenance shutdowns by us, as well as by many of our customers. However, the timing of major changes in the general economy or the markets for certain products can alter this historical pattern. 

&#160; 

The chart below summarizes the percent of net sales by quarter for the past three fiscal years:

(5) &#160; &#32; Customers: 

&#160; 

On a consolidated basis, we are not dependent upon a single customer, or a very few customers, such that the loss of any one or more particular customers would have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated statement of income. One customer, Alcoa Inc., accounted for approximately 13 percent of net sales for the year ended June 30, 2016. No single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of net sales during fiscal years 2015 &#32;and 2014. Approximately 22 percent of the accounts receivable outstanding at June 30, 2016 is due from two customers, Alcoa Inc. and Precision Castparts Corporation. Approximately 17 percent of the accounts receivable outstanding at June 30, 2015 is due from one customer, Alcoa Inc. See Note 18 &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; for additional information. 

&#160; 

(6) &#160; &#32; Backlog: 

&#160; 

As of June 30, 2016 , we had a sales backlog of orders excluding surcharge, believed to be firm, of approximately $306 million, substantially all of which is expected to be shipped within fiscal year 2017. Our backlog of orders excluding surcharge as of June 30, 2015 &#32;was approximately $435 million. 

(7) &#160; &#32; Competition: 

&#160; 

Our business is highly competitive. We supply materials to a wide variety of end-use market sectors and compete with various companies depending on end-use market, product or geography. We are leaders in specialty materials for critical applications with over 125 years of metallurgical and manufacturing expertise. A significant portion of the products we produce are highly engineered materials for demanding applications. There are less than ten companies producing one or more similar products that we consider our major competitors for our high value products used in demanding applications, particularly in our Aerospace and Defense and Energy end-use markets. These products are generally required to meet complex customer product specifications and often require the materials to be qualified prior to supplying the customer orders. Our experience, technical capabilities, product offerings and research and development efforts that we have in our niche markets represent barriers to existing and potential competitors. 

&#160; 

For other products, there are several dozen smaller producing companies and converting companies that are also competitors, as well as several hundred independent distributors of products similar to those distributed by us. Additionally, numerous foreign companies produce various specialty metal products similar to those produced by us. Furthermore, a number of different products may, in certain instances, be substituted for our finished products. 

(8) &#160; &#32; Research, Product and Process Development: 

&#160; 

Our expenditures for company-sponsored research and development were $16.3 million, $18.7 million and $18.5 million in fiscal years 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. We believe that our ability to be an innovator in special material development and manufacturing processes has been and will continue to be an important factor in the success of the Company. Our worldwide staff of expert metallurgists, research and development scientists, engineers and service professionals work closely with our customers to identify and provide innovative solutions to specific product requirements. 

(9) &#160; &#32; Environmental Regulations: 

&#160; 

We are subject to various stringent federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations relating to pollution, protection of public health and the environment, natural resource damages and occupational safety and health. Management evaluates the liability for future environmental remediation costs on a quarterly basis. We accrue amounts for environmental remediation costs representing management&#8217;s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable costs relating to environmental remediation. For further information on environmental remediation, see the Contingencies section included in Item 7. &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221;. 

&#160; 

Our costs of maintaining and operating environmental control equipment were $13.5 million, $14.8 million and $13.3 million for fiscal years 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. The capital expenditures for environmental control equipment were $0.7 million, $0.5 million and $2.2 million for fiscal years 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. We anticipate spending approximately $3 million on major domestic environmental capital projects over the next five fiscal years. This includes approximately $1 million in fiscal year 2017. Due to the possibility of future regulatory developments, the amount of future capital expenditures may vary from these estimates. 

&#160; 

(10) &#160; &#32; Employees: 

&#160; 

As of June 30, 2016 , our total workforce consisted of approximately 4,500 employees, which included approximately 125 production employees in Washington, Pennsylvania who are covered under a collective bargaining agreement which expires on August 31, 2016, and approximately 440 employees in Latrobe, Pennsylvania who are covered under a collective bargaining agreement which expires August 1, 2017. 

&#160; 

(d) &#160; &#32; Financial information about foreign and domestic operations and export sales: 

&#160; 

Sales outside of the United States, including export sales, were $569.9 million, $646.8 million and $635.1 million in fiscal years 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. Long-lived assets held outside of the United States were $28.0 million , $30.0 million and $27.5 million as of June 30, 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. For further information on domestic and international sales, see Note 18 &#32;to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221;.
