 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. &#160;

Our Business 

&#160;

Our mission is to be the leading provider of products and on-demand application services for the healthcare industry, specializing in bedside video monitoring, software tools to improve hospital communications and operations, and patient education and entertainment packages. Our proprietary, high-speed data network system is the next generation of patient care monitoring that allows real-time bedside and point-of-care video monitoring designed to improve patient safety and overall hospital costs. The entertainment packages and patient education enhance the patient&#8217;s quality of stay. Reported results from CareView-driven hospitals prove that our products reduce falls, reduce the cost of sitter fees, increase patient satisfaction and reduce bed turnaround time to increase patient flow. For patients, we have a convenient in-room, entertainment package that includes high-speed Internet, access to first-run on-demand movies and visual connectivity to family and friends from anywhere in the world. For the hospital, we offer tools to provide superior patient care, peace of mind and customer service satisfaction.

&#160;

Our CareView System &#174; suite of video monitoring, guest services and related applications connect patients, families and healthcare providers. Through the use of telecommunications technology and the Internet, our evolving products and on-demand services greatly increase the access to quality medical care and education for patients/consumers and healthcare professionals. We understand the importance of providing high quality patient care in a safe environment and believe in partnering with hospitals to improve the quality of patient care and safety by providing a system that monitors and records continuously. We are committed to providing an affordable video monitoring tool to improve the practice of nursing, create a better work environment and make the patient&#8217;s hospital stay more informative and satisfying. Our suite of products and services can simplify and streamline the task of preventing and managing patients&#8217; falls, enhance patient safety, improve quality of care and reduce costs associated with bringing information technology directly to patients, families and healthcare providers. Our products and services can be used in all types of hospitals, nursing homes, adult living centers and selected outpatient care facilities domestically and internationally.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

The CareView System secure video monitoring system connects the patient room to a touch-screen monitor at the nursing station, allowing nursing staff to maintain a level of visual contact with each patient. This configuration enhances the use of the nurse call system, reduces unnecessary steps to and from patient rooms, and the recording capability allows for a video record of all in-room activity during the length of the patient&#8217;s hospital stay. The CareView System suite can be easily configured to meet the individual privacy and security requirements of any hospital or nursing facility. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#8220;HIPAA&#8217;) compliant, patient approved video record can be included as part of the patient&#8217;s medical record and serves as additional documentation of bedside care, procedures performed, patient and hospital ancillary activities, safety or care incidents, support to necessitate additional clinical services, and, if necessary, as evidence. Additional HIPAA-compliance features allow privacy options to be enabled at any time by the patient, nurse or physician.

&#160;

In addition to patient safety and security, we also provides a suite of services to increase patient satisfaction scores and enhance the overall image of the hospital including first-run on-demand movies, Internet access via the patient&#8217;s television, and video visits with family and friends from most places throughout the world. Through continued investment in patient care technology, our products and services help hospitals and assisted living facilities build a safe, high quality healthcare delivery system that best serves the patient, while striving for the highest level of satisfaction and comfort.

&#160;

Our Products and Services 

&#160;

We offer a variety of products and services designed to meet individual hospital needs to enhance quality patient care and safety. Our services are offered with no capital expenditure by the hospital and do not require extensive integration with the facility&#8217;s management information system. For healthcare facilities looking for an effective, affordable and innovative way to improve performance throughout the facility, our products are the answer. CareView-driven facilities have shown documented success in reducing patient falls and sitter costs, improving overall patient satisfaction, streamlining and documenting patient education at the bedside, and improving patient flow and overcrowding. These successes protect the facilities&#8217; reimbursement from loss due to never events and poor patient satisfaction.

Pricing Structure and Revenue Streams 

&#160;

The CareView System suite is provided and installed in healthcare facilities at no charge to the facility after which we generate revenue from subscriptions to its services. We work with each hospital on pricing to offer an affordable package based on the demographics of the hospital&#8217;s patients. The pricing structure with each hospital is negotiated separately and may vary depending on the hospital&#8217;s desire to include premium services at no charge to the patient. Typically, we offer the Primary Package at a price per bed with varying price structures based on number of beds in each facility. The Guest Services Package is generally offered to the patient as a complimentary service of the hospital; however, hospitals have the option to charge their patients for these services. The hospital may elect to charge a package price for all services for any combination of days, including a package for the patient&#8217;s entire stay. Each facility may decide to bundle products for specialty pricing to the patients or may offer any or all services at no charge to the patient. All revenue generated by us during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was derived from the sale of the Primary Package, Additional CareView Products, Guest Services Package and related services to hospitals.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Products in Development 

&#160;

1. Alternative Sensors. We are in the research and development stages of using alternative sensors, such as thermal cameras, to improve automated monitoring of patient safety as well as other services. We expect the alternative sensors to be deliverable in fourth quarter of 2016. &#160;

2. Improved Asset Management and Tracking Module. We are in the research and development stages of overhauling the improved Asset Management and Tracking Module, based on new technology that provides improved precision, better performance, and is more accessible. We expect the improved Asset Management and Tracking Module to be deliverable in third quarter of 2016. &#160;

3. Improved Detection Algorithms. We are continuing to develop and hone new techniques and algorithms geared towards improving system functionality in the Virtual Bed Rails product. Advances include techniques based on machine learning and statistical probability. &#160;

4. Pressure Ulcer Monitor and Alarm Module. We are in the research and development stages of the Pressure Ulcer Monitor and Alarm module. This module will monitor the patient and identify if the patient is at risk for pressure ulcers through automated computer vision algorithms and techniques. We expect the Pressure Ulcer Monitor and Alarm module to be deliverable in the third quarter of 2016. &#160;

5. Business Intelligence Module. We are in the development stages of a Business Intelligence module. This module will collect and analyze data trends geared towards understanding improved patient safety, staff performance, and industry trends. We expect the Business Intelligence module to be available on or before September 30, 2016. &#160;

Products and Services Agreement with Healthcare Facilities 

&#160;

We offer our products and services through a subscription-based model with healthcare facilities through a Products and Services Agreement (the &#8220;P&#38;S Agreement(s)&#8221;). During the term of the P&#38;S Agreement, we provide continuous monitoring of the CareView System&#8217;s products and services deployed to the healthcare facility and maintain and service all equipment installed by us. Terms of each P&#38;S Agreement require the hospital to pay us a monthly subscription fee based on the number of selected, installed and activated services. None of the services provided through the Primary Package or GuestView are paid or reimbursed by any third party provider including insurance companies, Medicare or Medicaid. We also enter into corporate-wide agreements with health systems (the &#8220;Master Agreement(s)&#8221;), wherein the hospitals that are a part of a health system enter into individual facility level agreements that are substantially similar to our P&#38;S Agreements.

&#160;

Master Agreements and P&#38;S Agreements are currently negotiated for a period of five years with a minimum of two or three years; however, older P&#38;S Agreements were negotiated for a five year period with a provision for automatic renewal. P&#38;S Agreements specific to pilot programs (&#8220;P&#38;S Pilot Agreements&#8221;) contain pricing terms substantially similar to P&#38;S Agreements, are generally three or six-month in length and can be extended on a month to month basis as required. We own all rights, title, and interest in and to the equipment we install at each location and agree to maintain and repair it, although we may charge for repairs or replacements due to damage or misuse. We are not responsible for maintaining data arising from use of the CareView System or for transmission errors, corruption or compromise of data carried over local or interchange telecommunication carriers. We grant each medical facility a limited, revocable, non-transferable and non-exclusive license to use the software, network facilities, content and documentation on and in the CareView System suite to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to access, explore and otherwise use the CareView System suite in real time. Such non-exclusive license expires upon termination of the P&#38;S Agreement.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

We use specific terminology in an effort to better define and track the staging and billing of the individual components of the CareView System suite. The CareView System suite includes three components which are separately billed; the Room Control Platform (the &#8220;RCP&#8221;), the Nurse Station and mobile devices (each component referred to as a &#8220;unit&#8221;). The term &#8220;bed&#8221; refers to each hospital bed as part of the overall potential volume that a hospital represents. For example, if a hospital has 200 beds, the aggregate of those beds is the overall potential volume of that hospital. The term &#8220;bed&#8221; is often used interchangeably with &#8220;RCP&#8221; or &#8220;Room Control Platform&#8221; as this component of the system consistently resides within each hospital room where the &#8220;bed&#8221; is located. On average, there are six Nurse Stations for each 100 beds. The term &#8220;deployed&#8221; means that the units have been delivered to the hospital, but have not yet been installed at their respective locations within the hospital. The term &#8220;installed&#8221; means that the units have been mounted and are operational. The term &#8220;billable&#8221; refers to the aggregate of all units on which we charge fees. Units become billable once they are installed and the required personnel have been trained in their use. Units are only deployed upon the execution of a P&#38;S Agreement or P&#38;S Pilot Agreement.

&#160;

Community Health Systems, Inc. 

&#160;

In January 2014, Community Health Systems, Inc. (&#8220;CHS&#8221;) acquired Hospital Management Associates, Inc. (&#8220;HMA&#8221;). Post-acquisition, CHS assumed our Master Agreement with HMA. Although that agreement expired on December 31, 2014, we continued to bill CHS on a month to month basis. On April 1, 2015, we closed a Master Agreement with CHS. Under the terms of the Master Agreement we have approximately 1,800 billable units. In early 2016, Mat-Su Regional Medical Center, a legacy CHS facility completed policy revision for patient video monitoring for CHS. With the policy revision complete, we have approval to contact all CHS facilities. We have had meeting with CHS market leaders and their Chief Nursing Officer and have their support, which could result in a potential roll-out of approximately 15,000 additional beds out of their estimated 27,000 staffed beds.

&#160;

Tenet Healthsystem Medical, Inc. 

&#160;

In February 2014, we entered into a Master Agreement with Tenet Healthsystem Medical, Inc. (&#8220;Tenet&#8221;). The terms of the Master Agreement provide for the execution of a facilities level agreement with each hospital. Currently we have approximately 1,300 billable units and anticipate adding approximately 1,000 units on or before June 30, 2016. Thereafter, we anticipate a continued roll-out with the potential for an approximate 6,500 additional beds out of their estimated 18,000 staffed beds.

&#160;

Kaiser Permanente 

&#160;

We currently have approximately 400 billable units in seven Kaiser Permanente (&#8220;Kaiser&#8221;) facilities. In April and May 2014, we executed P&#38;S Pilot Agreements with Kaiser&#8217;s Baldwin Park and Panorama City facilities, respectively. This is in addition to our P&#38;S Pilot Agreement with Kaiser Orange County covering its facilities in Anaheim and Irvine, California which was executed in October 2013. The P&#38;S Pilot Agreements for these four facilities provide for a monthly renewal until termination or replacement by a Master Agreement or individual P&#38;S Agreements. We are now in the process of finalizing a conversion from a P&#38;S Pilot Agreement to a P&#38;S Agreement with Kaiser Orange County for approximately 225 beds installed in the Anaheim and Irvine hospitals. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

In 2015 we executed P&#38;S Pilot Agreements with Kaiser&#8217;s Northern California division for installation of the CareView System in San Francisco Medical Center, Santa Clara Medical Center and South Sacramento Medical Center. We are awaiting instructions before installation can be completed, however we expect to have all three facilities installed and billable on or before September 30, 2016. We are also in the process of finalizing negotiations for installation of the CareView System in Kaiser&#8217;s facility in San Jose, California. We anticipate that the timing of the San Jose installation will coincide with the other facility in the Northern California Region.

&#160;

In early 2016 we commenced discussions with Kaiser Northwest Region for deployment of the CareView System in Kaiser Hospital in Oregon. We are currently in the process of finalizing negotiations with the Northwest Region for installation of the CareView System in two other facilities, the Westside Medical Center and the Sunnyside Medical Center, for an anticipated total of 159 units. We anticipate having finalized P&#38;S Pilot Agreements on or before June 30, 2016. After a successful pilot, in February 2016 we executed a P&#38;S Agreement with Kaiser&#8217;s Los Angeles Medical Center for a total of 136 units. We are also in pilot discussions with the Kaiser facilities in the San Diego area for installation in San Diego Medical Center/Kaiser Foundation Hospital and future installation in the currently under construction Medical Center in Central San Diego.

&#160;

While we are continuing our sales efforts at the hospital and regional level, there are still discussions regarding a possible Master Agreement. Notwithstanding those discussions we will continue to sell into other Kaiser Regions and look to convert our P&#38;S Pilot Agreements into P&#38;S Agreements that can be replaced by a Master Agreement if and when one is finalized.

&#160;

Parkland 

&#160;

In June 2015 we signed a P&#38;S Agreement with Dallas County Hospital District d/b/a Parkland Health &#38; Hospital System (&#8220;Parkland&#8221;) to install 408 units.

&#160;

Hospital Corporation of America 

&#160;

In February 2015, we executed a P&#38;S Pilot Agreement for 280 beds with Hospital Corporation of America (&#8220;HCA&#8221;) to install the CareView System in their Research Medical Center facility located in Kansas City, Missouri. HCA intends to use all CareView products including NurseView, Virtual Bed Rails, BedView, Patient Services, CareView Connect mobile product and have expressed interest in our Asset Management and Tracking product.

&#160;

In October 2015, we signed a P&#38;S Pilot Agreement for 40 beds with Blake Medical Center, a hospital in HCA&#8217;s West Florida Division. The pilot will run from December 2015 through March 2016. We expect to execute two additional P&#38;S Pilot Agreement with hospitals in HCA&#8217;s West Florida Division, Medical Center of Trinity and Northside Medical Center for approximately 50 beds each during the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Initial feedback is positive and we expect that the CareView System will be further rolled out to the other 14 hospitals in the West Florida Division. The West Florida Division has approximately 3,600 staffed beds.

&#160;

Banner Health 

&#160;

In June 2015 we entered into a P&#38;S Pilot Agreement with Banner Desert Medical Center for 73 beds which became billable in November 2015. At the request of Banner, we executed an amendment to that agreement to extend the pilot term to one year. The preliminary results have been good and we anticipate rolling out to the rest of the Banner Health System following the successful conclusion of this pilot. Banner Health has approximately 4,400 staffed bed in 24 facilities.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Summary of Product and Service Usage 

&#160;

The following table shows the number of healthcare facilities using our products and services including the number of deployed units, installed units and billable units as of February 29, 2016. The table also shows the number of pilot programs in place and hospital proposals pending approval, estimated bed count if the pilot programs and pending proposals result in executed P&#38;S Agreement, and the estimated total number of licensed beds available under the pilot programs and hospital proposals. There are no assurances that the pilot programs will be extended or the pending proposals will be approved to ultimately result in the number of estimated beds. Further, there are no assurances that we will have access to the total number of licensed beds in each healthcare facility.

&#160;

Installed Hospitals &#160; &#160; Installed Units &#160; &#160; Billable Units &#160; &#160; Total Staffed Beds in Contracted/ Pilot Hospitals &#160; &#160; Potential Units Available Under Current Contract/ Pilot Contracts (*) &#160; &#160; Units in Negotiation Prior to Contract/ Pilot &#160; &#160; 107 &#160; &#160; &#160; 9,211 &#160; &#160; &#160; 8,136 &#160; &#160; &#160; 121,956 &#160; &#160; &#160; 84,668 &#160; &#160; &#160; 49,972 &#160; &#160;

&#160;

(*) This number represents management&#8217;s best estimate of the number of units available to us in hospitals that are currently under Master, P&#38;S or Pilot P&#38;S Agreements. We assume that in any given acute care facility, our products and services are appropriate for deployment in approximately 70% of the total staffed beds. If we have specific information from a current contracted or pilot hospital that the number of potential units in that hospital is either higher or lower than 70%, specific number has been used in the aggregate estimate.

&#160;

Availability of Suppliers 

&#160;

We are not dependent on, nor do we expect to become dependent on, any one or a limited number of suppliers. We purchase parts and components to assemble our equipment and products. We do not manufacture or fabricate our own products or systems, but rely on sub-suppliers and third party vendors to procure and/or fabricate components based on our designs, engineering and specifications. We enter into subcontracts for field installation of our products which we supervise. We manage all technical, physical and commercial aspects of the performance of our contracts with sub-suppliers and third party vendors. To date, we have experienced no difficulties in obtaining fabricated components, materials and parts or in identifying qualified subcontractors for installation work.

&#160;

Sales, Marketing and Customer Service 

&#160;

We do not consider our business to be seasonal, however the availability of hospital staff is typically less available in December which impacts our ability to sale/install our CareView System. We generate sales leads through a variety of means including direct one-to-one marketing, email and web campaigns, customer and industry referrals, strategic partnerships, and trade shows and events. Our sales team consists of highly trained professionals with many years of experience in the healthcare market.

&#160;

Our initial focus has been to pursue large for-profit hospital management companies that own multiple facilities and large not-for-profit integrated delivery networks in major metropolitan areas. Our sales staff approaches decision makers for hospitals, integrated delivery networks, and major owners and operators of hospitals to demonstrate the CareView product line. In 2013, we expanded our sales process to include an inside sales team and have expanded our capabilities of providing web-based demonstrations and presentations. In addition, we have begun to rely more heavily on arranging reference calls and site visits between our current customers and our prospects. These efforts have provided a higher volume of qualified sales leads and have resulted in more substantive conversations with a larger number of prospects.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

We entered into an exclusive National Business Development Services Agreement (&#8220;NBDS Agreement&#8221;) with Relamatrix Group, Inc. (&#8220;RMG&#8221;) through which RMG facilitated business opportunities for CareView. The NBDS Agreement terminated on January 31, 2014. We may still be liable to pay fees to RMG if we actually contract with hospitals initiated through them. Through the date of this filing, we have not entered into any contracts related with hospitals introduced by RMG.

&#160;

We ensure high levels of customer service through our account representatives and through our technical support processes. We attempt to position our account representatives geographically close to our customer hospitals to allow them to make regular visits to proactively train staff and address any issues. We offer 24/7 monitoring and phone support through our technical support team which allows us to quickly identify and resolve any technical issues. From time to time we are called upon to service the installed hardware at customer facilities. To facilitate expedient service, our account representatives typically maintain a small supply of RCPs should they need repair or replacement. Historically, our RCPs and Nursing Station units have required little, if any, servicing. We believe that we handle requests quickly and efficiently, and that overall, our customers are satisfied with our level of service.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Our intellectual property portfolio is one of the means by which we attempt to protect our competitive position. We rely primarily on a combination of know-how, trade secrets, patents, trademarks and contractual restrictions to protect our products and to maintain our competitive position. We are constantly seeking ways to protect our intellectual property through registrations in relevant jurisdictions.

&#160;

We have received patents from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and have numerous patents pending. We intend to file additional patent applications when appropriate; however, we may not file any such applications or, if filed, the patents may not be issued. We also have numerous registered trademarks.

&#160;

We intend to aggressively prosecute, enforce and defend our patents, trademarks and proprietary technology. The loss, by expiration or otherwise, of any one patents may have a material effect on our business. Defense and enforcement of our intellectual property rights can be expensive and time consuming, even if the outcome is favorable to us. It is possible that the patents issued to or licensed to us will be successfully challenged, that a court may find that we are infringing validly issued patents of third parties, or that we may have to alter or discontinue the development of our products or pay licensing fees to take into account patent rights of third parties.

&#160;

Joint Venture with Rockwell Holdings 

&#160;

On November 16, 2009, we entered into a joint venture relationship with Rockwell Holdings I, LLC, a Wisconsin limited liability company (&#8220;Rockwell&#8221;), wherein two Wisconsin limited liability companies were formed, CareView-Hillcrest, LLC (&#8220;CareView-Hillcrest&#8221;) and CareView-Saline, LLC (&#8220;CareView-Saline&#8221;) (together known as the &#8220;Project LLCs&#8221;). Under the terms of a Master Investment Agreement, CareView and Rockwell each own 50% of the Project LLCs with Rockwell providing the financing and CareView providing the technology and expertise to fully implement the CareView System in Hillcrest Medical Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma and Saline Memorial Hospital in Benton, Arkansas. Pursuant to the terms of the Operating Agreements of each of the Project LLCs, we are the managing member. We consolidate the Project LLCs as we have the power to direct the activities and an obligation to absorb losses.

&#160;

On March 18, 2014, the Project Notes and Rockwell&#8217;s Preferential Returns, previously due on June 30, 2014 (the &#8220;June 2014 extensions&#8221;), were extended to June 30, 2015. On February 19, 2015, the Project Notes and Rockwell&#8217;s Preferential Returns were extended to June 30, 2016.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

In conjunction with an August 2013 extension of the due dates of the Project Notes and Rockwell&#8217;s Preferential Returns to December 31, 2013, the expiration date of the Project Warrant was also extended from November 16, 2014 to November 16, 2015. In October 2015, the expiration date of the Project Warrant was further extended from November 16, 2015 to November 16, 2017. In both cases, all other provisions of the Project Warrant remained unchanged. The Project Warrant were revalued in August 2013 resulting in a $25,327 increase in fair value, which has been recorded as non-cash costs included in general and administration expense in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Project Warrant were also revalued in October 2015 resulting in a $102,457 increase in fair value, which has been recorded as non-cash costs included in general and administration expense in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. CareView, as 50% owner of the LLCs, is currently negotiating with Rockwell to settle the debt of the LLCs. Although CareView anticipates that this settlement will be forthcoming in the near future, CareView and the LLCs can give no assurances that a settlement will be negotiated, or if negotiated and settled, that it will be through the issuance of CareView&#8217;s Common Stock.

&#160;

Installation and Technical Support 

&#160;

We provide installation and technical support for our customers through third-party providers located across the United States that we contract on a per-job basis.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We offer products in four distinct categories: clinical video monitoring and fall prevention, patient education and entertainment, patient flow, and mobile communications. We have competitors in each of these product areas; however, we believe that we offer the only integrated suite of products that combines all of these areas into one cost-effective platform. Some of our competitors may be larger, may have greater financial resources, and may have a longer history than us. We compete with them based on price, engineering and technological expertise, knowledge, and the quality of our products, systems and services. Additionally, we believe that the successful performance of our installed products and systems is a key factor in retaining current business and gaining new business as customers typically prefer to make significant purchases from a company with a solid performance history.

Clinical Video Monitoring and Fall Prevention: Cisco Systems, Inc., Avasure (a division of AvaSure Holdings, Inc.), and Royal Philips Electronics all provide clinical video monitoring tools. Cisco offers Virtual Patient Observation, a video monitoring tool aimed at reducing sitter costs and preventing patient falls. AvaSure offers a similar application using cameras mounted on a rolling camera stand, aimed at preventing patient falls. Philips offers the eICU product, which primarily targets a high-definition monitoring of patients in intensive-care applications and also provides telephonic consults.

&#160;

Alternative fall prevention mechanisms include physical sensors manufactured by Stanley and Posey, and beds which include fall alarms manufactured by Stryker and Hill-Rom. Customers may consider these physical fall prevention mechanisms to be alternatives to a video-based fall prevention system such as the one we offer.

&#160;

Patient Education and Entertainment: There are many vendors who offer patient entertainment products, and most of them also provide a portal for accessing patient educational content either authored by themselves or by third parties. Our major competitors include The GetWellNetwork (privately held by Welsh, Carson, Anderson and Stowe), Skylight Healthcare Systems, and Sonifi Solutions, Inc., all of which offer interactive patient communications systems.

&#160;

Patient Flow: These systems may be called patient flow, census, bed tracking, patient tracking, or &#8220;bed board&#8221; applications. Our major competitors include companies that offer focused solutions such as TeleTracking Technologies, Inc., Aionex, Inc., and BedWatch, Inc. Additionally some Electronic Medical Record vendors offer similar products which may compete with our patient flow product.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Mobile Communications: Some competitors offer mobile communications on smart phones or voice-activated pendants which operate over the hospitals Wi-Fi system, including Vocera, Inc., and Voalte, Inc. Other competitors offer special-purpose phones that operate on the cellular network or other wireless technology, and provide notifications to caregivers within the hospital.

&#160;

The clinical systems offered by our competitors do not appear to offer a video monitoring and observation option as provided by our system. It appears that we are the only company that offers solutions in more than one of the categories listed above.

&#160;

In addition to favorable economics and enhanced patient care, safety and satisfaction, we also compete on the basis of quality of services provided. Our management believes that our GuestView patient services suite will provide revenue protection for our contracted hospitals under the Value Based Purchasing initiative which is part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, prompting hospitals to focus on Patient Satisfaction and Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems to (i) prompt each healthcare facility to promote patients&#8217; use of NetView, MovieView, and PatientView, and (ii) encourage the hospital to expand its use of pre-procedure and condition videos, welcome videos, and other ancillary services.

&#160;

We believe we also compete based on the success of our products and services which provide our customers with:

&#160;

&#183; significant and tangible cost savings, 

&#183; reductions in patient falls and pressure ulcers, 

&#183; improved documentation, quality and timeliness of patient care, 

&#183; enhanced safety and security for patients and facilities, 

&#183; support for new technologies, 

&#183; business growth, 

&#183; return on investment, and 

&#183; enhanced patient satisfaction. &#160;

We are currently unable to predict what competitive impact any regulatory development and advances in technology will have on our future business and results of operations. We believe our success depends upon our ability to maintain and enhance the performance, content and reliability of our products in response to the evolving demands of the industry and any competitive products that may emerge. We cannot give assurances that we will be able to do so successfully or that any enhancements or new products that we introduce will gain acceptance in the marketplace. If we are not successful or if our products are not accepted, we could lose potential customers to our competitors.

Major Customers 

&#160;

We derive all of our revenues from hospitals. For the year ended December 31, 2015 96 hospitals accounted for all of our revenue. During 2015, IASIS Healthcare Corporation (&#8220;IASIS&#8221;), CHS and Tenet, accounted for 30%, 20% and 15% of our net revenues, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2014, 91 hospitals accounted for the all of our net revenue. During that period, IASIS, CHS and Tenet accounted for 49%, 21% and 12% of our net revenues, respectively.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Backlog 

&#160;

Our estimated backlog is driven by signed Master and P&#38;S Agreements. Each Master and P&#38;S Agreement establishes the rates that we will charge for the use of our products and services as well as an approximate number of billable units that will be installed. Our RCPs, Nursing Stations and mobile devices are billed on a per unit basis. Most Master and P&#38;S Agreements are for five years but include options to cancel after a minimum of two or three years. Backlog, which covers the non-cancellable period, as of December 31, 2015 is approximately $8,700,000, of which approximately $5,400,000 is expected to be billed during 2016. Most of the current backlog will have future value as the Master and P&#38;S Agreements continue beyond the minimum two or three years and the Master and P&#38;S Agreements move toward expiration and potential renewal. The amount of the non-cancellable backlog to be billed beyond December 31, 2016 is approximately $3,300,000.

&#160;

Research and Development Activities 

&#160;

The cost of our research and development activities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 totaled approximately $1,086,000 and $843,000, respectively. None of the cost of such activities was borne directly by our customers. To date, we have not performed any customer-sponsored research and development activities relating to any new products or services.

&#160;

Governmental Approval 

&#160;

Neither our Company nor our products are subject to government approval beyond required Federal Communication Commission (&#8220;FCC&#8221;) certifications. Certain medical devices and applications may be subject to Section 510(k) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act, which regulates the ability of medical device manufacturers to market their devices. CareView has reviewed the requirements for registration, and at the current time, we do not believe that our suite of applications is subject to 510(k) regulation. Although the parameters of our CareView System products and services complies with HIPAA as far as use by health care providers, CareView itself, as the manufacturer and installer of the units, is not subject to HIPAA regulations. We do not know of any other privacy laws that affect our business as we are not in control of nor do we keep patient medical records in our possession. We are unaware of any probable government regulations that may affect our business in the future. We have received Underwriters Laboratories (&#8220;UL&#8221;) and FCC approval on our products. Additionally, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services does not pay or reimburse any party for use of our products and services.
