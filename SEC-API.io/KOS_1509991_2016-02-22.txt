General 

Kosmos is a leading independent oil and gas exploration and production company focused on frontier and emerging areas along the Atlantic Margin. Our assets include existing production and development projects offshore Ghana, large discoveries offshore Mauritania and Senegal, as well as exploration licenses with significant hydrocarbon potential offshore Portugal, Sao Tome and Principe, Suriname, Morocco and Western Sahara. Kosmos is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) and is traded under the ticker symbol KOS. 

Kosmos was founded in 2003 to find oil in under &#8209;explored or overlooked parts of West Africa. Members of the management team&#8212;who had previously worked together making significant discoveries and developing them in Africa, the Gulf of Mexico, and other areas&#8212;established the company on a single geologic concept that previously had been overlooked by others in the industry, the Late Cretaceous play system. 

Following our formation, we acquired multiple exploration licenses and proved the geologic concept with the discovery of the Jubilee Field within the Tano Basin in the deep waters offshore Ghana in 2007. This was the first of our discoveries offshore Ghana; it was one of the largest oil discoveries worldwide in 2007 and is considered one of the largest finds offshore West Africa during the last decade. As technical operator of the initial phase of the Jubilee Field, we planned and executed the development. Oil production from the Jubilee Field began in November 2010, just 42 months after initial discovery, a record for a deepwater development in this water depth in West Africa. Gross production from the Jubilee Field averaged approximately 102,500 Bopd for 2015 . 

Following our Initial Public Offering, we acquired several new exploration licenses and again proved our geologic concept with the Ahmeyim discovery in the deepwater offshore Mauritania in 2015. The Ahmeyim discovery (formerly known as Tortue) was one of the largest natural gas discoveries worldwide in 2015 and is believed to be the largest ever gas discovery offshore West Africa. We have since demonstrated the extension of the gas discovery into Senegal with the successful Guembeul-1 exploration well. 

Our business strategy focuses on achieving three key objectives: (1) maximize the value of our Ghana assets; (2) continue to explore and appraise the deepwater basin offshore Mauritania and Senegal to maximize and monetize value; and (3) increase value further through a high &#8209;impact exploration program to unlock new petroleum systems. In Ghana, we are focused on increasing production, cash flows and reserves from the Jubilee Field, the development of the Tweneboa &#8209;Enyenra &#8209;Ntomme (&#8220;TEN&#8221;) project, and the appraisal and development of our other Ghanaian discoveries. In Mauritania and Senegal, we expect to efficiently appraise and develop our current Ahmeyim discovery as well as continue to test our inventory of oil and gas prospects. We have a large inventory of leads and prospects in the remainder of our exploration portfolio which we plan to continue to build through new ventures and we plan to test this prospectivity targeting high impact opportunities along the Atlantic Margin. 

Our Business Strategy 

Grow proved reserves and production through exploration, appraisal and development 

In the near &#8209;term we plan to grow proved reserves and production by further developing and debottlenecking the Jubilee Field, including incorporating our Mahogany and Teak discoveries into the Greater Jubilee Full Field Development Plan (&#8220;GJFFDP&#8221;) and by completing the TEN development, which is expected to deliver first oil in the third quarter of 2016 through a second, dedicated FPSO. In the medium-term, growth could also be realized following the appraisal and ongoing assessment of commerciality and development over all or a portion of our new discoveries in Mauritania and Senegal. In the longer &#8209;term, we plan to drill exploration prospects, with the intent to provide further growth in reserves and ultimately production. 

&#160;

Successfully open and develop our offshore exploration plays 

We believe the prospects and leads potentially existing offshore Mauritania, Portugal, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Suriname and Western Sahara in particular provide a favorable opportunity to create substantial value through exploration drilling. Given the potential size of these prospects and leads, we believe that exploratory success in our operating areas could significantly add to our growth profile. 

Apply our entrepreneurial culture, which fosters innovation and creativity, to continue our successful exploration and development program 

We differentiate ourselves from other exploration and production companies through our approach to exploration and development. Our geoscientists and engineers are critical to the success of our business strategy. We have created an environment that enables them to focus their knowledge, skills and experience on finding and developing new fields. Culturally, we have an open, team &#8209;oriented work environment that fosters entrepreneurial, creative and contrarian thinking. This approach enables us to fully consider and understand both risk and reward, as well as deliberately and collectively pursue strategies that maximize value. This philosophy and approach was successfully utilized offshore Ghana, Mauritania and Senegal, resulting in the discovery of significant new petroleum systems, which the industry previously did not consider either prospective or commercially viable. 

Focus on optimally developing our discoveries to initial production 

We focus on field developments designed to accelerate production, deliver early learnings and maximize returns. In certain circumstances, we believe a phased approach can be employed to optimize full &#8209;field development through a better understanding of dynamic reservoir behavior and enable activities to be performed in a parallel rather than a sequential manner. A phased approach also facilitates refinement of the development plans based on experience gained in initial phases of production and by leveraging existing infrastructure as subsequent phases of development are implemented. Production and reservoir performance from the initial phase are monitored closely to determine the most efficient and effective techniques to maximize the recovery of reserves and returns. Other benefits include minimizing upfront capital costs, reducing execution risks through smaller initial infrastructure requirements, and enabling cash flow from the initial phase of production to fund a portion of capital costs for subsequent phases. In contrast, a traditional development approach consists of full appraisal, conceptual engineering, preliminary engineering, detail engineering, procurement and fabrication of facilities, development drilling and installation of facilities for the full &#8209;field development, all performed sequentially, before first production is achieved. This approach can considerably lengthen the time from discovery to first production. 

For example, post &#8209;discovery in 2007, first oil production from the Jubilee Field commenced in November 2010. This development timeline from discovery to first oil was significantly less than the seven to ten year industry average and set a record for a deepwater development of this size and scale at this water depth in West Africa. This condensed timeline reflects the lessons learned by our experienced team while leading other large scale deepwater developments. 

Additionally, we look to partner with high quality, industry partners with world &#8209;class development capabilities early in our exploration projects. This strategy is designed to ensure that upon successful exploration and appraisal activities, the project can benefit from development and production operations expertise provided by these partners, as we have done with BP plc (&#8220;BP&#8221;) in Morocco and Chevron Corporation (&#8220;Chevron&#8221;) in Suriname. 

Identify, access and explore emerging regions and hydrocarbon plays 

Our management and exploration teams have demonstrated an ability to identify regions and hydrocarbon plays that yield multiple large commercial discoveries. We focus on frontier and emerging areas that have been underexplored yet offer attractive commercial terms as a result of first &#8209;mover advantage. We expect to continue to use our systematic and proven geologically &#8209;focused approach in frontier and emerging petroleum systems where geological data suggests hydrocarbon accumulations are likely to exist, but where commercial discoveries have yet to be made. We believe this approach reduces the exploratory risk in poorly understood, under &#8209;explored or otherwise overlooked hydrocarbon basins that offer significant hydrocarbon potential. 

&#160;

This approach and focus, coupled with a first &#8209;mover advantage and our management and technical teams&#8217; discipline in execution, provide a competitive advantage in identifying and accessing new strategic growth opportunities. We expect to continue seeking new opportunities where hydrocarbons have not been discovered or produced in meaningful quantities by leveraging the reputation and relationships of our experienced technical and management teams. This includes our existing areas of interest as well as selectively expanding our reach into other locations. 

Farm &#8209;in opportunities may offer a way to participate in new venture opportunities to undertake exploration in emerging basins, new plays and fairways to enhance and optimize our portfolio. Consistent with this strategy, we may also evaluate potential corporate and asset acquisition opportunities as a source of new ventures to support and expand our asset portfolio. 

Maintain Financial Discipline 

We strive to maintain a conservative financial profile and strong balance sheet with ample liquidity. Typically, we fund exploration activities from a combination of production cash flows or partner carries, and development activities from a combination of production cash flows and debt. As of December 31, 2015 , we have approximately $1.8 billion of liquidity available to fund our opportunities. Additionally, we use derivative instruments to partially limit our exposure to fluctuations in oil prices and interest rates. We have an active commodity hedging program where we hedge a portion of our anticipated sales volumes on a two &#8209;to &#8209;three year rolling basis. As of December 31, 2015 , we have hedged positions covering 10.9 million barrels of oil from 2016 to 2018, which provide partial downside protection should Dated Brent oil prices remain below our floor prices. We also maintain insurance to partially protect against loss of production revenues from our Jubilee asset. 

Kosmos Exploration Approach 

Kosmos&#8217; exploration philosophy is deeply rooted in a fundamental, geologically &#8209;based approach geared toward the identification of misunderstood, under &#8209;explored or overlooked petroleum systems. This process begins with detailed geologic studies that methodically assess a particular region&#8217;s subsurface, with careful consideration given to those attributes that lead to working petroleum systems. The process includes basin modeling to predict oil or gas charge and fluid migration, as well as stratigraphic and structural analysis to identify reservoir/seal pair development and trap definition. This analysis integrates data from previously drilled wells where available and seismic data. Importantly, this approach also takes into account a detailed analysis of geologic timing to ensure that we have an appropriate understanding of whether the sequencing of geological events could promote and preserve hydrocarbon accumulation. Once an area is high &#8209;graded based on this play/fairway analysis, geophysical analysis based on new 3D seismic is conducted to identify prospective traps of interest. 

Alongside the subsurface analysis, Kosmos performs an analysis of country &#8209;specific risks to gain an understanding of the &#8220;above &#8209;ground&#8221; dynamics, which may influence a particular country&#8217;s relative desirability from an overall oil and natural gas operating and risk &#8209;adjusted return perspective. This process is employed in both areas that have existing oil and natural gas production, as well as those regions that have yet to achieve commercial hydrocarbon production. 

Once an area of interest has been identified, Kosmos targets licenses over the particular basin or fairway to achieve an early &#8209;mover or in many cases a first &#8209;mover advantage. In terms of license selection, Kosmos targets specific regions that have sufficient size to provide scale should the exploration concept prove successful. Kosmos also looks for long &#8209;term contract duration to enable the &#8220;right&#8221; exploration program to be executed, play type diversity to provide multiple exploration concept options, prospect dependency to enhance the chance of replicating success and sufficiently attractive fiscal terms to maximize the commercial viability of discovered hydrocarbons.

The Jubilee Field straddles the boundary between the West Cape Three Points (&#8220;WCTP&#8221;) petroleum contract and the Deepwater Tano (&#8220;DT&#8221;) petroleum contract offshore Ghana. Consistent with the Ghana Petroleum Exploration and Production Law of 1984 (PNDCL 84) (the &#8220;Ghanaian Petroleum Law&#8221;), the WCTP petroleum contract and DT petroleum contract and as required by Ghana&#8217;s Ministry of Petroleum (formerly Ghana&#8217;s Ministry of Energy and Petroleum), in order to optimize resource recovery in this field, we entered into the Unitization and Unit Operating Agreement (the &#8220;UUOA&#8221;) in July 2009 with Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (&#8220;GNPC&#8221;) and the other block partners of each of these two blocks. The UUOA governs the interests in and development of the Jubilee Field and created the Jubilee Unit from portions of the WCTP petroleum contract and the DT petroleum contract areas. 

(3) 

The Greater Tortue resource, which includes the Ahmeyim discovery in Mauritania Block C8 and the Guembeul discovery in the Senegal Saint Louis Offshore Profond Block, straddles the border between Mauritania and Senegal. We have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (&#8220;MOU&#8221;) signed by Societe des Petroles du Senegal (&#8220;PETROSEN&#8221;) and Societe Mauritanienne des Hydrocarbures et de Patrimoine Minier (&#8220;SMHPM&#8221;), the national oil companies of Senegal and Mauritania, respectively, which sets out the principles for an intergovernmental cooperation agreement for the development of the cross-border Greater Tortue resource.

In September 2015, GNPC exercised its WCTP petroleum contract option, with respect to the Mahogany and Teak discoveries, to acquire an additional paying interest of 2.5%. We signed the Jubilee Field Unit Expansion Agreement with our partners in November 2015. This allows for the Mahogany and Teak discoveries to be included in the GJFFDP. Upon approval of the GJFFDP by Ghana&#8217;s Ministry of Petroleum, (a) the Jubilee Unit will be expanded to include the Mahogany and Teak discoveries, (b) revenues and expenses associated with these discoveries will be at the Jubilee Unit interests, and (c) operatorship of the Mahogany and Teak discoveries will be transferred to Tullow as Jubilee Unit operator. These interest percentages give effect to the exercise of GNPC&#8217;s option and approval of the GJFFDP. Our paying interest on development activities in these discoveries is 26.9%. &#160; Our participating interest as of December 31, 2015 is 30.0%. Additionally, the WCTP Block partners have agreed they will take the steps necessary to transfer operatorship of the remaining portions of the WCTP Block to Tullow after approval of the GJFFDP by Ghana&#8217;s Ministry of Petroleum.

In March 2015, we closed a farm - out agreement covering our three license areas in Mauritania with Chevron . As a component of the consideration for the farm-out, Chevron was required to make an election by February 1, 2016, to either farm-in to the Tortue-1 exploration well by paying a disproportionate share of the costs incurred in drilling of the well or, alternatively elect to not farm-in to the Tortue-1 exploration well and pay a disproportionate share of the costs of a second contingent exploration or appraisal well in the contract areas, subject to maximum expenditure caps. Chevron failed to make this mandatory election by the required date. Consequently, pursuant to the terms of the farm-out agreement, Chevron has withdrawn from our Mauritania blocks. Subsequently, Chevron requested that we engage in discussions related to the possible reinstatement of Chevron&#8217;s interests in our Mauritania blocks and such discussions are ongoing. However, if no such agreement is reached in these discussions, Chevron&#8217;s 30% non-operated participating interest will be reassigned to us (subject to requisite government approvals), and our participating interests in the Block C8, C12 and C13 petroleum contracts will be 90%.

&#160;

Ghana 

The WCTP Block and DT Block are located within the Tano Basin, offshore Ghana. This basin contains a proven world &#8209;class petroleum system as evidenced by our discoveries. 

The Tano Basin represents the eastern extension of the Deep Ivorian Basin which resulted from the development of an extensional sedimentary basin caused by tensional forces associated with opening of the Atlantic Ocean, as South America separated from Africa in the Mid &#8209;Cretaceous period. The Tano Basin forms part of the resulting transform margin which extends from Sierra Leone to Nigeria. 

The Tano Basin sediments comprise a thick Upper Cretaceous, deepwater turbidite sequence which, in combination with a modest Tertiary section, provided sufficient thickness to mature an early to Mid &#8209;Cretaceous source rock in the central part of the Tano Basin. This well &#8209;defined reservoir and charge fairway forms the play which, when draped over the South Tano high (a structural high dipping into the basin), resulted in the formation of trapping geometries. 

The primary reservoir types consist of well &#8209;imaged Turonian and Campanian aged submarine fans situated along the steeply dipping shelf margin and trapped in an up dip direction by thinning of the reservoir and/or faults. Many of our discoveries have similar trap geometries. 

The following is a brief discussion of our discoveries to date on our license areas offshore Ghana. 

Jubilee Discovery 

The Jubilee Field was discovered by Kosmos in 2007, with first oil produced in November 2010. Appraisal activities confirmed that the Jubilee discovery straddled the WCTP and DT Blocks. Pursuant to the terms of the UUOA, the discovery area was unitized for purposes of joint development by the WCTP and DT Block partners. Our current unit interest is 24.1%. 

The Jubilee Field is a combination structural &#8209;stratigraphic trap with reservoir intervals consisting of a series of stacked Upper Cretaceous Turonian &#8209;aged, deepwater turbidite fan lobe and channel deposits. 

The Jubilee Field is located approximately 37 miles offshore Ghana in water depths of approximately 3,250 to 5,800 feet, which led to the decision to implement an FPSO based development. The FPSO is designed to provide water and natural gas injection to support reservoir pressure, to process and store oil and to export gas through a pipeline to the mainland. The Jubilee Field is being developed in a phased approach. The Phase 1 development focused on partial development of certain reservoirs in the Jubilee Field. The Kosmos &#8209;led Integrated Project Team (&#8220;IPT&#8221;) successfully executed the initial 17 well development plan, which included nine producing wells that produced through subsea infrastructure to the &#8220;Kwame Nkrumah&#8221; FPSO, six water injection wells and two natural gas injection wells. This initial phase provided subsea infrastructure capacity for additional production and injection wells to be drilled in future phases of development. 

The Phase 1A development provided further development to the currently producing Jubilee Field reservoirs. The Phase 1A development included the drilling of eight additional wells consisting of five production wells and three water injection wells. Approval was given for an additional well, a gas injector, considered as part of Phase 1A. The Phase 1A Addendum PoD was submitted to the Ministry of Petroleum in June 2015 and deemed approved in July 2015 to enable drilling and completion of two additional wells consisting of one production well and one water injection well. 

In November 2015, we signed the Jubilee Field Unit Expansion Agreement with our partners to allow for the development of the Mahogany and Teak discoveries through the Jubilee FPSO and infrastructure. The expansion of the Jubilee Unit becomes effective upon approval of the GJFFDP by Ghana&#8217;s Ministry of Petroleum. The GJFFDP was submitted to the government of Ghana in December 2015. The GJFFDP includes further development of the three producing reservoirs and final development of the two remaining reservoirs to maximize ultimate recovery and asset value. 

&#160;

The Government of Ghana completed the construction and connection of a gas pipeline from the Jubilee Field to transport natural gas to the mainland for processing and sale. In November 2014, the transportation of gas produced from the Jubilee Field commenced through the gas pipeline to the onshore gas plant. However, the uptime of the facility during 2016 and in future periods is not known. In the absence of the continuous export of large quantities of natural gas from the Jubilee Field it is anticipated that we will need to flare such natural gas. Currently, we have not been issued an amended permit from the Ghana Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;Ghana EPA&#8221;) to flare natural gas produced from the Jubilee Field in substantial quantities. Our inability to continuously export associated natural gas in large quantities from the Jubilee Field could impact our oil production. 

In prior years, certain near wellbore productivity issues were identified, impacting several Phase 1 production wells. We have also experienced mechanical issues in the Jubilee Field, including failures of our water injection facilities on the FPSO and water and gas injection wells. This equipment downtime negatively impacted past oil production. The Jubilee Unit partners identified a means of successfully mitigating the near wellbore productivity issues with ongoing acid stimulation treatments and we are in the process of correcting the mechanical issues experienced in the Jubilee Field. 

Oil production from the Jubilee Field averaged approximately 102,500 &#160; barrels (gross) of oil per day during 2015 . 

Following a February 2016 inspection of the turret area of the FPSO, by SOFEC, Inc. (&#8220;SOFEC&#8221;), the original turret manufacturer, a potential issue was identified with the turret bearing. As a precautionary measure, additional operating procedures to monitor the turret bearing and reduce the degree of rotation of the vessel are being put in place. 

SOFEC will now undertake further offshore examinations and Tullow will work with SOFEC to determine what further measures will be required. Oil production and gas export is continuing as normal. 

Deepwater Tano Block Discoveries 

The Tweneboa, Enyenra and Ntomme fields are located in the western and central portions of the DT Block, approximately 30 miles offshore Ghana in water depths of approximately 3,300 to 5,700 feet. In November 2012, we submitted a declaration of commerciality and PoD over the TEN discoveries. In May 2013, the government of Ghana approved the TEN PoD. The discoveries are being jointly developed with shared infrastructure and a single FPSO. 

The TEN fields consist of multiple stratigraphic traps with reservoir intervals consisting of a series of stacked Upper Cretaceous Turonian &#8209;aged, deepwater fan lobes and channel deposits. Fluid samples recovered from the fields indicate an oil gravity of approximately 31 &#8209;35 degrees API and a natural gas condensate gravity of between 41 and 48 degrees API. 

The TEN development is being developed in a phased manner. The plan of development for TEN was designed to include an expandable subsea system that would provide for multiple phases. Phase 1 of the TEN development includes the drilling and completion of up to 17 wells, 11 of which have been drilled and are being completed. Seven additional development wells are expected to be drilled during Phase 2. The remaining Phase 1 and Phase 2 wells are a combination of production wells and water or gas injection wells needed to maximize recovery. The remainder of Phase 1 and all Phase 2 drilling is dependent on the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (the &#8220; ITLOS&#8221;) ruling expected by late 2017. 

The TEN development is on schedule and expected to deliver first oil in the third quarter of 2016 and is expected to increase towards the FPSO capacity of 80,000 barrels (gross) per day as the phased development progresses. Future development of gas resources at the TEN development is anticipated following the commencement of oil production. 

The Wawa &#8209;1 exploration well intersected oil and gas &#8209;condensate in a Turonian &#8209;aged turbidite channel system. Pressure data shows that it is a separate accumulation from the TEN fields. Following additional appraisal and evaluation, a decision regarding the commerciality of the Wawa discovery will be made by the DT Block partners. 

&#160;

Should the discovery be declared commercial, a PoD would be prepared for submission to Ghana&#8217;s Ministry of Petroleum within six months of the declaration of commerciality. 

West Cape Three Points Block Discoveries 

Mahogany is located within the WCTP Block, southeast of the Jubilee Field. The field is approximately 37 miles offshore Ghana in water depths of approximately 4,100 to 5,900 feet. We believe the field is a combination stratigraphic &#8209;structural trap with reservoir intervals contained in a series of stacked Upper Cretaceous Turonian &#8209;aged, deepwater fan lobe and channel deposits. 

The Teak discovery is located in the western portion of the WCTP Block, northeast of the Jubilee Field. The field is approximately 31 miles offshore Ghana in water depths of approximately 650 to 3,600 feet. We believe the field is a structural &#8209;stratigraphic trap with an element of four &#8209;way closure. 

The Akasa discovery is located in the western portion of the WCTP Block approximately 31 miles offshore Ghana in water depths of approximately 3,200 to 5,050 feet. The discovery is southeast of the Jubilee Field. We believe the target reservoirs are channels and lobes that are stratigraphically trapped. The Akasa &#8209;1 well intersected oil bearing reservoirs in the Turonian zones. Fluid samples recovered from the well indicate an oil gravity of 38 degrees API. 

The GJFFDP incorporating the Mahogany and Teak discoveries was submitted to the Ghanaian Ministry of Petroleum in December 2015. While we are currently in discussions with the government of Ghana, we can give no assurance that approval by the Ministry of Petroleum will be forthcoming in a timely manner or at all. We signed the Jubilee Field Unit Expansion Agreement with our partners in November 2015. This allows for the Mahogany and Teak discoveries to be developed contemporaneously with the Jubilee Field. Upon approval of the GJFFDP by the Ministry of Petroleum, the Jubilee Unit will be expanded to include the Mahogany and Teak discoveries and revenues and expenses associated with these discoveries will be at the Jubilee Unit interests. We are currently in discussions with the government of Ghana regarding additional technical studies and evaluation that we want to conduct before we are able to make a determination regarding commerciality of the Akasa discovery. Additionally, the WCTP Block partners have agreed they will take the steps necessary to transfer operatorship of the remaining portions of the WCTP Block to Tullow after approval of the GJFFDP by Ghana&#8217;s Ministry of Petroleum. 

Mauritania 

We are operator of three Offshore Blocks, C8, C12 and C13, which are located on the western margin of the Mauritania Salt Basin. Our blocks both include and are adjacent to proven petroleum systems, with our primary targets being Cretaceous sediments in structural and stratigraphic traps. We believe that the Triassic salt basin formed at the onset of rifting and contains Jurassic, Cretaceous and Tertiary passive margin sequences of limestones, sandstone and shales. Interpretation of available geologic and geophysical data has identified Cretaceous basin floor channels and fans in trapping geometries outboard of the Salt Basin. Cretaceous source rocks penetrated by wells and typed to oils in the Mauritania Salt Basin are the same age as those which charge other oil and gas fields in the Late Cretaceous of West Africa. 

Our acreage is located outboard of the Chinguetti Field and range in water depth from 4,900 to 9,800 feet. These blocks cover an aggregate area of approximately 6.6 million acres. We have obtained approximately 6,000 line-kilometers of 2D seismic data and 10,300 square kilometers of 3D seismic data covering portions of our blocks in Mauritania. Based on these 2D and 3D seismic programs, we have identified numerous prospects in our blocks and we continue to integrate the results of our successful drilling program in Mauritania to further evaluate our reservoir model and delineate prospectivity. 

&#160;

The following is a brief discussion of our discoveries to date in Block C8 offshore Mauritania. 

Block C8 Discoveries 

The Ahmeyim discovery (formerly named Tortue) is located in Block C8 offshore Mauritania. The discovery is a significant, play-opening gas discovery for the outboard Cretaceous petroleum system. Based on analysis of drilling results and logging data, the well intersected approximately 117 meters (383 feet) of net hydrocarbon pay. A single gas pool was encountered in the Lower Cenomanian objective, which is comprised of three reservoirs totaling 88 meters (288 feet) in thickness over a gross hydrocarbon interval of 160 meters (528 feet). A fourth reservoir totaling 19 meters (62 feet) was penetrated within the Upper Cenomanian target over a gross hydrocarbon interval of 150 meters (492 feet). The exploration well also intersected an additional 10 meters (32 feet) of net hydrocarbon pay in the lower Albian section, which is interpreted to be gas. The well was drilled to a total depth of 5,107 meters. The Ahmeyim discovery extends across the Mauritania border into our Saint Louis Offshore Profond block offshore Senegal. In January 2016, we drilled the Guembeul-1 well in Senegal, which confirmed the extension of the Ahmeyim discovery into Senegal. We are currently drilling the Ahmeyim-2 well as part of the appraisal program in Mauritania to further delineate the Ahmeyim discovery. 

The Marsouin discovery, located in Block C8 offshore Mauritania, is a significant, play-extending gas discovery, building on our successful exploration program in the outboard Cretaceous petroleum system offshore Mauritania. The Marsouin-1 well is located approximately 60 kilometers north of the Ahmeyim discovery and was drilled to a total depth of 5,153 meters in nearly 2,400 meters of water. Based on analysis of drilling results and logging data, Marsouin-1 encountered at least 70 meters (230 feet) of net gas pay in Upper and Lower Cenomanian intervals comprised of excellent quality reservoir sands. An appraisal program is currently being planned to delineate the Marsouin discovery. 

Senegal 

We are the operator of the Cayar Offshore Profond and Saint Louis Offshore Profond Blocks offshore Senegal. The blocks are located in the Senegal River Mid &#8209;Cretaceous deep water system, which is an extention of a working petroleum system in the Mauritania Salt Basin . We believe the area has multiple Lower Cretaceous source rocks with Albo &#8209;Cenomanian reservoir sands. We obtained approximately 7,000 square kilometers of 3D seismic data over the central and eastern portions of the Cayar Offshore Profond and Saint Louis Offshore Profond blocks in January 2015. The results of these 3D seismic programs provided sufficient encouragement to begin acquiring additional seismic data in November 2015 in the western portions of both blocks to fully evaluate the prospectivity. This survey is expected to be completed in February 2016. We have identified numerous prospects in our blocks and we continue to integrate the results of our successful drilling program in Mauritania and Senegal to further evaluate our reservoir model and delineate prospectivity. &#160; 

The following is a brief discussion of our discovery in the Saint Louis Offshore Profond Block offshore Senegal. 

Saint Louis Offshore Profond Discoveries 

The Guembeul-1 exploration well, located in the northern part of the Saint Louis Offshore Profond license area in Senegal, has made a significant gas discovery. The Guembeul-1 exploration well is located approximately five kilometers south of the Tortue-1 exploration well in Mauritania in approximately 2,700 meters of water and was drilled to a total depth of 5,245 meters. The well encountered 101 meters (331 feet) of net gas pay in two excellent quality reservoirs, including 56 meters (184 feet) in the Lower Cenomanian and 45 meters (148 feet) in the underlying Albian, with no water encountered. Importantly, the Guembeul-1 exploration well has demonstrated reservoir continuity as well as static pressure communication with the Tortue-1 exploration well in the Lower Cenomanian. 

&#160;

Suriname 

We are the operator for petroleum contracts covering Block 42 and Block 45 offshore Suriname, which are located within the Guyana &#8209;Suriname Basin, along the Atlantic transform margin of northern South America. Suriname lies between Guyana and French Guyana. The Guyana-Suriname Basin resulted from rock deformation caused by tensional forces associated with the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, as South America separated from Africa in the Mid &#8209;Cretaceous period. The Suriname basin is considered similar to the working petroleum systems of the West African transform margin. The emerging petroleum system in Suriname has been proven by the presence of onshore producing fields and nearby discoveries offshore Guyana. 

Suriname Block 42 and Block 45 are positioned centrally in the Suriname-Guyana Basin, and located to the southeast of the recent play opening Liza-1 oil discovery. Likewise, the blocks are also positioned to the northwest of the French Guyana Basins&#8217; Zaedysus oil discovery. 

We believe that there are several independent play types of importance to our operated blocks. Of note are the listric faulted structural stratigraphic play of the lower Cretaceous and the stratigraphically trapped Upper Cretaceous plays similar to those discovered offshore West Africa in the Ghanaian Jubilee Field. The recent oil discovery in Guyana (Liza-1) in the same geologic basin provides a positive point of calibration for the Upper Cretaceous stratigraphic play. 

Target reservoirs in our blocks are similar Upper and Middle Cretaceous age basin floor fans and mid &#8209;slope channel sands. Seismic evidence suggests thick Late Cretaceous and Tertiary reservoir systems are present in the deep water area demonstrated by Liza-1. 

The Tambaredjo and Calcutta Fields onshore Suriname as well as the Liza-1 well discovery offshore Guyana demonstrate that a working petroleum system exists, and geological and geochemical studies suggest the hydrocarbons in these fields were generated from source rocks located in the offshore basin. The source rocks are believed to be similar in age to those which charged some of the fields offshore West Africa. 

During 2012, we completed a 3D seismic data acquisition program which covered approximately 3,900 square kilometers over portions of Block 42 and Block 45 offshore Suriname. In August 2013, we completed a 2D seismic program of approximately 1,400 line kilometers over a portion of Block 42, outside of the existing 3D seismic survey. The processing of the seismic data was completed during 2014. 

In December 2015, we received an extension of Phase 1 of the Exploration Period for Block 42 offshore Suriname which now expires in September 2018. We have compiled an initial inventory of prospects on the license areas in Suriname and will continue to refine and assess the prospectivity of these areas during 2016. 

Morocco (including Western Sahara) 

Our petroleum contracts in Morocco include the Cap Boujdour Offshore Block, which is within the Aaiun Basin, and the Essaouira Offshore Block, the Foum Assaka Offshore Block and the Tarhazoute Offshore Block, which are within the Agadir Basin. We are the operator of these petroleum contracts. 

Aaiun Basin 

The Cap Boujdour Offshore Block is located within the Aaiun Basin, along the Atlantic passive margin and covers a high &#8209;graded area within the original Boujdour Offshore Block which expired in February 2011. Detailed seismic sequence analysis suggests the possible existence of stacked deepwater turbidite systems throughout the region. The scale of the license area has allowed us to identify distinct exploration fairways in this block. The main play elements of the prospectivity within the Cap Boujdour Offshore Block consist of a Late Jurassic source rock, charging Early to Mid &#8209;Cretaceous deepwater sandstones trapped in a number of different structural trends. In the inboard area a number of three &#8209;way fault closures are present which contain Early to Mid &#8209;Cretaceous sandstone sequences some of which have been penetrated in wells on the continental shelf. Outboard of these fault trap trends, large four &#8209;way closure 

&#160;

and combination structural stratigraphic traps are present in discrete northeast to southwest trending structurally defined fairways. 

During 2014, we conducted a new 3D seismic survey of approximately 5,100 square kilometers over the Cap Boujdour Offshore Block. The processing of this seismic data was completed in 2015. 

Drilling of the CB-1 exploration well on the Cap Boujdour Offshore Block was completed in March 2015. The well penetrated approximately 14 meters of net gas and condensate pay in clastic reservoirs over a gross hydrocarbon bearing interval of approximately 500 meters. The discovery was sub-commercial, and the well was plugged and abandoned. However, the well demonstrated a working petroleum system including the presence of a hydrocarbon charge. The results are being integrated with the ongoing geological evaluation to determine future exploration activity. 

Agadir Basin 

The Foum Assaka Offshore, Essaouira Offshore and Tarhazoute Offshore Blocks are located in the Agadir Basin. A working petroleum system has been established in the onshore area of the Agadir Basin based on onshore and shallow offshore wells. Existing well data and geological and geochemical studies have demonstrated the presence of Cretaceous source rocks in the acreage. Onshore production suggests that possible Jurassic source rocks are also present in the offshore Agadir Basin. The offshore Agadir Basin sediments are interpreted to comprise thick sequences of Lower to Upper Cretaceous age formations consisting of deep water channels and lobes. The interpreted prospects&#8217; trapping styles are varied and include pre &#8209;salt ponded slope fans, salt domes, salt &#8209;cored anticlines and sub &#8209;salt structures. 

We completed interpretation of approximately 7,800 square kilometers of new and reprocessed 3D seismic data in our Foum Assaka Offshore and Essaouira Offshore Blocks. During 2014, we conducted a 3D seismic data acquisition program of approximately 4,300 square kilometers over the Tarhazoute Offshore and Essaouira Offshore Blocks. The processing of this seismic data was completed in late 2015. 

During 2014, we drilled the FA &#8209;1 exploration well in the Foum Assaka Offshore block. The well encountered oil and gas shows while drilling and in sidewall cores suggesting the presence of a working petroleum system; however, it failed to encounter commercial reservoirs and was plugged and abandoned. 

We are currently assessing prospectivity on our Agadir Basin Blocks offshore Morocco and plan to continue processing and interpreting seismic information to assess the prospectivity of these license areas. 

Portugal 

In March 2015, we closed a farm &#8209;in agreement to acquire a non &#8209;operated interest in the Camarao, Ameijoa, Mexilhao and Ostra Blocks offshore Portugal. Offshore Atlantic Portugal has been identified as a potentially attractive Central Atlantic margin area with Jurassic source rocks and Lower Cretaceous reservoirs in combination traps. This overlooked and underexplored area has a number of wells showing good evidence for working charge from oil shows and drill stem tests in Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous sandstones and limestones. These blocks cover an area of approximately 3.0 million acres in water depths ranging from approximately 200 to 3,200 meters. 

During 2015, we conducted a 3D seismic survey of approximately 3,200 square kilometers over the Camarao Block. The processing of this seismic data is expected to be completed in 2016. We are integrating the results from the 3D seismic survey into our geologic model to further assess prospectivity on the blocks. 

Sao Tome and Principe 

During the fourth quarter of 2015 and in January 2016 , Kosmos acquired acreage in Blocks 5, 6 and 11 offshore Sao Tome and Principe in the Gulf of Guinea. We are the operator of Block 11 , Equator Exploration Limited (&#8220;Equator&#8221;), an affiliate of Oando Energy Resources, is the operator of Block 5 and Galp Energia Sao Tome E Principe, Unipessoal, LDA (&#8220; Ga lp&#8221;), a wholly owned subsidiary of Petrogal, S.A., is the operator of Block 6. These blocks cover an area of approximately 4.2 million acres i n water depth ranging from 2,250 to 3 , 000 &#160; m eters and provide an opportunity 

&#160;

to pursue the core Cretaceous theme that was successful for us in Ghana. Block 5 is subject to certain governmental approvals and processes required to be completed before this acquisition is effective. 

Our blocks are adjacent to a proven and prolific petroleum system in Equatorial Guinea and northern Gabon comprising Early Cretaceous post-rift source rocks and Late Cretaceous reservoirs and provide an extension of this basin. 

We believe that the southern extent of the West African transform margin in Sao Tome and Principe comprises a series of Albian pull-apart basins formed during the separation of Africa from South America and provides the necessary conditions for the generation, migration and trapping of hydrocarbons. Early in the basin history, restricted marine conditions prevailed allowing rich source rocks to be deposited. Large sandstone depo-centers were developed at the structural junctions of rift and shear fault trends resulting in the deposition of deep-water slope channels and basin floor fans draping over and around anticlinal hig hs adjacent to fracture zones. These constitute the main play in the acreage. 

We have approximately 1 , 250 line kilometers of 2D seismic covering portions of our blocks and have identified numerous leads in our Sao Tome and Principe acreage. We intend to further delineate this prospectivity with a seismic acquisition program which will facilitate a detailed geologic evaluation.

Our reserves associated with the Jubilee Field are based on the 54.4%/45.6% redetermination split, between the WCTP Block and DT Block. Totals within the table may not add as a result of rounding. 

(2) 

These reserves represent only the estimated quantities of fuel gas required to operate the Jubilee and TEN FPSOs during normal field operations. No natural gas volumes, outside of the fuel gas reported, have been classified as reserves. If and when a subsequent gas sales agreement is executed for Jubilee, a portion of the remaining gas may be recognized as reserves. If and when a gas sales agreement and the related infrastructure are in place for the TEN development, a portion of the remaining gas may be recognized as reserves. 

(3) 

All of our proved undeveloped reserves are expected to be developed within five years or less from their initial disclosure as proved undeveloped reserves. As of December 31, 2015, we recognized 25 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves related to the TEN development, which is expected to begin first oil production in the third quarter of 2016. 

&#160;

Changes for the year ended December 31, 2015, include an increase of 11.8 MMBbl of net proved reserves related to Jubilee field performance and in &#8209;fill drilling results, which were partially offset by negative revisions to the TEN development of 2.1 MMBbl due to lower oil prices and by 8.6 MMBbl of net Jubilee production during 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $80.6 million of capital expenditures related to the Jubilee Field Phase 1A and 1A addendum developments, which consisted of drilling and completing two wells, resulting in the conversion of approximately 3 MMBbl of net proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2014 to proved developed reserves as of December 31, 2015. 

Changes for the year ended December 31, 2014, include an increase of 27 MMBbl of net proved reserves related to the initial recognition of reserves associated with the TEN development. Jubilee net proved oil reserves increased 11 MMBbl as a result of field performance and in &#8209;fill drilling results, which was partially offset by 8.5 MMBbl of net Jubilee production during 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred $82.8 million of capital expenditures related to the Jubilee Field Phase 1A development, which resulted in the conversion of approximately 6 MMBbl of net proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2013 to proved developed reserves as of December 31, 2014. This conversion of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves was due to the drilling of the remaining Jubilee Field Phase 1A development wells. 

Changes for the year ended December 31, 2013, include an increase of 11 MMBbl of proved reserves as a result of drilling and reservoir performance, which is partially offset by 8 MMBbl of net production during 2013. During 2013, approximately 1 MMBbl of proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2012 were converted to proved developed reserves as of December 31, 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we incurred $116.6 million of capital expenditures related to the Jubilee Field Phase 1A development. 

The following table sets forth the estimated future net revenues, excluding derivatives contracts, from net proved reserves and the expected benchmark prices used in projecting net revenues at December 31, 2015 . All estimated future net revenues are attributable to projected production from the Jubilee Field and the TEN development in Ghana. If we are unable to export associated natural gas in large quantities from the Jubilee Field and TEN development then production could be limited and the future net revenues discussed herein will be adversely affected.

PV &#8209;10 represents the present value of estimated future revenues to be generated from the production of proved oil and natural gas reserves, net of future development and production costs, royalties, additional oil entitlements and future tax expense levied at an asset level (in our case, future Ghanaian tax expense), using prices based on an average of the first &#8209;day &#8209;of &#8209;the &#8209;months throughout 2015 and costs as of the date of estimation without future escalation, without giving effect to hedging activities, non &#8209;property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses, debt service and depreciation, depletion and amortization, and discounted using an annual discount rate of 10% to reflect the timing of future cash flows. PV &#8209;10 is a non &#8209;GAAP financial measure and often differs from Standardized Measure, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, because it does not include the effects of future income tax expense related to proved oil and gas reserves levied at a corporate parent level on future net revenues. However, it does include the effects of future tax expense levied at an asset level (in our case, the effects of future Ghanaian tax expense). Neither PV &#8209;10 nor Standardized Measure represents an estimate of the fair market value of our oil and natural gas assets. PV &#8209;10 should not be considered as an alternative to the Standardized Measure as computed under GAAP; however, we and others in the industry use PV &#8209;10 as a measure to compare the relative size and value of proved reserves held by companies without regard to the specific corporate tax characteristics of such entities. 

&#160;

Standardized Measure represents the present value of estimated future cash inflows to be generated from the production of proved oil and natural gas reserves, net of future development and production costs, future income tax expense related to our proved oil and gas reserves levied at a corporate parent and intermediate subsidiary level, royalties, additional oil entitlements and future tax expense levied at an asset level (in our case, future Ghanaian tax expense), without giving effect to hedging activities, non &#8209;property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses, debt service and depreciation, depletion and amortization, and discounted using an annual discount rate of 10% to reflect timing of future cash flows and using the same pricing assumptions as were used to calculate PV &#8209;10. Standardized Measure often differs from PV &#8209;10 because Standardized Measure includes the effects of future income tax expense related to our proved oil and gas reserves levied at a corporate parent level on future net revenues. However, as we are a tax exempted company incorporated pursuant to the laws of Bermuda, we do not expect to be subject to future income tax expense related to our proved oil and gas reserves levied at a corporate parent level on future net revenues. Therefore, the year &#8209;end 2015 estimate of PV &#8209;10 is equivalent to the Standardized Measure.

The unweighted arithmetic average first &#8209;day &#8209; of &#8209;the &#8209;month prices for the prior 12 months was $54.13 for Dated Brent at December 31, 2015 . The price was adjusted for crude handling, transportation fees, quality, and a regional price differential. These adjustments are estimated to include a $(0.41) discount relative to Dated Brent for the Jubilee Field. The adjusted price utilized to derive the Jubilee Field PV &#8209;10 is $53.72 . It was determined that no differential should be applied for the TEN development since oil production has not yet begun for those fields, hence the price utilized to derive the TEN PV &#8209;10 is $54.13 .

Future net revenues and PV-10 have been adjusted from the reserve report which is based on the entitlements method as we account for oil and gas revenues under the sales method of accounting. 

Estimated proved reserves 

Unless otherwise specifically identified in this report, the summary data with respect to our estimated net proved reserves for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 has been prepared by Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (&#8220;RSC&#8221;), our independent reserve engineering firm, and for the year ended December 31, 2013 was prepared by Netherland, Sewell &#38; Associates, Inc. (&#8220;NSAI&#8221;), our independent reserve engineering firm for such years, in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) applicable to companies involved in oil and natural gas producing activities. These rules require SEC reporting companies to prepare their reserve estimates using reserve definitions and pricing based on 12 &#8209;month historical unweighted first &#8209;day &#8209;of &#8209;the &#8209;month average prices, rather than year &#8209;end prices. For a definition of proved reserves under the SEC rules, see the &#8220;Glossary and Selected Abbreviations.&#8221; For more information regarding our independent reserve engineers, please see &#8220;&#8212;Independent petroleum engineers&#8221; below. 

Our estimated proved reserves and related future net revenues, PV &#8209;10 and Standardized Measure were determined using index prices for oil, without giving effect to derivative transactions, and were held constant throughout the life of the assets. 

Future net revenues represent projected revenues from the sale of proved reserves net of production and development costs (including operating expenses and production taxes). Such calculations at December 31, 2015 are based on costs in effect at December 31, 2015 and the 12 &#8209;month unweighted arithmetic average of the first &#8209;day &#8209;of &#8209;the &#8209;month price for the year ended December 31, 2015 , adjusted for anticipated market premium, without giving effect to derivative transactions, and are held constant throughout the life of the assets. There can be no assurance that the proved reserves will be produced within the periods indicated or prices and costs will remain constant. 

Independent petroleum engineers 

Ryder Scott Company, L.P. 

RSC, our independent reserve engineers for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , was established in 1937. Over the past 75 years, RSC has provided services to the worldwide petroleum industry that include the issuance 

&#160;

of reserves reports and audits, appraisal of oil and gas properties including fair market value determination, reservoir simulation studies, enhanced recovery services, expert witness testimony, and management advisory services. RSC professionals subscribe to a code of professional conduct and RSC is a Registered Engineering Firm in the State of Texas. 

For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 , we engaged RSC to prepare independent estimates of the extent and value of the proved reserves of certain of our oil and gas properties. These reports were prepared at our request to estimate our reserves and related future net revenues and PV &#8209;10 for the periods indicated therein. Our estimated reserves at December 31, 2015 and 2014 and related future net revenues and PV &#8209;10 at December 31, 2015 and 2014 are taken from reports prepared by RSC, in accordance with petroleum engineering and evaluation principles which RSC believes are commonly used in the industry and definitions and current regulations established by the SEC. The December 31, 2015 reserve report was completed on January 21, 2016 , and a copy is included as an exhibit to this report. 

In connection with the preparation of the December 31, 2015 and 2014 reserves report, RSC prepared its own estimates of our proved reserves. In the process of the reserves evaluation, RSC did not independently verify the accuracy and completeness of information and data furnished by us with respect to ownership interests, oil and gas production, well test data, historical costs of operation and development, product prices or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the fields and sales of production. However, if in the course of the examination something came to the attention of RSC which brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data, RSC did not rely on such information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved its questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data. RSC independently prepared reserves estimates to conform to the guidelines of the SEC, including the criteria of &#8220;reasonable certainty,&#8221; as it pertains to expectations about the recoverability of reserves in future years, under existing economic and operating conditions, consistent with the definition in Rule 4 &#8209;10(a)(2) of Regulation S &#8209;X. RSC issued a report on our proved reserves at December 31, 2015 , based upon its evaluation. RSC&#8217;s primary economic assumptions in estimates included an ability to sell Jubilee Field oil and TEN development oil at a price of $53.72 and $54.13 , respectively , and certain levels of future capital expenditures. The assumptions, data, methods and precedents were appropriate for the purpose served by these reports, and RSC used all methods and procedures as it considered necessary under the circumstances to prepare the report. 

Netherland, Sewell &#38; Associates, Inc. NSAI was established in 1961. Over the past 50 years, NSAI has provided services to the worldwide petroleum industry that include the issuance of reserves reports and audits, acquisition and divestiture evaluations, simulation studies, exploration resources assessments, equity determinations, and management and advisory services. NSAI professionals subscribe to a code of professional conduct and NSAI is a Registered Engineering Firm in the State of Texas. 

For the year ended December 31, 2013, we engaged NSAI to prepare independent estimates of the extent and value of the proved reserves of certain of our oil and gas properties. These reports were prepared at our request to estimate our reserves and related future net revenues and PV &#8209;10 for the periods indicated therein. Our estimated reserves at December 31, 2013 and related future net revenues and PV &#8209;10 at December 31, 2013 are taken from reports prepared by NSAI, in accordance with petroleum engineering and evaluation principles which NSAI believes are commonly used in the industry and definitions and current regulations established by the SEC.

Technology used to establish proved reserves 

Under the SEC rules, proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. The term &#8220;reasonable certainty&#8221; implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and/or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. Reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have proved effective by actual comparison of production from projects in the same reservoir interval, an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that have been field tested and have been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. 

In order to establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, RSC and NSAI employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include, but are not limited to, production and injection data, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, acoustic logs, whole core analysis, sidewall core analysis, downhole pressure and temperature measurements, reservoir fluid samples, geochemical information, geologic maps, seismic data, well test and interference pressure and rate data. Reserves attributable to undeveloped locations were estimated using performance from analogous wells with similar geologic depositional environments, rock quality, appraisal plans and development plans to assess the estimated ultimate recoverable reserves as a function of the original oil in place. These qualitative measures are benchmarked and validated against sound petroleum reservoir engineering principles and equations to estimate the ultimate recoverable reserves volume. These techniques include, but are not limited to, nodal analysis, material balance, and numerical flow simulation. 

Internal controls over reserves estimation process 

In our production and development team, we maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineering and geoscience professionals with significant international experience that contribute to our internal reserve and resource estimates. This team works closely with our independent petroleum engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished in their reserve and resource estimation process. Our Production and Development team is responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserves estimates and has over 100 combined years of industry experience among them with positions of increasing responsibility in engineering and evaluations. Each member of our team holds a minimum of Bachelor of Science degree in petroleum engineering or geology. 

The RSC technical person primarily responsible for preparing the estimates set forth in the RSC reserves report incorporated herein is Mr. Guadalupe Ramirez. Mr. Ramirez has been practicing consulting petroleum engineering at RSC since 1981. Mr. Ramirez is a Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas (No. 48318) and has over 35 years of practical experience in petroleum engineering. He graduated from Texas A&#38;M University in 1976 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Mechanical Engineering. Mr. Ramirez meets or exceeds the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers and is proficient in judiciously applying industry standard practices to engineering and geoscience evaluations as well as applying SEC and other industry reserves definitions and guidelines. 

The Audit Committee provides oversight on the processes utilized in the development of our internal reserve and resource estimates on an annual basis. In addition, our Production and Development team meets with representatives of our independent reserve engineers to review our assets and discuss methods and assumptions used in preparation of the reserve and resource estimates. Finally, our senior management review reserve and resource estimates on an annual basis.

In March 2015, we closed a farm-out agreement covering our three license areas in Mauritania with Chevron. As a component of the consideration for the farm-out, Chevron was required to make an election by February 1, 2016, to either farm-in to the Tortue-1 exploration well by paying a disproportionate share of the costs incurred in drilling of the well or, alternatively elect to not farm-in to the Tortue-1 exploration well and pay a disproportionate share of the costs of a second contingent exploration or appraisal well in the contract areas, subject to maximum expenditure caps. Chevron failed to make this mandatory election by the required date. Consequently, pursuant to the terms of the farm-out agreement, Chevron has withdrawn from our Mauritania blocks . Subsequently, Chevron requested that we engage in discussions related to the possible reinstatement of Chevron&#8217;s interests in our Mauritania blocks and 

&#160;

such discussions are ongoing. However, if no such agreement is reached in these discussion s , Chevron&#8217;s 30% non-operated participating interest will be reassigned to us (subject to requisite government approvals), and our participating interests in the Block C8, C12 and C13 petroleum contracts will be 90%. 

(4) 

In January 2016, we closed a farm-in agreement with Equator, an affiliate of Oando, for Block 5 offshore Sao Tome and Principe, whereby we acquired a 65% participating interest and operatorship in the block. Certain governmental approvals and processes are still required to be completed before this acquisition is effective. Once the farm-in agreement becomes effective, the gross and net undeveloped acres in Block 5 will be 703 thousand acres and 457 thousand acres, respectively. 

Productive Wells 

Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production, including wells awaiting connections. For wells that produce both oil and gas, the well is classified as an oil well. The following table sets forth the number of productive oil and gas wells in which we held an interest at December 31, 2015 :

As of December 31, 2015 , 12 exploratory and appraisal wells have been excluded from the table until a determination is made if the wells have found proved reserves. Also excluded from the table are 13 development wells awaiting completion. These wells are shown as &#8220;Wells Suspended or Waiting on Completion&#8221; in the table below. 

&#160;

(2) 

A productive well is an exploratory or development well found to be capable of producing either oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or natural gas producing well. Productive wells are included in the table in the year they were determined to be productive, as opposed to the year the well was drilled.

In March 2015, we closed a farm-out agreement covering our three license areas in Mauritania with Chevron. As a component of the consideration for the farm-out, Chevron was required to make an election by February 1, 2016, to either farm-in to the Tortue-1 exploration well by paying a disproportionate share of the costs incurred in drilling of the well or, alternatively elect to not farm-in to the Tortue-1 exploration well and pay a disproportionate share of the costs of a second contingent exploration or appraisal well in the contract areas, subject to maximum expenditure caps. Chevron failed to make this mandatory election by the required date. Consequently, pursuant to the terms of the farm-out agreement, Chevron has withdrawn from our Mauritania blocks . Subsequently, Chevron requested that we engage in discussions related to the possible reinstatement of Chevron&#8217;s interests in our Mauritania blocks and such discussions are ongoing . However, if no such agreement is reached in these discussion s , Chevron&#8217;s 30% non-operated participating interest will be reassigned to us (subject to requisite government approvals), and our participating interests in the Block C8, C12 and C13 petroleum contracts will be 90%. 

Domestic Supply Requirements 

Many of our petroleum contracts or, in some cases, the applicable law governing such agreements, grant a right to the respective host country to purchase certain amounts of oil/gas produced pursuant to such agreements at international market prices for domestic consumption. In addition, in connection with the approval of the Jubilee Phase 1 PoD, the Jubilee Field partners agreed to provide the first 200 Bcf of natural gas produced from the Jubilee Field Phase 1 development to GNPC at no cost. 

Significant License Agreements 

Below is a discussion concerning the petroleum contracts governing our current drilling and production operations. 

West Cape Three Points Block 

Effective July 22, 2004, Kosmos, the EO Group and GNPC entered into the WCTP petroleum contract covering the WCTP Block offshore Ghana in the Tano Basin. As a result of farm &#8209;out agreements and other sales of partners&#8217; interests for the WCTP Block, Kosmos, Anadarko WCTP Company (&#8220;Anadarko&#8221;), Tullow Ghana Limited, a subsidiary 

&#160;

of Tullow Oil plc (&#8220;Tullow&#8221;) and PetroSA Ghana Limited (&#8220;PetroSA&#8221;), a wholly owned subsidiary of Petro S.A., participating interests are 30.9%, 30.9%, 26.4% and 1.8%, respectively. Kosmos is the operator; however, a letter agreement has been executed that obligates the WCTP partners to take the necessary steps to transfer operatorship of the WCTP Block to Tullow after approval of the GJFFDP by the Ministry of Petroleum. Upon approval of the GJFFDP, our participating interest in Mahogany and Teak will be at the Jubilee Unit interests. GNPC has a 10% participating interest and will be carried through the exploration and development phases. GNPC has the option to acquire additional paying interests in a commercial discovery on the WCTP Block of 2.5%. Under the WCTP petroleum contract, GNPC exercised its option to acquire an additional paying interest of 2.5% in the Jubilee Field development (see &#8220;&#8212;Jubilee Field Unitization&#8221;), the Mahogany discovery and the Teak discovery. GNPC is obligated to pay its 2.5% share of all future petroleum costs as well as certain historical development and production costs attributable to its 2.5% additional paying interests in the Jubilee Unit, Mahogany discovery and Teak discovery. Furthermore, it is obligated to pay 10% of the production costs of the Jubilee Field development allocated to the WCTP Block. In August 2009, GNPC notified us and our unit partners it would exercise its right for the contractor group to pay its 2.5% WCTP Block share of the Jubilee Field development costs and be reimbursed for such costs plus interest out of GNPC&#8217;s production revenues under the terms of the WCTP petroleum contract. Kosmos is required to pay a fixed royalty of 5% and a sliding &#8209;scale royalty (&#8220;additional oil entitlement&#8221;) which escalates as the nominal project rate of return increases. These royalties are to be paid in &#8209;kind or, at the election of the government of Ghana, in cash. A corporate tax rate of 35% is applied to profits at a country level. 

The WCTP petroleum contract has a duration of 30 years from its effective date (July 2004). However, in July 2011, at the end of the seven &#8209;year Exploration Period, parts of the WCTP Block on which we had not declared a discovery area, were not in a development and production area, or were not in the Jubilee Unit, were relinquished (&#8220;WCTP Relinquishment Area&#8221;). We maintain rights to our three existing discoveries within the WCTP Block (Akasa, Mahogany and Teak) as the WCTP petroleum contract remains in effect after the end of the Exploration Period. Effective January 14, 2014, the Ministry of Petroleum and GNPC entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Kosmos Energy, on behalf of the WCTP petroleum contract Block partners, wherein all parties have settled all matters pertaining to the Notices of Dispute for the Mahogany East PoD and the Cedrela Notice of Force Majeure, and the Ministry of Petroleum has approved the Appraisal Programs for the Mahogany, Teak, and Akasa discoveries. As a result of the settlement, a portion of the WCTP petroleum contract area which contained the Cedrela prospect has been relinquished. We and our WCTP Block partners have certain rights to negotiate a new petroleum contract with respect to the WCTP Relinquishment Area. We and our WCTP Block partners, the Ghana Ministry of Petroleum and GNPC have agreed such WCTP petroleum contract rights to negotiate extend from July 21, 2011 until such time as either a new petroleum contract is negotiated and entered into with us or we decline to match a bona fide third party offer GNPC may receive for the WCTP Relinquishment Area. 

Deepwater Tano Block 

Effective July 2006, Kosmos, Tullow and PetroSA entered into the DT petroleum contract with GNPC covering the DT Block offshore Ghana in the Tano Basin. The DT petroleum contract has a duration of 30 years from its effective date of July 19, 2006. As a result of farm &#8209;out agreements and other sales of partners interests for the DT Block, Kosmos, Anadarko, Tullow and PetroSA&#8217;s participating interests are 18%, 18%, 50% and 4%, respectively. Tullow is the operator. GNPC has a 10% participating interest and will be carried through the exploration and development phases. GNPC has the option to acquire additional paying interests in a commercial discovery on the DT Block of 5%. Under the DT petroleum contract, GNPC exercised its option to acquire an additional paying interest of 5% in the commercial discovery with respect to the Jubilee Field development and TEN development. GNPC is obligated to pay its 5% of all future petroleum costs, including development and production costs attributable to its 5% additional paying interest. Furthermore, it is obligated to pay 10% of the production costs of the Jubilee Field development allocated to the DT Block. In August 2009, GNPC notified us and our unit partners that it would exercise its right for the contractor group to pay its 5% DT Block share of the Jubilee Field development costs and be reimbursed for such costs plus interest out of a portion of GNPC&#8217;s production revenues under the terms of the DT petroleum contract. Kosmos is required to pay a fixed royalty of 5% and an additional oil entitlement which escalates as the nominal project rate of return increases. These royalties are to be paid in &#8209;kind or, at the election of the government of Ghana, in cash. A corporate tax rate of 35% is applied to profits at a country level. 

&#160;

In January 2013, at the end of the seven &#8209;year Exploration Period, parts of the DT Block on which we had not declared a discovery area, were not in a development and production area, or were not in the Jubilee Unit, were relinquished (&#8220;DT Relinquishment Area&#8221;). Our existing Wawa discovery within the DT Block was not subject to relinquishment upon expiration of the Exploration Period of the DT petroleum contract, as the DT petroleum contract remains in effect after the end of the Exploration Period while commerciality is being determined. Pursuant to our DT petroleum contract, we and our DT Block partners have certain rights to negotiate a new petroleum contract with respect to the DT Relinquishment Area until such time as either a new petroleum contract is negotiated and entered into with us or we decline to match a bona fide third party offer GNPC may receive for the DT Relinquishment Area. 

The Ghanaian Petroleum Law and the WCTP and DT petroleum contracts form the basis of our exploration, development and production operations on the WCTP and DT blocks. Pursuant to these petroleum contracts, most significant decisions, including PoDs and annual work programs, for operations other than exploration and appraisal, must be approved by a joint management committee, consisting of representatives of certain block partners and GNPC. Certain decisions require unanimity. 

Jubilee Field Unitization 

The Jubilee Field, discovered by the Mahogany &#8209;1 well in June 2007, covers an area within both the WCTP and DT Blocks. Consistent with the Ghanaian Petroleum Law, the WCTP and DT petroleum contracts and as required by Ghana&#8217;s Ministry of Petroleum, it was agreed the Jubilee Field would be unitized for optimal resource recovery. A Pre Unit Agreement was agreed to between the contractors groups of the WCTP and DT Blocks in 2008, with a more comprehensive unit agreement, the UUOA, agreed to in 2009 which govern each party&#8217;s respective rights and duties in the Jubilee Unit. Tullow is the Unit Operator, while Kosmos was the Technical Operator for the initial development of the Jubilee Field. The Jubilee Unit holders&#8217; interests are subject to redetermination in accordance with the terms of the UUOA. As a result of the initial redetermination process completed in October 2011, the tract participation was determined to be 54.4% for the WCTP Block and 45.6% for the DT Block. Our Unit Interest was increased from 23.5% to 24.1%. The accounting for the Jubilee Unit is in accordance with the redetermined tract participation stated. Although the Jubilee Field is unitized, Kosmos&#8217; participating interests in each block outside the boundary of the Jubilee Unit remain the same. Kosmos remains operator of the WCTP Block outside the Jubilee Unit area. 

Morocco (including Western Sahara) Exploration Agreements 

Effective September 1, 2011, we entered into the Cap Boujdour Offshore Petroleum Agreement as the operator. In October 2013, we entered into a farm &#8209;out agreement with Cairn Energy PLC (&#8220; Cairn&#8221;), covering the Cap Boujdour Offshore block, offshore Western Sahara. In the first quarter of 2014, the Moroccan government issued a joint ministerial order approving the farm-out agreement. Under the terms of the farm &#8209;out agreement, Cairn acquired a 20% non &#8209;operated interest in the exploration permits comprising the Cap Boujdour Offshore block. Cairn paid 150% of its share of costs of a 3D seismic survey capped at $25.0 million. The 3D seismic survey was completed in September 2014. Cairn also contributed $12.3 million towards our future costs and paid $1.5 million for their share of costs incurred from the effective date of the contract through the closing date. Cairn funded Kosmos&#8217; share of the CB-1 exploration well capped at $100.0 million. After giving effect to the farm &#8209;out, our participating interest in the Cap Boujdour Offshore block is 55% and we remain the operator. The Moroccan national oil company, Office National des Hydrocarbures et des Mines (&#8220;ONHYM&#8221;), has a carried 25% participating interest. We are required to pay a 10% royalty on oil produced in water depths of 200 meters or less (the first 300,000 tons produced are exempt from royalty) and a 7% royalty on oil produced in water depths deeper than 200 meters (the first 500,000 tons produced are exempt from royalty). These royalties are to be paid in &#8209;kind or, at the election of the government of Morocco, in cash. A corporate tax rate of 30% is applied to profits at the license level following a 10 &#8209;year tax holiday post first production, if any. The exploration term of the Cap Boujdour Offshore Permits is eight years and includes an initial exploration period of one year and six months, which was extended for one year to March 5, 2014, followed by the first extension period of two years and the second extension period of three years and six months. We entered the first extension period on March 5, 2014. By entering the first extension period we were obligated to drill one exploration well. To meet this obligation, we drilled the CB &#8209;1 exploration well which was completed in March 2015. The well failed to encounter commercial reservoirs and was plugged and abandoned. In the event of commercial success, we have the right to develop and produce oil and/or gas for 

&#160;

a period of 25 years from the grant of an exploitation authorization from the government, which may be extended for an additional period of 10 years under certain circumstances. 

Effective July 1, 2011, we entered into the Foum Assaka Offshore Petroleum Agreement as operator. In August 2013, final government approvals and processes were completed for the acquisition of an additional 18.8% participating interest in the Foum Assaka block in the Agadir Basin offshore Morocco from Pathfinder, a wholly owned subsidiary of Fastnet, one of our block partners, and resulted in our participating interest being 56.2%. In October 2013, we entered into a farm &#8209;out agreement with BP. In the first quarter of 2014, the Moroccan government issued joint ministerial orders approving the farm &#8209;out agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, BP acquired a 26.3% non &#8209;operating interest in the Foum Assaka Offshore block. BP funded Kosmos&#8217; share of the cost of the FA-1 exploration well in the block, subject to a maximum spend of $120.0 million, and paid its proportionate share of any well costs above the maximum spend. In the event a second exploration well is drilled, BP will pay 150% of its share of costs subject to a maximum spend of $120.0 million. After giving effect to the farm &#8209;out, our participating interest is 29.9% in the Foum Assaka Offshore block and we remain the operator. The Moroccan national oil company, ONHYM, has a 25% participating interest and is carried by the block partners proportionately during the exploration phase. We are required to pay a 10% royalty on oil produced in water depths of 200 meters or less (the first 300,000 tons produced are exempt from royalty) and a 7% royalty on oil produced in water depths deeper than 200 meters (the first 500,000 tons produced are exempt from royalty). These royalties are to be paid in &#8209;kind or, at the election of the government of Morocco, in cash. A corporate tax rate of 30% is applied to profits at the license level following a 10 &#8209;year tax holiday post first production. The term of the Foum Assaka Offshore Permits, beginning on July 1, 2011, is eight years and includes an initial exploration period of two years and six months followed by the first extension period of two years and six months and the second extension period of three years. We entered the first extension period effective January 1, 2014. By entering the first extension period we were obligated to drill one exploration well. To meet this obligation, we drilled the FA &#8209;1 exploration well in 2014. The well failed to encounter commercial reservoirs and was plugged and abandoned. In the event of commercial success, we have the right to develop and produce oil and/or gas for a period of 25 years from the grant of an exploitation authorization from the government, which may be extended for an additional period of 10 years under certain circumstances. 

Effective April 2, 2012, we entered into the Essaouria Offshore Petroleum Agreement as operator. In January 2013, we closed on an agreement to acquire an additional 37.5% participating interest in the Essaouira Offshore block from Canamens Energy Morocco SARL, one of our block partners. Governmental approvals and processes for this acquisition were finalized in November 2013 and resulted in our participating interest in the Essaouira Offshore block being 75%. In October 2013, we entered into a farm &#8209;out agreement with BP. In the first quarter of 2014, the Moroccan government issued joint ministerial orders approving the farm &#8209;out agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, BP acquired a non &#8209;operating interest in the Essaouria Offshore block. BP will fund Kosmos&#8217; share of the cost of one exploration well in the block, subject to a maximum spend of $120.0 million, and pay its proportionate share of any well costs above the maximum spend. In the event a second exploration well is drilled, BP will pay 150% of its share of costs subject to a maximum spend of $120.0 million. After giving effect to the farm &#8209;out, our participating interest is 30% in the Essaouria Offshore block and we remain the operator. The Moroccan national oil company, ONHYM, has a 25% participating interest and is carried by the block partners proportionately during the exploration phase. We are required to pay a 10% royalty on oil produced in water depths of 200 meters or less (the first 300,000 tons produced are exempt from royalty) and 7% royalty on oil produced in water depths deeper than 200 meters (the first 500,000 tons produced are exempt from royalty). These royalties are to be paid in &#8209;kind or, at the election of the government of Morocco, in cash. A corporate tax rate of 30% is applied to profits at the license level following a 10 &#8209;year tax holiday post first production. The term of the Essaouria Offshore Permits, beginning November 8, 2011, is eight years and includes an initial exploration period of two years and six months followed by the first extension period of three years and the second extension period of two years and six months. We are currently in the first extension period of the exploration permit, which ends in May 2017. The work program for the first extension period includes a drilling obligation. The extension of the exploration phases are subject to fulfillment of specific work obligations. In the event of commercial success, we have the right to develop and produce oil and/or gas for a period of 25 years from the grant of an exploitation authorization from the government, which may be extended for an additional period of 10 years under certain circumstances. 

&#160;

Effective December 6, 2013, we entered into the Tarhazoute Offshore Petroleum Agreement as operator with a 75% participating interest. The Moroccan national oil company, ONHYM, has a 25% participating interest and is carried by the block partners proportionately during the exploration phase. In October 2013, we entered into a farm &#8209;out agreement with BP. In the first quarter of 2014, the Moroccan government issued joint ministerial orders approving the farm &#8209;out agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, BP acquired a 45% non &#8209;operating interest in the Tarhazoute Offshore block. BP will fund Kosmos&#8217; share of the cost of one exploration well in the block, subject to a maximum spend of $120.0 million, and pay its proportionate share of any well costs above the maximum spend. In the event a second exploration well is drilled, BP will pay 150% of its share of costs subject to a maximum spend of $120.0 million. After giving effect to the farm &#8209;out, our participating interest is 30% in the Tarhazoute Offshore block and we remain the operator. We are required to pay a 10% royalty on oil produced in water depths of 200 meters or less (the first 300,000 tons produced are exempt from royalty) and 7% royalty on oil produced in water depths deeper than 200 meters (the first 500,000 tons produced are exempt from royalty). These royalties are to be paid in &#8209;kind or, at the election of the government of Morocco, in cash. A corporate tax rate of 30% is applied to profits at the license level following a 10 &#8209;year tax holiday post first production. The exploration term of the Tarhazoute Offshore Permits, beginning December 9, 2013, is eight years and includes an initial exploration period of two years and six months followed by the first extension period of two years and six months and the second extension period of three years. In the event of commercial success, we have the right to develop and produce oil and/or gas for a period of 25 years from the grant of an exploitation authorization from the government, which may be extended for an additional period of 10 years under certain circumstances. 

Suriname Exploration Agreements 

On December 13, 2011, we signed a petroleum contract covering Offshore Block 42 located offshore Suriname. We have a 50% participating interest in the block and are the operator. Staatsolie Maatschappij Suriname N.V. (&#8220;Staatsolie&#8221;), Suriname&#8217;s national oil company, has the option to back into the contract with an interest of not more than 10% upon approval of a development plan. In November 2012, Kosmos closed an agreement with Chevron under which Kosmos assigned half of its interest in Block 42, offshore Suriname, to Chevron. Each party now has a 50% participating interest in Block 42 and Kosmos remains the operator. The Block 42 petroleum contract provides for us to recover our share of expenses incurred (&#8220;cost recovery oil&#8221;) and our share of remaining oil (&#8220;profit oil&#8221;). Cost recovery oil is apportioned to Kosmos from up to 80% of gross production prior to profit oil being split between the government of Suriname and the contractor. Profit oil is then apportioned based upon &#8220;R &#8209;factor&#8221; tranches, where the R &#8209;factor is cumulative net revenues divided by cumulative net investment. A corporate tax rate of 36% is applied to profits. We are in the initial period of the exploration phase, which has been extended and ends in September 2018. There are two renewal periods consisting of three years for the first renewal period and two years for the second renewal period. Each renewal period carries a one well drilling obligation. In the event of commercial success, the duration of the contract will be 30 years from the effective date or 25 years from governmental approval of a plan of development, whichever is longer. Block 42 comprises approximately 1.5 million acres (approximately 6,176 square kilometers). 

On December 13, 2011, we signed a petroleum contract covering Offshore Block 45 located offshore Suriname. We have a 50% participating interest in the block and are the operator. Staatsolie will be carried through the exploration and appraisal phases and has the option to back into the petroleum contract with an interest of not more than 15% upon approval of a development plan. In November 2012, Kosmos closed an agreement with Chevron under which Kosmos assigned half of its interest in Block 45, offshore Suriname, to Chevron. Each party now has a 50% participating interest in Block 45 and Kosmos remains the operator. The Block 45 petroleum contract provides for us to recover our share of expenses incurred (&#8220;cost recovery oil&#8221;) and our share of remaining oil (&#8220;profit oil&#8221;). Cost recovery oil is apportioned to Kosmos from up to 80% of gross production prior to profit oil being split between the government of Suriname and the contractor. Profit oil is then apportioned based upon &#8220;R &#8209;factor&#8221; tranches, where the R &#8209;factor is cumulative net revenues divided by cumulative net investment. A corporate tax rate of 36% is applied to profits. We are currently in the initial period of the exploration phase, which has been extended and ends in September 2016. Following the initial period, there are two renewal periods consisting of two years each. Each renewal period carries a one well drilling obligation. In the event of commercial success, the duration of the contract will be 30 years from the effective date or 25 years from governmental approval of a plan of development, whichever is longer. 

&#160;

Mauritania Exploration Agreements 

Effective June 15, 2012, we entered into three petroleum contracts covering offshore Mauritania blocks C8, C12 and C13 with the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. We have a 90% participating interest and are the operator. The Mauritanian national oil company, SMHPM, currently has a 10% carried participating interest during the exploration period only. Should a commercial discovery be made, SMHPM&#8217;s 10% carried interest is extinguished and SMHPM will have an option to acquire a participating interest between 10% and 14%. SMHPM will pay its portion of development and production costs in a commercial development. Cost recovery oil is apportioned to Kosmos from up to 55% of total production prior to profit oil being split between the government of Mauritania and the contractor. Profit oil is then apportioned based upon &#8220;R &#8209;factor&#8221; tranches, where the R &#8209;factor is cumulative net revenues divided by the cumulative investment. At the election of the government of Mauritania, the government may receive its share of production in cash or in kind. A corporate tax rate of 27% is applied to profits at the license level. The terms of exploration periods of these Offshore Blocks are all ten years and include an initial exploration period of four years followed by the first extension period of three years and the second extension period of three years. Kosmos is currently in the first exploration period of the blocks, expiring in June 2016. The first extension period carries a seismic obligation and a one well drilling obligation and the second extension period carries an additional one well drilling obligation for each block. These obligations have been met for Block C8 and the seismic obligation has been met for Block C12 with work completed during the initial exploration period. In the event of commercial success, we have the right to develop and produce oil for 25 years and gas for 30 years from the grant of an exploitation authorization from the government, which may be extended for an additional period of 10 years under certain circumstances. 

In March 2015, we closed a farm &#8209;out agreement with Chevron covering the C8, C12 and C13 petroleum contracts offshore Mauritania. Under the terms of the farm &#8209;out agreement, Chevron acquired a 30% non &#8209;operated working interest in each of the contract areas. As partial consideration for the farm-out, Chevron paid a disproportionate share of the costs of one exploration well, the Marsouin-1 exploration well, as well as its proportionate share of certain previously incurred exploration costs. As a further component of the consideration for the farm-out, Chevron was required to make an election by February 1, 2016, to either farm-in to the Tortue-1 exploration well by paying a disproportionate share of the costs incurred in drilling of the well or, alternatively elect to not farm-in to the Tortue-1 exploration well and pay a disproportionate share of the costs of a second contingent exploration or appraisal well in the contract areas, subject to maximum expenditure caps. Chevron failed to make this mandatory election by the required date. Consequently, pursuant to the terms of the farm-out agreement, Chevron has withdrawn from our Mauritania blocks. Subsequently, Chevron requested we engage in discussions related to the possible reinstatement of Chevron&#8217;s interests in our Mauritania blocks and such discussions are ongoing. However, if no such agreement is reached in these discussions, Chevron&#8217;s 30% non-operated participating interest will be reassigned to us (subject to requisite government approvals), and our participating interests in the Block C8, C12 and C13 petroleum contracts will be 90%. 

Portugal Explorations Agreements 

In August 2014, we entered into a farm &#8209;in agreement with Repsol to acquire a non &#8209;operated interest in the Camarao, Ameijoa, Mexilhao and Ostra blocks in the Peniche Basin offshore Portugal. In March 2015, the Portuguese government issued the requisite approvals for the assignment to us. As part of the agreement, we reimbursed a portion of Repsol&#8217;s previously incurred exploration costs, as well as partially carried Repsol&#8217;s share of the costs of a 3D seismic program. After giving effect to the farm-in agreement, our participating interest is 31% in each of the blocks. Repsol is the operator. 

The petroleum contracts for the four blocks were awarded in May of 2007 and each provides for an initial exploration phase of eight years and possible extensions. The initial exploration period has been extended through various amendments. The exploration period now ends in 2022, with drilling obligations in years eleven (June 2017 to June 2018), thirteen (June 2019 to June 2020) and fifteen (June 2021 to June 2022). At the end of each contract year, we may elect to fully relinquish the blocks without further obligation. Drilling a well on any block serves to fulfill the requirement for all four blocks. We are obligated to relinquish at least 50% of the total contract areas at the end of contract year twelve (with at least 25% from each contract area) and at least 50% of the total contract areas at the end of the second year of extension of the initial term. 

&#160;

In September 2015, we completed a 3D seismic survey of approximately 3,200 square kilometers over the Camarao block offshore Portugal. 

Senegal Exploration Agreements 

In August 2014, we entered into a farm &#8209;in agreement with Timis Corporation Limited (&#8220;Timis&#8221;), whereby we acquired a 60% participating interest and operatorship, covering the Cayar Offshore Profond and Saint Louis Offshore Profond Contract Areas offshore Senegal. In September 2014, the Senegal government issued the requisite approvals for the assignment to us. As part of the agreement, we carried the full costs of a 3D seismic program which was completed in January 2015. Additionally, we carried the full costs of the Guembeul-1 exploration well and will fund the Timis&#8217; share of the costs of a second contingent exploration well in either contract area, subject to a maximum gross cost per well of $120.0 million, should Kosmos elect to drill such well. We also retain the option to increase our equity interest in each contract area to 65% in exchange for carrying the full cost of a third exploration or appraisal well in either contract area, subject to a maximum gross cost of $120.0 million. 

In June 2015, we entered the first renewal of the exploration period for the Cayar Offshore Profond and Saint Louis Offshore Profond Contract Areas, which lasts for three years. The exploration phase of each contract area may be extended to December 2020 at our election subject to our fulfilling specific work obligations including an exploration well in the current exploration period and an exploration well in the final period of two and one half years. In the event of commercial success, we have the right to develop and produce oil and/or gas for a period of 25 years from the grant of an exploitation authorization from the government, which may be extended for at least one additional period of 10 years under certain circumstances. 

Sao Tome and Principe Exploration Agreements 

In October 2015, we closed a sale and purchase agreement with ERHC Energy EEZ, LDA, whereby we acquired an 85% participating interest and operatorship in Block 11 offshore Sao Tome and Principe. The Agencia Nacional do Petroleo ("ANP") has a carried 15% participating interest. The production sharing contract was awarded in July 23, 2014, and provides for an initial exploration period of eight years with possible extensions and includes a first phase exploration period of four years followed by the second phase of two years and the third phase of two years. The work program for the first phase includes a 2D seismic acquisition obligation and the next the exploration phases are subject to fulfillment of specific work obligations. In the event of commercial success, we have the right to develop and produce oil and/or gas for a period of 20 years from the approval of a field development program from ANP, which may be extended for additional periods of five years until all hydrocarbons have been economically depleted. &#160; 

In November 2015, we closed a farm-in agreement with Galp &#160; to acquire a non-operated 45% participating interest in Block 6 offshore Sao Tome and Principe. The ANP has a carried 10% participating interest. The production sharing contract was awarded in October 2015, and provides for an initial exploration period of eight years with possible extensions and includes a first phase exploration period of four years followed by the second phase of two years and the third phase of two years. The work program for the first phase includes a 2D or 3D seismic acquisition obligation and the next exploration phases are subject to fulfillment of specific work obligations. In the event of commercial success, we have the right to develop and produce oil and/or gas for a period of 20 years from the approval of a field development program from ANP, which may be extended for additional periods of five years until all hydrocarbons have been economically depleted. 

In January 2016, we closed a farm-in agreement with Equator, an affiliate of Oando , for Block 5 offshore Sao Tome and Principe, whereby we acquired a 65 % participating interest and operatorship in each block. Certain governmental approvals and processes are still required to be completed before these acquisitions are effective. &#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

As provided under the UUOA and the WCTP and DT petroleum contracts, we are entitled to lift and sell our share of the Jubilee production in conjunction with the Jubilee Unit partners. We have entered into an agreement with an 

&#160;

oil marketing agent to market our share of the Jubilee Field oil, and we approve the terms of each sale proposed by such agent. We do not anticipate entering into any long term sales agreements at this time. 

There are a variety of factors which affect the market for oil, including the proximity and capacity of transportation facilities, demand for oil, the marketing of competitive fuels and the effects of government regulations on oil production and sales. Our revenue can be materially affected by current economic conditions and the price of oil. However, based on the current demand for crude oil and the fact that alternative purchasers are available, we believe that the loss of our marketing agent and/or any of the purchasers identified by our marketing agent would not have a long &#8209;term material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. 

Competition 

The oil and gas industry is competitive. We encounter strong competition from other independent operators and from major oil companies in acquiring and developing licenses. Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources and staff that are substantially larger than ours. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for desirable oil and natural gas assets, or to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of licenses than our financial or personnel resources will permit. Furthermore, these companies may also be better able to withstand the financial pressures of lower commodity prices, unsuccessful wells, volatility in financial markets and generally adverse global and industry &#8209;wide economic conditions. These companies may also be better able to absorb the burdens resulting from changes in relevant laws and regulations, which may adversely affect our competitive position. 

Historically, we have also been affected by competition for drilling rigs and the availability of related equipment. Higher commodity prices generally increase the demand for drilling rigs, supplies, services, equipment and crews. Shortages of, or increasing costs for, experienced drilling crews and equipment and services may restrict our ability to drill wells and conduct our operations. 

The oil and gas industry as a whole experienced an extended decline in crude oil prices. Dated Brent crude, the benchmark for our oil sales, ranged from approximately $35-67 per barrel during 2015. Excluding the impact of hedges, our realized price for 2015 was $ 52.32 per barrel. We believe lower prices will generally result in greater availability of assets and necessary equipment, however the impacts on the industry from a competition perspective are not entirely known at this point. 

Title to Property 

Other than as specified in this annual report on Form 10 &#8209;K, we believe that we have satisfactory title to our oil and natural gas assets in accordance with standards generally accepted in the international oil and gas industry. Our licenses are subject to customary royalty and other interests, liens under operating agreements and other burdens, restrictions and encumbrances customary in the oil and gas industry that we believe do not materially interfere with the use of, or affect the carrying value of, our interests. 

Environmental Matters 

General 

We are subject to various stringent and complex international, foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing matters including the emission and discharge of pollutants into the ground, air or water; the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of regulated materials; and the health and safety of our employees. These laws and regulations may, among other things: 

&#183; 

require the acquisition of various permits before operations commence; 

&#183; 

enjoin some or all of the operations or facilities deemed not in compliance with permits; 

&#160;

&#183; 

restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with oil and natural gas drilling, production and transportation activities; 

&#183; 

limit, cap, tax or otherwise restrict emissions of GHG and other air pollutants or otherwise seek to address or minimize the effects of climate change; 

&#183; 

limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain locations lying within protected or otherwise sensitive areas; and 

&#183; 

require measures to mitigate or remediate pollution, including pollution resulting from our operations. 

These laws and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. Compliance with these laws can be costly; the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. We cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with such laws, or that environmental laws and regulations will not change or become more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Moreover, public interest in the protection of the environment continues to increase. Offshore drilling in some areas has been opposed by environmental groups and, in other areas, has been restricted. Our operations could be adversely affected to the extent laws or regulations are enacted or other governmental action is taken that prohibits or restricts offshore drilling or imposes environmental requirements that increase costs to the oil and gas industry in general, such as more stringent or costly waste handling, disposal or cleanup requirements or financial responsibility and assurance requirements. 

For example, the Macondo spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 has resulted and will likely continue to result in increased scrutiny, regulation, costs and liabilities in the United States. The governments of the countries in which we currently, or in the future may, operate may also impose increased regulation as a result of this or similar incidents, which could materially delay, restrict or prevent our operations in those countries. 

Capping and Containment 

We entered into an agreement with a third party service provider to supply subsea capping and containment equipment on a global basis. The equipment includes capping stacks, debris removal, subsea dispersant and auxiliary equipment. The equipment meets industry accepted standards and can be deployed by air cargo and other conventional means to suit multiple application scenarios. We also developed an emergency response plan and response organization to prepare and demonstrate our readiness to respond to a subsea well control incident. 

Oil Spill Response 

To complement our agreement discussed above for subsea capping and containment equipment, we became a charter member of the Global Dispersant Stockpile. The new dispersant stockpile, which is managed by Oil Spill Response Limited (&#8220;OSRL&#8221;) of Southampton, United Kingdom (&#8220;UK&#8221;), an oil spill response contractor, consists of 5,000 cubic meters of dispersant strategically located at OSRL bases around the world. The total volume of the stockpile located at the OSRL bases is approximate to the amount used in the Macondo spill response. 

Ghana 

Kosmos maintains an Oil Spill Contingency Plan (&#8220;OSCP&#8221;) for the coordination of responses to oil spills that might arise from our operations in Ghana. No exploration drilling is expected in the WCTP Block in 2016. Tullow, our partner and the operator of the Jubilee Unit and TEN development, however maintains an OSCP covering the Jubilee Field and DT Block. Both plans are based on the principle of &#8220;Tiered Response&#8221; to oil spills (&#8220;Guide to Tiered Response and Preparedness&#8221;, IPIECA Report Series, Volume 14, 2007). A Tier 1 spill is defined as a small &#8209;scale operational incident which can be addressed with resources that are immediately available to us. A Tier 2 spill is a larger incident 

&#160;

which would need to be addressed with regionally based shared resources. A Tier 3 spill is a large incident which would require assistance from national or world &#8209;wide spill co &#8209;operatives. Under the OSCPs, emergency response teams may be activated to respond to oil spill incidents. We maintain a tiered response system for the mobilization of resources depending on the severity of an incident. While a Tier 3 incident is not expected in Ghana, in the case of a Tier 3 incident, we would engage the services of OSRL. 

Tullow has access to OSRL&#8217;s oil spill response services comprising technical expertise and assistance, including access to response equipment and dispersant spraying systems. Tullow maintains lease agreements with OSRL for Tier 1 and Tier 2 packages of oil spill response equipment. Tier 1 equipment, which is stored in &#8220;ready to go trailers&#8221; for effective mobilization and deployment, includes booms and ancillaries, recovery systems, pumps and delivery systems, oil storage containers, personal protection equipment, sorbent materials, hand tools, containers and first aid equipment. Tier 2 equipment consists of larger boom and oil recovery systems, pump and delivery systems and auxiliary equipment such as generators and lighting sets, and is also containerized and pre &#8209;packed in trailers and ready for mobilization. 

Tullow has additional response capability to handle an offshore Tier 1 response. Further, our membership in the West and Central Africa Aerial Surveillance and Dispersant Spraying Service (&#8220;WACAF&#8221;) gives us access to aircraft for surveillance and spraying of dispersant, which is administered by OSRL for a Tier 2 offshore response. The aircraft is based at the Kotoka International Airport in Accra, Ghana with a contractual response time, loaded with dispersant, of six hours. Additional stockpiles of dispersant are maintained in Takoradi. Although the above arrangement is in place, we can make no assurance that these resources will be available or respond in a timely manner as intended, perform as designed or be able to fully contain or cap any oil spill, blow &#8209;out or uncontrolled flow of hydrocarbons. 

Morocco (including Western Sahara), Mauritania and Senegal 

We have a specific Oil Spill Contingency Plan to support our drilling operations in countries where we operate. The plan calls for the addition of Tier 1 spill equipment to our shorebase in Agadir, Morocco, Nouakchott, Mauritania, and Dakar, Senegal to respond to a harbor or shoreline incident in the area. In Senegal, we also have access to the WACAF aircraft described above. We will have access to additional Tier 2 and Tier 3 equipment from the Southampton, UK location. 

Per common industry practice, under the agreements currently in place, or agreements we may enter into during the future, governing the terms of use of the drilling rigs contracted by us or our block partners, the drilling rig contractors indemnify us and our block partners in respect of pollution and environmental damage arising out of operations which originate above the surface of the water and from a drilling rig contractor&#8217;s property, including, but not limited to, their drilling rig and other related equipment. Furthermore, pursuant to the terms of the operating agreements covering the blocks in which we or our block partners are currently drilling, except in certain circumstances, each block partner is responsible for the share of liabilities in proportion to its respective participating interest in the block incurred as a result of pollution and environmental damage, containment and clean &#8209;up activities, loss or damage to any well, loss of oil or natural gas resulting from a blowout, crater, fire, or uncontrolled well, loss of stored oil and natural gas, and liabilities incurred in connection with plugging or bringing under control any well. We maintain, or expect to maintain, upon commencement of drilling operations, insurance coverage typical of the industry in the areas we operate in; these include property damage insurance, loss of production insurance, wreck removal insurance, control of well insurance, general liability including pollution liability to cover pollution from wells and other operations. We also participate in an insurance coverage program for the Jubilee FPSO. Our insurance is, or will be, carried in amounts typical for the industry and relative to our size and operations and in accordance with our contractual and regulatory obligations. 

Other Regulation of the Oil and Gas Industry 

Ghana 

The Ghanaian Petroleum Law currently governs the upstream Ghanaian oil and natural gas regulatory regime and sets out the policy and framework for industry participants. All petroleum found in its natural state within Ghana is deemed to be national property and is to be developed on behalf of the people of Ghana. GNPC is empowered to carry out exploration and development work either on its own or in association with local or foreign contractors. Companies who wish to gain rights to explore and produce in Ghana can only do so by entering into a petroleum agreement with 

&#160;

Ghana and GNPC. The law requires for the terms of the petroleum agreement to be negotiated and agreed between GNPC and oil and gas companies. The Parliament of Ghana has final approval rights over the negotiated petroleum agreement. Ghana&#8217;s Ministry of Petroleum represents the state in its executive capacity. The Petroleum Commission is the regulatory body for the upstream petroleum industry and the advisor to the Ministry of Petroleum. GNPC has rights to undertake petroleum operations in any acreage declared open by Ghana&#8217;s Ministry of Petroleum. As well, when petroleum operations are undertaken by GNPC under a petroleum contract, GNPC has a carried interest in each petroleum agreement and, following the declaration of any commercial discovery, such carried interest is typically subject to increase by a certain agreed upon amount at the option of GNPC. Petroleum agreements are required to include certain domestic supply requirements, including the sale to Ghana of oil for consumption in Ghana at international market prices. 

The Ghanaian Petroleum Law and our Ghanaian petroleum agreements contain provisions restricting the direct or indirect assignment or transfer of such petroleum agreements or interests thereunder without the prior written consent of GNPC and the Ministry of Petroleum. The Ghanaian Petroleum Law also imposes certain restrictions on the direct or indirect transfer by a contractor of shares of its incorporated company in Ghana to a third party without the prior written consent of Ghana&#8217;s Minister of Petroleum. The Ghanaian Tax Law may impose certain taxes upon the direct or indirect transfer of interests in the petroleum agreements or interests thereunder. 

Ghana&#8217;s Parliament is considering the enactment of a new Petroleum Exploration and Production Act and has enacted a Petroleum Revenue Management Act and the Petroleum Commission Act of 2011. The Petroleum Exploration and Production Act remains in a draft form, with industry comments having been submitted. The new Petroleum Revenue Management Act of 2011 pertains primarily to the collection, allocation, and management by the government of Ghana of the petroleum revenue. The Petroleum Commission Act created the Petroleum Commission, whose objective is to regulate and manage the use of petroleum resources and coordinate the policies thereto. The Petroleum Commission became effective in January 2012. Among the Petroleum Commission&#8217;s functions are advising the Minister of Energy on matters such as appraisal plans, field development plans, recommending to the Minister national policies related to petroleum, and storing and managing data. We understand the primary purpose of the Petroleum Commission is to fulfill the regulatory functions previously undertaken by GNPC. We currently believe that such laws will only have prospective application, and as such will not modify the terms of (or interests under) the agreements governing our license interests in Ghana, including the WCTP and DT petroleum contracts (which include stabilization clauses) and the UUOA, and will not impose additional restrictions on the direct or indirect transfer of our license interests, including upon a change of control. The Petroleum (Local Content and Local Participation in Petroleum Activities) Regulations came into effect in February 2014. The Regulations mandate certain levels of local participation in service companies, in &#8209;country manufacturing of goods and the provision of services, and certain reporting requirements. 

Mauritania 

The main legislative act in the Islamic Republic of Mauritania relevant to petroleum exploration and production is Law No. 2010 &#8209;033 dated July 20, 2010 as amended (the &#8220;Hydrocarbon Laws&#8221;). The regulatory authority in Mauritania is the Ministry of Petroleum, Energy and Mines and the national oil company acting on its behalf is SMHPM. SMHPM was instituted by Decree No. 2005 &#8209;106 of November 7, 2005 and modified by Decree No. 2009 &#8209;168 of May 3, 2009 and Decree No. 2014 &#8209;01 dated January 6, 2014. Pursuant to the Hydrocarbon Laws, Mauritania or SMHPM may undertake petroleum operations and may authorize other legal entities to undertake petroleum operations under petroleum contracts. The Ministry shall sign petroleum contracts on behalf of Mauritania. Assignments of interests in petroleum contracts also require the consent of the Ministry. The exploration period shall not be more than ten years, subject to certain permitted extensions and the exploitation period shall not be more than 25 years. Petroleum contracts may provide that Mauritania has a carried interest of up to 10% during the exploration period. Petroleum contracts shall grant Mauritania the option to participate for a percentage not less than 10% nor more than 14% in the rights of the contractor during the exploitation period. 

Morocco (including Western Sahara) 

The two main legislative acts in Morocco relevant to petroleum exploration and production are (i) the Law 21 &#8209;90 (April 1, 1992) as amended and completed by the Law 27 &#8209;99 (February 15, 2000) and (ii) the Decree 2 &#8209;93 &#8209;786 (November 3, 1993) as amended and completed by decree 2 &#8209;99 &#8209;210 (March 16, 2000) (together, &#8220;Morocco&#8217;s Petroleum 

&#160;

Laws&#8221;). The regulatory authority in Morocco is the Ministry of Energy, Mines, Water and Environment and the national oil company acting on its behalf is ONHYM. ONHYM is a public establishment ( &#233;tablissement public ) with the legal personality and financial autonomy created pursuant to the Law 33 &#8209;01 (November 11, 2003) which was further completed by the Decree 2 &#8209;04 &#8209;372 (December 29, 2004). 

Pursuant to the Law 21 &#8209;90, the granting of an exploration permit is subject to the conclusion of a petroleum contract with the Moroccan State. Therefore, companies who wish to gain rights to explore and produce in Morocco can only do so by entering into a petroleum contract with ONHYM acting on behalf of the State. It is further provided that the State of Morocco (via ONHYM) shall retain a participation in exploration permits or exploitation concessions which shall not be in excess of 25%. More generally, ONHYM is representing the State of Morocco for licensing, exploration and exploitation matters within the limit of its prerogatives set out pursuant to the Law 33 &#8209;01. Assignments of interests in exploration permits also require the consent of the administration pursuant to the Law 21 &#8209;90. 

The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (the &#8220;SADR&#8221;) has claimed sovereignty over the Western Sahara territory, including the area offshore, and has issued exploration licenses which conflict with those issued by Morocco, including certain licenses which conflict with the Cap Boujdour Offshore block license issued to Kosmos. Other countries have formally recognized the SADR, but the UN has not. It is uncertain when and how Western Sahara&#8217;s sovereignty issues will be resolved. 

Portugal 

The primary legislative acts in Portugal relevant to petroleum exploration and production are Decree &#8209;Law 109/94, of April 16, 1994&#8212;governing petroleum exploration and production activities (the &#8220;Petroleum Law&#8221;)&#8212;and Order 790/94, of September 5, 1994&#8212;concerning the standard terms for concession contracts. The main regulatory authorities in Portugal are the Ministry of Environment, Spatial Planning and Energy, the General Directorate for Energy and Geology (the &#8220;DGEG&#8221;) and the National Entity for the Fuel Market (&#8220;ENMC&#8221;). This latter entity is fairly recent and for that reason there is ambiguity between DGEG&#8217;s and ENMC&#8217;s powers and authority in respect of the upstream oil sector. DGEG&#8217;s authority derives from Decree &#8209;Law 130/2014, of August 29, 2014&#8212;which approves DGEG&#8217;s organic statute&#8212;and ENMC&#8217;s from Decree &#8209;Law 165/2013, of December 16, 2013&#8212;which created ENMC and defined its responsibilities. The award of petroleum exploration and production rights is made through concession contracts. As a general rule, the awarding procedure is a public tender. The assignment or transfer of interests in concession contracts (as well as transfers of 50% or more of the concessionaire&#8217;s share capital) requires the consent of the Minister. 

Sao Tome and Principe 

The Fundamental Law on Petroleum Operations, Law No. 16/2009 governs petroleum operations in Sao Tome and Principe , including the exploration, development and production of hydrocarbons and the marketing and transportation thereof. There is also the Petroleum Taxation Law, Law No. 15/2009. The ANP is established by Law No. 5/2004, and is responsible for the regulation, contracting and supervision of hydrocarbon operations in Sao Tome and Principe. 

Senegal 

The Petroleum Code of Senegal, Law No. 98 &#8209;05 of January 8, 1998 governs petroleum operations in Senegal, including the exploration, development and production of hydrocarbons and the marketing and transportation thereof, as well as the rights of landowners. The implementing decree is No 98 &#8209;810 of October 6, 1998. The Ministry in charge of Energy grants or denies applications for petroleum agreements, and such are granted by decree. Any amendment to the petroleum agreements requires the consent of the Minister. The Senegalese national oil company, Societe des Petroles du Senegal (&#8220;PETROSEN&#8221;), as the regulatory body tasked with both upstream and downstream missions, is under the supervision of the Ministry of Energy. PETROSEN prepares and negotiates all hydrocarbon licenses and contracts. PETROSEN has a carried interest during the exploration phase. The assignment of interests in petroleum contracts, as well as amendments thereto, require the consent of the Minister. 

&#160;

Suriname 

The three sets of rules governing petroleum exploration and production in Suriname are (i) Staatsolie&#8217;s Concession Agreement (Decree E8 &#8209;B, Official Gazette 1981 no. 59), (ii) the Mining Decree of 1986 (Official Gazette 1986 no. 28) and (iii) the Petroleum Law 1990 (Official Gazette 1991 no. 7, as amended in 2001). 

The Mining Decree granted concession rights for petroleum activities to state enterprises. Staatsolie, the national oil company, was founded in 1980 as a state enterprise and holds mining rights onshore and offshore in Suriname. The Suriname Petroleum Law granted state enterprises with petroleum concession rights the authority, upon the approval of the Minister of Natural Resources, to enter into petroleum contracts with E&#38;P companies. Therefore, companies who wish to gain rights to explore and produce in Suriname can only do so by entering into a petroleum contract with Staatsolie, subject to approval by the Minister of Natural Resources. Assignments of interests in petroleum contracts also require the consent of Staatsolie and/or The Minister of Natural Resources. 

Certain Bermuda Law Considerations 

As a Bermuda exempted company, we are subject to regulation in Bermuda. Among other things, we must comply with the provisions of the Bermuda Companies Act regulating the payment of dividends and making of distributions from contributed surplus. 

We have been designated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority as a non &#8209;resident for Bermuda exchange control purposes. This designation allows us to engage in transactions in currencies other than the Bermuda dollar, and there are no restrictions on our ability to transfer funds (other than funds denominated in Bermuda dollars) in and out of Bermuda or to pay dividends to United States residents who are holders of our common shares. 

Under Bermuda law, &#8220;exempted&#8221; companies are companies formed for the purpose of conducting business outside Bermuda from a principal place of business in Bermuda. As an exempted company, we may not, without a license or consent granted by the Minister of Finance, participate in certain business transactions, including transactions involving Bermuda landholding rights and the carrying on of business of any kind for which we are not licensed in Bermuda. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 260 employees. None of these employees are represented by labor unions or covered by any collective bargaining agreement. We believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory. 

Corporate Information 

We were incorporated pursuant to the laws of Bermuda as Kosmos Energy Ltd. in January 2011 to become a holding company for Kosmos Energy Holdings. Kosmos Energy Holdings was formed as an exempted company limited by guarantee pursuant to the laws of the Cayman Islands in March 2004. Pursuant to the terms of a corporate reorganization that was completed simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering, all of the interests in Kosmos Energy Holdings were exchanged for newly issued common shares of Kosmos Energy Ltd. and as a result, Kosmos Energy Holdings became a wholly owned subsidiary of Kosmos Energy Ltd. 

We maintain a registered office in Bermuda at Clarendon House, 2 Church Street, Hamilton HM 11, Bermuda. The telephone number of our registered offices is (441) 295 &#8209;5950. Our U.S. subsidiary maintains its headquarters at 8176 Park Lane, Suite 500, Dallas, Texas 75231 and its telephone number is (214) 445 &#8209;9600.
