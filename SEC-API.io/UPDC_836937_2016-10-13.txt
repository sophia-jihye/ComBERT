 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160; 

Overview 

&#160;

Acquisition of iMetabolic Corp. 

&#160;

On December 31 , 2014, we entered into an Agreement of Share Exchange and Plan of Reorganization (the &#8220;Share Exchange Agreement&#8221;) and consummated a share exchange (the &#8220;Share Exchange&#8221;) with iMetabolic Corp. (&#8220;IMET&#8221;), a Nevada corporation. The Effective Date of the transaction was March 16, 2015 (the &#8220;Effective Date&#8221;) and resulted in the acquisition of IMET (the &#8220;Acquisition&#8221;). Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of IMET from the 16 IMET shareholders for an aggregate of 60,000,000 shares, or 76.2% of the Company&#8217;s common stock.

&#160;

As a result of the Share Exchange Agreement, the IMET shareholders transferred all their interest in IMET to the Company and, as a result, IMET became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

&#160;

As a further condition of the Share Exchange Agreement, the then current officers of the Company resigned on March 16, 2015 and Mark W. Conte was appointed President, CEO and a director of the Company, Kevin J. Pikero as CFO, Treasurer, Secretary, and a director and Andrew D. Smith as a director.

&#160;

The IMET acquisition is discussed more fully in the Form 8-K we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) on March 20, 2015. Included as an exhibit to that Form 8-K is a copy of the Share Exchange Agreement.

&#160;

Name Change 

&#160;

On December 30, 2015, the Company filed Articles of Merger (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;) with the Nevada Secretary of State. The Merger was between the Company and our wholly-owned subsidiary, UPD Holding Corp. (the &#8220;Subsidiary&#8221;). Pursuant to Nevada corporate law, we amended our Articles of Incorporation by the Merger to change our name to UPD Holding Corp. We believe our new name more properly indicates our current lines of business because the Company has not been in the water and beverage industry since 2012. &#8220;UPD&#8221; stands for United Product Development which is the name of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. We will be applying to FINRA to have our common stock traded under the new name and for a new trading symbol as soon as possible.

&#160;

IMET Products 

&#160;

IMET was formed on July 1, 2013 for the purpose of marketing products under the brand &#8220;iMetabolic&#8221; that were previously being sold by the brand&#8217;s licensor, International Metabolic Institute LLC (&#8220;IMI&#8221;), as well as to develop new products that would be specifically suited for a national marketing plan. IMI transferred certain product and trademark rights to IMET on July 22, 2013 (the &#8220;License&#8221;). The License was amended on March 16, 2015 to clarify IMET&#8217;s and IMI&#8217;s future rights. See &#8220;IMET License Agreement&#8221; below. The mission of IMET is to build upon preexisting brand equity and the expert copy and other literature authored by Dr. Kent Sasse as applied to the national launch of products with extraordinary profitability and novel market appeal.

&#160;

A pre-existing line of five (5) soft-bound books authored by the founder of the iMetabolic brand, Dr. Kent Sasse, is available for sale under the brand &#8220;A Sasse Guide&#8221; on both the www.imetabolic.com and www.sasseguide.com websites. These books are titled: (i) Life-Changing Weight Loss; (ii) Doctor&#8217;s Orders &#8211; 101 Medically Proven Tips for Losing Weight; (iii) Outpatient Weight Loss Surgery &#8211; Safe and Successful Weight Loss with Modern Bariatric Surgery; (iv) Weight-Loss Surgery &#8211; Which One is Right for You?; and (v) After Weight Loss Surgery. Pursuant to the terms of the License Amendment these books will continue to be the property of and sold by IMI. 

&#160;

A pre-existing line of products, including, but not limited to, proprietary blend meal replacements, dietary specialty foods, and nutraceuticals, have been sold by IMI at IMI&#8217;s company store / doctor&#8217;s office pursuant to a reservation of rights in the License and online at www.imetabolic.com. An amendment to the License provides that after IMI has sold its entire inventory existing or ordered on March 16, 2015, IMI will not sell any more products which may be deemed to compete with IMET&#8217;s products.

&#160;

&#160; Index to Financial Statements &#160;

&#160;

IMET has developed the following four new products to be marketed:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; A new product concept to be marketed under the name iMetabolic &#8220;Catalyst&#8221;, which is intended to provide the essential vitamins and plant compounds that are necessary to aid in metabolic functions. Such ingredients include broad spectrum B-Complex Vitamins, as well as Green Tea Extract and Resveratrol (polyphenols). &#160;

&#160; &#8226; A new product concept to be marketed under the name iMetabolic &#8220;Mini-Meal&#8221;, which is intended to provide the essential whey protein isolate intake for a person who is on a four-to-five meal per day diet or needs a snack that will act as a low-calorie, high nutritional value appetite suppressant. &#160;

&#160; &#8226; A new product concept to be marketed under the name iMetabolic &#8220;Multi-Pro&#8221;, which is intended to provide the essential broad-spectrum vitamins and minerals that are typically marketed as &#8220;multi-vitamin supplements;&#8221; however, this product is specifically tailored to dovetail with the &#8220;Catalyst&#8221; so as to virtually eliminate the duplicate consumption of overlapping ingredients that routinely plagues supplement users. &#160;

&#160; &#8226; A new product concept to be marketed under the name iMetabolic &#8220;BittX.&#8221; This product is premised on the scientific theory that modern horticulture and food producers have systematically promoted foods that are sweet or lack bitterness, which is the flavor typically associated with foods that have the greatest health benefits. Accordingly, this product is intended to reform the body&#8217;s disposition toward bitter foods in a subtle, inoffensive way. &#160;

We believe IMET&#8217;s current four products can be successfully marketed through the use of infomercials and have made progress with identifying a creator and producer for an infomercial to sell the products. Additionally, the Company is building a new website with e-commerce capabilities and plans to use SEO (search engine optimization), social media, e-mail marketing, and PPC (pay for click) venues as well to drive the business. However, there is no assurance IMET&#8217;s infomercial marketing strategy will be successful.

&#160;

We have also investigated using regional distributors for our products and may use them in the future, on a region by region basis as working capital permits. The Company has identified some prospects and is working to move those prospects forward.

&#160;

We believe IMET has located experienced nutrition and supplemental manufacturers who have indicated an interest and an ability to manufacture IMET&#8217;s initial four products. We have received written cost quotations from these manufactures and production timetables, as well. The Company is in the process of evaluating the best venue to move forward.

&#160;

The Company was hopeful that it was going to be able to secure its new website, marketing program, and product manufacturing schedules to begin marketing our products within six months of the closing of the Exchange. In reality, these details are taking more time to prepare and thus the Company is now targeting some initial product and marketing launches in 2016 &#8211; 2017.

&#160;

IMET License Agreement 

&#160;

IMET entered into a license with IMI, a Nevada limited liability company, on July 22, 2013 (the &#8220;License&#8221;). In the License, IMI granted to IMET the exclusive licenses to use, produce, market and sell: (i) five marks (the &#8220;Licensed Marks&#8221;); (ii) four books written by Dr. Sasse (the &#8220;Licensed Content&#8221;); and (iii) approximately 150 supplements and foods created and previously sold by IMI (the &#8220;Licensed Articles&#8221;). The Licensed Marks include the trademark &#8220;iMetabolic&#8221;; the domain name &#8220;www.imetabolic.com&#8221;; the trademark &#8220;iMetabolic Catalyst&#8221;; and a trademark and domain name related to Dr. Sasse. The License had a term of three years, commencing on July 1, 2013 (the &#8220;Initial Term&#8221;), with a provision stating that the term of the License would automatically become perpetual if IMET sold $3.0 Million of Licensed Content or Licensed Articles before July 1, 2016. IMET is to bear all expenses of the creation and sale of the Licensed Content and Licensed Articles. The License contains other provisions standard in licenses.

&#160;

&#160;

In conjunction with closing the Exchange, on March 16, 2015 IMI and IMET executed an amendment to the License (the &#8220;License Amendment&#8221;). In the License Amendment: (i) IMET returned to IMI all rights to the Licensed Content (Dr. Sasse&#8217;s books), the two Dr. Sasse Licensed Marks and all revenues from the sale of the Licensed Articles since July 1, 2013 through the date of closing the Exchange; (ii) the Initial Term was increased from three to four years; (iii) a provision was added stating that after the closing of the Exchange, IMI shall not sell any more of the Licensed Articles or any other products IMET deems as competing with the Licensed Articles; (iv) a provision was added stating that upon reaching the $3.0 Million milestone, IMI shall transfer and or assign to IMET the three remaining Licensed Marks; and (v) a provision was added stating that upon completion of the Initial Term, IMET shall have all rights, obligations, and burdens of enforcing the Licensed Marks.

&#160;

During 2014, the trademark &#8220;iMetabolic&#8221; expired at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. In conjunction with the closing of the Exchange, IMI re-applied for that trademark and the service mark &#34;iMetabolic&#34; on December 16, 2014. In May 2015, we engaged Drinker, Biddle &#38; Reath, LLP to correspond with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office regarding our application. As of April 19, 2016, the Company was awarded Registration Number 4,941,531 in the Class 5 Category. Additionally, on September 6, 2016, the Company was awarded Registration Number 5,034,186 in the Class 44 Category. At this juncture, the Company has succeeded in reclaiming both marks for consideration in its future operations.

&#160;

Plan of Operation 

&#160; 

At June 30, 2016, the Company does not currently engage in any business activities that generate cash flow. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had $1,619 in cash.

&#160;

Over the next 12 months we anticipate our operating expenses will include: (i) general and administrative expenses, (ii) any officer, director and/or consulting fees, and (ii) costs associated with maintaining the Company as a publicly traded entity, including the filing of Exchange Act reports. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through the use of existing cash and cash equivalents or additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned by or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors. However, no assurance can be given that we will be able to raise additional capital, when needed or at all, or that such capital, if available, will be on acceptable terms. In the absence of obtaining additional financing, we may be unable to fund our operations. Accordingly, the Company&#8217;s financial condition could require that it seek the protection of applicable reorganization laws in order to avoid or delay actions by third parties, which could materially adversely affect, interrupt or cause the cessation of its operations. As a result, the Company&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm has issued going concern opinion on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The business of marketing weight management and nutrition products is highly competitive and sensitive to the introduction of new products or weight management plans, including various prescription drugs, which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market. These market segments include numerous manufacturers, distributors, marketers, retailers and physicians that actively compete for the business of consumers both in the United States and abroad. Some of these competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, product development, marketing and sales resources, greater name recognition, larger established customer bases and better-developed distribution channels than we do. Our present or future competitors may be able to develop products that are comparable or superior to those we offer, adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies, evolving industry trends and standards or customer requirements, or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do. For example, if our competitors develop other diet or weight loss treatments that prove to be more effective than our products, demand for our products could be reduced. Accordingly, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets and competition may intensify.

&#160;

&#160; Index to Financial Statements &#160;

&#160;

We are also subject to significant competition from network marketing organizations, including those that market weight management products, dietary and nutritional supplements and personal care products as well as other types of products. We compete for global customers and distributors with regard to weight management, nutritional supplement and personal care products. Our competitors include both direct selling companies such as Herbalife, NuSkin Enterprises, Nature&#8217;s Sunshine, Alticor/Amway, Melaleuca, Avon Products, Oriflame and Mary Kay, as well as retail establishments in which we are not a vendor such as Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, General Nutrition Centers, Wal-Mart and retail pharmacies.

&#160;

In addition, because the industry in which we operate is not particularly capital intensive or otherwise subject to high barriers to entry, it is relatively easy for new competitors to emerge who will compete with us for our distributors and customers.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

In both domestic and foreign markets, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, importation, exportation, licensing, sale and storage of our products are affected by extensive laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations, court decisions and similar constraints. Such laws, regulations and other constraints may exist at the federal, state or local levels in the United States and at all levels of government in foreign jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that we or our distributors are in compliance with all of these regulations. Our failure or our distributors&#8217; failure to comply with these regulations or new regulations could lead to the imposition of significant penalties or claims and could negatively impact our business. In addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may negatively impact the marketing of our products, resulting in significant loss of sales revenues.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

We currently have informal arrangements with three individuals, who are officers and Directors of the Company, who serve as support staff for the functioning of all the corporate activities. There are no written agreements with these individuals. If administrative requirements expand, we anticipate that we may hire additional employees, and utilize a combination of employees and consultants as necessary to conduct our business.
