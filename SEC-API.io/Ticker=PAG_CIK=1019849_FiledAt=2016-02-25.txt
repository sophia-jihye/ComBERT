 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

We are an international transportation services company that operates automotive and commercial truck dealerships principally in the United States and Western Europe, and distributes commercial vehicles, diesel engines, gas engines, power systems and related parts and services principally in Australia and New Zealand. We employ more than 22,000 people worldwide. 

&#160; 

In 2015 , our business generated $19.3 billion in total revenue , which is comprised of $17.9 billion from retail automotive dealerships, $944.1 million from retail commercial truck dealerships and $444.5 million from commercial vehicle distribution and other operations. 

&#160; 

Retail Automotive Dealership. We believe we are the second largest automotive retailer headquartered in the U.S. as measured by the $17.9 billion in total retail automotive dealership revenue we generated in 2015 . As of December 31, 2015 , we operated 355 automotive retail franchises, of which 181 franchises are located in the U.S. and 174 franchises are located outside of the U.S. The franchises outside the U.S. are located primarily in the U. K. In 2015 , we retailed and wholesaled more than &#160; 523,000 &#160; vehicles. We are diversified geographically, with 61% of our total automotive dealership revenues in 2015 generated in the U.S. and Puerto Rico and 39% generated outside the U.S. We offer over 40 vehicle brands, with &#160; 72% of our retail automotive dealership revenue in 2015 generated from premium brands, such as Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche. Each of our dealerships offer a wide selection of new and used vehicles for sale. In addition to selling new and used vehicles, we generate higher -margin revenue at each of our dealerships through maintenance and repair services and the sale and placement of third - party finance and insurance products, third-party extended service and maintenance contracts , and replacement and aftermarket automotive products. Automotive dealerships represented 92.8% of our total revenues and 91.0% of our total gross profit in 2015 . 

&#160; 

We believe our diversified income streams help to mitigate the historical cyclicality found in some elements of the automotive sector. Revenues from higher margin service and parts sales include warranty work, customer paid work, collision repair services, and wholesale parts sales . Service and parts sales are typically less cyc lical than retail vehicle sales and generate the largest part of our retail automotive gross profit. The following graphic shows the percentage of our total retail automotive dealership revenues by product area and their respective contribution to our retail automotive gross profit:

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Retail Commercial Truck Dealership. In November 2014, we acquired a controlling interest in a heavy and medium duty truck dealership group located primarily in Texas and Oklahoma, which we renamed Premier Truck Group (&#8220;PTG&#8221;). During 2015, we acquired an additional 5% of PTG bringing our total ownership interest to 96%. &#160; Prior to the 2014 transaction, we held a 32% interest in PTG and accounted for this investment under the equity method. 

&#160; 

PTG operates fourteen locations , including ten full-service dealerships offering primarily Freightliner and Western Star branded trucks. Two of these locations, Chattanooga and Knoxville, were acquired in February 2015. PTG also offers a full range of used trucks available for sale as well as service and parts departments, many of which are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. T his business represented 4.9% of our total revenues and 5.1% of our total gross profit in 2015. 

&#160; 

Commercial Vehicle Distribution. &#160; We are the exclusive importer and di stributor of Western Star heavy- duty trucks (a Daimler brand), MAN heavy and medium duty trucks and buses (a VW Group brand), and Dennis Eagle refuse collection vehicles, together with associated parts across Australia, New Zealand and portions of the Pacific. Th is business, known as Penske Commercial Vehicles Australia, distributes commercial vehicles and parts to a network of more than 70 dealership locations, including three company-owned retail commercial vehicle dealerships. 

&#160; 

In October 2014, we acquired MTU Detroit Diesel Australia Pty Ltd., a leading distributor of diesel and gas engines and power systems, principally representing MTU, Detroit Diesel, Mercedes-Benz Industrial, Allison Transmission and MTU Onsite Energy. We have renamed this business Penske Power Systems. Penske Power Systems offers products across the on- and off-highway markets in Australia, New Zealand and portions of the Pacific and supports full parts and aftersales service through a network of branches, field locations and dealers across the region. The on-highway portion of this business complements our existing Penske Commercial Vehicles distribution business. 

&#160; 

These business es represented 2.2% of our total revenues and 3.8% of our total gross profit in 2015 . 

&#160; 

Penske Truck Leasing. &#160; We hold a 9.0% ownership interest in Penske Truck Leasing Co., L.P. (&#8220;PTL&#8221;), a leading provider of transportation and supply chain services. PTL operates and maintains more than 22 0 ,000 vehicles and serves customers in North America, South America, Europe, Australia and Asia and is one of the largest purchasers of commercial trucks in North America. Product lines include full-service truck leasing, contract maintenance, commercial and consumer truck rentals, used truck sales, transportation and warehousing management and supply chain management solutions. In March 2015, Mitsui &#38; Co. purchased a 20% ownership interest in PTL from General Electric Capital Corporation (&#8220;GECC&#8221;). PTL is currently owned 41.1% by Penske Corporation, 9.0% by us, 29.9% by GECC and 20.0% by Mitsui &#38; Co. We account for our investment in PTL under the equity method, and we therefore record our share of PTL&#8217;s earnings on our statements of income under the caption &#8220;Equity in earnings of affiliates,&#8221; which also includes the results of our other investments. 

&#160; 

2015 &#38; 2016 Key Developments 

&#160; 

Retail Automotive Dealership Acquisitions and Dispositions. In 2015, we acquired or were granted open points (new franchises awarded from the automotive manufacturer) representing six &#160; automotive franchises , including Land Rover of Darien in Connecticut, which complements our existing franchises in Greenwich and Fairfield, Connecticut, and Audi, Porsche, Land Rover and Jaguar franchises in Monmouth County, New Jersey. In addition , in September 2015, we acquired an additional 10% interest in one of our German automotive dealership joint ventures, which gave us a controlling interest . As a result, we began consolidating an additional 27 dealerships in our financial results from September 2015. We expect that these 33 franchises collectively represent approximately $925.0 million in annualized revenue. In 2015, w e disposed of six retail automotive franchises, including Nissan and Infiniti of San Francisco. 

&#160; 

Retail Commercial Truck Dealership. In 2015, we acquired an additional 5% of PTG bringing our total ownership interest to 96%. In February 2015, we acquired two retail commercial truck dealerships, located in Knoxville and Chattanooga, which complement the existing commercial truck operations acquired in 2014 in Texas and Oklahoma , representing approximately $2 70.0 million in annualized revenue . 

&#160; 

Expansion of U.S. Credit Agreement. In May 2015, we amended and restated our U.S. credit agreement principally to increase the revolving borrowing capacity from $ 450.0 million to $700.0 million and to extend the term through 

&#160;

September of 2018 . As amended, the U.S. credit agreement provides for up to $700.0 million in revolving loans for working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, investments and other general corporate purposes, which includes $250.0 million in revolving loans solely for future U.S. acquisitions. 

&#160; 

2016 Japan Investment. In January 2016, we acquired a 49% interest in the Nicole Group, a luxury dealership group 

with operations in Tokyo and nearby subu rbs. The Nicole Group operates four BMW and three MINI dealerships, a 

Rolls-Royce dealership and a Ferrari dealership, and is the exclusive importer and distributor of Alpina. This investment will be accounted for under the equity method of accounting. 

&#160; 

Shareholder Dividends and Stock Repurchases. We increased our quarterly stock dividend each quarter in 2015 . Our latest declared dividend is $0.26 per share payable March 1 , 2016, which represents a dividend yield of 3.3 % using our January 29, 2016 closing stock pri ce. We repurchased 854,313 shares of our common stock in 2015 for $40.9 million, which, together with the quarterly dividends, represents a return to shareholders of approximately $125. 7 million. 

&#160; 

Named &#8220;Best Dealerships To Work For&#8221;. Fifteen of our dealerships in the U.S. were named by Automotive News as among the 100 &#8220;Best Dealerships to Work For&#8221; in 2015. In addition, our U.K. dealerships, collectively known as the Sytner Group, were ranked as one of the &#8220;Best Big Companies to Work For&#8221; in the U.K. by the London Sunday Times. We believe these awards reflect our ongoing commitment to our valuable dealership employees, which enhances customer satisfaction and may result in improved sales over time. 

&#160; 

Outlook 

&#160; 

In 2015, the U.S. light vehicle retail automotive market grew 5.7 % to 17.5 million units. During the last several years the new vehicle market and the amount of customer traffic visiting our dealers hips has continued to improve. 2015 was a record year for U.S. auto sales . W e believe the overall market is being positively impacted by generally strong economic conditions, including increased consumer confidence, low levels of unemployment and low interest rates, attractive products and new model intr oductions by many different OEM s, access to credit, the age of vehicles on the road, and lower consumer fuel costs. 

&#160; 

In 2015, U.K. new vehicle registrations increased 6.3% from 2014 to 2.6 million registrations. We believe the overall market in the U.K. is being positively impacted by generally strong economic conditions, strong business and consumer confidence, including low levels of unemployment, access to credit, attractive financing offers, improving new car fuel efficiency, and the latest technologically advanced vehicles, particularly in the area of premium brand sales. &#160; We expect another strong year of U.K. auto registrations in 2016 based on these factors. 

&#160; 

In 2015, North American sales of Class 5-8 medium and heavy-duty trucks, the principal vehicles for our PTG business, were approximately 537 ,000 units, a n increase of 7.8 %. The largest market, Class 8 heavy-duty trucks, increased 8.4 % to approximately 310 ,0 00 units from approximately 286 ,000 units in 2014. The backlog of orders for Class 5-8 medium and heavy-duty trucks was &#160; approximately &#160; 187,000 &#160; units at the end of December 2015, including approximately 135,400 Class 8 heavy-duty trucks . Based on a growing economy, the strength of the order backlog and &#160; the drop in oil prices , which may help trucking profitability and boost discretionary spending, we expect another strong year in the North American Class 5-8 medium and heavy-duty truck market in 2016, especially for the bra nds we represent, although the Class 8 &#160; market is forecasted to experience a year over year decline according to industry reports . 

&#160; 

Our Penske C ommercial V ehicle distribution business and the on-highway portion of our Penske Power Systems business each operate principally in the Australian and New Zealand heavy and medium duty truck markets. In 2015, the Australian heavy - duty truck market reported sales of 9,895 units, representing a decrease of &#160; 7.5 % from 2014. The New Zealand market reported sales of 3,004 units in 2015, representing a de crease of &#160; 6.4 % from 2014. The brands we represent in Australia hold an 8.1% market share in the Australian heavy-duty truck market, and a 5.6% market share in New Zealand. We expect the Australian commercial vehicle market to lag behind historical sales levels partly due to difficult macro-economic conditions, including the weakening of the Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar, and the declining price of commodities in these markets. The commercial parts distribution portion of our business has been increasing and we expect the parts distribution business will continue to be resilient due to the delayed vehicle replacement cycle resulting from the difficult macro-economic conditions. 

&#160;

&#160; 

We expect PTL to benefit from continued strong economic conditions in the United States. PTL has experienced &#160; revenue growth driven by increased demand for freight movement, as measured by freight utilization and freight volumes, which we believe is an indicator of the recovery of the overall economy. As a global supply chain provider, PTL has seen the trucking industry tightening capacity as a result of reductions in purchasing of trucks and increased utilization of the existing fleet . We expect this tightening to continue as the expense of maintaining and operating trucks continues to increase. PTL&#8217;s business is also impacted by the demand for freight. If the demand for freight changes, we expect PTL&#8217;s business to be impacted accordingly. As fleet operators add new vehicles, they must decide whet her to buy or lease vehicles. We believe t he complexity, cost and total capital requirements of vehicle ownership will continue to favor the types of global supply chain services PTL provides. &#160; 

&#160; 

As discussed in &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors,&#8221; there are a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a detailed discussion of our financial and operating results, see &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Long-Term Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Our long-term business strategy focuses on several key areas in an effort to foster long-term relationships with our customers. The key areas of our long-term strategy follow: 

&#160; 

&#183; Attract, develop, and empower associates to grow our business; 

&#183; Maintain diversification; 

&#183; Expand revenues at existing locations and increase higher-margin businesses; 

&#183; Offer outstanding brands in premium facilities and superior customer service; 

&#183; Grow through strategic acquisitions; 

&#183; Enhance customer satisfaction; 

&#183; Leverage scale and implement &#8220;best practices&#8221;; and 

&#183; Leverage digital marketing. 

&#160; 

Attract, Develop, and Empower Associates to Grow our Business 

&#160; 

We view our local managers and associates as one of our most important assets. We operate in a decentralized manner that fosters an entrepreneurial spirit where each dealership or business unit has independent operational and financial management responsible for day-to-day operations. We believe experienced local managers are better qualified to make day-to-day decisions concerning the successful operation of a business unit and can be more responsive to our customers&#8217; needs. We seek local management that not only has relevant industry experience, but is also familiar with the local market. We also have regional management that oversees operations and supports the local unit operationally and administratively. We invest for future growth and offer outstanding brands and facilities which we believe attract outstanding talent. We believe attracting the best talent and allowing our associates to make business decisions at the local level helps to foster long-term growth through increased repeat and referral business. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Maintain Diversification 

&#160; 

Our business benefits from our diversified revenue mix, including the multiple revenue streams in a traditional dealership (new vehicles, used vehicles, finance and insurance, and service and parts operations), revenues from our retail commercial truck dealership operations, our commercial vehicle distribution operations and returns relating to our joint venture investments, which we believe helps to mitigate the cyclicality that has historically impacted some elements of the automotive sector. We are further diversified within our automotive retail operations due to our brand mix, where we represent more than 40 brands, and geographically, where we operate across more than 15 states. One of the unique attributes of our operations versus our peers is our diversification outside the U.S. 

&#160;

The U.K. is the &#160; second largest automotive retail market in Western Europe as measured by new units sold. We generated 95% of our revenue in the U.K. through the sale and service of premium brands in 2015. &#160; We believe we are among the largest Audi, Bentley , BMW, Ferrari, Land Rover, Lexus, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz , MINI, and Porsche dealers in the U.K. based on new unit sales. Additionally, we operate a number of dealerships in Germany, Western Europe&#8217;s largest automotive retail market, including through joint ventures with experienced local partners, which sell and service Audi, Lexus, Porsche, Toyota, Volkswagen and other brands. We also operate BMW/MINI and Maserati dealerships in Northern Italy and BMW/MINI dealerships in Spain through joint ventures with local partners. 

&#160; 

Diversification Through Penske Truck Leasing. We hold a 9.0% ownership interest in PTL, a leading provider of transportation and supply chain services, which further diversifies our total results of operations. Our share of PTL&#8217;s earnings in 2015 was $ 32.2 million and is shown on our statement of income under the caption &#8220;Equity in earnings of affiliates.&#8221; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Expand Revenues at Existing Locations and Increase Higher-Margin Businesses 

&#160; 

Retail Commercial Truck Dealership. &#160; Our PTG business provides more diversification to our overall business model and allows us to bring our automotive dealership expertise to the commercial truck market. Similar to automotive dealerships, the service and parts business of the commercial truck dealerships provides higher-margin revenues. 

&#160; 

Increase Same-Store Sales. We believe our emphasis on superior customer service and premium facilities will contribute to increases in same-store sales over time. We have added a significant number of incremental automotive service bays in recent years in order to better accommodate our customers and further enhance our higher-margin service and parts revenues. O verall, we believe that our same-store used vehicle sales are being positively impacted by an increase in trade-in units due to an increase in new unit sales, an increase in lease returns, as well as favorable market conditions. 

&#160; 

Grow Finance, Insurance, and Other Aftermarket Revenues. Each sale of a vehicle provides us the opportunity to assist in arranging financing for the sale of a vehicle, to sell the customer an extended service contract or other insurance product, and to sell aftermarket products, such as security systems and protective coatings. Where possible, we attempt to vertically integrate with the captive finance companies of the manufacturers we represent and to supplement these offerings with preferred lenders as necessary. In order to improve our finance and insurance business, we focus on enhancing training programs and implementing process improvements which we believe will improve our overall revenues. 

&#160; 

Expand Service and Parts and Collision Repair Revenues. Today&#8217;s vehicles are increasingly complex and require sophisticated equipment and specially trained technicians to perform certain services. Additionally, many manufacturers today are offering maintenance programs packaged with the vehicle sale. These programs require customers to have the service work performed at a factory-authorized dealership. Unlike independent service shops, our dealerships are authorized to perform this work under warranties provided by manufacturers. Additionally, we offer maintenance programs for sale through our dealerships. We believe that our brand mix and the complexity of today&#8217;s vehicles, combined with our investment in expanded service facilities, including the addition of a significant number of incremental service bays in recent years, and our focus on customer service, will contribute to increases in our service and parts revenue. We also operate 33 &#160; automotive collision repair centers which are integrated with local automotive dealership operations. We offer rapid repair services such as paint-less dent repair, headlight reconditioning, wheel repairs, tire sales , seat sales for our retail commercial truck operations, and windshield replacement at most of our facilities in order to offer our customers the convenience of one-stop shopping for all of their vehicle requirements. 

&#160; 

Offer Outstanding Brands in Premium Facilities and Superior Customer Service 

&#160; 

We offer outstanding brands in premium facilities and believe offering our customers a superior customer service experience will generate repeat and referral business and will help to foster a loyal and dedicated customer base. Customer satisfaction is measured at each of our automotive dealerships on a monthly, quarterly, and/or yearly basis by the manufacturers we represent, and we compensate our employees, in part, based on their performance in such rankings. 

&#160; 

We sell over 40 brands in our markets and o ur automotive dealership revenue mix consists of 72% related to premium brands, 24% related to volume non-U.S. brands, and 4% related to brands of U.S. based manufacturers. We believe our largely premium and non-U.S. brand mix will continue to offer us the opportunity to generate same-store growth, 

&#160;

including higher margin service and parts sales. The following chart reflects our percentage of total retail automotive dealership revenue by brand: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We sell and service outstanding automotive brands in our premium facilities, in attractive geographic markets. Where advantageous, we aggregate our automotive dealerships in a campus setting in order to build a destination location for our customers, which we believe helps to drive increased customer traffic to each of the brands at the location. This strategy also creates an opportunity to reduce personnel expenses, consolidate advertising and administrative expenses and leverage operating expenses over a larger base of dealerships. 

&#160; 

Grow Through Strategic Acquisitions 

&#160; 

We believe that attractive automotive retail acquisition opportunities exist for well-capitalized dealership groups with experience in identifying, acquiring and integrating dealerships. The fragmented automotive retail market provides us with significant growth opportunities in our markets. We generally seek to acquire dealerships with high-growth automotive brands in highly concentrated or growing demographic areas that will benefit from our management expertise, manufacturer relations and scale of operations, as well as smaller, single location dealerships that can be effectively integrated into our existing operations. Over time, we have also been awarded new franchises from various manufacturers. In 2015, we acquired or were granted open points representing 33 franchises, which we expect will generate approximately $ 925 .0 &#160; million in annualized revenue. 

&#160; 

We &#160; be lieve the re are attractive retail commercial truck acquisition opportunities. We see continued growth in the brands we represent at our existing retail commercial truck dealerships and believe there are opportunities for us to continue to make strategic acquisitions over time. In 2015, the two retail commercial truck dealerships we acquired represented approximately $270.0 million in annualized revenues. 

&#160; 

We also believe there are acquisition opportunities for our commercial vehicle distribution operations in Australia and New Zealand. We have a seasoned local management team in Australia that we have complemented with additional personnel familiar with our automotive retail operations and we will endeavor to utilize local management to identify additional retail and distribution opportunities. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Enhance Customer Satisfaction 

&#160; 

We strive for superior customer satisfaction. By offering outstanding brands in premium facilities, &#8220;one-stop&#8221; shopping convenience in our aggregated facilities, and a well-trained and knowledgeable sales staff, we aim to forge lasting relationships with our customers, enhance our reputation in the community, and create the opportunity for significant repeat and referral business. We monitor customer satisfaction data accumulated by manufacturers to track the performance of operations, and incent our personnel to provide exceptional customer service, thereby driving increased customer loyalty. In addition, we monitor online reputation management sites , such as Google and Yelp reviews , to proactively assess customer comments to ensure we are offering a superior customer satisfaction experience in our dealerships. 

&#160; 

Leverage Scale and Implement &#8220;Best Practices&#8221; 

&#160; 

We seek to build scale in many of the markets where we have operations. Our desire is to reduce or eliminate redundant administrative costs such as accounting, payroll, information technology systems and other general administrative costs. In addition, we seek to leverage our industry knowledge and experience to foster communication and cooperation between like brand dealerships throughout our organization. Corporate management and local management meet regularly to review operating performance, examine industry trends, and implement operating improvements. Key financial information is discussed and compared across all markets. This frequent interaction facilitates implementation of successful strategies throughout the organization. 

&#160; 

Leverage Digital Marketing 

&#160; 

As consumers have continued to shift towards digital platforms for their buying process, we have adjusted our marketing strategy to pl ace a stronger emphasis on the I nternet and digital media; however, where appropriate, we continue to utilize traditional marketing avenues in select markets, including targeted newspaper, direct mail, magazine, television, and radio advertising. 

&#160; 

In order to attract customers and enhance our customer service, each of our dealerships maintains its own website store front. All of our dealership websites employ consistent functionality and design formats while ensuring standards and requirements are met for each manufacturer. This allows us to minimize costs and benefit from consistent processes across our dealerships. 

&#160; 

In addition to the individual website storefronts, we advertise our U.S. and U.K. automotive retail new and pre-owned vehicle inventory online through PenskeCars.com and Sytner.co.uk, respectively. These websites are designed to make it easy for consumers, employees and partners to view and compare on average over 50,000 new, certified and pre-owned vehicles. These sites, together with our dealership websites, provide consumers a simple method to schedule maintenance and repair services at their local Penske Automotive Group dealership and view extensive vehicle information, including photos, prices, promotions, videos and third party vehicle history reports for pre-owned vehicles. Customers may also download our PenskeCars.com app to access our vehicle inventory, contact dealers and schedule service at their convenience. The manufacturers&#8217; websites, in addition to our corporate websites, serve as lead generating tools to our dealerships. In the U.K., manufacturers also provide a website for the dealership. 

&#160; 

We constantly strive to build and optimize our online presence across multiple platforms in order to drive organic and high quality traffic to our business. By focusing on social media, search engine management, video, reputation management and online chat, we proactively optimize all avenues of digital customer engagement. As an example, each of our dealerships maintains a Facebook property to bring in new customers to our dealership, focus on community involvement and enhance repeat and referral business. We also leverage our corporate social media efforts and partners to benefit our dealerships and create a strong sense of community. Most importantly, once our clients have reached us, the content that we serve our customers is tailored to their method of engagement with us, the device they are using and their specific requests where applicable. 

&#160;

In 2015, 2014 and 2013, we disposed of six, seven and thirty franchises, respectively, that we believe were not integral to our strategy or operations. The dispositions in 2015 included our Nissan and Infiniti franchises in San Francisco, California. During the first quarter of 2015, we divested our car rental business which included Hertz car rental franchises in the Memphis, Tennessee market and certain markets in Indiana in light of our perceived inability to grow that business. We expect to continue to pursue acquisitions and selected dispositions in the future.

New Vehicle Retail Sales. In 2015, we retailed 233,524 &#160; new vehicles which generated 51.5 % of our retail automotive dealership revenue and 27. 1 % of our retail automotive dealership gross profit. &#160; New vehicles are typically acquired by dealerships directly from the manufacturer. We strive to maintain outstanding relations with the automotive manufacturers, based in part on our long-term presence in the automotive retail market, our commitment to providing premium facilities, our commitment to drive customer satisfaction, the reputation of our management team and the consistent high sales volume at our dealerships. Our dealerships finance the purchase of most new vehicles from the manufacturers through floor plan financing provided primarily by various manufacturers&#8217; captive finance companies. 

&#160; 

Used Vehicle Retail Sales. In 2015, we retailed 198,459 &#160; used vehicles, which generated 30.3 % of our retail automotive dealership revenue and 12.6 % of our retail automotive dealership gross profit. We acquire used vehicles from various sources including auctions open only to authorized new vehicle dealers, public auctions, trade-ins from consumers in connection with their purchase of a new vehicle from us and lease expirations or terminations. To improve customer confidence in our used vehicle inventory, each of our dealerships participates in all available manufacturer certification processes for used vehicles. If certification is obtained, the used vehicle owner is typically provided benefits and warranties similar to those offered to new vehicle owners by the applicable manufacturer. Most of our dealerships have implemented software tools which assist in procuring and selling used vehicles. In the U.K., we offer used vehicles to wholesalers and other dealers via online auction. 

&#160; 

Vehicle Finance, Extended Service and Insurance Sales. Finance, extended service and insurance sales represented 2.7 % of our retail automotive dealership revenue and 18. 3 % of our retail automotive dealership gross profit in 2015. At our customers&#8217; option, our dealerships can arrange third-party financing or leasing in connection with vehicle purchases. We typically receive a portion of the cost of the financing or leasing paid by the customer for each transaction as a fee. While these services are generally non-recourse to us, we are subject to chargebacks in certain circumstances, such as default under a financing arrangement or prepayment. These chargebacks vary by finance product but typically are limited to the fee we receive. As further discussed in &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors,&#8221; the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau 

&#160;

has instituted regulatory proceedings which may change the way we are compensated for assisting our customers in obtaining financing, which could result in lower related revenues. 

&#160; 

We also offer our customers various vehicle warranty and extended protection products, including extended service contracts, maintenance programs, guaranteed auto protection (known as &#8220;GAP,&#8221; this protection covers the shortfall between a customer&#8217;s loan balance and insurance payoff in the event of a total loss), lease &#8220;wear and tear&#8221; insurance and theft protection products. The extended service contracts and other products that our dealerships currently offer to customers are underwritten by independent third parties, including the vehicle manufacturers&#8217; captive finance companies. Similar to finance transactions, we are subject to chargebacks relating to fees earned in connection with the sale of certain extended protection products. We also offer for sale other aftermarket products, including security systems and protective coatings. 

&#160; 

We offer finance and insurance products using a &#8220;menu&#8221; process, which is designed to ensure that we offer our customers a complete range of finance, insurance, protection, and other aftermarket products in a transparent manner. We provide training to our finance and insurance personnel to help assure compliance with internal policies and procedures, as well as applicable state regulations. 

&#160; 

Service and Parts Sales. Service and parts sales represented 10.2 % of our retail automotive dealership revenue and 41.6 % of our retail automotive dealership gross profit in 2015. We generate service and parts sales in connection with warranty and non-warranty work performed at each of our dealerships. We believe our service and parts revenues benefit from the increasingly complex technology used in vehicles that makes it difficult for independent repair facilities to maintain and repair today&#8217;s automobiles. 

&#160; 

A goal of each of our dealerships is to make each vehicle purchaser a customer of our service and parts department. Our dealerships keep detailed records of our customers&#8217; maintenance and service histories, and many dealerships send reminders to customers when vehicles are due for periodic maintenance or service. Many of our dealerships have extended evening and weekend service hours for the convenience of our customers. We also offer rapid repair services such as paint-less dent repair, headlight reconditioning, wheel repairs, tire sales and windshield replacement at most of our facilities in order to offer our customers the convenience of one-stop shopping for all of their automotive requirements. We also operate 33 automotive collision repair centers, each of which is operated as an integral part of our dealership operations. 

&#160; 

Fleet and Wholesale Sales. Fleet and wholesale sales represented 5.3 % of our retail automotive dealership revenue and 0.4 % of our retail automotive dealership gross profit in 2015. Fleet activities represent the sale of new units to customers that are deemed to not be retail customers such as cities, municipalities or rental car companies and are genera lly sold at contracted amounts. Wholesale activities relate to the sale of used vehicles generally to othe r dealers and occur at auction. Vehicles sold through this channel generally include units acquired by trade-in that do not meet certain standards or aged units.

Retail Commercial Truck Dealership Operations 

&#160; 

In November 2014, we acquired a control ling interest in a heavy and medium duty truck dealership group located primarily in Texas and Oklahoma , which we renamed Premier Truck Group (&#8220;PTG&#8221;). &#160; During 2015, we acquired an additional 5% of PTG bringing our total ownership interest to 96%. PTG operates four teen locations, including ten full-service dealerships offering primarily Freightliner and Western Star branded trucks. Two of these locations, Chattanooga and Knoxville, were acquired in February 2015 . PTG also offers a full range of used trucks available for sale as well as service and parts departments, many of which are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. T his business generated $944.1 &#160; million of revenue in 2015. 

&#160; 

The following table sets forth the locations of our retail commercial truck dealerships:

Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, PTG serves thousands of customers, both in and traveling through the southwest, through its dealerships principally located in Oklahoma and North Central Texas. These dealerships provide the same suite of services as our automotive dealerships, offering new trucks and vans, a large selection of used trucks for sale, a full range of parts, maintenance and repair services, and finance and insurance options for its customers by facilitating truck and trailer financing and leasing, extended maintenance plan s, physical damage insurance, GAP insurance, roadside relief and other programs. 

&#160; 

The necessity of repairing trucks for our customers is a key differentiation for our commercial truck dealerships and we provide around-the-clock service in certain locations to get our customers&#8217; commercial trucks back on the road so they can complete their routes. Many of the service and parts departments are conveniently open 24 hours every day and 7 days each week to better serve our customers. PTG also carries an extensive inventory of parts for the new and used trucks they sell and service, including for FUSO trucks and Thomas buses, and other makes of medium and heavy- duty trucks. 

&#160; 

Similar to our automotive retail business, PTG is committed to providing outstanding brands and superior customer service in premium facilities. For example, our Dallas Freightliner location offers a state-of-the-art facility with over 200,000 square feet of climate controlled office space, service shops, customer amenities, parts inventory storage, and a 4,000 square foot parts showroom. This facility sits on almost 24 acres of property and is equipped with 80 full service truck bays, open 24 hours a day , 7 days a week, with a full suite of on-hand parts inventory. Guests of Dallas Freightliner enjoy a television lounge with HDTV theater seating, a large comfortable customer lounge with lockers, laundry and shower facilities, on-site trailer parking, and free recreational vehicle electrical hook-up.

&#160; 

We are the exclusive importer and di stributor of Western Star heavy- duty trucks (a Daimler brand), MAN heavy and medium duty trucks and buses (a VW Group brand), and Dennis Eagle refuse collection vehicles, together with associated parts across Australia, New Zealand and portions of the Pacific. This business, known as Penske Commercial Vehicles Australia, distributes commercial vehicles and parts to a network of more than 70 dealership locations, including three company-owned retail commercial vehicle dealerships. This business generated $ 233.6 million of revenue in 2015. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our local headquarters is located in Brisbane, Australia, which is the country&#8217;s third largest city. Our headquarters includes administrative facilities as well as a 167,000 square foot parts distribution center and an 85,000 square foot production center. We also have a 1 5,780 square foot parts distribution center in Auckland, New Zealand.

We are also the exclusive importer of MAN trucks and buses. MAN Truck and Bus, a VW Group company, is a leadi ng producer of medium and heavy- duty trucks as well as city and coach buses. These cab-forward, fuel efficient vehicles are principally produced in several sites in Germany. Dennis Eagle refuse collection vehicles are manufactured by Ros Roca in Warwick, England. Together these brands represented 8.1 % of heavy - duty truck units sold in Australia during 2015.

The Brisbane Truck Centre in Brisbane, Aus tralia is the largest retailer of Western Star Trucks in Australia by volume. The remaining two points are in Auckland, New Zealand and Tauranga, New Zealand, which together represent the largest retailer of Western Star Trucks in New Zealand by volume. We finance our purchases of these vehicles under a floor plan agreement with a local Daimler affiliate with terms similar to our other floor plan agreements. 

&#160; 

In October 2014, we acquired MTU Detroit Diesel Australia Pty Ltd., a leading distributor of diesel and gas engines and power systems , principally representing MTU, Detroit Diesel, Mercedes-Benz Industrial, Allison Transmission and MTU Onsite Energy. We have renamed this busines s Penske Power Systems (&#8220;PPS&#8221;). PPS offers products across the on- and off-highway markets in Australia, New Zealand and portions of the Pacific, including trucking, mining, power generation, construction, industrial, rail, marine, agriculture, oil &#38; gas and defense and supports full parts and aftersales service through a network of branches, &#160; remote field service locations and dealers across the region. This business generated $ 197.9 million of revenue in 2015 . 

&#160; 

Penske Power Systems&#8217; principal headquarters is located at its Melbourne branch, a workshop/office facility of approximately 56 ,000 square feet . In addition to sales, distribution and full product repair capability, this facility includes the offices for national sales, engineering and marketing, a regional training facility and a regional engineering center. In addition, PPS operates a corporate office based at its Sydney (Chipping Norton) branch, approximately a 61 ,000 square foot facility dedicated to corporate activities and distribution and product repair capability. PPS operates additional branch facilities across Australia and in Auckland, New Zealand. 

&#160; 

Penske Power Systems&#8217; 86 dealers are strategically located throughout Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific. Most of the dealers (7 9 ) represent the Detroit Diesel brand, with the majority aligned to Western Star and/or Freightliner Truck manufacturers. The remaining dealers represent the MTU ( 3 ) and Allison Transmission (4) brands. T he &#8220;off-highway&#8221; business of PPS principally includes the sale of power systems by PPS directly to customers in the commercial, defense and maritime sectors, and to several dealers. PPS conducts business through its 1 4 branch locations and utilizes mobile remote field service units travelling directly to customer premises.

PTL integrates most aspects of fleet management, including the provision of custom configured equipment and the delivery of a package of support and maintenance services, as well as making additional short-term rental vehicles available to its contract customers. Its broad service offering has enabled its customers to reduce the large number of vendors that an in-house fleet manager must coordinate. The services provided under its full-service lease and contract maintenance agreements generally include preventive maintenance, advanced diagnostics, emergency road service, fleet services, safety programs and fuel services through its network of approximately 670 locations across the United States, Canada, Mexico and Australia. This network has enabled PTL to successfully meet multi-location customer requirements for consistent and reliable service. Its commercial rental operations offer short-term availability of tractors, trucks and trailers, typically to accommodate seasonal, emergency and other temporary needs. A significant portion of these rentals are to existing full-service leasing and contract maintenance customers that are seeking flexibility in their fleet management. 

&#160; 

For consumer customers, PTL provides short-term rental of light- and medium-duty trucks on a one-way and local basis, typically to transport household goods. Customers typically include local small businesses and individuals seeking a do-it-yourself solution to their moving needs. Its consumer fleet consists generally of late model vehicles ranging in size from small vans to 26-foot trucks. Its consumer rentals are conducted through approximately 1,800 independent rental agents and 340 of its PTL-operated leasing and rental facilities. 

&#160; 

Logistics . PTL&#8217;s logistics business offers an extensive variety of services, including dedicated contract carriage, distribution center management, transportation management and lead logistics provider. PTL coordinates services for its customers across the supply chain, including: inbound material flow, handling and packaging, inventory management, distribution and technologies, and sourcing of third-party carriers. These services are available individually or on a combined basis and often involve its associates performing services at the customer&#8217;s location. By offering a scalable series of products to its customers, PTL can manage the customer&#8217;s entire supply chain or any stand-alone service. It also utilizes specialized software that enables real-time fleet visibility and provides reporting metrics, giving customers detailed information on fuel economy and other critical supply chain costs. PTL&#8217;s international logistics business has approximately 350 locations in North America, South America, Europe and Asia, with recently expanded logistics operations in India.

Industry Information 

&#160; 

Approximately 61% of our automotive dealership revenues are generated in the U.S., which in 2015 was the world&#8217;s second largest automotive retail market as measured by units sold. In 2015, sales of new cars and light trucks were approximately 17.5 million units, an increase of 5.7 % from 2014, and were generated at approximately 18 ,000 franchised new-car dealerships as of January 1, 2016. According to the latest available data from the National Automobile Dealers Association, dealership revenue is derived as follows: 5 8 % from new vehicle sales, 31 % from used vehicle sales and 1 1 % from service and parts sales. Dealerships also offer a wide range of higher-margin products and services, including extended service contracts, financing arrangements and credit insurance . The National Automobile Dealers Association figures noted above include finance and insurance revenues within either new or used vehicle sales, as sales of these products are usually incremental to the sale of a vehicle. 

&#160; 

W e &#160; also operate in Germany, the U.K., Italy, and Spain, which represented the first, second, fourth, and fifth largest automotive retail markets, respectively, in Western Europe in 2015, and accounted for approximately 64 % of the total vehicle sales in Western Europe. Unit sales of automobiles in Western Europe were approximately 13.2 million in 2015, a 9.0 % increase compared to 2014. In Germany, the U.K., Italy, and Spain, new car sales were approximately 3.2 million, 2.6 million, 1.6 million and 1.0 million units, respectively, in 2015. 

&#160; 

In the U.S., publicly held automotive retail groups account for less than 10% of total industry revenue. Although significant consolidation has already taken place, the industry remains highly fragmented, with more than 90% of the U.S. industry&#8217;s market share remaining in the hands of smaller regional and independent players. The Western European automotive retail market is similarly fragmented. We believe that further consolidation in these markets is probable due 

&#160;

to the significant capital requirements of maintaining manufacturer facility standards and the limited number of viable alternative exit strategies for dealership owners. 

&#160; 

In 2015, North America sales of Class 5-8 medium and heavy-duty trucks, the principal vehicles for our PTG business, were approximately 537 ,000 units, an increase of 7.8 % from 2014 . The largest market, Class 8 heavy-duty trucks, increased 8.4 % to 310 ,000 units from 286,000 units in 2014 and our principal brands, Freightliner and Western Star, represent approximately 39.1 % of that market. &#160; 

&#160; 

Our commercial vehicle distribution business operates principally in Australia and New Zea land. In 2015, heavy- duty truck sales in Australia and New Zealand combined were 12,899 units, representing a decrease of 7.3 % from 2014. The brands we represent in Australia hold an 8.1% market share in the Australian heavy-duty truck market, and a 5.6% market share in New Zealand . 

&#160; 

Generally, new vehicle unit sales are cyclical and, historically, fluctuations have been influenced by factors such as manufacturer incentives, interest rates, fuel prices, unemployment, inflation, weather, the level of personal discretionary spending, credit availability, consumer confidence and other general economic factors. However, from a profitability perspective, automotive and truck retailers have historically been less vulnerable than manufacturers and parts suppliers to declines in new vehicle sales. We believe this is due to the retailers&#8217; more flexible expense structure (a significant portion of the retail industry&#8217;s costs are variable) and their diversified revenue streams such as used vehicle sales and service and parts sales. In addition, manufacturers may offer various dealer incentives when sales are slow, which further increases the volatility in profitability for manufacturers and may help to decrease volatility for automotive retailers. 

&#160; 

Business Description 

&#160; 

Information Technology and Customer Privacy 

&#160; 

We consolidate financial, accounting and operational data received from our local operations through private data communications networks. Local operating data is gathered and processed through individual systems utilizing common centralized management systems predominately licensed from, and in many cases operated by, third-parties. Our local systems follow our standardized accounting procedures and are compliant with any guidelines established by our vehicle manufacturers. Our database technology allows us to extract and aggregate data from the systems in a consistent format to generate consolidated financial and operational analysis. These systems also allow us to access detailed information for each individual location, as a group, or on a consolidated basis. Information we can access includes, among other things, inventory, cash, unit sales, the mix of new and used vehicle sales and sales of aftermarket products and services. Our ability to access this data allows us to continually analyze our local results of operations and financial position so as to identify areas for improvement. 

&#160; 

We utilize common customer relationship management systems that assist us in identifying customer opportunities and responding to customer inquiries. We utilize compliance systems that assist us with our regulatory obligations and assist us in maintaining the privacy of the information we receive from customers that we collect, process, and retain in the normal course of our business. We have adopted rigorous customer information safeguard programs and &#8220;red flag&#8221; policies to assist us in maintaining customer privacy. 

&#160; 

As part of our business model, we receive personal information regarding customers, associates and vendors, from various online and offline channels. Our internal and third-party systems are under a moderate level of risk from hackers or other individuals with malicious intent to gain unauthorized access to our systems. Cyber-attacks are growing in number and sophistication thus presenting an ongoing threat to systems, whether internal or external, used to operate the business on a day to day basis. We perform periodic control testing and audits on our systems. Despite these measures, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, could be vulnerable to security breaches, computer viruses, or other events. Any security breach or event resulting in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, or degradation of services provided by critical business systems, whether by us directly or our third-party service providers, could adversely affect our business operations, sales, reputation with current and potential customers, associates or vendors, as well as other operational and financial impacts derived from investigations, litigation, imposition of penalties, or other means. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Marketing 

&#160; 

Our marketing strategy takes a two-pronged approach that focuses strongly on our individual businesses to capitalize on our local branding, as well as corporate programs and web presence that allows us to leverage our scale and parent brands. We also make it a point to align ourselves with the marketing implemented by our OEM partners for their respective brands and integrate those initiatives and resources across our businesses. 

&#160; 

The central core of our strategy revolves around a data driven approach that combines key metrics and trends from industry and consumer studies, our customer r elations management s ystem s and performance data from our businesses. This approach emphasizes objectivity and transparency in our marketing efforts and allows us to produce return on investmen t metrics to gauge our success. 

&#160; 

Our dealerships have strong local brand and name recognition and are respected in their local communities. As such, we focus our efforts on our individual businesses to capitalize on their strong local reputation with a mix of traditional and digital marketing practices. To supplement local marketing, we also run corporate initiatives to link our local businesses to leverage our scale and parent brand recognition. 

&#160; 

Parallel to our own initiatives, manufacturers supplement our efforts through advertising and financing campaigns that promote their respective brands. We leverage manufacturer efforts by focus ing on common marketing metrics and align ing our initiatives with the manufacturer to create a strong and consistent message for our customers. 

&#160; 

We leverage our scale by using consistent performance metrics across the group to identify best practices and areas for improvement and we negotiate enterprise arrangements for key marketing providers. We also utilize a single, unified customer relationship management tool in the U.S. in order to enhance and control customer communication, provide visibility into our sales pipeline and track return on investment for lead sources across the group. 

&#160; 

Consistent with our data-driven approach, as consumers have continued to shift towards digital platforms for their buying process, we have adjusted our marketing strategy to place an even stronger emphasis on the I nternet and digital media; however, where appropriate, we continue to utilize traditional marketing avenues in select markets, including targeted newspaper, direct mail, magazine, television, and radio advertising. 

&#160; 

In order to attract customers and enhance our customer service, each of our dealerships maintain s its ow n website store front. All of our dealership websites employ consistent functionality and design formats while ensuring standards and requirements are met for each manufacturer. This allows us to minimize costs and benefit from consistent processes across our dealerships. 

&#160; 

In addition to the individual website storefronts, we advertise our U.S. and U.K. automotive retail new and pre-owned vehicle inventory online through PenskeCars.com and Sytner.co.uk, respectively. These websites are designed to make it easy for consumers, employees and partners to view and compare on average over 50,000 new, certified and pre-owned vehicles. These sites, together with our dealership websites, provide consumers a simple method to schedule maintenance and repair services at their local Penske Automotive Group dealership and view extensive vehicle information, including photos, prices, promotions, videos and third party vehicle history reports for pre-owned vehicles. Customers may also download our PenskeCars.com app to access our vehicle inventory, contact dealers and schedule service at their convenience. The manufacturers&#8217; websites, in addition to our corporate websites, serve as lead generating tools to our dealerships. In the U.K., manufacturers also provide a website for the dealership. 

&#160; 

We constantly strive to build and optimize our online presence across multiple platforms in order to drive organic and high quality traffic to our business. By focusing on social media, search engine management, video, reputation management and online chat, we proactively optimize all avenues of digital customer engagement. As an example, each of our dealerships maintains a Facebook property to bring in new customers to our dealership, focus on community involvement and enhance repeat and referral business. We also leverage our corporate social media efforts and partners to benefit our dealerships and create a strong sense of community. Most importantly, once our clients have reached us, the content that we serve our customers is tailored to their method of engagement with us, the device they are using and their specific requests where applicable. 

&#160; 

&#160;

In Australia and New Zealand, we market our commercial vehicles and other products principally through our network of dealership and service locations, supported by corporate level marketing efforts. We separate our marketing by brand in Australia. We market to customers at various trade shows and other industry events in Australia and New Zealand, which presents the opportunity to approach fleet managers with new products and offerings. We also employ racing and other local sponsorships to generate brand awareness in our markets. Our I nternet marketing leverages manufacturer websites supplemented by our brand specific websites to promote our brands. Furthermore, in Australia , we and our dealers advertise available pre-owned commercial vehicle inventory online through pensketrucks.com.au. This website is designed to make it easy for customers to view and compare on average 150 certified and pre-owned commercial vehicles and make contact with the relevant dealership. It provides another point of contact for customers to engage with the Penske brands in Australia. We also rely on our dealerships and service locations to market to local customers, though we typically assign a regional sales manager to oversee local dealer marketing efforts. 

&#160; 

Agreements with Vehicle Manufacturers 

&#160; 

We operate our dealerships under separate agreements with the manufacturers or distributors of each brand of vehicle sold at that dealership. These agreements are typical throughout the industry and may contain provisions and standards governing almost every aspect of the dealership, including ownership, management, personnel, training, maintenance of a minimum of working capital, net worth requirements, maintenance of minimum lines of credit, advertising and marketing activities, facilities, signs, products and services, maintenance of minimum amounts of insurance, achievement of minimum customer service standards and monthly financial reporting. In addition, the General Manager and/or the owner of a dealership typically cannot be changed without the manufacturer&#8217;s consent. In exchange for complying with these provisions and standards, we are granted the non-exclusive right to sell the manufacturer&#8217;s or distributor&#8217;s brand of vehicles and related parts and warranty services at our dealership. The agreements also grant us a non-exclusive license to use each manufacturer&#8217;s trademarks, service marks and designs in connection with our sales and service of its brand at our dealership. 

&#160; 

Some of our agreements, including those with BMW, Honda, Mercedes-Benz and Toyota, expire after a specified period of time, ranging from one to six years. Manufacturers have generally not terminated our franchise agreements, and our franchise agreements with fixed terms have typically been renewed without substantial cost. We currently expect the manufacturers to renew all of our franchise agreements as they expire. In addition, certain agreements with the manufacturers limit the total number of dealerships of that brand that we may own in a particular geographic area and, in some cases, limit the total number of their vehicles that we may sell as a percentage of a particular manufacturer&#8217;s overall sales. Manufacturers may also limit the ownership of stores in contiguous markets. We have reached certain geographical limitations with certain manufacturers in the U.S. and U.K. Where these limits are reached, we cannot acquire additional franchises of those brands in the relevant market unless we can negotiate modifications to the agreements. We may not be able to negotiate any such modifications. 

&#160; 

Many of these agreements also grant the manufacturer or distributor a security interest in the vehicles and/or parts sold by them to the dealership, as well as other dealership assets, and permit them to terminate or not renew the agreement for a variety of causes, including failure to adequately operate the dealership, insolvency or bankruptcy, impairment of the dealer&#8217;s reputation or financial standing, changes in the dealership&#8217;s management, owners or location without consent, sales of the dealership&#8217;s assets without consent, failure to maintain adequate working capital or floor plan financing, changes in the dealership&#8217;s financial or other condition, failure to submit required information to them on a timely basis, failure to have any permit or license necessary to operate the dealership, and material breaches of other provisions of the agreement. In the U.S., these termination rights are subject to state franchise laws that limit a manufacturer&#8217;s right to terminate a franchise. In the U.K., we operate without such local franchise law protection (see &#8220;Regulation&#8221; below). 

&#160; 

Our agreements with manufacturers or distributors usually give them the right, in some circumstances (including upon a merger, sale, or change of control of the company, or in some cases a material change in our business or capital structure), to acquire the dealerships from us at fair market value. For example, our agreement with General Motors provides that, upon a proposed purchase of 20% or more of our voting stock by any new person or entity or another manufacturer (subject to certain exceptions), an extraordinary corporate transaction (such as a merger, reorganization or sale of a material amount of assets) or a change of control of our board of directors, General Motors has the right to acquire all assets, properties and business of any General Motors dealership owned by us for fair value. Some of our 

&#160;

agreements with other major manufacturers, including Honda and Toyota, contain provisions similar to the General Motors provisions. 

&#160; 

With respect to our commercial vehicle distribution operations in Australia and New Zealand, we are party to distributor agreements with each manufacturer of products we distribute pursuant to which we are the distributor of these products in those countries and nearby markets. The agreements govern all aspects of our distribution rights, including sales and service activities, service and warranty terms, use of intellectual property, promotion and advertising provisions, pricing and payment terms, and indemnification requirements. The agreement with Western Star expires in 2025, the agreement with MTU expires in 2024 and the agreement with Detroit Diesel expires in 2025. We also are party to shipping agreements with respect to importing those products. For each of our dealers, we have signed a franchise agreement with terms that set forth the dealer&#8217;s obligations with respect to the sales and servicing of these vehicles. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Dealership. &#160; We believe that the principal factors consumers consider when determining where to purchase a vehicle are the marketing campaigns conducted by manufacturers, the ability of dealerships to offer a wide selection of the most popular vehicles, the location of dealerships and the quality of the customer experience. Other factors include customer preference for particular brands of vehicles, pricing (including manufacturer rebates and other special offers) and warranties. We believe that our dealerships are competitive in all of these areas. 

&#160; 

The automotive and truck retail industry is currently served by franchised dealerships, independent used vehicle dealerships and individual consumers who sell used vehicles in private transactions. For new vehicle sales, we compete primarily with other franchised dealers in each of our marketing areas, relying on our premium facilities, superior customer service, advertising and merchandising, management experience, sales expertise, reputation and the location of our dealerships to attract and retain customers. Each of our markets may include a number of well-capitalized competitors, including in certain instances dealerships owned by manufacturers and national and regional retail chains. In our retail commercial truck dealership operations, we compete with other manufacturers an d retailers of medium and heavy- duty truck s such as Ford, International Kenworth, Mack, Peterbilt and Volvo. We also compete with dealers that sell the same brands of new vehicles that we sell and with dealers that sell other brands of new vehicles that we do not represent in a particular market. Our new vehicle dealership competitors have franchise agreements which give them access to new vehicles on the same terms as us. Automotive dealers also face competition in the sale of new vehicles from purchasing services and warehouse clubs. With respect to arranging financing for our customers&#8217; vehicle purchases, we compete with a broad range of financial institutions such as banks and local credit unions. 

&#160; 

For used vehicle sales, we compete in a highly fragmented market which sells more than 40 million units annually through other franchised dealers, independent used vehicle dealers, automobile rental agencies, purchasing services, private parties and used vehicle &#8220;superstores&#8221; for the procurement and resale of used vehicles. We compete with other franchised dealers to perform warranty repairs, and with other dealers, franchised and non-franchised service center chains, and independent garages for non-warranty repair and routine maintenance business. We compete with other dealers, franchised and independent aftermarket repair shops, and parts retailers in our parts operations. We believe that the principal factors consumers consider when determining where to purchase vehicle parts and service are price, the use of factory-approved replacement parts, facility location, the familiarity with a manufacturer&#8217;s brands and the quality of customer service. A number of regional or national chains offer selected parts and services at prices that may be lower than our prices. 

&#160; 

We believe the majority of consumers are utilizing the I nternet and other digital media in connection with the purchase of new and used vehicles. Accordingly, we face increased competition from online vehicle websites, including those developed by manufacturers and other dealership groups. Consumers can use the I nternet and other digital media to compare prices for vehicles and related services, which may result in reduced margins for new vehicles, used vehicles and related services. 

&#160; 

Commercial Vehicle Distribution. With respect to our commercial vehicle distribution operations in Australia and New Zealand, we compete with manufacturers, distributors, and retailers of other vehicles and products in our m arkets. The brands we represent in Australia hold an 8.1% market share in the Australian heavy-duty truck market, and a 5.6% market share in New Zealand . 

&#160;

&#160; 

PTL. &#160; As an alternative to using PTL&#8217;s full-service truck leasing or contract maintenance services, PTL believes that most potential customers perform some or all of these services themselves. They may also purchase similar or alternative services from other third-party vendors. PTL&#8217;s full-service truck leasing operations compete with companies providing similar services on a national, regional and local level. PTL&#8217;s contract maintenance offering competes primarily with truck and trailer manufacturers and independent dealers who provide maintenance services. Its commercial and consumer rental operations compete with several other nationwide truck rental systems, a large number of truck leasing and rental companies with multiple branches operating on a regional basis, and many similar companies operating primarily on a local basis. Its logistics business competes with other dedicated logistics providers, transportation management businesses, freight brokers, warehouse providers and truckload carriers on a national, regional and local level, as well as with the internal supply chain functions of prospective customers who rely on their own resources for logistics management. 

&#160; 

Employees and Labor Relations 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed more than &#160; 22,000 people , approximately 670 of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements with labor unions. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. Our policy is to motivate our key managers through, among other things, variable compensation programs tied principally to local profitability. Due to our reliance on vehicle manufacturers, we may be adversely affected by labor strikes or work stoppages at the manufacturers&#8217; facilities. 

&#160; 

Regulation 

&#160; 

We operate in a highly regulated industry and a number of regulations affect the marketing, selling, financing, servicing, and distribution of vehicles. Under the laws of the jurisdictions in which we currently operate, we typically must obtain a license in order to establish, operate or relocate a dealership, or operate a repair facility. These laws also regulate our conduct of business, including our advertising, operating, financing, employment, distribution and sales practices. Other laws and regulations include franchise laws and regulations, environmental laws and regulations (see &#8220;Environmental Matters&#8221; below), laws and regulations applicable to new and used motor vehicle dealers, as well as privacy, identity theft prevention, wage-hour, anti-discrimination and other employment practices laws. 

&#160; 

Our financing activities with customers are subject to truth-in-lending, consumer leasing, equal credit opportunity and similar regulations, as well as motor vehicle finance laws, installment finance laws, insurance laws, usury laws and other installment sales laws. Some jurisdictions regulate finance fees that may be paid as a result of vehicle sales. In recent years, private plaintiffs, state attorneys general and federal agencies in the U.S. have increased their scrutiny of advertising, sales, and finance and insurance activities in the sale and leasing of motor vehicles. As further discussed in &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors,&#8221; the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau has instituted regulatory proceedings which may change the way we are compensated for assisting our customers in obtaining financing, which could result in lower related revenues. 

&#160; 

In the U.S., we benefit from the protection of numerous state franchise laws that generally provide that a manufacturer or distributor may not terminate or refuse to renew a franchise agreement unless it has first provided the dealer with written notice setting forth good cause and stating the grounds for termination or non-renewal. Some state franchise laws allow dealers to file protests or petitions or to attempt to comply with the manufacturer&#8217;s criteria within the notice period to avoid the termination or non-renewal. Europe generally does not have these laws and, as a result, our European dealerships operate without these types of protections. 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

We are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations, including those governing discharges into the air and water, the operation and removal of aboveground and underground storage tanks, the use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and other materials and the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination. Our business involves the generation, use, handling and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, including environmentally sensitive materials such as motor oil, filters, 

&#160;

transmission fluid, antifreeze, refrigerant, batteries, solvents, lubricants, and fuel. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

Our operations involving the management of hazardous and other environmentally sensitive materials are subject to numerous requirements. Our business also involves the operation of storage tanks containing such materials. Storage tanks are subject to periodic testing, containment, upgrading and removal under applicable law. Furthermore, investigation or remediation may be necessary in the event of leaks or other discharges from current or former underground or aboveground storage tanks. In addition, water quality protection programs govern certain discharges from some of our operations. Similarly, certain air emissions from our operations, such as auto body painting, may be subject to relevant laws. Various health and safety standards also apply to our operations. 

&#160; 

We may have liability in connection with materials that are sent to third-party recycling, treatment, and/or disposal facilities under the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and comparable statutes. These statutes impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault or the legality of the conduct that contributed to the contamination. Responsible parties under these statutes may include the owner or operator of the site where the contamination occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances released at these sites. 

&#160; 

An expanding trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. Vehicle manufacturers are subject to federally mandated corporate average fuel economy standards, which will increase substantially through 2025. Furthermore, in response to concerns that emissions of carbon dioxide and certain other gases, referred to as &#8220;greenhouse gases,&#8221; may be contributing to warming of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, climate change-related legislation and policy changes to restrict greenhouse gas emissions are being considered, or have been implemented, at state and federal levels. Furthermore, numerous states, including California, have adopted or are considering requiring the sale of specified numbers of zero-emission vehicles. Significant increases in fuel economy requirements or new federal and state restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide on vehicles and automobile fuels in the U.S. could adversely affect prices of and demand for the vehicles that we sell. 

&#160; 

We have a proactive strategy related to environmental, health and safety compliance, which includes contracting with third-parties to inspect our facilities periodically. We believe that we do not have any material environmental liabilities and that compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material effect on us. However, soil and groundwater contamination is known to exist at certain of our current or former properties. Further, environmental laws and regulations are complex and subject to change. In addition, in connection with our acquisitions, it is possible that we will assume or become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities, some of which may be material. Compliance with current, amended, new or more stringent laws or regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws or the future discovery of environmental conditions could require additional expenditures by us, and such expenditures could be material. 

&#160; 

Insurance 

&#160; 

Our business is subject to substantial risk of loss due to significant concentrations of property value, including vehicles and parts at our locations. In addition, we are exposed to liabilities arising out of our operations such as employee claims, customer claims and claims for personal injury or property damage, and potential fines and penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements. We attempt to manage such risks through loss control and risk transfer utilizing insurance programs which are subject to specified deductibles and significant retentions. Certain insurers have limited available property coverage in response to the natural catastrophes experienced in recent years. As a result, we are exposed to uninsured and underinsured losses that could have a material adverse effect on us.

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Dealership. Our business is modestly seasonal overall. Our U.S. operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales in the second and third quarters of each year due in part to consumer buying trends and the introduction of new vehicle models. Also, vehicle demand, and to a lesser extent demand for service and parts, is generally lower during the winter months than in other seasons, particularly in regions of the U.S. where dealerships may be subject to severe winters. Our U.K. operations generally experience higher volumes of vehicle sales in the first and third quarters of each year, due primarily to vehicle registration practices in the U.K. 

&#160; 

Commercial Vehicle Distribution. Our commercial vehicle distribution business generally experiences higher sales volumes during the second quarter of the year, which is primarily attributable to commercial vehicle customers completing annual capital expenditures before their fiscal year-end, which is typically June 30 in Australia and New Zealand. 

&#160;
