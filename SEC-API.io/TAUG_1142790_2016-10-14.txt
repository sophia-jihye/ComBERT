 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

General Overview 

&#160; 

We are a Florida corporation formed on April 8, 2001. We were originally organized to be a blank check company. 

&#160; 

On June 8, 2009, the Board of Directors approved the change of name to &#8220;Novo Energies Corporation&#8221;. As described in a report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 26, 2009, a majority of shareholders executed a written consent in lieu of an Annual Meeting (the &#8220;Written Consent&#8221;) effecting the change of the name of our business from &#8220;Atlantic Wine Agencies, Inc.&#8221; to &#8220;Novo Energies Corporation&#8221; on June 8, 2009 to better reflect what we then intended to be our future operations. We filed an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation on June 8, 2009 with the Florida Secretary of State to affect this name change after receiving the requisite corporate approval. 

&#160; 

On June 23, 2009, the Board of Directors approved a 3-for-1 forward stock split. Accordingly, all share and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted in the accompanying financial statements. 

&#160; 

On July 30, 2009, Novo Energies Corporation (&#8220;Novo&#8221;) formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, WTL Renewable Energy, Inc. (&#8220;WTL&#8221;). WTL was established as a Canadian Federal Corporation whose business is to initially research available technologies capable of transforming plastic and tires into useful energy commodities. Simultaneously, WTL also intended to plan, build, own, and operate renewable energy plants throughout Canada utilizing a third party technology and using plastic and tire waste as feedstock. On May 8, 2012, the name was changed to Immunovative Canada, Inc. 

&#160; 

On May 17, 2011, Novo entered into an exclusive memorandum of understanding with Immunovative Clinical Research, Inc. (&#8220;ICRI&#8221;), a Nevada corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Immunovative Therapies, Ltd. (&#8220;ITL&#8221;), an Israeli corporation pursuant to which the Company and ICRI intended to pursue a merger resulting in Novo owning ICRI. 

&#160; 

In April 2012, the Board of Directors approved the change of name to &#8220;Immunovative, Inc.&#8221; As described in a report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 30, 2012, a majority of shareholders executed a written consent in lieu of an Annual Meeting (the &#8220;Written Consent&#8221;) effecting the change of the name of our business from &#8220;Novo Energies Corporation&#8221; to &#8220;Immunovative, Inc.&#8221; on April 2, 2012 to better reflect what we then intended to be our future operations. We filed an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation on April 30, 2012 with the Florida Secretary of State to affect this name change after receiving the requisite corporate approval. 

&#160; 

On January 8, 2013, the Company received from ITL, a notice by which ITL purported to terminate the License Agreement dated December 9, 2011 between the Company and ITL (the &#8220;ITL Notice&#8221;), along with alleged damages. It is the Company&#8217;s position that ITL breached the License Agreement by delivering the ITL Notice and, that prior to the ITL Notice, the License Agreement was in full force and, on January 17, 2013 and that the Company had complied in all material respect with the License Agreement therefore the Company believes that there are no damages to ITL. As such, on January 17, 2013, the Company filed a lawsuit against ITL, which included the request for various injunctive relief against ITL for damages stemming from this breach. 

&#160; 

On February 19, 2013, the Company and ITL entered into a settlement agreement whereby the parties have agreed to the following: (1) the Company will submit a letter to the Court advising the Court that the parties have reached a settlement and that the Company is withdrawing its motion, (2) ITL will pay the Company $20,000, (3) ITL will issue to the Company, ITL&#8217;s share capital equivalent to 9% of the issued and outstanding shares of ITL, (4) the Company will change its name and (5) the settling parties agree that the license agreement will be terminated. The Company had valued these shares at $0 since they deemed the investment to be worthless. During the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company sold the 3,280,000 shares for $125,000 which is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. 

&#160; 

On March 13, 2013, the Board of Directors approved the change of name to &#8220;Tauriga Sciences, Inc.&#8221; from &#8220;Immunovative, Inc.&#8221; We filed an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation on March 13, 2013 with the Florida Secretary of State to affect this name change after receiving the requisite corporate approval. The Company&#8217;s symbol change to &#8220;TAUG&#8221; was approved by FINRA effective April 9, 2013. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

On May 31, 2013, the Company signed an exclusive North American license agreement with Green Innovations, Inc. (&#8220;Green Innovations&#8221;) for the commercialization of Bamboo-Based &#8220;100% Tree Free&#8221; products including hospital grade biodegradable disinfectant wipes. This 5-year license agreement functioned such that profits were to be split equally between Tauriga and Green Innovations. In consideration for such agreement Tauriga agreed to pay Green Innovations $250,000 USD and 4,347,826 shares of TAUG common stock. Tauriga received 625,000 shares of Green Innovations common stock as well. The agreement was later amended and completed for the following consideration: Tauriga paid Green Innovations a total of $143,730 USD and an additional 2,500,000 shares of TAUG common stock (for an aggregate share issuance of 6,847,826 shares). As of March 31, 2016, Tauriga has not generated any revenues from the license agreement. This agreement expires on June 1, 2018. 

&#160; 

On October 29, 2013 the Company entered into a Strategic Alliance with Synthetic Biology Pioneer Bacterial Robotics LLC to Develop and Commercialize Industry Specific Bacterial Robots &#8220;BactoBots&#8221;. Under terms of the Agreement the companies will jointly develop a nuclear industry-specific Bacterial Robot (&#8220;BactoBots(TM)&#8221;). BactoBots are ubiquitous microscopic robots applicable to therapeutics, wastewater, and chemicals. Specifically, Bacterial Robotics owns a family of intellectual property beginning with U.S Patent # 8,354,267 B2 that relates generally to genetically enhanced bacteria that conduct specific functions. Bacterial Robotics initial focus with Tauriga is developing a proprietary BactoBot to remediate wastewater generated by nuclear energy production. On July 15, 2016, the Company was notified by its patent attorney, that the maintenance fee is due in the issue of US Patent # 8,354,267. The final deadline to pay the fee to avoid abandonment is January 15, 2017. If the Company does not make this payment it will lose the patent permanently. 

&#160; 

On November 25, 2013, the Company entered a definitive agreement to acquire Cincinnati, Ohio based Pilus Energy LLC (&#8220;Pilus Energy&#8221;), a developer of alternative cleantech energy platforms using proprietary microbial solutions that creates electricity while consuming polluting molecules from wastewater. Upon consummation of the proposed transaction, which has been unanimously ratified by Tauriga&#8217;s board of directors, Pilus Energy will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tauriga. In addition, certain advisors of Pilus Energy will be incorporated into the existing management team of Tauriga and report directly to the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer. A total of $100,000 was paid by Tauriga to Bacterial Robotics in connection with the execution of this November 2013 definitive agreement for the acquisition of Pilus Energy. 

&#160; 

On January 28, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of Cincinnati, Ohio based synthetic biology pioneer Pilus Energy LLC (&#8220;Pilus Energy&#8221;). Structurally Pilus Energy will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Tauriga (pursuant to the terms of the definitive agreement) and will maintain its headquarters location in the State of Ohio. The management of Pilus Energy will report directly to both the Chief Executive Officer (&#8220;CEO&#8221;) and Chief Operating Officer (&#8220;COO&#8221;) of Tauriga with the expectation that at least one board seat of Tauriga will be allocated to a Pilus Energy affiliate. The Board of Directors of Tauriga Sciences unanimously approved both the previously announced definitive merger agreement on October 25, 2013 as well as the completion of the acquisition inclusive of amended closing terms. In consideration for early closing of this acquisition, shareholders of Pilus Energy received 100,000,000 shares of Tauriga Sciences, Inc. common stock at $0.02 per share. 

&#160; 

The main benefits in accelerating the closing of this acquisition are to enhance Tauriga&#8217;s access to capital markets and enable the intrinsic value of Pilus Energy&#8217;s technology to be realized sooner through demonstrable progress in the commercialization process. Pilus Energy utilizes a proprietary clean technology to convert industrial customer &#8220;wastewater&#8221; into value. This wastewater-to-value (&#8220;WTV&#8221;) proposition provides customers with substantial revenue-generating and cost-saving opportunities. Pilus Energy is converging digester, fermenter, scrubber, and other proven legacy technologies into a single scalable Electrogenic Bioreactor (&#8220;EBR&#8221;) platform. This transformative microbial fuel cell technology is the basis of the Pilus Cell(TM). The EBR harnesses genetically enhanced bacteria, also known as bacterial robots, or BactoBots(TM), that remediate water, harvest direct current (DC) electricity, and produce economically important gases and chemicals. The EBR accomplishes this through bacterial metabolism, specifically cellular respiration of nearly four hundred carbon and nitrogen molecules typically called pollutants in wastewater. Pilus Energy&#8217;s highly metabolic bacteria are non-pathogenic. Because of the mediated biofilm formation, these wastewater-to-value BactoBots(TM) resist heavy metal poisoning, swings of pH, and survive in a 4-to-45-degree Celsius temperature range. Additionally, the BactoBots(TM) are anaerobically and aerobically active, even with low biological oxygen demand (&#8220;BOD&#8221;) and chemical oxygen demand (&#8220;COD&#8221;). 

&#160; 

On March 10, 2014, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire California based Honeywood LLC, developer of a topical medicinal cannabis product (Therapeutic Cream) that currently sells in numerous dispensaries across the state of California. This definitive agreement was valid for a period of 120 days and Tauriga advanced to Honeywood $217,000 USD to be applied towards the final closing requisite cash total and incurred $178,000 in legal fees as of March 31, 2014 in connection with the acquisition. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

On March 26, 2014, the Company announced that its wholly owned subsidiary Pilus Energy LLC (&#8220;Pilus Energy&#8221;) has commenced a five-phase, $1,700,000 USD commercial pilot test (&#8220;commercial pilot&#8221;) with the Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;), utilizing Chicago Bridge &#38; Iron Co. (NYSE:CBI) (&#8220;CB&#38;I&#8221;) Federal Services serving as the third-party-contractor through the EPA&#8217;s Test and Evaluation (&#8220;T&#38;E&#8221;) facility. This five phase commercial pilot will include significant testing of the Pilus Energy Electrogenic Bioreactor (&#8220;EBR&#8221;) synthetic biology platform for generating value from wastewater. This commercial pilot is of great importance to the Company, because it represents the scale up from the benchtop (laboratory) scale to commercial (industrial) scale. The Metropolitan Sewer District of Greater Cincinnati (&#8220;MSDGR&#8221;), which is co-located with EPA&#8217;s T&#38;E facility, will host the commercial scale EBR prototype at its main treatment plant in Cincinnati. 

&#160; 

On September 24, 2014 (the &#8220;Unwinding Date&#8221;), the Company, Honeywood and each of the Honeywood Principals entered into a Termination Agreement (the &#8220;Termination Agreement&#8221;) to unwind the effects of the Merger (the &#8220;Unwinding Transaction&#8221;). Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, the Merger Agreement, the Standstill Agreement and the Employment Agreements were all terminated. As required by the Termination Agreement, on the Unwinding Date the Company entered into an Assignment of Interest (the &#8220;Assignment of Interest&#8221;) pursuant to which it conveyed its membership interest in Honeywood to the Honeywood Principals, as a result of which Honeywood ceased to be owned by the Company and became owned again by the Honeywood Principals. 

&#160; 

In the Termination Agreement, the Honeywood Principals relinquished their right to any merger consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement, including the right to any shares of capital stock of the Company (which had never been formally issued or delivered), and agreed that all indicia of any Company shares issuable as merger consideration reflected on the transfer books of the Company, if any, would be cancelled without any further action by the Honeywood Principals. The shares of the Company that would have been issuable as merger consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement if the Unwinding Transaction had not been consummated consisted of: (i) shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock representing approximately 15.457% of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock as of the Merger (109,414,235 shares) payable to the Honeywood Principals, (ii) 18,000,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock payable to a consultant of Honeywood, and (iii) additional shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock representing up to 10% of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common as of the Merger payable to the Honeywood Principals as an earn-out upon the achievement of certain milestones. Because of the Unwinding Transaction, none of the foregoing shares will be issued by the Company and the stockholders of the Company will not experience the dilution that would have resulted from such issuance. 

&#160; 

In accordance with the Termination Agreement, Honeywood agreed to repay to the Company substantially all of the advances made by the Company to Honeywood prior to and after the Merger by delivering to the Company on the Unwinding Date a Secured Promissory Note in the principal amount of $170,000 (the &#8220;Note&#8221;). The Note bears interest at 6% per annum and is repayable in six quarterly installments on the last day of each calendar quarter starting on March 31, 2015 and ending on June 30, 2016. The Note is secured by a blanket security interest in Honeywood&#8217;s assets pursuant to a Security Agreement entered into on the Unwinding Date between Honeywood and the Company (the &#8220;Security Agreement&#8221;). 

&#160; 

The Termination Agreement contains a general release and covenant not to sue pursuant to which the Company, Honeywood and the Honeywood Principals released, and agreed not to sue with respect to, any and all rights they have against each other through the Unwinding Date except for their respective rights under the Termination Agreement, the Assignment of Interest, the Note, the Security Agreement, the License Agreement and the Release and Covenant Not to Sue dated July 15, 2014 entered into in connection with the closing of the Merger. The Termination Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants regarding confidentiality and non-disparagement.

Private Placement &#8211; April 18, 2016 

&#160; 

On April 18, 2016, the Company completed an equity private placement for $105,500 to date comprised of accredited individual investors as well as one institutional investor. The terms of this private placement are as follows: $0.004 per share of common stock with a related three-year warrant for 40% of each share of common stock purchased at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. The warrants require the investors to pay cash to exercise the warrants and do not allow for cashless exercise. All shares to be issued will be &#8220;restricted securities&#8221; as such term is defined by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Company collected $7,500 of this in March 2016, and the remaining funds in April 2016 at the time the shares and warrants were issued. The $7,500 is included in the liability for stock to be issued as of March 31, 2016. 

&#160; 

The proceeds from this private placement will be used for working capital purposes, most specifically to fund the Company&#8217;s ongoing litigation against Cowan Gunteski Co. P.A., and settle some outstanding obligations and establish new business opportunities for the Company. 

&#160; 

Private Placement &#8211; June 27, 2016 

&#160;

On June 27, 2016, the Company completed an additional $194,000 USD in equity private placement financing from six accredited individual investors. The terms of this private placement are as follows: $0.004 per share of common stock with a related three-year warrant for 40% of each share of common stock purchased and an exercise price of $0.01 per share. The warrants require the investors to pay cash to exercise the warrants and do not allow for cashless exercise. For example, an investor who invested $10,000 USD in this financing round received 2,500,000 shares of common stock and the 1,000,000 warrant to purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.01 for a period of three years. The Company received funds for 48,500,000 shares of common stock at $0.004 per share (of which 47,000,000 shares are pending issuance) and warrants for an additional 19,400,000 shares of common stock as part of the financing. All shares issued and to be issued will be &#8220;restricted securities&#8221; as such term is defined by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

&#160; 

Lawsuit Filed Against Cowan Gunteski &#38; Co. PA 

&#160; 

On November 4, 2015, the Company filed a lawsuit against its predecessor audit firm Cowan Gunteski &#38; Co. PA in Federal Court &#8212; Southern District Florida (Miami, Florida) entitled &#8220;Tauriga Sciences, Inc. v. Cowan, Gunteski &#38; Co., P.A. et al&#8221;, Case No. 0:15-cv-62334. The case has since been transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The case alleges, among other things, that Cowan Gunteski committed malpractice with respect to the audit of the Company&#8217;s FY 2014 financial statements (as illustrated in the PCAOB Public Censure of July 23, 2015) and then misrepresented to the Company with respect about its ability to re-issue an independent opinion for FY 2014 financial statements. On July 31, 2015, the Company was delisted from the OTCQB Exchange to the OTC Pink Limited Information Tier due to its inability to file its FY 2015 Form 10K. The lawsuit was expected by the Company and its counsel to take up to 18 months to complete, from the date it was filed (November 4, 2015). 

&#160; 

The Company in its lawsuit seeks damages against Cowan Gunteski (and its malpractice insurance policy) exceeding $4,000,000. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in this lawsuit. 

&#160; 

Subsequent to the filing of the lawsuit, the Company was notified that the lawsuit was temporarily suspended so that the Company and Cowan can attempt to mediate this case. On December 30, 2015, the Company was notified that Daniel F. Kolb was appointed as the mediator. 

&#160; 

Mediation commenced on February 3, 2016. During these efforts, the Company had been offered settlement amounts, but none that have been satisfactory. 

&#160; 

On March 22, 2016 the Company decided that its good faith efforts to settle its ongoing litigation with Cowan Gunteski &#38; Co. P.A. have proven unsuccessful. Therefore, the Board of Directors of the Company unanimously agreed to proceed to trial. The case is expected to proceed in Federal District Court &#8212; Southern District Florida (Miami, Florida) with an expectation that the venue will be challenged. The Company is continuing to seek the assistance of independent experts, to help ascribe dollar amounts for certain damages suffered by the Company (&#8220;provable damages&#8221;). At this point in time, the Company has realized out of pocket cash losses and debts (inclusive of liquidated damages) that exceed $850,000. Additional potential damages include but are not limited to: inability to properly maintain Pilus Energy&#8217;s Intellectual Property (&#8220;Pilus IP&#8221;), the July 31, 2015 delisting of the Company shares from OTCQB to Pink Sheets, loss of market capitalization (&#8220;market cap&#8221;), loss of trading liquidity (&#8220;trading volume&#8221;), and loss of substantial business opportunities. In aggregate the Company intends to seek monetary award(s), during trial, in excess of $4,000,000. That figure is expected to continually increase as additional time lapses. 

&#160; 

On May 10, 2016, the Company was notified of an Order Reopening Case, Scheduling Order for Pretrial Conference set for December 7, 2016 before Judge Robin L. Rosenberg, Trial set for January 23, 2017 in West Palm Beach Division, and a Calendar Call set for January 18, 2017. 

&#160; 

On September 26, 2016, a motion was filed requesting that the trial date be moved from the current scheduled date of January 23, 2017 to July 24, 2017 (6-months.) The Company must respond to this motion no later than October 14, 2016. 

&#160; 

On September 29, 2016, the judge presiding over the case approved the ruled on the two outstanding motions filed on June 13, 2016. The motion to transfer the case to United States District Court for the District of New Jersey was approved, however the judge denied the defendants&#8217; motion to dismiss the lawsuit. Depositions have commenced in this case.

&#160; 

Convertible Notes Payable 

&#160; 

Group 10 Holdings LLC 

&#160; 

On August 3, 2016, the Company entered into a $48,000 convertible debenture with OID in the amount of $8,000 with Group 10 Holdings LLC. Along with this note, 8,000,000 commitment shares must be issued to the holder within 15 days or an event of default will have occurred (shares were issued on August 4, 2016), earned in full upon purchase of the debenture. This debenture bears 12% interest per annum with a default interest rate of the lesser of 18% or the or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law, effective as of the issuance date of this debenture (&#8220;default interest rate&#8221;.) If any event of default occurs, the outstanding principal amount of this debenture, plus accrued but unpaid interest, liquidated damages and other amounts owing in respect thereof through the date of acceleration, shall become, at holder&#8217;s election, immediately due and payable in cash in the sum of (a) one hundred eighteen percent (118%) of the outstanding principal amount of this debenture plus one hundred percent (100%) of accrued and unpaid interest thereon and (b) all other amounts, costs, expenses and liquidated damages due in respect of this debenture (&#8220;mandatory default amount&#8221;). After the occurrence of any event of default, the interest rate on this debenture shall accrue at an interest rate equal the default interest rate. 

&#160; 

Subject to the approval of holder for prepayments after one hundred eighty (180) days, borrower may prepay in cash all or any portion of the principal amount of this debenture and accrued interest thereon, with a premium, as set forth below (each a &#8220;prepayment premium&#8221;), upon ten (10) business days prior written notice to holder. Holder shall have the right to convert all or any portion of the principal amount and accrued interest thereon during such ten (10) business day notice period. The amount of each prepayment premium shall be as follows: (a) one hundred forty-five percent (145%) of the prepayment amount if such prepayment is made at any time from the issuance date until the maturity date. 

&#160; 

The holder shall have the right, but not the obligation, at any time after the issuance date and until the maturity date, or thereafter during an event of default, to convert all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount, accrued interest and fees due and payable thereon into fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock of borrower at the conversion price, (the &#8220;conversion shares&#8221;) which shall mean the lesser of (a) sixty percent (60%) multiplied by the lowest closing price during the thirty-five (35) trading days prior to the notice of conversion is given (which represents a discount rate of forty percent (40%)) or (b) one-half of a penny ($0.005.) 

&#160; 

If the market capitalization of the borrower is less than two million dollars ($2,000,000) on the day immediately prior to the date of the notice of conversion, then the conversion price shall be twenty-five percent (25%) multiplied by the lowest closing price during the thirty-five (35) trading days prior to the date a notice of conversion is given (which represents a discount rate of seventy-five percent (75%)). Additionally, if the closing price of the borrower&#8217;s common stock on the day immediately prior to the date of the notice of conversion is less than two-tenths of a penny ($0.002) then the conversion price shall be twenty-five percent (25%) multiplied by the lowest closing price during the thirty-five (35) trading days prior to a notice of conversion is given (which represents a discount rate of seventy-five percent (75%)). 

&#160; 

The note also contains a most favored nations status provision whereby the borrower or any of its subsidiaries issue any security (in an amount under one million dollars ($1,000,000)) with any term more favorable to the holder such more favorable term, at holder&#8217;s option, shall become a part of the transaction documents with holder. 

&#160; 

At all times during which this debenture is outstanding, borrower shall reserve and keep available from its authorized and unissued shares of common stock (the &#8220;share reserve&#8221;) for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of this debenture and payment of interest on this debenture, free from preemptive rights or any other actual or contingent purchase rights of persons other than holder, not less than five times the aggregate number of shares of the commons stock that shall be issuable the conversion of the outstanding principal amount of this debenture and payment of interest hereunder. Initially, the share reserve shall be equal to one hundred fifty million (150,000,000) shares. The holder may request bi-monthly increases to reserve such amounts based on a conversion price equal to the lowest closing price during the preceding thirty-five (35) day. Borrower agrees that it will take all such reasonable actions as may be necessary to assure that the conversion shares may be issued. Borrower agrees to provide holder with confirmation evidencing the execution of such share reservation within fifteen (15) business days from the issuance date. 

&#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Holder may provide the transfer agent with written instructions to increase the share reserve in accordance therewith in the event of: (a) closing price of borrower&#8217;s common stock is less than $0.002 for three (3) consecutive trading days; or (b) borrower&#8217;s issued and outstanding shares of common stock is greater than seventy of their authorized shares. Then the share reserve shall increase to the number of shares of common stock equal to the five (5) times the value of the outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest. 

&#160; 

Further, as part of the terms of this note the Company agrees that it will not incur further indebtedness other than (a) lease obligations and purchase money indebtedness of up to one hundred thousand dollars, in the aggregate, incurred in connection with the acquisition of capital assets and lease obligations with respect to newly acquired or leased assets, (c) indebtedness that (i) is expressly subordinate to this debenture pursuant to a written subordination agreement with holder that is acceptable to holder in its sole and absolute discretion and (ii) matures at a date sixty (60) days later than the maturity date, (d) trade payables and other accounts payable of borrower incurred in the ordinary course of business in accordance with GAAP and not evidenced by a promissory note or other security, and (e) indebtedness existing on the date hereof and set forth on the Balance Sheet dated September 30, 2015, provided that (x) the terms of such indebtedness are not changed from the terms in effect as of the most recent balance sheet date, and (y) any such indebtedness which is for borrowed money is not due and payable until after August 3, 2017. 

&#160; 

Reports to Security Holders 

&#160; 

We intend to furnish our shareholders annual reports containing financial statements audited by our independent registered public accounting firm and to make available quarterly reports containing unaudited financial statements for each of the first three quarters of each year. We file Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Current Reports on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission in order to meet our timely and continuous disclosure requirements.
