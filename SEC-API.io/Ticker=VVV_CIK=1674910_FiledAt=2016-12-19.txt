Premium branded product offerings enhance Valvoline&#8217;s high quality reputation and provide customers with solutions that address a wide variety of needs. &#32; 

Reportable Segments 

Valvoline&#8217;s reporting structure is principally composed of three reportable segments: Core North America, Quick Lubes and International. Additionally, certain corporate and other costs are included in an Unallocated and other segment. 

Core North America &#32; - The Core North America segment &#32; sells Valvoline&#8482; and other branded and private label products in the United States and Canada to both consumers who perform their own automotive maintenance, referred to as &#8220;Do-It-Yourself&#8221; or &#8220;DIY&#8221; consumers, as well as to installer customers who use Valvoline products to service vehicles owned by &#8220;Do-It-For-Me&#8221; or &#8220;DIFM&#8221; consumers. Valvoline sells to its DIY consumers through retail auto parts stores, such as AutoZone, O&#8217;Reilly Auto Parts and Advance Auto Parts, as well as leading mass merchandisers and independent auto part stores. Valvoline also sells branded products and services to installer customers such as car dealers, general repair shops and third-party quick lube locations, including Goodyear, Monro, Express Oil Change, TBC Retail Group and Sears, directly through distributors. The Valvoline team also sells branded products and solutions to heavy duty customers, such as on-highway fleets and construction companies, and has a strategic relationship with Cummins Inc. (&#8220;Cummins&#8221;), a leading heavy duty engine manufacturer, for co-branding products in the heavy duty business. 

Quick Lubes - The Quick Lubes segment services the passenger car and light truck quick lube market through two platforms: Valvoline&#8217;s company-owned and franchised Valvoline Instant Oil Change SM (&#8220;VIOC&#8221;) stores, the second largest U.S. retail quick lube service chain by number of stores; and Express Care&#8482;, a quick lube customer platform developed for independent operators who purchase Valvoline motor oil and other products pursuant to contracts while displaying Valvoline branded signage. VIOC centers offer customers a quick, easy, and trusted way to maintain their vehicles, utilizing well-trained technicians who have access to a proprietary service process that sets forth rigorous protocols for both the steps that must be followed in the service of vehicles and for interactions with customers. As of September 30, 2016, the VIOC network consisted of 342 company-owned and 726 franchised centers and operated in 44 states. The Express Care&#8482; platform supports smaller (typically single store) operators that do not fit Valvoline&#8217;s franchised model and typically offer other non-quick lube services such as auto repairs and car washes. As of September 30, 2016, there were 347 Express Care&#8482; locations. 

International - Valvoline&#8217;s International segment sells Valvoline&#8482; and other branded products through wholly-owned affiliates, joint ventures, licensees and independent distributors in approximately 140 countries outside of the United States and Canada. Key international markets include China; India; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (&#8220;EMEA&#8221;); Latin America; and Australia Pacific. International sales include both passenger car products and heavy duty products used in a wide variety of heavy duty equipment. Passenger car, motorcycle and light duty truck products are sold internationally mostly through distributors in DIFM sales channels to installer customers. Heavy duty products are sold either directly to key customers, or through distributors. Valvoline goes to market in its International business segment in three ways: (1) through its own local sales, marketing, and back office support teams; (2) through 

joint ventures; and (3) through independent distributors. Valvoline has 50/50 joint ventures with Cummins in India and China and smaller joint ventures in select countries in Latin America and Asia. 

Unallocated and other - Valvoline&#8217;s Unallocated and other segment generally includes items such as components of pension and other postretirement benefit plans and certain significant restructuring activities that are not directly attributable to any of the other segments described above, including costs related to the Separation of Valvoline from Ashland and legacy costs. 

The majority of the Company&#8217;s sales comes from the sale of lubricant products which were approximately 89% of Valvoline&#8217;s total consolidated sales for fiscal 2016. For 2016 sales and other information by reportable segment and by geography, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation-Business Overview-Business Results.&#8221;

Corporate Developments 

On September 22, 2015, Ashland announced that its Board of Directors approved proceeding with a plan to separate Ashland into two independent, publicly traded companies comprising of the Valvoline business and the specialty chemicals businesses. To facilitate the Separation, Valvoline Inc. was incorporated in May 2016 as a subsidiary of Ashland. Following a series of restructuring steps prior to the initial public offering (&#8220;IPO&#8221;) of Valvoline common stock, the Valvoline business was transferred from Ashland to Valvoline Inc. 

On September 22, 2016, Ashland and Valvoline announced the pricing of the IPO of 30 million shares of Valvoline&#8217;s common stock at a price to the public of $22.00 per share and closed the IPO on September 28, 2016. The underwriters exercised an option to purchase an additional 4.5 million shares of Valvoline&#8217;s common stock to cover over allotments. The total net proceeds, after underwriter&#8217;s discount and other offering expenses, received from the IPO were $712 million. Valvoline&#8217;s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol &#8220;VVV.&#8221; After completing the IPO, Ashland owns 170 million shares of Valvoline&#8217;s common stock, representing approximately 83% of the total outstanding shares of Valvoline&#8217;s common stock. Ashland presently intends to distribute the remaining shares of Valvoline common stock to Ashland&#8217;s stockholders following the release of second fiscal quarter of 2017 financial results by both Ashland and Valvoline subject to final Ashland board approval as well as the satisfaction or waiver by Ashland of a number of conditions. Ashland may determine not to complete the separation if, at any time, the Board of Directors of Ashland determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that the distribution is not in the best interest of Ashland or its stockholders or is otherwise not advisable. 

As of September 30, 2016, Valvoline includes substantially all of the historical Valvoline business reported by Ashland, as well as certain other assets and liabilities transferred to Valvoline by Ashland. The largest transferred liabilities are the net pension and other postretirement plan liabilities. Other transferred assets and liabilities primarily consist of deferred compensation, certain Ashland legacy business insurance reserves, tax attributes, and certain trade payables. Additionally, any deferred tax assets and liabilities that relate specifically to these assets and liabilities have been transferred to Valvoline, as well as certain other tax liabilities and indemnities as a result of the Tax Matters Agreement entered into between Ashland and Valvoline. 

Industry Overview 

Valvoline participates primarily in the global finished lubricants market. The global finished lubricants market is an approximately $60 billion market with demand for over 11 billion gallons of lubricants. Demand for passenger car motor oil and motorcycle oil accounted for approximately 24% of global lubricant demand, while the remaining 76% of demand was for commercial and industrial products. The United States has historically accounted for the largest amount of lubricant demand, followed by China and India. The lubricants market is impacted by the following key drivers and trends: 

&#8226; 

Global lubricants market demand is shifting towards higher performance finished lubricants, largely driven by advancements in vehicle/equipment design and original equipment manufacturer (&#8220;OEM&#8221;) requirements for improved efficiency, reduced carbon footprints and optimized fuel consumption. 

&#8226; 

There has been increasingly stringent regulation, particularly in North America and Europe aimed at reducing toxic emissions, which has led to a continuous drive for innovation given changing specifications for lubricants. 

&#8226; 

Between 2007 and 2012, the North American transport lubes market experienced average annual volume declines of 2.7% per annum, due in part to an increase in oil change intervals, which have resulted from changing OEM recommendations and advancements in engine technology. However, this trend has reversed over the past two years as an increase in the number of cars on the road and miles driven has led to stable market volumes. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

A surge in the number of cars on the road has led to rapid expansion of passenger vehicle lubricant sales in developing regions. 

Business and Growth Strategies 

The strength of Valvoline&#8217;s business model is the ability to generate profitable sales across multiple channels to market, leveraging the Valvoline brand through effective marketing, innovative product technology and the capabilities of the Valvoline team. Valvoline has delivered strong profits and return on capital, with balanced results. Today, Valvoline is a high margin, high free cash flow generating business, with significant growth opportunities. Valvoline&#8217;s key business and growth strategies include: 

&#8226; 

growing and strengthening Valvoline&#8217;s quick lube network through organic store expansion, opportunistic, high-quality acquisitions in both core and new markets within the VIOC system and strong sales efforts to partner with new Express Care operators, in addition to continued same-store sales growth and profitability within Valvoline&#8217;s existing VIOC system stores as a result of attracting new customers and increasing customer satisfaction, customer loyalty and average ticket size; 

&#8226; 

accelerating international growth across key markets where demand for premium lubricants is growing, such as China, India and select countries in Latin America, by building strong distribution channels in under-served geographies, replacing less successful distributors and improving brand awareness among installer customers in those regions; and 

&#8226; 

&#32;leveraging innovation, both in terms of product development, packaging, marketing and the implementation of Valvoline&#8217;s new digital infrastructure, to strengthen market share and profitability.

Valvoline&#8217;s private label products include lubricants, coolants and chemicals bearing the brand names of some of the world&#8217;s most recognized marketers. 

Competition 

The industry is highly competitive and Valvoline faces competition in all product categories and subcategories. In the United States and Canada, Valvoline&#8217;s principal competitors for retail customers are global integrated oil brands, such as Shell, which produces Pennzoil and Quaker State, BP, which produces Castrol, and Exxon Mobil, which produces Mobil1, mid-tier brands, and private label producers. With respect to installer customers in the United States and Canada, Valvoline competes with these major integrated oil brands and regional private label companies. 

The Quick Lubes segment competes with other major franchised brands that offer a turn-key operations management system, such as Jiffy Lube (owned by Shell), Grease Monkey and Express Oil Change, as well as national branded companies that offer a professional signage program with limited business model support, similar to Valvoline&#8217;s Express Care network, and regional players such as Super-Lube and American Lube Fast that are not directly affiliated with a major brand. Valvoline also competes to some degree with automotive dealerships and service stations, which provide quick lube and other preventative maintenance services. Valvoline believes there are over 9,000 existing quick lube stores currently operating in the U.S. market. Jiffy Lube is currently the largest player, with just over 1,900 stores, all of which are owned and operated by franchisees. 

Major competitors of Valvoline&#8217;s International business vary by region. Valvoline generally faces strong competition from global integrated oil brands, as these companies have a particularly strong presence in Europe and Asia. In certain markets Valvoline also competes with regional brands, including brands produced by national oil companies, such as Sinopec in China and Indian Oil in India. 

Competitive factors in all of these markets include price, product or service technology, brand awareness and loyalty, customer service, and sales and marketing. Valvoline&#8217;s Core North America and International businesses also compete on the basis of shelf space and product packaging. 

Marketing and Advertising 

Valvoline places a high priority on sales and marketing and focuses marketing efforts on areas expected to yield the highest rate of return. Valvoline has dedicated marketing resources in each business segment, which are well qualified to reach target customers. The majority of Valvoline&#8217;s large customers are supported by direct sales representatives with a number of key customers having dedicated Valvoline teams. Consistent with Valvoline&#8217;s belief and value that it &#8220;all starts with our people,&#8221; Valvoline also has a keen focus on sales force effectiveness, with a cross functional team regularly evaluating the recruiting, compensation, performance management and employee development of sales teams. 

Valvoline uses a variety of marketing techniques to build awareness of, and create demand for, Valvoline products and services. Valvoline advertises through social and digital media, as well as traditional media outlets such as television, print and radio. In addition, Valvoline selectively sponsors teams in high performance racing series, including a current sponsorship of Hendrick Motorsports, featuring drivers Dale Earnhardt Jr., Chase Elliott, Jimmie Johnson and Kasey Kahne. 

Valvoline has also embarked on a digital infrastructure initiative that will enable the use of technology across the entire enterprise. Valvoline believes its digital marketing infrastructure will drive more effective engagement to deliver growth, customer retention and acquisition as a strategic business partner. 

Research and Development 

Valvoline&#8217;s innovation is central to the successful performance of its business. Valvoline research and development is focused on developing new and innovative products to meet the current and future needs of its customers. These products are developed through Valvoline&#8217;s &#8220;Hands on Expertise&#8221; innovation approach, which begins with the mathematical modeling of critical product design elements and extends through field testing. In addition, Valvoline technology centers, located in the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific regions, develop solutions for existing and emerging on and off-road equipment. Valvoline&#8217;s research and development team also leverages its strong relationships with customers and suppliers to incorporate their feedback into the research and development process. In addition to its own research and development initiatives, Valvoline also conducts limited testing for other entities, which builds its expertise and partially offsets its research and development costs. 

Intellectual Property 

Valvoline is continually seeking to develop new technology and enhance its existing technology. Valvoline has been issued 33 U.S. and 59 international patents, and has 13 U.S. and 42 international patent applications pending or published. Valvoline also holds approximately 2,450 trademarks in various countries around the world, which Valvoline believes are some of its most valuable assets, and Valvoline dedicates significant resources to protecting them. These trademarks include the Valvoline trademark and the famous &#8220;V&#8221; brand logo trademark, which are registered in over 150 countries. Valvoline owns over 700 domain names that are used to promote Valvoline products and services and provide information about the Company. 

Raw Material Supply and Prices 

The key raw materials used in Valvoline&#8217;s business are base oils, additives, packaging materials (high density polyethylene bottles and steel drums) and ethylene glycol. Valvoline continuously monitors global supply and cost trends of these key raw materials and obtains these raw materials from a diversified network of large global suppliers and regional providers. Valvoline&#8217;s sourcing strategy is to ensure supply through contracting a diversified supply base while leveraging market conditions to take advantage of spot opportunities whenever such conditions are available. Valvoline leverages worldwide spend to obtain favorable contract terms from the global suppliers and use the regional providers to ensure market competitiveness and reliability in its supply chain. For materials that must be customized, Valvoline works with market leaders with global footprints and well developed business continuity plans. Valvoline also utilizes the Company&#8217;s research and development resources to develop alternative product formulations, which provide flexibility in the event of supply interruptions. Valvoline closely monitors the Company&#8217;s supply chain and conducts annual supply risk assessments of its critical suppliers to reduce risk. 

Valvoline seeks to actively manage fluctuations in supply costs, product selling prices and the timing thereof to preserve unit margins. The prices of many of Valvoline&#8217;s products fluctuate based on the price of base oil, which is a large percentage of Valvoline&#8217;s cost of sales. Historically, base oil prices have been volatile, which sometimes causes sharp cost increases during periods of short supply, which was the case in 2011. Since that time, base oil supply has increased dramatically while global demand has generally grown at a steady and moderate rate. Although base oil, a derivative of crude, is highly correlated to the global oil market, excess supply of base oil in recent years has contributed to reduced volatility in the base oil market. Base oil prices generally follow crude prices, but the lag period between changes in the price of crude oil and changes in the price of base oil is influenced by whether there is an excess of or shortness in the supply of base oil. 

Valvoline has generally been successful in adjusting product selling prices to account for changes in base oil costs in order to preserve unit margins. As part of the strategy to mitigate the impact of base oil volatility, Valvoline has negotiated base oil supply contracts with terms that have reduced the impact of changes in the base oil market on Valvoline&#8217;s financial results. Valvoline has revised contracts in several of the Company&#8217;s sales channels to accelerate the timing of adjustments to selling prices in response to changes in raw material prices. Pricing adjustments to product sold to Valvoline&#8217;s larger national or regional accounts in its installer channel tend to be made pursuant to contract and are often based on movements in published base oil indices. Pricing for product sold to Valvoline&#8217;s franchisees is adjusted on a periodic basis pursuant to an agreed upon index (weighted combination of published base oil indices), the composition and weighting of which may be updated from time to time by Valvoline and representatives of Valvoline&#8217;s franchisees. Pricing adjustments for product sold in Valvoline&#8217;s DIY channel, private label products in the United States and product sold to smaller accounts in its installer channel are generally market driven, based on negotiations in light of base oil costs and the pricing strategies of Valvoline&#8217;s competitors. 

Seasonality 

Overall, there is little seasonality in Valvoline&#8217;s business. Valvoline Quick Lubes business and, to a lesser extent, its Core North America business tend to experience slightly higher sales volume in the summer months due to summer vacations and increased driving, as well as during the periods of time leading into holidays. Both businesses also tend to slow a little from October to February due to inclement weather in parts of the United States and Canada. Valvoline&#8217;s International business experiences almost no seasonality due to its geographic diversity and the high percentage of its business in the commercial and industrial lubricants market, which is less influenced by weather. 

Environmental Health and Safety 

Valvoline is subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local Environmental Health and Safety (&#8220;EHS&#8221;) laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern matters such as safe working conditions; product stewardship; air emissions; discharges to the land and surface waters; generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials; and the registration and evaluation of chemicals. Valvoline maintains policies and procedures to control EHS risks and monitor compliance with applicable EHS laws and regulations. These laws and regulations also require Valvoline to obtain, and comply with, permits, registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities. These authorities can modify or revoke the Company's permits, registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions. 

Valvoline expects to incur ongoing costs to comply with existing and future EHS requirements, including the cost of a dedicated EHS group that will be responsible for ensuring its business maintains compliance with applicable laws and regulations. This responsibility will be carried out through training; widespread communication of EHS policies; formulation of policies, procedures and work practices; design and implementation of EHS management systems; internal auditing by a separate auditing group; monitoring legislative and regulatory developments that may affect Valvoline's operations; and incident response planning. 

Government Regulation 

Valvoline is subject to regulation by various U.S. federal regulatory agencies and by the applicable regulatory authorities in countries in which Valvoline&#8217;s products are manufactured and sold. Such regulations principally relate to the ingredients, labeling, packaging, advertising and marketing of Valvoline&#8217;s products. In addition, as a result of Valvoline&#8217;s commercial operations overseas, the Company is subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other countries&#8217; anti-corruption and anti-bribery regimes, such as the U.K. Bribery Act. 

Employees 

As of September 30, 2016, Valvoline and its consolidated subsidiaries had approximately 5,150 employees (excluding contract employees).
