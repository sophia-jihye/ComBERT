 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

GENERAL 

Overview 

Viavi Solutions Inc. &#32;(&#8220; Viavi ,&#8221; also referred to as &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221;), formerly JDS Uniphase Corporation (&#8220;JDSU&#8221;), is a global provider of network test, monitoring and assurance solutions to communications service providers, enterprises and their ecosystems, supported by a worldwide channel community. Our solutions deliver end-to-end visibility across physical, virtual and hybrid networks, enabling customers to optimize connectivity, quality of experience and profitability. Viavi is also a leader in high performance thin film optical coatings, providing light management solutions to anti-counterfeiting, consumer and industrial, government and healthcare and other markets. On August 1, 2015, we completed the separation (&#8220;Separation&#8221;) of our optical components and lasers business and created two publicly-traded companies: 

&#8226; 

an optical components and commercial lasers company, Lumentum Holdings Inc. (&#8220; Lumentum &#8221;), consisting of our former Communications and Commercial Optical Products (&#8220; CCOP &#8221;) segment and the WaveReady product line within our Network Enablement (&#8220; NE &#8221;) segment; and 

&#8226; 

a network and service enablement and optical coatings company, renamed Viavi , consisting of our NE , Service Enablement (&#8220; SE &#8221;) and Optical Security and Performance Products (&#8220; OSP &#8221;) segments. 

In connection with the Separation we distributed approximately 80.1% of the outstanding shares of Lumentum common stock to our stockholders on August 1, 2015. The Company was renamed Viavi &#32;and, at the time of the distribution, retained ownership of approximately 19.9% of Lumentum &#8217;s outstanding shares. Activities related to the Lumentum business have been presented as discontinued operations in all periods of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the accompanying disclosures, discussion and analysis herein pertains to the Company&#8217;s continuing operations, unless noted otherwise. 

To serve our markets, during fiscal 2016 &#32;we operated the following business segments: 

&#8226; 

Network Enablement 

&#8226; 

Service Enablement 

&#8226; 

Optical Security and Performance Products 

Industry Trends 

NE and SE 

There is a convergence of multiple technologies taking place in the networking industry to meet the needs of increased network capacity and faster transmission speeds across the physical network and across the airwaves. In order to meet these demand challenges, the network needs to be more agile, flexible, programmable and cost-effective. This will require networks to transition from a hardware-centric approach to a virtualized software-centric approach. These transformative changes in the network are driving the shift to software defined networking (&#8220; SDN &#8221;) and network function virtualization (&#8220; NFV &#8221;). 

Our NE and SE products and solutions are well positioned to meet these industry trends in the deployment of next generation network technologies. There is a race towards providing 1 gigabit per second (&#8220;Gbps&#8221;) speed with the deployment of optical fiber-to-the-home (&#8220; FTTH &#8221;) and to &#8220;everywhere&#8221; (&#8220;FTTx&#8221;). Cable service providers are investing in high speed connection and increased bandwidth availability with the deployment of DOCSIS 3.1. Network service providers are also upgrading digital subscriber line (&#8220;DSL&#8221;) to G.fast technology. With the growing number of connected smart mobile devices and demand for high-speed broadband access to support video and other high-bandwidth applications, capacity is increasing at the edge of the network pushing the expansion of the overall network and larger links along with new networks requiring re-architecture for scalability and flexibility. Over the airwaves, 5G is expected to augment and expand the 4G/Long Term Evolution (&#8220;LTE&#8221;) wireless technology within the next five years which is expected to provide 100x faster speeds (about 1 Gbps) and 50x lower latency time (about 1 millisecond). All this network expansion and new technology deployment requires sophisticated network monitoring and assurance of quality of the overall network. 

OSP 

Counterfeiting of bank notes and other goods is on the rise because counterfeiters now have access to a broad range of advanced but relatively low-cost imaging technologies and printing tools giving them the ability to create convincing simulations of actual documents and products for illicit purposes. At the same time, the penalties for counterfeiting can often be relatively modest when compared to the penalties for other crimes. We have decades of anti-counterfeiting expertise leveraging our Optically Variable Pigment (&#8220; OVP&#174; &#8221;), and more recently our Optically Variable Magnetic Pigment (&#8220; OVMP&#174; &#8221;) technologies to protect the integrity of banknotes and other high-value documents by delivering optical effects that are very easy for consumers to recognize but also very difficult for counterfeiters to reproduce. We also provide optical technologies for government, healthcare, consumer electronics and industrial markets. 

In addition to network and anti-counterfeiting solutions, we extend our technology expertise to solve complex problems and deliver unique solutions in other industries. For example, we manufacture and sell optical filters for 3D sensing products that separate out ambient light from incoming data to allow devices to be controlled by a person&#8217;s movements or gestures. 

Sales and Marketing 

Communication service providers (&#8220; CSP s&#8221;), consisting of telecommunications, cable and cloud service providers, make up the majority of NE and SE revenues. We also market and sell our products to network-equipment manufacturers (" NEMs "), original equipment manufacturers (&#8220; OEMs &#8221;), enterprises, governmental organizations, distributors and strategic partners worldwide. We have a dedicated sales force organized around the markets our segments serve that works directly with customers&#8217; executive, technical, manufacturing and purchasing personnel to determine design, performance, and cost requirements. We are also supported by a worldwide channel community, including Viavi&#8217;s Velocity Solution Partners who support our NE and SE segments. 

A high level of support is a critical part of our strategy to develop and maintain long-term collaborative relationships with our customers. We develop innovative products by engaging our customers at the initial design phase and continue to build that relationship as our customers&#8217; needs change and develop. Service and support are provided through our offices and those of our partners worldwide. 

Additional Information 

We were incorporated in California in 1979 as Uniphase Corporation and reincorporated in Delaware in 1993. We are the product of several significant mergers and acquisitions including, among others, the combination of Uniphase Corporation and JDS FITEL in 1999. In 2000 we acquired Optical Coatings Lab, Inc., which is currently part of our OSP business, and in 2005 we acquired Acterna, Inc. which is currently part of our Network and Service Enablement (&#8220; NSE &#8221;) business, which consists of our NE and SE segments. Following these acquisitions, we operated as a company comprised of a portfolio of businesses with a focus on optical innovation, communications network and service enablement, commercial lasers and anti-counterfeiting solutions. In August 2015, we separated our portfolio of businesses into two separate publicly-traded companies to gain greater strategic flexibility to address rapidly changing market dynamics. At the same time, we changed our name to Viavi Solutions Inc. 

We are subject to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, pursuant to which we file annual, quarterly and periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC . The SEC &#32;maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. We also make available free of charge all of our SEC &#32;filings on our website at www.viavisolutions.com/investors as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC .

Based on current and anticipated demand, we continue to invest in research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;) and pursue acquisitions and partnerships to develop new technologies, products and services that offer our customers increased value and strengthen our leadership position in our core markets. 

&#8226; 

Expand our global market presence 

Long term, we expect growth in Asia-Pacific, Eastern Europe and Latin America. Therefore, we are developing products, sales, marketing and customer support to meet the specific customer requirements in these regions to serve these customers. 

Although we expect to successfully implement our strategy, internal and/or external factors could impact our ability to meet any, or all, of our objectives. These factors are discussed under Item 1A - Risk Factors. 

Business Segments 

Following the Separation of the Lumentum business on August 1, 2015, we operated in two broad business categories: NSE &#32;and OSP. NSE &#32;operates in two reportable segments, NE &#32;and SE , whereas OSP &#32;operates as a single segment. Our NSE and OSP businesses each are organized with its own engineering, manufacturing and dedicated sales and marketing groups focused on each of the markets we serve to better support our customers and respond quickly to market needs. In addition, our segments share common corporate services that provide capital, infrastructure, resources and functional support, allowing them to focus on core technological strengths to compete and innovate in their markets. 

The table below discloses the percentage of our total net revenue attributable to each of our three reportable segments.

Additionally, following the Separation we no longer sell products or services from the WaveReady product line. We also moved our Video Assurance products (formerly a component of Media, Access and Content) to our SE segment. For the purposes of providing year-over-year variance analysis in the &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have reflected these changes for all prior periods presented so that they are comparable with our current groupings. 

Service Enablement 

Our SE segment is a provider of embedded systems and enterprise performance management solutions to global CSP s and enterprises with visibility into network, service and application data. Our portfolio of SE solutions - which primarily consist of instruments, microprobes and software - address the same lab and production environments, field deployment and service assurance for wireless and fixed communications networks, including storage networks, as our NE portfolio. Our SE solutions allow carriers to remotely monitor performance and quality of network, service and applications performance throughout the entire network. Remote monitoring decreases operating expenses, while early detection helps provide increased uptime, preserves revenue, and allows operators to better monetize their networks. 

Markets 

Our SE segment provides solutions and services primarily for communication service providers and enterprises that deliver and/or operate broadband/IP networks (fixed and mobile) supporting voice, video and data services as well as a wide range of applications. These solutions provide network and application visibility to enable more cost-effective ways to provide a higher-quality customer experience. 

Customers 

SE customers include similar CSPs, NEMs, government organizations, large corporate customers, and storage-segment customers that are served by our NE segment. &#32; 

Trends 

Our Service Enablement solutions portfolio is a result of several acquisitions made during the past several years to address the network industry shift to a more agile, flexible, programmable, and cost-effective virtualized software-centric network. CSP s along with hyperscale data centers are adopting SDN &#32;and NFV &#32;which our SE solutions address. Network operators require improved network visibility and intelligence in order to ensure reliable network and service performance as well as identify locations for more optimal network deployment and expansion. Traditional data centers are becoming legacy networks that are not programmable and difficult to integrate with third-party applications and have given rise to cloud networks that provide greater network agility and programmability. Our Enterprise product and solutions offerings address customers&#8217; needs to support data center network traffic through application and performance monitoring. CSP s are increasingly demanding Ethernet assurance solutions to provide active performance monitoring and validate the quality of service of the networks. 

While the network industry is shifting towards SDN and NFV, in fiscal 2016 we experienced a decline in SE net revenue compared to fiscal 2015 and certain growth products will require a longer investment cycle than originally expected. In accordance with the authoritative guidance, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $91.4 million related to our SE segment in fiscal 2016. Refer to &#8220; Note 9. Goodwill &#8221; included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Strategy 

We plan to evolve the SE portfolio and determine which products/solutions we believe will provide meaningful return on investment (&#8220;ROI&#8221;) and devote greater focus in these areas to drive profitability. 

Competition 

Our NE and SE segments compete against many of the same companies. Competitors of SE include NetScout Systems, Inc. Riverbed Technology, and Spirent Communications plc. While we face multiple competitors for each of our product families, we 

continue to have one of the broadest portfolios of wireline and wireless monitoring solutions available in the service enablement industry.

Our strength in the banknote anti-counterfeiting market is complemented by our advances in developing novel pigments and foils for a variety of applications. Other areas of R&#38;D focus for OSP include our efforts to leverage our optical coating technology expertise to develop applications for the government and defense markets as well as efforts related to new products for 3-D sensing and smart phone sensors. OSP has also introduced an innovative handheld spectrometer solution with applications in the agriculture, healthcare and defense markets. 

Manufacturing 

As of July 2, 2016 &#32;significant manufacturing facilities for our NE, SE and OSP segments were located in China, France, Germany, Korea and the United States and our significant contract manufacturing partners were located in China and Mexico. 

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 

Viavi uses various suppliers and contract manufacturers to supply parts and components for the manufacture and support of multiple product lines. Although our intention is to establish at least two sources of supply for materials whenever possible, for certain components we have sole or limited source supply arrangements. We may not be able to procure these components from alternative sources at acceptable prices within a reasonable time, or at all; therefore, the loss or interruption of such arrangements could impact our ability to deliver certain products on a timely basis. 

Patents and Proprietary Rights 

Intellectual property rights apply to our various products include patents, trade secrets and trademarks. We do not intend to broadly license our intellectual property rights unless we can obtain adequate consideration or enter into acceptable patent cross-license agreements. As of July 2, 2016 , we owned approximately 700 U.S. patents and 925 foreign patents and have 500 patent applications pending throughout the world. 

Backlog 

Backlog consists of purchase orders for services and products for which we have assigned shipment dates. As of July 2, 2016 &#32;and June 27, 2015, our backlog was approximately $234 million for both periods, excluding the backlog related to Lumentum as of June 27, 2015. 

Due to possible changes in product delivery schedules and cancellation of product orders, and because our sales often reflect orders shipped in the same quarter in which they are received, our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual revenue or the level of orders for any succeeding period. 

Employees 

We employed approximately 3,000 &#32;employees as of July 2, 2016 , which included approximately 900 employees in manufacturing, 800 &#32;employees in R&#38;D, 850 employees in sales and marketing, and 450 employees in general and administration. This compared to a workforce of approximately 4,900 &#32;and 5,100 &#32;as of June 27, 2015 &#32;and June 28, 2014 , respectively, which also included employees who transferred to Lumentum as part of the Separation. On August 1, 2015, approximately 1,700 &#32;employees were transferred to Lumentum as part of the separation of the Lumentum business which included approximately 850 &#32;employees from manufacturing, 550 &#32;employees from R&#38;D, 150 &#32;employees from sales and marketing and 150 employees general and administration. 

Similar to other technology companies, we rely upon our ability to use &#8220;Full Value Awards&#8221; (as defined below) and other forms of stock-based compensation as key components of our executive and employee compensation structure. Full Value Awards refer to Restricted Stock Units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;) and performance-based RSUs that are granted with the exercise price equal to zero and are converted to shares immediately upon vesting. The performance-based RSUs are also referred to as Market Stock Units and have vesting requirements tied to the performance of the Company&#8217;s stock as compared to the NASDAQ telecommunications index, and could vest at a higher or lower rate or not at all, based on this relative performance. Historically, these components have been critical to our ability to retain important personnel and offer competitive compensation packages. Without these components, we would be required to significantly increase cash compensation levels or develop alternative compensation structures to retain our key employees. 

Outside of the United States, our businesses are subject to labor laws that differ from those in the United States. The Company follows statutory requirements, and in certain European countries it is common for a works council, consisting of elected employees, to represent the sites when discussing matters such as compensation, benefits or terminations of employment. We consider our employee relations to be good.
