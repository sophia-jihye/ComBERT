Business. 

Organization 

Virtus Investment Partners, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) commenced operations on November 1, 1995 through a reverse merger with Duff &#38; Phelps Corporation. The Company was a majority-owned subsidiary of The Phoenix Companies, Inc. (&#8220;PNX&#8221;) from 1995 to 2001 and a wholly-owned subsidiary of PNX from 2001 until 2008. On December 31, 2008, PNX distributed 100% of Virtus common stock to PNX stockholders in a spin-off transaction. 

Our Business 

We are a provider of investment management and related services to individuals and institutions. We use a multi-manager, multi-style approach, offering investment strategies from affiliated managers and select unaffiliated subadvisors, each having its own distinct investment style, autonomous investment process and individual brand. By offering a broad array of products, we believe we can appeal to a greater number of investors which allows us to have opportunities across market cycles and through changes in investor preferences. 

We provide our products in a number of forms and through multiple distribution channels. Our retail products include open-end mutual funds, closed-end funds, exchange traded funds, variable insurance funds, Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities ("UCITS") and separately managed accounts. Our open-end mutual funds and exchange traded funds are distributed through financial intermediaries. Our closed-end funds trade on the New York Stock Exchange, and our exchange traded funds are traded on either the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ. Our variable insurance funds are available as investment options in variable annuities and life insurance products distributed by life insurance companies. Separately managed accounts are comprised of intermediary programs, sponsored and distributed by unaffiliated brokerage firms and private client accounts which are offered to the high net-worth clients of one of our affiliated managers. We also manage institutional accounts for corporations, multi-employer retirement funds, public employee retirement systems, foundations, endowments and as a subadviser to unaffiliated mutual funds. Our earnings are primarily driven by asset-based fees charged for services relating to these products including investment management, fund administration, distribution and shareholder services. These fees are based on a percentage of assets under management (&#8220;AUM&#8221;) and are calculated using daily or weekly average assets, quarter-end assets or average month-end assets. 

Our Investment Managers 

Our investment management services are provided by investment managers who are registered investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the &#8220;Investment Advisers Act&#8221;). The investment managers are responsible for portfolio management activities for our retail and institutional products operating under advisory or subadvisory agreements. We provide our affiliated managers with distribution, operational and administrative support, thereby allowing each affiliated manager to focus primarily on investment management. We also engage select unaffiliated subadvisers for certain of our open-end mutual funds and exchange traded funds. At December 31, 2015 , $12.7 billion or 26.8% of our assets under management were managed by unaffiliated subadvisers. We monitor the quality of our managers&#8217; services by assessing their performance, style, consistency and the discipline with which they apply their investment process. 

Our affiliated investment managers and their respective assets under management, styles and strategies are as follows:

Closed-End Funds 

We managed nine closed-end funds as of December 31, 2015 , each of which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, with aggregate assets of $6.2 billion. Closed-end funds do not continually offer to sell and redeem their shares; rather, daily liquidity is provided by the ability to trade the shares of these funds at prices that may be above or below the shares&#8217; net asset value.

Exchange Traded Funds 

In April 2015, we made an investment for a majority ownership position in Virtus ETF Solutions (&#8220;VES&#8221;), formerly known as ETF Issuer Solutions, that operates a platform for listing, operating, and distributing exchange traded funds. We manage seven U.S.-domiciled exchange traded funds with total assets under management of $0.3 billion at December 31, 2015 . 

Separately Managed Accounts 

Separately managed accounts are individually owned portfolios that include intermediary sponsored programs, whereby an intermediary assists individuals in hiring investment managers that have been approved by the broker-dealer to fulfill those objectives and private client accounts that are accounts of high net-worth individuals who are direct clients of an affiliated manager. Separately managed account assets totaled $6.8 billion at December 31, 2015 . 

Institutional Accounts 

We offer a variety of equity and fixed income strategies to institutional clients, including corporations, multi-employer retirement funds, public employee retirement systems, foundations, endowments and as a subadviser to unaffiliated mutual funds. Our institutional assets under management totaled $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2015 .

Investment Management Fees 

We provide investment management services pursuant to investment management agreements through our affiliated investment advisers (each, an &#8220;Adviser&#8221;). With respect to our open-end funds, closed-end funds and exchange traded funds, the Adviser provides overall management services to a fund, subject to supervision by the fund&#8217;s board of directors, pursuant to agreements that must be approved annually by each fund&#8217;s board of directors and which may be terminated without penalty upon written notice, or automatically, in certain situations, such as a &#8220;change in control&#8221; of the Adviser. We earn fees based on each fund&#8217;s average daily or weekly net assets with most fee schedules providing for rate declines or &#8220;breakpoints&#8221; as asset levels increase to certain thresholds. For funds managed by a subadviser, the agreement provides that the subadviser manage the day-to-day investment management of the fund&#8217;s portfolio and receive a management fee from the Adviser based on the percentage of average daily net assets in the funds they subadvise or a percentage of the Adviser&#8217;s management fee. Each fund bears all expenses associated with its operations. In some cases, to the extent total fund expenses exceed a specified percentage of a fund&#8217;s average net assets, the Adviser has agreed to reimburse the funds for such excess expenses or voluntarily or contractually waive a portion of its fee for a period of time. 

For separately managed accounts and institutional accounts, fees are negotiated and are based primarily on asset size, portfolio complexity and individual client requests. 

Administration Fees 

We provide fund administration services to our open-end funds, exchange traded funds and certain of our closed-end funds. We earn fees based on each fund&#8217;s average daily or weekly net assets. Administrative services include recordkeeping, preparing and filing documents required to comply with federal and state securities laws, legal administration and compliance services, supervising the activities of the funds&#8217; other service providers, providing assistance with fund shareholder meetings, tax services and treasury services as well as providing office space, equipment and personnel that may be necessary for managing and administering the business affairs of the funds. 

Transfer Agent Fees 

We provide shareholder services to our open-end mutual funds. We earn fees based on each fund&#8217;s average daily net assets. Shareholder services include maintaining shareholder accounts, processing shareholder transactions, preparing filings and performing necessary reporting, among other things. We engage third-party service providers to perform certain aspects of the shareholder services. 

Our Distribution Services 

We distribute our open-end funds and exchange traded funds through financial intermediaries. We have broad access in the retail market, with distribution partners that include national and regional broker-dealers and independent financial advisory firms. Our sales efforts are supported by regional sales professionals, a national account relationship group and separate teams for the retirement and insurance products. 

Our separately managed accounts are distributed through financial intermediaries and directly by teams at our affiliated managers. Our institutional distribution strategy is an affiliate-centric model. Through relationships with consultants, they target key market segments, including foundations and endowments, corporate, public and private pension plans and subadvisory accounts. 

Our Broker-Dealer Services 

We have two subsidiaries that are broker-dealers registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), and are members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;). They serve as principal underwriters and distributors of our open-end mutual funds, exchange traded funds and our separately managed accounts. Our broker-dealers are subject to the SEC's net capital rule designed to enforce minimum standards regarding the general financial condition and liquidity of broker-dealers. 

Open-end mutual fund shares, UCITS and exchange traded fund shares are distributed by VP Distributors, LLC ("VPD") and ETF Distributors, LLC (&#8220;ETFD&#8221;) both under sales agreements with unaffiliated financial intermediaries. VPD also markets advisory services to sponsors of separately managed account programs. ETFD serves as the principal underwriter and distributor of our exchange traded funds. 

Our Competition 

We face significant competition from a wide variety of financial institutions, including other investment management companies, as well as from proprietary products offered by our distribution partners such as banks, broker-dealers and financial planning firms. Competition in our businesses is based on several factors including investment performance, access to distribution channels, service to financial advisers and their clients and fees charged. Our competitors, many of which are larger than we are, often offer similar products and use similar distribution sources and may also offer less expensive products, have greater access to key distribution channels and have greater resources than we do. 

Our Regulatory Matters 

We are subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;), FINRA and other federal and state agencies and self-regulatory organizations. Each affiliated manager and unaffiliated subadviser is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act. Each open-end mutual fund, closed-end fund, exchange traded fund and each series of our variable insurance funds is registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Our Global Funds are subject to regulation by the Central Bank of Ireland (&#8220;CBI&#8221;) and the funds and each investment manager and sub-investment manager to the Global Funds are registered with the CBI. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for more information. 

The financial services industry is highly regulated and failure to comply with related laws and regulations can result in the revocation of registrations, the imposition of censures or fines and the suspension or expulsion of a firm and/or its employees from the industry. All of our U.S.-domiciled open-end mutual funds are currently available-for-sale and are qualified in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Our Global Funds are sold through financial intermediaries to investors who are not citizens of or residents of the United States. Most aspects of our investment management business, including the business of the unaffiliated subadvisers, are subject to various U.S. federal and state laws and regulations. 

Our officers, directors and employees may, from time to time, own securities that are also held by one or more of our funds. Our internal policies with respect to personal investments are established pursuant to the provisions of the Investment Company Act and/or the Investment Advisers Act. Employees, officers and directors who, in the function of their responsibilities to us, meet the requirements of the Investment Company Act, Investment Advisers Act and/or of FINRA regulations, must disclose personal securities holdings and trading activity. Those employees, officers and directors with investment discretion or access to investment decisions are subject to additional restrictions with respect to the pre-clearance of the purchase or sale of securities over which they have investment discretion or beneficial interest. Other restrictions are imposed upon supervised persons with respect to personal transactions in securities that are held, recently sold or contemplated for purchase by our mutual funds. All supervised persons are required to report holdings and transactions on an annual and quarterly basis pursuant to the provisions of the Investment Company Act and Investment Advisers Act. In addition, certain transactions are restricted so as to avoid the possibility of improper use of information relating to the management of client accounts. 

Our Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 426 full time equivalent employees. None of our employees are represented by a union.
