The Company 

&#160; 

We are a leading producer of data capture products for the worldwide business mobility markets. Our products are incorporated into mobile applications used in mobile point of sale (mPOS), hospitality, asset management, commercial services, healthcare and other mobile business markets. Our primary products are cordless barcode scanners that connect over Bluetooth and work with applications running on smartphones, mobile computers and tablets using operating systems from Apple&#174; (iOS), Google&#8482; (Android&#8482;) and Microsoft&#174; (Windows&#174;/Windows Mobile&#8482;). We offer an easy-to-use software developer kit (SDK) to mobile application developers to enable the use of our products with their applications. Our products become an ingredient of the application solution and our products are marketed by the application developer or their resellers as part of that solution. Our registered developer program for data capture applications has grown from 700 developers at the beginning of 2015 to more than 1,400 developers at the beginning of 2016. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

We offer barcode scanning products for both 1D (imager and laser) and 2D barcode scanning in standard and durable cases. Our 7 Series barcode scanners are lightweight and ergonomically designed for easy handling as a stand-alone cordless barcode scanner. Our 7 Series standard cases come in 5 vivid colors. Our 7 Series durable barcode scanners are designed for use in environments needing a more durable barcode scanner. In the first half of 2016 we are upgrading our durable barcode scanning line by introducing our D700 series durable barcode scanners in linear imaging, laser and 2D models. Using the same ergonomic form factor, the barcode scanners have an IP54 durability rating and improved durability features. Our 8 Series cordless barcode scanners in linear imaging and 2D models are designed to be attachable to smartphones for one-handed barcode scanning and can also be used in handheld mode. They attach to smartphones with an easily detachable clip. In the first half of 2016, we are introducing a case, &#8220;DuraCase&#8221;, designed to keep the smartphone and barcode scanner together and enabling both devices to be charged simultaneously. 

&#160; 

Many smartphones and tablets now offer Near Field Communications (&#8220;NFC&#8221;), and RFID technology along with digital wallet applications for loyalty cards, identification cards, payment cards, coupons, event tickets and others which leverage the exchange of electronic &#8220;tokens&#8221;. These tokens can be exchanged through another NFC enabled device. We are incorporating an NFC reader/writer into the base of a retail accessory stand that today enables customers to scan barcoded documents. The NFC reader/writer may also be used as a stand-alone base. In addition, we are developing a handheld NFC reader/writer for the similar purposes. We will work with our registered developers during 2016 and beyond to encourage them to include Near Field Communications capabilities in their mobile applications. 

&#160; 

Our Software Developer Kit (&#8220;SDK&#8221;) supports all of our barcode scanners with a single installation, making it easy for a developer to integrate our data collection capabilities while giving the customer the ability to select the products that work best for them. We also support using the built-in camera in a customer&#8217;s smartphone or tablet for lower volume data collection requirements. When a developer builds in our SDK, a customer can edit and direct the placement in their application of collected data while also receiving feedback that the collection of data was successfully completed. 

&#160; 

Cordless barcode scanning represented 85 percent of our revenue in 2015, up from 79 percent in 2014. We also offer a handheld mobile computer first introduced in 2007 running Windows Embedded 6.5 operating system from Microsoft. Handheld computer and legacy product revenue represented 13 percent of our revenue in 2015 and 18 percent of our revenue in 2014. Handheld computer revenue has been in decline as developers move their applications to smartphones and tablets. We have announced that we will discontinue our handheld computer product line during 2016. Service revenue represented 2 percent of our revenue in 2015 and 3 percent in 2014.

&#160; 

&#160; 

We design our own products and test product components obtained from third party contract manufacturers. We perform final product assembly, test, package, and distribute our products at and from our Newark, California facility. We offer our products worldwide through two-tier distribution enabling customers to purchase from a large number of on-line resellers around the world including application developers who resell their own products along with our data collection products. We believe growth in mobile applications and the mobile workforce are resulting from technical advances in mobile technologies, cost reductions in mobile devices and the growing adoption by businesses of mobile applications, building a growing demand for our products. Our data capture products address the growing need for speed and accuracy by today&#8217;s mobile workers and by the systems supporting those workers, thereby enhancing their productivity and allowing them to exploit time sensitive opportunities and improve customer satisfaction.

&#160; 

NFC data capture products 

Near Field Communications (NFC), an RFID radio technology, is being widely deployed in smartphones to enable the electronic transfer of loyalty cards, identification cards, payment cards, coupons, event tickets and electronic tokens on smartphones and similar devices, often in combination with Beacon technology that identifies for the smartphone the electronic information accepted by a merchant or vendor and helps present such information for identification, event entry, coupon application or payment. We are developing products that our registered developers can use within their applications to accept information either by barcode scan or by an electronic transfer of data over NFC/RFID. The NFC/RFID products are expected to commence shipping late in 2016. 

&#160; 

Handheld Computers 

We offer a family of SoMo&#174; (&#8220; So cket&#174; Mo bile&#8221;) handheld computer products with antimicrobial cases running the Windows Embedded Handheld System 6.5 operating system. Handheld computer accessories include plug-in 1D and 2D barcode scanners, charging cradles, durable cases, and plug-in radio frequency identification (RFID) readers with NFC (near field communications). Our handheld computers are designed with wireless LAN (802.11 b/g/n) and Bluetooth connectivity for use with applications that do not require phones. Our newest family of handheld computers, the SoMo Model 655, commenced sales in June 2012, replacing the SoMo650 introduced in 2007. Due to the technical obsolescence of key components, we have announced end of life for this product family and are expected to exhaust supplies during 2016.

Marketing Strategy and Dynamics 

&#160; 

Capitalize on Strategic Relationships . We actively support software application developers to integrate our products into their applications through our registered developer program. We provide an easy to use software developer kit (SDK) and training and technical support to our registered developers. We support the marketing activities of our registered developers in promoting the applications that include our products. Once our barcode scanning products are integrated into a developer&#8217;s application, our products become part of the application solution and are part of the developer&#8217;s marketing program for that application. We stay current on operating system updates provided by Apple, Google and Microsoft to support new products running the latest versions of their operating systems on smartphones, tablets and mobile computers while providing backward compatibility. We spend extensive engineering time and resources to ensure that our cordless barcode scanning products are compatible with a wide variety of the most popular smartphones, tablets and mobile computers running a variety of operating systems. We adhere to standards of a number of standards setting bodies whose technologies are used in our products including Bluetooth (both handheld computers and cordless barcode scanners) and wireless LAN (handheld computers). 

&#160; 

Markets . Our growth in 2015 and 2014 was driven by sales of barcode scanners integrated into retail mobile point of sale applications for use with Apple tablets. Many developers of mobile point of sale applications have been funded by venture capital organizations enabling their rapid development and growth. Other mobile markets being addressed by registered developers include hospitality, asset management, commercial services, and healthcare. We expect all of these markets to increase the availability and use of mobile applications and the demand for mobile barcode scanners. 

&#160; 

Expand and improve our product offerings. We offer a wide range of products that enable application developers and their customers to design their mobile systems to meet their specific requirements, and we encourage our distributors to support the full range of our products. The goal is for customers to view Socket as a primary source for their mobile barcode scanning needs. Within our family of barcode scanning products, we offer durable and standard cases (the latter in multiple colors), linear imaging and laser barcode scanning, 2D barcode scanning, and two form factors: an ergonomically designed handheld cordless barcode scanner (our model 7 series) and a smartphone attachable barcode scanner (our model 8 series) to enable one-handed barcode scanning. Both series 7 and series 8 products connect cordlessly over Bluetooth and may be used as handheld barcode scanners. We design our products to comply with the regulations of the many worldwide agencies that regulate the safety, performance and use of electronic products. 

&#160; 

Price our products competitively and available worldwide . We have designed our products to be priced competitively although we are subject to changes in component pricing by our suppliers. We update our products from time to time and work with our vendors to achieve reductions in component pricing. We distribute our products through a worldwide distribution network that places products into geographic regions to shorten purchasing times and provides a credit shield to us. Our largest distributors are Ingram Micro&#174;, ScanSource&#174; and BlueStar, and they support a worldwide network of on-line resellers including Amazon&#174;.com, CDW&#174; and Barcodes, Inc. 

5 &#160; 

&#160; 

Build a Strong Brand Name . We believe that our products make a difference in the daily work life of mobile workers and the people they serve. We are building a brand image focused on business mobility. This image closely associates us with business mobility solutions and to reflect this image, we began doing business as Socket Mobile, Inc. in January 2007 and changed our legal name to Socket Mobile, Inc. in April 2008. We stress with customers the design of our products for the markets they address, emphasizing quality and standards-based connectivity. Mobility requires products that are compact and designed to be handled while mobile, with low power consumption to extend time between charges, and easy to use. We strive to offer high performance products in a wide range of competitive prices. Through our developer support program, we work closely with application developers who are developing productivity enhancing applications for the mobile workforce. Our overall company brand identity and positioning goal is to be a leading provider of easy-to-deploy business mobility data capture systems to the business mobility market. 

&#160; 

Competition and Competitive Risks 

&#160; 

The overall market for mobile handheld computing solutions is both complex and competitive. Our barcode scanning hardware products compete with similar hardware products in all of our markets in the United States, Europe and Asia and we differentiate our products with our software developer kit and our underlying data capture software designed to work with smartphones, tablets and other mobile computers running the Apple, Android and Windows operating systems. Our longtime focus on creating innovative mobile solutions for the mobile workforce has resulted in good brand name recognition and reputation. We believe that our brand name identifies our products as durable, dependable, small form factor, low power and easy to use, all features designed for a mobile worker while mobile, and the breadth of our product offerings, including the extensive features of our software and software developer kit will continue to differentiate us relative to our competitors. 

&#160; 

Cordless Barcode Scanning. We offer a full range of handheld cordless barcode scanners connecting to smartphones, tablets and other computing devices over Bluetooth. Our Software Developer Kit (SDK) enables registered third party application developers to integrate the features of our Data Capture software into their applications and helps differentiate our products. We face competition from products similar to our cordless hand scanners from Koamtec, Code Corporation, and Opticon (Japan). Barcodes may also be scanned using the built-in camera in smartphones or tablets with applications like Scandit or Manatee Works. However, scanning using the built-in camera is typically slower and more awkward especially as the pixel count gets larger. Users may choose a barcode scanner that connects directly to an Apple tablet, iPhone or computer such as offered by Infinite Peripherals and Honeywell. Users also may choose more rugged barcode scanners as an alternative, some of which are integrated into computing devices from manufacturers such as Datalogic, Honeywell&#174;, and Zebra Technologies. Many of these devices are not Apple certified. Many connect to Apple devices over Bluetooth in keyboard emulation mode, and do not offer extensive tools for software developers such as our software developer kit (SDK) to integrate features of our sophisticated data collection scanning software into data capture applications. 

&#160; 

Near Field Communications (NFC) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). We are developing the use of NFC/RFID technology with NFC/RFID reader/writers to enable the transfer of electronic tokens to and from smartphones, tablets and mobile applications that are supported by our software developer kit. Use of electronic tokens includes loyalty cards, identification cards, payment cards, coupons, and event tickets. Distribution of electronic tokens by organizations to customers is becoming more widespread, and organizations need the ability to accept these tokens electronically from their customers. For retail organizations, we are adding NFC reader/writer technology to the base of our presentation stand which will support data collection either by scanning a barcode including one displayed on an electronic screen or by electronically accepting the transfer of an NFC token. We are also developing a stand-alone RFID handheld reader/writer that communicates over Bluetooth. NFC today is primarily being used to facilitate payment transactions through organizations such as Square, Clover, Revel Systems, Poynt, Verifone and Ingenico using Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay. Other developers are able to facilitate payments within their mobile applications using software tools supplied by Apple, Google, PayPal and Visa. If a registered developer adds the use of our NFC/RFID products to their application, their customers will be able to broaden their use of NFC/RFID beyond payments to issue and accept loyalty cards, identification cards, coupons and event tickets.
