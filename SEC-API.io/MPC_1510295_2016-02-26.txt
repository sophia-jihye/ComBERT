 Item 1. Business 

Overview 

Marathon Petroleum Corporation (&#8220;MPC&#8221;) has 128 &#32;years of experience in the energy business with roots tracing back to the formation of the Ohio Oil Company in 1887. We are one of the largest independent petroleum product refining, marketing, retail and transportation businesses in the United States and the largest east of the Mississippi. With the merger of MPLX LP (&#8220;MPLX&#8221;), the midstream master limited partnership sponsored by MPC, and MarkWest Energy Partners, L.P. (&#8220;MarkWest&#8221;) effective December 4, 2015 (the &#8220;MarkWest Merger&#8221;), we believe we are one of the largest natural gas processors in the United States and the largest processor and fractionator in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions. Our operations consist of three reportable operating segments: Refining &#38; Marketing; Speedway; and Midstream . Each of these segments is organized and managed based upon the nature of the products and services it offers. 

&#8226; 

Refining &#38; Marketing &#8211; refines crude oil and other feedstocks at our seven &#32;refineries in the Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States, purchases refined products and ethanol for resale and distributes refined products through various means, including barges, terminals and trucks that we own or operate. We sell refined products to wholesale marketing customers domestically and internationally, buyers on the spot market, our Speedway &#174; &#32;business segment and to independent entrepreneurs who operate Marathon &#174; &#32;retail outlets. 

&#8226; 

Speedway &#8211; sells transportation fuels and convenience products in the retail market in the Midwest, East Coast and Southeast. 

&#8226; 

Midstream &#8211; includes the operations of MPLX and certain other related operations. Following the MarkWest Merger, we changed the name of this segment from Pipeline Transportation to Midstream to reflect its expanded business activities. There were no changes to the historical financial information reported for this segment. The Midstream segment gathers, processes and transports natural gas; gathers, transports, fractionates, stores and markets natural gas liquids and transports and stores crude oil and refined products. 

See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8211; Note 10 &#32;for operating segment and geographic financial information, which is incorporated herein by reference. 

Corporate History and Structure 

MPC was incorporated in Delaware on November 9, 2009 in connection with an internal restructuring of Marathon Oil Corporation (&#8220;Marathon Oil&#8221;). On May 25, 2011, the Marathon Oil board of directors approved the spinoff of its Refining, Marketing &#38; Transportation Business (&#8220;RM&#38;T Business&#8221;) into an independent, publicly traded company, MPC, through the distribution of MPC common stock to the stockholders of Marathon Oil common stock on June 30, 2011 (the &#8220;Spinoff&#8221;). Following the Spinoff, Marathon Oil retained no ownership interest in MPC, and each company has separate public ownership, boards of directors and management. All subsidiaries and equity method investments not contributed by Marathon Oil to MPC remained with Marathon Oil and, together with Marathon Oil, are referred to as the &#8220;Marathon Oil Companies.&#8221; On July 1, 2011, our common stock began trading &#8220;regular-way&#8221; on the NYSE under the ticker symbol &#8220;MPC.&#8221; 

Recent Developments 

On December 4, 2015, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPLX, the midstream master limited partnership sponsored by MPC, merged with MarkWest, whereby MarkWest became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPLX. Each common unit of MarkWest issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the MarkWest Merger was converted into a right to receive 1.09 common units of MPLX representing limited partner interests in MPLX, plus a one-time cash payment of $6.20 &#32;per unit. Each Class B unit of MarkWest outstanding immediately prior to the merger was converted into the right to receive one Class B unit of MPLX having substantially similar rights, including conversion and registration rights, and obligations that the Class B units of MarkWest had immediately prior to the merger. At closing, we contributed $1.23 billion in cash to MPLX to pay the cash consideration to MarkWest common unitholders. We will contribute an additional total of $50 million in cash to MPLX for the cash consideration to be paid upon the conversion of the MPLX Class B units to MPLX common units in equal installments in July 2016 and July 2017, respectively. These contributions are with respect to MPC&#8217;s existing interests in MPLX (including IDRs) and not in consideration of new units or other equity interest in MPLX. Our financial results and operating statistics reflect the results of MarkWest from the date of the acquisition. 

Consistent with our strategy to grow our midstream business, the MarkWest Merger combines one of the nation&#8217;s largest processors of natural gas and the largest processor and fractionator in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions with a rapidly growing crude oil and refined products logistics partnership sponsored by MPC. The complementary aspects of the highly diverse asset base of MarkWest, MPLX and MPC provide significant additional opportunities across multiple segments of the hydrocarbon value chain. The combined entity will further MarkWest's leading midstream presence in the Marcellus and Utica shales by allowing it to pursue additional midstream projects, which should allow producer customers to achieve superior value for their growing production in these important shale regions. In addition, the combination provides significant vertical integration opportunities, as MPC is a large consumer of NGLs. 

In September 2015, we acquired a 50 percent &#32;ownership interest in a new joint venture with Crowley Maritime Corporation through our investment in Crowley Ocean Partners LLC (&#8220;Crowley Ocean Partners&#8221;), which is included in our Refining &#38; Marketing segment. The joint venture will operate and charter four &#32;new Jones Act product tankers, most of which will be leased to MPC. Contributions to the joint venture with respect to each vessel will occur at the vessel&#8217;s delivery. During 2015, we contributed $72 million &#32;in connection with delivery of the first two vessels. The remaining two vessels are expected to be delivered by the third quarter of 2016. We account for our ownership interest in Crowley Ocean Partners as an equity method investment. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 25 &#32;for information on our conditional guarantee of the indebtedness of the joint venture and future contributions to Crowley Ocean Partners. 

On September 30, 2014, we acquired from Hess Corporation (&#8220;Hess&#8221;) all of its retail locations, transport operations and shipper history on various pipelines, including approximately 40 &#32;mbpd on Colonial Pipeline, for $2.82 billion . We refer to these assets as &#8220;Hess&#8217; Retail Operations and Related Assets&#8221; and substantially all of these assets are part of our Speedway segment. This acquisition significantly expands our Speedway presence from nine &#32;to 22 &#32;states throughout the East Coast and Southeast and is aligned with our strategy to grow higher-valued, stable cash flow businesses. This acquisition also enables us to further leverage our integrated refining and transportation operations, providing an outlet for incremental assured sales from our refining system. The transaction was funded with a combination of debt and available cash. Our financial results and operating statistics reflect the results of Hess&#8217; Retail Operations and Related Assets from the date of the acquisition. 

In July 2014, we exercised our option to acquire a 35 percent ownership interest in Enbridge Inc.&#8217;s Southern Access Extension (&#8220;SAX&#8221;) pipeline which runs from Flanagan, Illinois to Patoka, Illinois. This option resulted from our agreement to be the anchor shipper on the SAX pipeline and our commitment to the Sandpiper pipeline project as discussed below. During 2015 , we made contributions of $147 million &#32;to Illinois Extension Pipeline Company, LLC (&#8220;Illinois Extension Pipeline&#8221;) to fund our portion of the construction costs for the SAX project. We have contributed $267 million &#32;since project inception. The pipeline became operational in December 2015. Our investment in the pipeline is included in our Midstream &#32;segment. 

On April 1, 2014, we purchased a facility in Cincinnati, Ohio from Felda Iffco Sdn Bhd, Malaysia for $40 million . The plant currently produces biodiesel, glycerin and other by-products. The capacity of the plant is approximately 60 million &#32;gallons per year. 

In March 2014, we acquired from Chevron Raven Ridge Pipe Line Company an additional seven percent &#32;interest in Explorer Pipeline Company (&#8220;Explorer&#8221;) for $77 million , bringing our ownership interest to 25 percent . Explorer owns approximately 1,900 miles of refined products pipeline from Lake Charles, Louisiana to Hammond, Indiana. 

In November 2013, we agreed with Enbridge Energy Partners L.P. (&#8220;Enbridge Energy Partners&#8221;) to serve as an anchor shipper for the Sandpiper pipeline, which will run from Beaver Lodge, North Dakota to Superior, Wisconsin. We also agreed to fund 37.5 percent &#32;of the construction of the Sandpiper pipeline project, which is currently estimated to cost $2.6 billion, of which approximately $1.0 billion is our share. We made contributions of $71 million &#32;during 2015 &#32;and have contributed $287 million &#32;since project inception, which are included in our Midstream &#32;segment. In exchange for our commitment to be an anchor shipper and our investment in the project, we will earn an approximate 27 percent equity interest in Enbridge Energy Partners&#8217; North Dakota System when the Sandpiper pipeline is placed into service. The anticipated in-service date for the pipeline is likely to be delayed to early 2019. The project schedule and cost estimates remain under review. Enbridge Energy Partners&#8217; North Dakota System currently includes approximately 240 miles of crude oil gathering pipelines connected to a transportation pipeline that is approximately 730 miles long. We will also have the option to increase our ownership interest to approximately 30 percent through additional investments in future system improvements. 

On August 1, 2013 , we acquired from Mitsui &#38; Co. (U.S.A.), Inc. its interests in three &#32;ethanol companies for $75 million . Under the purchase agreement, we acquired an additional 24 percent &#32;interest in The Andersons Clymers Ethanol LLC (&#8220;TACE&#8221;), bringing our ownership interest to 60 percent ; a 34 percent &#32;interest in The Andersons Ethanol Investment LLC (&#8220;TAEI&#8221;), which holds a 50 percent &#32;ownership in The Andersons Marathon Ethanol LLC (&#8220;TAME&#8221;), bringing our direct and indirect ownership interest in TAME to 67 percent ; and a 40 percent &#32;interest in The Andersons Albion Ethanol LLC (&#8220;TAAE&#8221;), which owns an ethanol production facility in Albion, Michigan. On October 1, 2013, our ownership interest in TAAE increased to 43 percent &#32;as a result of TAAE acquiring one of the owner&#8217;s interest. 

On February 1, 2013, we acquired from BP Products North America Inc. and BP Pipelines (North America) Inc. (collectively, &#8220;BP&#8221;) the 451,000 barrel per calendar day refinery in Texas City, Texas, three intrastate natural gas liquid pipelines originating at the refinery, four light product terminals, branded-jobber marketing contract assignments for the supply of approximately 1,200 branded sites, a 1,040 megawatt electric cogeneration facility and a 50 mbpd allocation of space on the Colonial Pipeline. We refer to these assets as the &#8220;Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets.&#8221; We paid $1.49 billion for these assets, which included $935 million for inventory. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement, we may also be required to pay BP a contingent earnout of up to an additional $700 million over six years, subject to certain conditions. Through the end of 2015, we have paid BP $369 million pursuant to the contingent earnout provisions of the agreement. The Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets are part of our Refining &#38; Marketing and Midstream &#32;segments. 

See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8211; Note 5 &#32;for additional information on these acquisitions and investments. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8211; Note 25 &#32;for information regarding our future contributions to the Sandpiper pipeline project. 

MPLX LP 

MPLX is a publicly traded master limited partnership formed by us to own, operate, develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets related to the transportation and storage of crude oil, refined products and other hydrocarbon-based products. On December 4, 2015, MPLX merged with MarkWest, whereby MarkWest became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPLX. 

Prior to the MarkWest Merger, we owned a 71.5 percent &#32;interest in MPLX, which included our two percent &#32;general partner interest. Each common unit of MarkWest issued and outstanding at the time of the MarkWest Merger was converted into the right to receive 1.09 common units of MPLX and as of December 31, 2015 , our ownership interest in MPLX was 20.4 percent , including our two percent &#32;general partner interest. Due to our general partner interest, we have determined that we control MPLX and therefore we consolidate MPLX and record a noncontrolling interest for the 79.6 percent &#32;interest owned by the public. 

Upon completion of the MarkWest Merger, MPLX assumed an aggregate principal amount of $4.1 billion in senior notes issued by MarkWest and MarkWest Energy Finance Corporation (the &#8220;MarkWest Senior Notes&#8221;). On December 22, 2015, MPLX completed offers to exchange any and all outstanding MarkWest Senior Notes for (1) up to $4.1 billion aggregate principal amount of new notes issued by MPLX having the same maturity and interest rates as the MarkWest Senior Notes and (2) cash of $1 for each $1,000 of principal amount exchanged. As of December 31, 2015, the exchange was completed on all the MarkWest Senior Notes except for 1.6 percent, or $63 million. 

MPLX&#8217;s initial assets consisted of a 51 percent &#32;general partner interest in MPLX Pipe Line Holdings LLC (&#8220;Pipe Line Holdings&#8221;), which owns a network of common carrier crude oil and product pipeline systems and associated storage assets in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions of the United States, and a 100 percent &#32;interest in a butane storage cavern in West Virginia. We originally retained a 49 percent limited partner interest in Pipe Line Holdings. 

On May 1, 2013, we sold a five percent &#32;interest in Pipe Line Holdings to MPLX for $100 million , which was financed by MPLX with cash on-hand. 

On March 1, 2014, we sold a 13 percent &#32;interest in Pipe Line Holdings to MPLX for $310 million . MPLX financed this transaction with $40 million &#32;of cash on-hand and $270 million &#32;of borrowings on its bank revolving credit facility. 

On December 1, 2014, we sold and contributed interests in Pipe Line Holdings totaling 30.5 percent &#32;to MPLX for $600 million &#32;in cash and 2.9 million &#32;MPLX common units valued at $200 million . MPLX financed the sales portion of this transaction with $600 million &#32;of borrowings on its bank revolving credit facility. 

On December 8, 2014, MPLX completed a public offering of 3.5 million &#32;common units at a price to the public of $66.68 &#32;per MPLX common unit, with net proceeds of $221 million . MPLX used the net proceeds from this offering to repay borrowings under its bank revolving credit facility and for general partnership purposes. On December 10, 2014, we exercised our right to maintain our two percent general partner interest in MPLX by purchasing 130 thousand &#32;general partner units for $9 million . 

On February 12, 2015, MPLX completed an underwritten public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of four percent unsecured senior notes due February 15, 2025 (the &#8220;Senior Notes&#8221;). The Senior Notes were offered at a price to the public of 99.64 percent of par. The net proceeds of this offering were used to repay the amounts outstanding under its bank revolving credit facility, as well as for general partnership purposes. 

On December 4, 2015, we sold our remaining 0.5 percent &#32;interest in Pipe Line Holdings to MPLX for $12 million . As a result, MPLX now owns 100 percent of Pipe Line Holdings. 

See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8211; Note 4 &#32;for additional information on MPLX. 

Our Competitive Strengths 

High Quality Refining, Gathering and Processing Assets 

We believe we are the largest crude oil refiner in the Midwest and the fourth largest in the United States based on crude oil refining capacity. We own a seven -plant refinery network, with approximately 1.8 &#32;mmbpcd of crude oil throughput capacity. Our refineries process a wide range of crude oils, feedstocks and condensate, including heavy and sour crude oils, which can generally be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil, and produce transportation fuels such as gasoline and distillates, specialty chemicals and other refined products. While we have historically processed significant quantities of heavy and sour crude oils, our refineries have the ability to process approximately 65 percent to 70 percent light sweet crude oils. 

Through our ownership interests in MPLX and its wholly-owned subsidiary, MarkWest, we believe we are one of the largest processors of natural gas in the United States and the largest processor and fractionator in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions. Our integrated midstream energy asset network links producers of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil from some of the largest supply basins in the United States to domestic and international markets. Our midstream gathering and processing operations include: natural gas gathering, processing and transportation; and NGL gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and marketing. Our assets include approximately 5,400 &#32;MMcf/d of gathering capacity, 7,100 &#32;MMcf/d of natural gas processing capacity and 500 &#32;mbpd of fractionation capacity as of December 31, 2015 . 

Strategic Locations 

The geographic locations of our refineries provide us with strategic advantages. Located in PADD II and PADD III, which consist of states in the Midwest and the Gulf Coast regions of the United States, our refineries have the ability to procure crude oil from a variety of supply sources, including domestic, Canadian and other foreign sources, which provides us with flexibility to optimize crude supply costs. For example, geographic proximity to various United States shale oil regions and Canadian crude oil supply sources allows our refineries access to price-advantaged crude oils and lower transportation costs than certain of our competitors. Our refinery locations and midstream distribution system also allow us to access refined product export markets and to serve a broad range of key end-user markets across the United States quickly and cost-effectively. 

Our Midstream &#32;segment assets are similarly located in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions of the United States, which collectively comprised approximately 73 percent of total United States crude distillation capacity and approximately 53 percent of total United States finished products demand for the year ended December 31, 2015 , according to the EIA. MPLX, through MarkWest, its wholly-owned subsidiary, is the largest processor and fractionator in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions. This significantly compliments and creates strategic opportunities for our Refining &#38; Marketing segment and MPLX&#8217;s logistic assets in the same geographic footprint. 

&#32; &#160;

As of December 31, 2015 &#32; 

Extensive Midstream Distribution Networks 

Our assets give us extensive flexibility and optionality to respond promptly to dynamic market conditions, including weather-related and marketplace disruptions. We believe the relative scale of our transportation and distribution assets and operations distinguishes us from other refining and marketing companies. We currently own, lease or have ownership interests in approximately 8,400 &#32;miles of crude oil and products pipelines. Additionally, we have over 5,000 miles of natural gas and NGL pipelines. We also own one of the largest private domestic fleets of inland petroleum product barges and one of the largest terminal operations in the United States, as well as trucking and rail assets. We operate this system in coordination with our refining and marketing network, which enables us to optimize feedstock and other raw material supplies and refined product distribution, and further allows for important economies of scale across our system. 

General Partner and Sponsor of MPLX 

Our investment in MPLX should allow us to enhance our share price through our limited partner and general partner interests which tend to receive higher market multiples. MPLX also provides us an efficient vehicle to invest in organic projects and pursue acquisitions of midstream assets. MPLX&#8217;s liquidity and access to the capital markets should provide us a strong foundation to execute our strategy for growing our midstream business. Our role as the general partner allows us to maintain strategic control of the assets so we can continue to optimize our refinery feedstock and distribution networks. 

We have an extensive portfolio of midstream assets that can potentially be sold and/or contributed to MPLX at valuations that are supportive to the partnership&#8217;s growth, providing MPLX with a competitive advantage. As of December 31, 2015 , these assets included: 

&#8226; 

approximately 5,400 &#32;miles of crude oil and products pipelines that MPC owns, leases or which it has an ownership interest; 

&#8226; 

ownership interest in SAX pipeline; 

&#8226; 

19 &#32;owned or leased inland towboats and 219 &#32;owned or leased inland barges; 

&#8226; 

ownership interest in a blue water joint venture with Crowley Maritime Corporation; 

&#8226; 

61 &#32;owned and operated light product terminals with approximately 20 million &#32;barrels of storage capacity and 187 &#32;loading lanes; 

&#8226; 

18 &#32;owned and operated asphalt terminals with approximately 4 million &#32;barrels of storage capacity and 68 &#32;loading lanes; 

&#8226; 

one &#32;leased and two &#32;non-operated, partially-owned light product terminals; 

&#8226; 

2,210 &#32;owned or leased railcars; 

&#8226; 

59 million &#32;barrels of tank and cavern storage capacity at our refineries; 

&#8226; 

25 &#32;rail and 26 &#32;truck loading racks at our refineries; 

&#8226; 

seven &#32;owned and 11 &#32;non-owned docks at our refineries; 

&#8226; 

condensate splitters at our Canton and Catlettsburg refineries; and 

&#8226; 

approximately 20 billion gallons of fuels distribution. 

We continue to focus resources on growing this portfolio of midstream assets, including investments in the Sandpiper pipeline project, the recently completed SAX pipeline and our new marine joint venture, Crowley Ocean Partners. We broadly estimate these assets and growth projects can generate annual EBITDA of $1.6 billion. In addition to this growing portfolio by which we can also incubate projects for MPLX, we also have the ability to provide additional financial flexibility to the partnership through intercompany debt and equity financing, commercial arrangements, IDR give-backs and other alternatives. See Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information on these midstream assets. 

Competitively Positioned Marketing Operations 

We are one of the largest wholesale suppliers of gasoline and distillates to resellers within our market area. We have two strong retail brands: Speedway &#174; &#32;and Marathon &#174; . We believe Speedway LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary, operates the second largest chain of company-owned and operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the United States, with approximately 2,770 &#32;convenience stores in 22 &#32;states throughout the Midwest, East Coast and Southeast. The Marathon brand is an established motor fuel brand primarily in the Midwest and Southeast regions of the United States, comprised of approximately 5,600 &#32;retail outlets operated by independent entrepreneurs in 19 &#32;states as of December 31, 2015 . In addition, as part of the acquisition of the Galveston Bay Refinery and Related Assets in 2013 and Hess&#8217; Retail Operations and Related Assets in 2014, we obtained retail marketing contracts that provide us with the opportunity to convert the associated retail outlets to the Marathon brand. As of December 31, 2015 , we had outstanding retail marketing contract assignments for approximately 300 &#32;retail outlets. We believe our distribution system allows us to maximize the sales value of our products and minimize cost. 

Attractive Growth Opportunities 

We believe we have attractive growth opportunities across all of our business segments. 

We recently announced a $2 billion multi-year project we are undertaking in our Refining &#38; Marketing segment which will fully integrate our Galveston Bay and Texas City refineries, increase residual oil processing, revamp a crude unit to increase our overall crude processing capacity, increase our distillate and gas oil recovery, improve the unit&#8217;s reliability and install a new ULSD hydrotreater allowing the refinery to produce 100% ULSD and ULSK. We refer to this group of projects as the South Texas Asset Repositioning (&#8220;STAR&#8221;) program. Our Refining &#38; Marketing segment is also investing in the midstream through our ocean vessel equity affiliate, which is constructing additional Jones Act product tankers to move finished products from our refineries to the coastal market. 

Our Speedway segment is focused on store remodels to enhance profitability, particularly for its acquired stores along the East Coast, building new locations in Speedway&#8217;s core market and fully integrating Hess&#8217; Retail Operations and Related Assets. 

MPLX, which is included in the Midstream &#32;segment, is focused on organic growth opportunities for natural gas gathering and processing and NGL gathering and fractionation in the Marcellus and Utica shale formations among other regions. MPLX also remains focused on the Cornerstone pipeline project and related Utica build out projects. The Cornerstone project is the building block for the other projects that will become a critical solution for the industry to move condensate and NGLs out of the Utica region into refining centers in northwest Ohio and into Canada. Our Midstream &#32;segment&#8217;s investments also include an investment in an equity interest in the Sandpiper pipeline project that will transport crude oil from growing North American hydrocarbon production regions to our refineries. 

In connection with the MarkWest Merger, we have also identified a portfolio of potential projects totaling $6 billion to $9 billion of incremental investment opportunities for our Midstream &#32;segment over the next several years. These investment opportunities are in the early stages of feasibility analysis and include projects in the Utica and Marcellus shale regions that could leverage our respective capabilities and pursue natural commercial synergies and transportation solutions to open new markets for producers&#8217; products in these shale regions. 

Established Track Record of Profitability and Diversified Income Stream 

We have demonstrated an ability to achieve positive financial results throughout all stages of the refining cycle. We believe our business mix and strategies position us well to continue to achieve competitive financial results. Income generated by our Speedway segment, which was significantly expanded with the acquisition of Hess&#8217; Retail Operations and Related Assets, is less sensitive to business cycles and income from our Midstream &#32;segment, which was significantly expanded through the MarkWest Merger, is more stable due to its long-term fee based contracts, while our Refining &#38; Marketing segment enables us to generate significant income and cash flow when market conditions are more favorable. 

Strong Financial Position 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had $1.13 billion &#32;in cash and cash equivalents and $3.17 billion &#32;in unused committed borrowing facilities, excluding MPLX&#8217;s credit facilities. We had $11.93 billion &#32;of debt at year-end, which represented 38 &#32;percent of our total capitalization. This combination of strong liquidity and manageable leverage provides financial flexibility to fund our growth projects and to pursue our business strategies. 

Our Business Strategies 

Maintain Top-Tier Safety and Environmental Performance 

We remain committed to operating our assets in a safe and reliable manner and targeting continuous improvement in our safety record across all of our operations. We have a history of safe and reliable operations, which was demonstrated again in 2015 with a solid performance compared to the industry average. Four of our refineries and five additional facilities have earned designation as an OSHA VPP Star site. In addition, we remain committed to environmental stewardship by continuing to improve the efficiency and reliability of our operations. We proactively address our regulatory requirements and encourage our operations to improve their environmental performance through our DEI program. The results of the 2015 DEI program show a 16 percent reduction over 2014 in regards to significant environmental incidents across MPC, which includes our major operating components. 

Grow Higher Valued, Stable Cash Flow Businesses 

We intend to continue allocating significant capital to grow our midstream and retail businesses, exclusive of acquisitions. These businesses typically have more predictable and stable income and cash flows compared to our refining operations and we believe investors assign a higher value to businesses with stable cash flows. 

MPLX is an important part of the MPC strategy to grow its higher valued, stable cash flow midstream businesses and the MarkWest Merger significantly expanded its midstream activities to include natural gas gathering, processing and transportation and NGL gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and marketing. MPLX will evaluate organic growth projects within its geographic footprint, including the Marcellus and Utica shale regions, Oklahoma and Texas, as well as in new areas, that provide attractive returns and cash flows. MPLX may pursue these opportunities as standalone projects, with MPC or other parties. 

We significantly expanded Speedway&#8217;s presence along the East Coast and Southeast through our acquisition of Hess&#8217; Retail Operations and Related Assets towards the end of 2014. We intend to continue growing Speedway&#8217;s sales and profitability by focusing on the conversion and integration of these acquired locations, from which we expect to realize increased merchandise sales and other synergies. We also remain focused on organic growth through remodeling stores, constructing new stores, rebuilding old stores, acquiring high quality stores through opportunistic acquisitions and improving margins at our existing operations. We have identified numerous opportunities for new convenience stores or store rebuilds in our existing market, Pennsylvania and Tennessee, as well as growth opportunities in Georgia, South Carolina and the Florida panhandle. We also plan to capitalize on diesel demand growth by building out our commercial fueling lane network. In addition, our highly successful Speedy Rewards &#174; &#32;customer loyalty program, which averaged more than 4.7 million &#32;active members in 2015 , provides us with a unique competitive advantage and opportunity to increase our Speedway customer base with existing and new Speedway locations, including the stores acquired from Hess. 

Maintain Long-Term Integrated Relationships with Our Producer Customers 

MPLX&#8217;s MarkWest subsidiary has developed long-term integrated relationships with its producer customers. These relationships are characterized by an intense focus on customer service and a deep understanding of producer customers&#8217; requirements coupled with the ability to increase the level of our midstream services in response to their midstream requirements. Through collaborative planning, MPLX continues to construct high-quality midstream infrastructure and provide unique solutions that are critical to the ongoing success of producer customers&#8217; development plans. As a result of delivering high-quality midstream services, MarkWest has been the top-rated midstream service provider since 2006, as determined by an independent research provider. 

Deliver Top Quartile Refining Performance 

Our refineries are well positioned to benefit from the growing crude oil and condensate production in North America, including the Bakken, Eagle Ford and Utica shale regions, along with the Canadian oil sands. We are also well positioned to export distillates, gasoline and other products. 

We intend to enhance our margins in the Refining &#38; Marketing segment by realizing benefits of continuous process improvements, investing in and optimizing operations at our Galveston Bay and Texas City refineries, increasing distillate yield and conversion capacity and growing refined product export capacity. For example, we completed condensate splitter projects at our Canton and Catlettsburg refineries to increase our condensate capacity, we increased distillate production at our Galveston Bay and Robinson refineries and expanded our export capacity at our Galveston Bay and Garyville refineries. We intend to create a world-class refining complex by investing $2 billion in our Galveston Bay refinery over the next five years. The group of projects included in this investment will enable us to produce 100 percent ULSD and ULSK, increase our overall crude processing capacity, increase our distillate and gas oil recovery and improve the refinery&#8217;s reliability. Furthermore, this investment program will fully integrate our Galveston Bay and Texas City refineries. In 2016, we intend to increase our capacity to produce high value products such as alkylate and light products by making investments in the FCC units at our Garyville and Detroit refineries. We also intend to further increase distillate production at our Garyville refinery and to further expand the export capacity at our Galveston Bay refinery. 

Sustain Focus on Shareholder Returns 

We intend to continue our focus on the return of capital to shareholders in the form of a strong and growing base dividend, supplemented by share repurchases. Since becoming a stand-alone company in June 2011, our dividend has increased by a 29.5 percent compound annual growth rate and our board of directors has authorized share repurchases totaling $10 billion . Through open market purchases and two ASR programs, we repurchased 198 million &#32;shares of our common stock for approximately $7.24 billion , representing approximately 28 &#32;percent of our outstanding common shares when we became a stand-alone company in June 2011. After the effects of these repurchases, $2.76 billion &#32;of the $10 billion &#32;total authorization was available for future repurchases as of December 31, 2015 . 

Increase Assured Sales Volumes at our Marathon Brand and Speedway Locations 

We consider assured sales as those sales we make to Marathon brand customers, our Speedway operations and to our wholesale customers with whom we have required minimum volume sales contracts. We believe having assured sales brings ratability to our distribution systems, provides a solid base to enhance our overall supply reliability and allows us to efficiently and effectively optimize our operations between our refineries, pipelines and terminals. The Marathon brand has been a vehicle for sales volume growth in existing and contiguous markets. Our Speedway operations have also enabled us to further leverage our integrated refining and transportation operations with its expansion from nine to 22 &#32;states throughout the East Coast and Southeast in 2014. 

Utilize and Enhance our High Quality Employee Workforce 

We utilize our high quality employee workforce, which was augmented with the addition of MarkWest&#8217;s employees to MPC, by continuing to leverage our commercial skills. In addition, we continue to enhance our workforce through selective hiring practices and effective training programs on safety, environmental stewardship and other professional and technical skills.

Refining throughput can exceed crude oil capacity due to the processing of other charge and blendstocks in addition to crude oil and the timing of planned turnaround and major maintenance activity. 

Our refineries include crude oil atmospheric and vacuum distillation, fluid catalytic cracking, hydrocracking, catalytic reforming, coking, desulfurization and sulfur recovery units. The refineries process a wide variety of condensate, light and heavy crude oils purchased from various domestic and foreign suppliers. We produce numerous refined products, ranging from transportation fuels, such as reformulated gasolines, blend-grade gasolines intended for blending with ethanol and ULSD fuel, to heavy fuel oil and asphalt. Additionally, we manufacture aromatics, propane, propylene and sulfur. See the Refined Product Marketing section for further information about the products we produce. 

Our refineries are integrated with each other via pipelines, terminals and barges to maximize operating efficiency. The transportation links that connect our refineries allow the movement of intermediate products between refineries to optimize operations, produce higher margin products and efficiently utilize our processing capacity. For example, naphtha may be moved from Texas City to Robinson where excess reforming capacity is available. Also, shipping intermediate products between facilities during partial refinery shutdowns allows us to utilize processing capacity that is not directly affected by the shutdown work. 

Garyville, Louisiana Refinery . Our Garyville, Louisiana refinery is located along the Mississippi River in southeastern Louisiana between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. The Garyville refinery is configured to process a wide variety of crude oils into gasoline, distillates, fuel-grade coke, asphalt, polymer-grade propylene, propane, slurry, sulfur and dry gas. The refinery has access to the export market and multiple options to sell refined products. A major expansion project was completed in 2009 that increased Garyville&#8217;s crude oil refining capacity, making it one of the largest refineries in the U.S. Our Garyville refinery has earned designation as an OSHA VPP Star site. 

Galveston Bay, Texas City, Texas Refinery . Our Galveston Bay refinery, which we acquired on February 1, 2013, is located on the Texas Gulf Coast approximately 30 miles southeast of Houston, Texas.

Gasoline and Distillates . We sell gasoline, gasoline blendstocks and distillates (including No. 1 and No. 2 fuel oils, jet fuel, kerosene and diesel fuel) to wholesale customers, Marathon-branded independent entrepreneurs and our Speedway &#174; &#32;convenience stores and on the spot market. In addition, we sell diesel fuel and gasoline for export to international customers. We sold 50 &#32;percent of our gasoline sales volumes and 87 &#32;percent of our distillates sales volumes on a wholesale or spot market basis in 2015 . The demand for gasoline and distillates is seasonal in many of our markets, with demand typically at its highest levels during the summer months. 

We have blended ethanol into gasoline for more than 20 years and began expanding our blending program in 2007, in part due to federal regulations that require us to use specified volumes of renewable fuels. Ethanol volumes sold in blended gasoline were 85 &#32;mbpd in 2015 , 78 &#32;mbpd in 2014 &#32;and 74 &#32;mbpd in 2013 . We sell reformulated gasoline, which is also blended with ethanol, in 12 &#32;states in our marketing area. We also sell biodiesel-blended diesel fuel in 16 &#32;states in our marketing area. The future expansion or contraction of our ethanol and biodiesel blending programs will be driven by market economics and government regulations. 

Propane . We produce propane at most of our refineries. Propane is primarily used for home heating and cooking, as a feedstock within the petrochemical industry, for grain drying and as a fuel for trucks and other vehicles. Our propane sales are typically split evenly between the home heating market and industrial consumers. 

Feedstocks and Special Products . We are a producer and marketer of feedstocks and specialty products. Product availability varies by refinery and includes platformate, alkylate, FCC unit gas, naptha, dry gas, propylene, raffinate, butane, benzene, xylene, molten sulfur, cumene and toluene. We market these products domestically to customers in the chemical, agricultural and fuel-blending industries. In addition, we produce fuel-grade coke at our Garyville, Detroit and Galveston Bay refineries, which is used for power generation and in miscellaneous industrial applications, and anode-grade coke at our Robinson refinery, which is used to make carbon anodes for the aluminum smelting industry. Our feedstocks and special products sales decreased to 258 mbpd in 2015 from 268 mbpd in 2014 and increased in 2014 from 214 mbpd in 2013. The decrease in 2015 was primarily due to higher turnaround activity in 2014 resulting in more available feedstocks, more feedstocks used in production versus selling them on the spot market and market conditions in 2015. The increase in 2014 was primarily due to our Galveston Bay refinery. 

Heavy Fuel Oil . We produce and market heavy residual fuel oil or related components, including slurry, at all of our refineries. Heavy residual fuel oil is primarily used in the utility and ship bunkering (fuel) industries, though there are other more specialized uses of the product. 

Asphalt . We have refinery-based asphalt production capacity of up to 101 &#32;mbpcd, which includes asphalt cements, polymer-modified asphalt, emulsified asphalt, industrial asphalts and roofing flux. We have a broad customer base, including asphalt-paving contractors, government entities (states, counties, cities and townships) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers. We sell asphalt in the domestic and export wholesale markets via rail, barge and vessel. 

Terminals 

As of December 31, 2015 , we owned and operated 61 &#32;light product and 18 &#32;asphalt terminals. Our light product and asphalt terminals averaged 1,410 &#32;mbpd and 32 &#32;mbpd of throughput in 2015 , respectively. In addition, we distribute refined products through one &#32;leased light product terminal, two &#32;light product terminals in which we have partial ownership interests but do not operate and approximately 120 &#32;third-party light product and two &#32;third-party asphalt terminals in our market area.

We are substantially complete with the conversion of the remaining convenience stores acquired from Hess to the Speedway brand and plan to complete this process by the end of the second quarter of 2016. Speedway convenience stores offer a wide variety of merchandise, including prepared foods, beverages and non-food items. Speedway&#8217;s Speedy Rewards&#174; loyalty program has been a highly successful loyalty program since its inception in 2004, with a consistently growing base which averaged more than 4.7 million &#32;active members in 2015 . Due to Speedway&#8217;s ability to capture and analyze member-specific transactional data, Speedway is able to offer the Speedy Rewards&#174; members discounts and promotions specific to their buying behavior. We believe Speedy Rewards&#174; is a key reason customers choose Speedway over competitors and it continues to drive significant value for both Speedway and our Speedy Rewards&#174; members. 

The demand for gasoline is seasonal, with the highest demand usually occurring during the summer driving season. Margins from the sale of merchandise tend to be less volatile than margins from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel. Merchandise margin as a percent of total gross margin for Speedway decreased in 2015, primarily due to higher light product margins during the year and the effects of the convenience stores acquired from Hess. The following table sets forth Speedway merchandise statistics for the past three years.

As of December 31, 2015 , Speedway owned 105 &#32;transport trucks and 83 &#32;trailers for the movement of gasoline and distillate. 

Midstream &#32; 

Following the MarkWest Merger, we changed the name of our Pipeline Transportation segment to the Midstream &#32;segment to reflect its expanded business activities. The Midstream &#32;segment includes the operations of MPLX, which transports crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and other locations, delivers refined products to wholesale and retail market areas, gathers, processes and transports natural gas, and transports, fractionates, stores and markets NGLs. As of December 31, 2015 , we owned, leased or had ownership interests in approximately 8,400 &#32;miles of crude oil and products pipelines, of which approximately 2,900 &#32;miles are owned through our investments in MPLX. Also through our investments in MPLX, we own 5,000 miles of gas gathering and NGL pipelines and have ownership interests in over 50 gas processing plants, over 10 NGL fractionation facilities and one condensate stabilization facility. 

MPLX 

MPLX is a publicly traded master limited partnership formed by us to own, operate, develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets related to the transportation and storage of crude oil, refined products and other hydrocarbon-based products. On December 4, 2015, MPLX merged with MarkWest, whereby MarkWest became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPLX. Prior to the MarkWest Merger, we owned a 71.5 percent &#32;interest in MPLX, which included our two percent &#32;general partner interest. As of December 31, 2015 , our ownership interest in MPLX was 20.4 percent , including our two percent &#32;general partner interest. 

As of December 31, 2015 , MPLX assets, through its combination with MarkWest, included approximately 5,400 &#32;MMcf/d of gathering capacity, 7,100 &#32;MMcf/d of natural gas processing capacity and 500 &#32;mbpd of NGL fractionation capacity and more than 5,000 miles of gas gathering and NGL pipelines. 

MPLX assets as of December 31, 2015 &#32;also included 100 percent ownership of common carrier pipeline systems through Marathon Pipe Line LLC (&#8220;MPL&#8221;) and Ohio River Pipe Line LLC (&#8220;ORPL&#8221;), and a one million &#32;barrel butane storage cavern in West Virginia. MPLX, through MPL and ORPL, owned or leased and operated 1,008 &#32;miles of common carrier crude oil lines and 1,900 &#32;miles of common carrier products lines located in nine &#32;states and four &#32;tank farms in Illinois and Indiana with available storage capacity of 4.53 million &#32;barrels that is committed to MPC. In 2015 , third parties generated 17 &#32;percent of the crude oil and refined product shipments on MPLX&#8217;s common carrier pipelines, excluding volumes shipped by MPC under joint tariffs with third parties. These common carrier pipelines transported the volumes shown in the MPLX Pipeline Throughput information in the table below for each of the last three years. 

MPC-Retained Assets and Investments 

We retained ownership interests in several crude oil and products pipeline systems and pipeline companies. MPC consolidated volumes transported through our common carrier pipelines, which include MPLX and our undivided joint interests, are shown in the MPC Consolidated Pipeline Throughput information in the following table for each of the last three years.

Competition, Market Conditions and Seasonality 

The downstream petroleum business is highly competitive, particularly with regard to accessing crude oil and other feedstock supply and the marketing of refined products. We compete with a large number of other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products. Based upon the &#8220;The Oil &#38; Gas Journal 2015 &#32;Worldwide Refinery Survey,&#8221; we ranked fourth among U.S. petroleum companies on the basis of U.S. crude oil refining capacity as of December 31, 2015 . We compete in four distinct markets for the sale of refined products&#8212;wholesale, spot, branded and retail distribution. We believe we compete with about 55 &#32;companies in the sale of refined products to wholesale marketing customers, including private-brand marketers and large commercial and industrial consumers; about 100 &#32;companies in the sale of refined products in the spot market; 12 &#32;refiners or marketers in the supply of refined products to refiner-branded independent entrepreneurs; and approximately 890 &#32;retailers in the retail sale of refined products. In addition, we compete with producers and marketers in other industries that supply alternative forms of energy and fuels to satisfy the requirements of our industrial, commercial and retail consumers. We do not produce any of the crude oil we refine. 

We also face strong competition for sales of retail gasoline, diesel fuel and merchandise. Our competitors include service stations and convenience stores operated by fully integrated major oil companies and their independent entrepreneurs and other well-recognized national or regional convenience stores and travel centers, often selling gasoline, diesel fuel and merchandise at competitive prices. Non-traditional retailers, such as supermarkets, club stores and mass merchants, have affected the convenience store industry with their entrance into sales of retail gasoline and diesel fuel. Energy Analysts International, Inc. estimated such retailers had approximately 13 &#32;percent of the U.S. gasoline market in mid- 2015 . 

Our Midstream &#32;operations face competition for natural gas gathering, crude oil transportation and in obtaining natural gas supplies for our processing and related services; in obtaining unprocessed NGLs for gathering and fractionation; and in marketing our products and services. Competition for natural gas supplies is based primarily on the location of gas gathering facilities and gas processing plants, operating efficiency and reliability and the ability to obtain a satisfactory price for products recovered. Competitive factors affecting our fractionation services include availability of capacity, proximity to supply and industry marketing centers and cost efficiency and reliability of service. Competition for customers to purchase our natural gas and NGLs is based primarily on price, delivery capabilities, flexibility and maintenance of high-quality customer relationships. In addition, certain of our Midstream &#32;operations are highly regulated, which affects the rates that our common carrier pipelines can charge for transportation services and the return we obtain from such pipelines. 

Market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations. Our operating results are affected by price changes in crude oil, natural gas and refined products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. Price differentials between sweet and sour crude oils, WTI and LLS crude oils and other market structure differentials also affect our operating results. 

Demand for gasoline, diesel fuel and asphalt is higher during the spring and summer months than during the winter months in most of our markets, primarily due to seasonal increases in highway traffic and construction. As a result, the operating results for each of our segments for the first and fourth quarters may be lower than for those in the second and third quarters of each calendar year. 

Our Midstream &#32;segment can be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the demand for natural gas and NGLs and the related fluctuations in commodity prices caused by various factors such as changes in transportation and travel patterns and variations in weather patterns from year to year. In the northeast region, we could be particularly impacted by seasonality as the majority of its revenues are generated by NGL sales. However, we manage the seasonality impact through the execution of our marketing strategy. We have access to up to 50 million gallons of propane storage capacity in the northeast region provided by an arrangement with a third-party which provides us with flexibility to manage the seasonality impact. Overall, our exposure to the seasonal fluctuations in the commodity markets is declining due to our growth in fee-based business. 

Environmental Matters 

Our management is responsible for ensuring that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and for reviewing our overall environmental performance. We also have a Corporate Emergency Response Team that oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our facilities. 

We believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the extent and causes of climate change will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. Currently, legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gases are in various phases of review, discussion or implementation. The cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time, but could be significant. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. We estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations and products. Additionally, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable. 

Our operations are subject to numerous other laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Such laws and regulations include, among others, the Clean Air Act (&#8220;CAA&#8221;) with respect to air emissions, the Clean Water Act (&#8220;CWA&#8221;) with respect to water discharges, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;) with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;) with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (&#8220;OPA-90&#8221;) with respect to oil pollution and response. In addition, many states where we operate have similar laws. New laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted on a continuing basis, and the costs of compliance with such new laws and regulations are very difficult to estimate until finalized. 

For a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters and Compliance Costs. 

Air 

We are subject to many requirements in connection with air emissions from our operations. Internationally and domestically, emphasis has been placed on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. pledge in 2009, as part of the Copenhagen Accord, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 remains in effect and was reaffirmed in the President&#8217;s 2013 Climate Action Plan. The 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change does not legally require parties to the Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but the United States&#8217; future activities in response to the Paris Agreement are unknown. In 2009, the EPA issued an &#8220;endangerment finding&#8221; that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to air pollution that endangers public health and welfare. Related to the endangerment finding, in April 2010, the EPA finalized a greenhouse gas emission standard for mobile sources (cars and other light duty vehicles). The endangerment finding, the mobile source standard and the EPA&#8217;s determination that greenhouse gases are subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act resulted in permitting of greenhouse gas emissions at stationary sources, but as a result of the EPA&#8217;s &#8220;tailoring rule,&#8221; permit applicability was limited to larger sources such as refineries. Legal challenges were filed against these EPA actions. In June 2014, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the Clean Air Act Prevention of Significant Deterioration program for new and modified stationary sources is not triggered by greenhouse gas emissions alone. The United States Supreme Court did, however, uphold the requirement for new or modified stationary sources that will also emit a criteria pollutant to control greenhouse gas emissions through Best Available Control Technology. Implementing Best Available Control Technology may result in increased costs to our operations. A few MPC projects triggered greenhouse gas permitting requirements but any additional capital spending will likely not be significant. 

The EPA has finalized Source Performance Standards for greenhouse gas emissions for new and existing electric utility generating units. These standards could impact electric and natural gas rates for all our operations. Legal challenges have been filed by several states and by industry groups seeking to overturn the final rules. Congress may again also consider legislation on greenhouse gas emissions or a carbon tax. Private parties have sued utilities and other emitters of greenhouse gas emissions, but such suits have been largely unsuccessful. We have not been named in any of those lawsuits. Private parties have also sued federal and certain state governmental entities seeking additional greenhouse gas emission reductions beyond those currently being undertaken. In sum, requiring reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls at our facilities and (iii) administer and manage any greenhouse gas emissions programs, including acquiring emission credits or allotments. These requirements may also significantly affect MPC&#8217;s refinery operations and may have an indirect effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The extent and magnitude of the impact from greenhouse gas regulation or legislation cannot be reasonably estimated due to the uncertainty regarding the additional measures and how they will be implemented. 

In 2013, the Obama administration made changes to the social cost of carbon (&#8220;SCC&#8221;) estimate. The SCC was first issued in 2010. The SCC is to be used by the EPA and other federal agencies in regulatory cost-benefit analyses to take into account alleged broad economic consequences associated with changes to emissions of greenhouse gases. In 2013, the Obama administration significantly increased the estimate to $36 per ton. In response to the regulated community and Congress&#8217; critiques of how the SCC was developed, the Office of Management and Budget provided an opportunity to comment on the SCC, but ultimately did not make any significant revisions. In December 2014, the White House Council on Environmental Quality issued new draft guidance for assessing greenhouse gas emissions under the National Environmental Policy Act, adding for the first time language that requires the analyses to also include the impact of climate change on projects, including using the SCC when analyzing costs and benefits of a project. While the impact of a higher SCC in future regulations is not known at this time, it may result in increased costs to our operations. 

In 2015, the EPA finalized a revision to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (&#8220;NAAQS&#8221;) for ozone. The EPA lowered the primary ozone NAAQS from 75 ppb to 70 ppb. This revision initiates a multi-year process in which nonattainment designations will be made based on more recent ozone measurements that includes data from 2016. States will then propose 

and adopt, as necessary, new rules reducing emissions to meet the new standard. Currently, the EPA is in the process of implementing the 75 ppb ozone standard that the EPA had promulgated in March 2008. The impact of a stricter standard cannot be accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding area nonattainment designations and the additional requirements that states may impose. Additionally, legal petitions challenging the revised ozone standard have been filed with the court adding uncertainty to the revised standard. 

On September 29, 2015, the EPA signed the final regulations revising existing refinery air emissions standards. The revised regulations were published in the Federal Register on December 1, 2015. The revised rule requires additional controls, lower emission standards and ambient air monitoring. We do not anticipate that MPC&#8217;s costs to comply with the revised regulations will be material to our results of operations or cash flows. 

Water 

We maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of the CWA and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance with these permits. In addition, we are regulated under OPA-90, which among other things, requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. Also, in case of any such release, OPA-90 requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages. OPA-90 also provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions. We have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by OPA-90 and we have established Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures plans for all facilities subject to such requirements. 

Additionally, OPA-90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in U.S. waters be double-hulled and that existing tank vessels that are not double-hulled be retrofitted or removed from U.S. service. All barges used for river transport of our raw materials and refined products meet the double-hulled requirements of OPA-90. We operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur. Some coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to OPA-90, but with expanded liability provisions, that include provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility. 

In June 2015, the EPA and the United States Army Corps of Engineers finalized significant changes to the definition of the term &#8220;waters of the United States&#8221; (&#8220;WOTUS&#8221;) used in numerous programs under the CWA. This final rulemaking is referred to as the Clean Water Rule. The Clean Water Rule has been challenged in multiple federal courts by many states, trade groups, and other interested parties, and in October 2015, a United States Court of Appeals issued a nationwide stay of the Clean Water Rule. The Clean Water Rule, as written, expands permitting, planning and reporting obligations and may extend the timing to secure permits for pipeline and fixed asset construction and maintenance activities. The Clean Water Rule does contain new language intended to address concerns that the proposed rule included storm water conveyances and storage structures as WOTUS, and we continue to review how that new language will apply under specific circumstances. Court challenges of the Clean Water Rule will continue through 2016. 

In 2015, the EPA issued its intent to review the CWA categorical effluent limitation guidelines (&#8220;ELG&#8221;) for the petroleum refining sector. During 2016, the EPA will prepare and request significant wastewater and treatment process details for our refining operations. The EPA has indicated they believe there have been significant changes in the characteristics of wastewaters generated within refining operations that warrant the review. Specific targets for the review are the impacts of processing heavier crude oils and the transfer of air pollutants to wastewater when air pollution abatement devices are in use. A similar project, initiated in 2007 for steam power generation with similar attributes, resulted in a significant change in the treatment requirements for coal fired power plants. The refining sector ELG review has the potential to result in a similar impact. We are actively engaged in the planning process for the 2016 information request and engaged with API and AFPM on this matter. The typical life-cycle for an ELG review from the intent to review to issuance of a final rule that would require upgrades is seven years. 

Solid Waste 

We continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations. RCRA establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. Besides affecting waste disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the regulation of USTs containing regulated substances. We have ongoing RCRA treatment and disposal operations at two of our facilities and primarily utilize offsite third-party treatment and disposal facilities. Ongoing RCRA-related costs, however, are not expected to be material to our results of operations or cash flows. 

Remediation 

We own or operate, or have owned or operated, certain convenience stores and other locations where, during the normal course of operations, releases of refined products from USTs have occurred. Federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. The enforcement of the UST regulations under RCRA has been delegated to the states, which administer their own UST programs. Our obligation to remediate such contamination varies, depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the applicable state laws and regulations. A portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state UST reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied. We also have ongoing remediation projects at a number of our current and former refinery, terminal and pipeline locations. Penalties or other sanctions may be imposed for noncompliance. 

Claims under CERCLA and similar state acts have been raised with respect to the clean-up of various waste disposal and other sites. CERCLA is intended to facilitate the clean-up of hazardous substances without regard to fault. Potentially responsible parties for each site include present and former owners and operators of, transporters to and generators of the hazardous substances at the site. Liability is strict and can be joint and several. Because of various factors including the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site, the complexity of determining the relative liability among them, the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and clean-up costs and the time period during which such costs may be incurred, we are unable to reasonably estimate our ultimate cost of compliance with CERCLA; however, we do not believe such costs will be material to our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

Mileage Standards, Renewable Fuels and Other Fuels Requirements 

In 2007, the U.S. Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act (&#8220;EISA&#8221;), which, among other things, set a target of 35 miles per gallon for the combined fleet of cars and light trucks in the United States by model year 2020, and contains the RFS2. In August 2012, the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration jointly adopted regulations that establish average industry fleet fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks of up to 41 miles per gallon by model year 2021 and average fleet fuel economy standards of up to 49.7 miles per gallon by model year 2025 (the standards from 2022 to 2025 are the government&#8217;s current estimate but will require further rulemaking). New or alternative transportation fuels such as compressed natural gas could also pose a competitive threat to our operations. 

The RFS2 required the total volume of renewable transportation fuels sold or introduced annually in the U.S. to reach 18.15 billion gallons in 2014, 20.5 billion gallons in 2015, 22.25 billion gallons in 2016 and increase to 36.0 billion gallons by 2022. Within the total volume of renewable fuel, EISA established an advanced biofuel volume of 3.75 billion gallons in 2014, 5.5 billion gallons in 2015, 7.25 billion gallons in 2016, and increasing to 21.0 billion gallons in 2022. Subsets within the advanced biofuel volume include biomass-based diesel, which was set as at least 1.0 billion gallons in 2014 through 2022 (to be determined by the EPA through rulemaking), and cellulosic biofuel, which was set at 1.75 billion gallons in 2014, 3.0 billion gallons in 2015, 4.25 billion gallons in 2016, and increasing to 16.0 billion gallons in 2022. 

On November 30, 2015, the EPA finalized the renewable fuel standards for the years of 2014, 2015 and 2016 as well as the biomass based diesel standard for 2017. Because the EPA missed the statutory deadlines for establishing the standards for 2014 and 2015, the EPA set the standards using actual consumption data obtained from EPA&#8217;s tracking system, EMTS. The volumes in billions of gallons that were finalized are as follows:

&#160; 

18.110 

These volumes, with the exception of biomass based diesel, represent a reduction from the statutory volumes. In the near term, the RFS2 will be satisfied primarily with ethanol blended into gasoline. Vehicle, regulatory and infrastructure constraints limit the blending of significantly more than 10 percent ethanol into gasoline (&#8220;E10&#8221;). The volumes for 2016 result in the ethanol content of gasoline exceeding the E10 blendwall, which will require obligated parties to either sell E15 or FlexFuel at levels that exceed historical levels. Neither E15 nor FlexFuel has been readily accepted by the consumer. There are numerous issues, including state and federal regulatory issues, which need to be addressed before E15 can be marketed for use in traditional gasoline engines. 

With potentially uncertain supplies, the advanced biofuels programs may present specific challenges in that we may have to enter into arrangements with other parties or purchase credits from the EPA to meet our obligations to use advanced biofuels, including biomass-based diesel and cellulosic biofuel. 

We made investments in infrastructure capable of expanding biodiesel blending capability to help comply with the biodiesel RFS2 requirement by buying and blending biodiesel into our refined diesel product, and by buying needed biodiesel RINs in the EPA-created biodiesel RINs market. On April 1, 2014, we purchased a facility in Cincinnati, Ohio, which currently produces biodiesel, glycerin and other by-products. The capacity of the plant is approximately 60 million &#32;gallons per year. As a producer of biodiesel, we now generate RINs, thereby reducing our reliance on the external RIN market. 

On October 13, 2010, the EPA issued a partial waiver decision under the CAA to allow for an increase in the amount of ethanol permitted to be blended into gasoline from E10 to E15 for 2007 and newer light-duty motor vehicles. On January 21, 2011, the EPA issued a second waiver for the use of E15 in vehicles model year 2001-2006. There are numerous issues, including state and federal regulatory issues, which need to be addressed before E15 can be marketed for use in traditional gasoline engines. 

There will be costs and uncertainties regarding how we will comply with the various requirements contained in EISA and related regulations. The RFS2 has required, and may in the future continue to require, additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased renewable fuels use. We may experience a decrease in demand for refined petroleum products due to an increase in combined fleet mileage or due to refined petroleum products being replaced by renewable fuels. 

On March 3, 2014, the EPA signed the final Tier 3 fuel standards. The final Tier 3 fuel standards require, among other things, a lower annual average sulfur level in gasoline to no more than 10 ppm beginning in calendar year 2017. In addition, gasoline refiners and importers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 80 ppm while retailers may not exceed a maximum per-gallon sulfur standard of 95 ppm. We anticipate that we will spend an estimated $750 million to $1 billion between 2014 and 2019 for capital expenditures necessary to comply with these standards, a majority of which is expected to be spent in the years of 2017 through 2019.

We currently hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications. Although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single patent or license or group of related patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole. In general, we depend on our technological capabilities and the application of know-how rather than patents and licenses in the conduct of our operations.

We had approximately 45,440 &#32;regular employees as of December 31, 2015 , which includes approximately 33,820 &#32;employees of Speedway.
