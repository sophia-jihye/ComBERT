Organization and Corporate History 

&#160;

BioHiTech Global, Inc. (&#8220;BioHiTech&#8221;, the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, or &#8220;us&#8221;) was incorporated on March 20, 2013 under the laws of the state of Delaware as Swift Start Corp. The Company&#8217;s initial business plan was to develop a website that offered comprehensive online computer programming courses for anyone with any level of computer programming knowledge, from beginners to experts. Our video courses would be developed and taught by seasoned teachers with extensive experience in the computer programming fields.

&#160; 

On August 6, 2015, the Company entered into and consummated an Agreement of Merger and Plan of Reorganization (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;), with BioHiTech Global, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (&#8220;Acquisition&#8221;) and Bio Hi Tech America, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (&#8220;BioHiTech&#8221;). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Acquisition merged with and into BioHiTech in a reverse business combination (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;) with BioHiTech surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. As consideration for the Merger, we issued the interest holders of BioHiTech (the &#8220;BioHiTech Holders&#8221;) an aggregate of 6,975,000 shares of our Common Stock issued to the BioHiTech Holders in accordance with their pro rata ownership of BioHiTech membership interests. Following the Merger, the Company adopted the business plan of BioHiTech in the development, marketing and sales of food waste disposal systems which transform food waste into nutrient-neutral water which may be disposed of via sewer systems while utilizing proprietary software to collect and transmit environmental performance data to its customers.

&#160;

Also, on August 6, 2015, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation (the &#8220;Amendment&#8221;) to (i) change its name to BioHiTech Global, Inc. and (ii) to amend the number of its authorized shares of capital stock from 200,000,000 to 30,000,000 shares of which 20,000,000 shares were designated common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the &#8220;Common Stock&#8221;) and 10,000,000 shares were designated &#8220;blank check&#8221; preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the &#8220;Preferred Stock&#8221;). As previously reported on February 10, 2015, the Amendment was approved by holders of a majority of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock (the &#8220;Majority Holder&#8221;) on February 6, 2015.

&#160;

1&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Immediately prior to the Merger, the Company had 9,040,000 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding. In connection with the Merger, the Majority Shareholder and other shareholders collectively agreed to retire and cancel an aggregate of 8,515,000 shares of Common Stock. Following the consummation of the Merger, the issuance of the Merger Shares, and the retirement of the 8,515,000 shares of Common Stock, the Company had 7,500,000 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding and the BioHiTech Holders beneficially own 6,975,000 shares or approximately ninety-three percent (93%) of such issued and outstanding Common Stock.

&#160; &#160;

ITEM I: BUSINESS 

&#160;

Company Overview 

&#160;

BioHiTech provides a simple, environmentally friendly, and cost effective solution for food waste disposal. BioHiTech has a global distribution license to sell, lease, use, distribute, and manufacture the product currently known as the Eco-Safe Digester. The Eco-Safe Digester is a data-driven, network-based mechanical/biological technology which transforms food waste into nutrient-neutral water that can safely be disposed of via conventional sanitary sewer systems. The Eco-Safe Digester reduces greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the volume of food waste being disposed of in landfills and eliminating the corresponding transportation of this waste. In addition, the technology saves users money by avoiding disposal costs (&#8220;tip fees&#8221;) and transportation charges. This process allows waste producing organizations to actively contribute to environmental sustainability and the preservation of resources in a cost-effective manner. The Eco-Safe Digester may be used by businesses in food service, hospitality, healthcare, government, conference centers, education centers, or stadiums that generate a high volume of waste. It is estimated that the US addressable market is in excess of 250,000 locations that could qualify for digesters and an additional 250,000 internationally.

&#160;

The Eco-Safe Digester is currently installed in 37 states throughout the United States as well as twelve foreign countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada and Israel.

&#160;

BioHiTech has over 300 units installed worldwide with over seven years of operating experience. With units in the field for over seven years, BioHiTech&#8217;s products have proven to have at least a reasonably long-term life expectancy comparable to the products sold by its competitors.

&#160;

BioHiTech hopes to leverage its existing technology, including the Eco-Safe Digester&#8217;s on-board weighing system, by collecting, accumulating and providing empirical data which we hope will improve the efficiency of the upstream supply chain. By streaming data from the digesters, collecting information from system users and integrating business application data, we expect BioHiTech&#8217;s internet enabled system known as the BioHiTech Cloud to provide necessary data that we expect will help customers reshape their purchasing decisions and positively effect employee behavior. In its simplest form, the BioHiTech Cloud quantifies food waste in a fashion that has historically not been available. It enables users to understand food waste generation habits and to pay for the Eco-Safe Digester based on savings on to traditional waste charges as well as improved operational efficiencies.

&#160;

The BioHiTech Cloud data is used to help educate customers as to where, when and how waste is being created. Tracking and analyzing waste based on creation time, food type, preparation stage, origin of waste or other key metrics may provide a clear picture of the food waste lifecycle. While the Eco-Safe Digester already provides significant economic savings and decreases in carbon footprint, the addition of the BioHiTech Cloud increases that impact by helping the customer to more accurately manage inventory, preparation practices and staff efficiencies.

&#160;

2&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES 

&#160;

BioHiTech believes that its combined offering of technology and its Eco-Safe digester provide customers with information (which/that) has not been readily available to consumers in the past that has the potential for improved management and reduction of waste at the point of generation on a real-time basis.

&#160;

BioHiTech believes its digester products remove organic waste from the overcrowded and costly landfills of the world and provide significant benefits to both business organizations and the community including:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Eliminating the transportation of organic waste &#160; &#183; Reducing carbon emissions associated with landfilling and truck transportation &#160; &#183; Complying with municipal laws banning organic waste from landfills &#160; &#183; Contributing to corporate and regulatory targets for diverting waste from landfills &#160; &#183; Extending the lifespan of the country&#8217;s disposal facilities &#160; &#183; Reducing groundwater and soil contamination at landfills &#160; &#183; Reducing harmful greenhouse gases that contribute to global climate change &#160; &#183; Recycling food waste into renewable resources (clean water, biogas, bio-solids) &#160; 

The BioHiTech Cloud and Cirrus Mobile Application 

&#160;

The BioHiTech solution is not based only on the removal of waste, but also provides real time information and metrics to improve the efficiency of an organization. Such information has not been readily available to consumers in the past. By providing a cloud-based dashboard and mobile application, the BioHiTech Cloud gives real-time visibility to the status of the device itself and provides insight to the efficiencies of the operations of food preparation and consumption of the user. Using leading edge cloud technologies, the systems allow for deep visibility into the process on an individual, regional, or national level. BioHiTech currently has a provisional patent pending on this technology.

&#160;

Recently, the Company released its first mobile application called BioHiTech Cirrus&#8482;. The new application should allow customers more immediate access to analytical data provided by the Eco-Safe Digester and more efficient monitoring across a number of network connected devices. The mobile application is available free to existing BioHiTech Cloud customers and is available through the iTunes Store, as well as Google Play.

&#160; 

The Eco-Safe Digester 

&#160;

&#160;

The Eco-Safe Digester is high technology appliance built upon several international patents that provides a safe, clean and odorless process for converting organic waste to a nutrient neutral discharge that is introduced to the typical sewage drain. The Digester utilizes technology similar to municipal sewage treatment plants in a scaled down, friendly point of generation format. It is an ecologically friendly solution for processing food waste directly at its source.

&#160;

3&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Eco-Safe Digester can digest up to 3,500 pounds of food waste every day including vegetables, fruits, meat, fish, poultry, grains, coffee grinds, egg shells and dairy products, with decomposition typically occurring within 24 hours. The Eco-Safe Digester rapidly digests large volumes of food waste into a nutrient neutral liquid effluent using the following steps:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; A proprietary blend of microorganisms and bio-media are loaded into the Eco-Safe Digester &#160; &#183; Heat, agitation and moisture help enable the microorganisms to reduce the food waste into liquefied grey water, also called effluent &#160; &#183; Food waste is continuously added into the machine &#160; &#183; The effluent drains into a conventional sanitary sewer system &#160;

&#160;

The Eco-Safe Digester is currently available in three sizes to fit varying customer requirements. The appliance is manufactured using the high quality components and materials. It is wrapped in durable stainless steel to complement industrial kitchen equipment, provide long life and resist corrosion.

Currently, BioHiTech leverages multiple sales models including all-inclusive rental models and traditional retail sales models. List prices for all of the three models are under $50,000. Under BioHiTech&#8217;s rental model, BioHiTech provides a digester, quarterly service, consumables and in most cases, an annual cloud license under a monthly bundles charge. These contracts normally range from three to five years in duration. Monthly charges range from $500 to $1,200 per month depending on the unit size, services provided and the quantity of units under contract. Annual cloud licenses are also available ala carte at a rate of $2,400 per unit per year.

&#160;

Under the retail sales model, each unit is normally accompanied by an annual service or supply contract providing a potential recurring revenue stream for each unit sold. Annual service contracts range from $2,300 to $5,450 per year depending on the size of the unit and level of support. Typical customer return on investment is approximately three years depending on tip fees within their geographical footprint and without giving effect to potential savings due to increased efficiencies.

&#160;

TARGET MARKETS AND MARKETING STRATEGY 

&#160; 

Several municipalities have recently enacted ordinances prohibiting commercial food waste from being disposed of in landfills. Many cities and states have banned landfill disposal of food waste generated by large, commercial food waste generators, with pending legislation in numerous others. The Company anticipates this trend to continue as sustainability efforts advance.

&#160;

In addition to the US domestic marketplace, the Company anticipates growth internationally with a primary focus on the United Kingdom, Singapore, Mexico and Latin America. As International communities continue to strive toward more sustainable options, the company has identified a need for its Eco-Safe Digester platform and BioHiTech Cloud and has recently opened an office in London and has identified various qualified resellers in the target markets.

&#160;

BioHiTech has applied for, but has not yet received, a patent for &#8220;Network Connected Weight Tracking System for a Food Waste Disposal Machine.&#8221;

&#160;

CUSTOMERS 

&#160; 

BioHiTech targets large producers of food waste as its primary customers. Industries served include but are not limited to healthcare, grocery, prisons, retail food services, education, and full service hospitality. Volume of food waste as well as traditional waste disposal costs are the primary drivers of return on investment for customers. BioHiTech is in the process of attempting to sell its products to governmental agencies including correctional facilities and hospitals as well as large private sector companies throughout the United States and abroad.

&#160;

There are believed to be approximately 250,000 potential users of the Eco-Safe Digester in the United States with an additional 250,000 potential international installations.

&#160;

MARKETING, SALES AND DISTRIBUTIONS 

&#160;

BioHiTech operates under two revenue models, &#8220;in-house&#8221; direct sales and &#8220;Reseller&#8221; sales. We currently leverage five company-employed sales associates that focus on maintaining and expanding &#8220;house accounts&#8221;. BioHiTech currently has thirteen registered domestic resellers, five registered international resellers, eleven independent sales agents and one international sub-distributor. Domestic and international resellers are granted a non-exclusive license to sell and market products and services. The international sub-distributor has been granted exclusive sub-distribution rights in Mexico and Latin America. All resellers are required to purchase all products and consumables directly from BioHiTech. In some cases, BioHiTech also provides annual service to customers of its resellers at an additional charge.

&#160;

BioHiTech employs one full time marketing professional and contracts with various firms for design and production of its marketing materials. BioHiTech supplies its resellers with any necessary marketing materials.

&#160;

Our internal team of technology professionals is responsible for research and development, as well as maintenance of existing systems &#8211; the BioHiTech Cloud, the Company&#8217;s website and the BioHiTech Cirrus App. The Company also employs one full time Director of Science and Research.

&#160;

BioHiTech is the owner of the trademarks for &#8220;Eco-Safe Digester&#8221; and &#8220;BioBrain&#8221; which its products are marketed under.

&#160;

BioHiTech is under contract with a nationally recognized Public Relations firm for representation of its products, services, and messaging to national media outlets. Our general media strategy consists of a combination of feature articles and press releases to communicate our strategic vision as well as promote our products and services.

&#160;

BioHiTech is under contract with a nationally recognized Investor Relations firm for communication to existing and potential shareholders.

&#160;

As regulations continue to be passed regarding the disposal of food waste BioHiTech will leverage both its internal and external marketing sources to communicate to the target market the increasing level of need for its products and services.

&#160;

5&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Currently, Eco-Safe Digesters are imported from the manufacturer located in Seoul, South Korea and received at the BioHiTech headquarters and warehouse in Chestnut Ridge, New York. Each product goes through a rigorous quality control process before it is delivered to the customer. At our headquarters facility, each product is equipped with our proprietary hardware and software to enable our BioHiTech Cloud connectivity. International units may be drop shipped directly to resellers. In this event, BioHiTech ships the necessary hardware and software to its international service agents for installation prior to customer delivery. The company is currently exploring the potential of transitioning to a US manufacturing model and has identified potential manufacturing firms located in Pennsylvania.

&#160;

COMPETITION 

&#160;

There are a handful of companies that distribute products utilizing similar technology to the Eco-Safe Digester. Most of these companies originated in Korea and we believe may have copied our technology, some with modifications. Of our competitors, our machine has the smallest footprint, requires the least amount of water to operate and we believe is an industry leader in terms of installations and efficiency. Currently we are not aware of any direct competitor with the ability to capture and deliver real time data. We believe that our pending patent, if granted, will provide BioHiTech the right to exclude competitors from making, using or selling technology on a food waste disposal device within the scope of the patent claims, in the countries in which the patent or patents are granted.

&#160;

Totally Green: Totally Green develops and markets an ORCA Green&#8482; Machine. The &#8220;ORCA&#8221; (stands for Organic Refuse Conversion Alternative) allows for rapid composting of most organic material in institutional and commercial end-user applications. The liquid compost is channeled through the sewer system or can be returned to the soil as nourishment.

&#160;

Powerknot: Based in California, Powerknot markets a product similar to other digesters.

&#160;

Enviropure: Enviropure markets a similar digester, with a much larger footprint requirement, to those noted above, as well as a &#8220;dry&#8221; solution. Its units also are purportedly available with a scale.

&#160;

Grind2Energy: A non-sewer food waste recycling system in which food waste is ground, stored in a tank, collected and transported to an Anaerobic Digester facility where it is converted into renewable energy. Grind2Energy is a product from InSinkErator, a business unit of Emerson Electric Company.

&#160;

Traditional Composting 

&#160;

Composting has been in existence for many years and has historically been the only option for organics disposal. Composting:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Relies heavily on truck collection and transportation. &#160; &#183; Uses facilities that can be considered public nuisances. &#160; &#183; Is very difficult to provide accurate metrics on waste volumes and generation. &#160; &#183; Facilities are difficult to site and are often long distances from waste generation. &#160; &#183; Is neither cost effective nor environmentally friendly. &#160;

Anaerobic Digestion 

&#160; 

Anaerobic digesters are readily used throughout Europe. Anaerobic digestion (&#8220;AD&#8221;) is the decomposition of organic waste in the absence of oxygen. The beneficial by-product is gas to be used to generate electricity. AD is generally accomplished on a large municipal or commercial scale and is not believed to be readily available as an &#8220;at the source&#8221; solution. AD facilities are beginning to be sited in the United States and are thought of as a viable disposal option for organic waste. While the technology is sound, AD facilities face various challenges in the United States. Management believes that AD facilities will continue to be developed and will be a part of the total solution for organic waste disposal. Many private equity funds have made investments in companies that own or are permitting AD facilities. The challenges to AD include:

&#160;

6&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Capital intensity of sizeable plants &#160; &#183; Difficult to site with proximity to feedstock &#160; &#183; Need steady, homogenous waste source (pre-processing is necessary) &#160; &#183; Relies on traditional collection and transportation of waste (significant costs) &#160; &#183; Rely on &#8220;tip fee&#8221; to subsidize operating expenses &#160; &#183; Difficult to provide data to consumers (similar to composting) &#160;

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

&#160;

BioHiTech is continually investing in research and development in an effort to enhance and expand upon its existing products and services. There are several research and development initiatives underway.

&#160;

As water is becoming a highly scrutinized resource, BioHiTech is negotiating for the right to use a proprietary water treatment and recirculation system in conjunction with its Eco-Safe Digester. If the pilot project is successful, we will be able to achieve multiple objectives, eliminating the need for fresh water in the digestion process, eliminating the discharge of effluent to waste water treatment facilities, and the creation of &#8220;net new&#8221; water for our customers for re-use within their facilities for general purposes.

&#160;

As customers gain an appreciation for the transparency provided by the BioHiTech Cloud on their food waste they have expressed the desire to track other recyclable and waste products using our existing dashboard. As the core technology already exists, we are currently in the process of adapting our weight capture and presentation to be deployed on various other waste equipment located within our customers&#8217; locations. The success of this pilot project would provide the ability to expand our software as a service offerings under additional license fees for each piece of equipment. These pieces of equipment have been utilized for many years and provide a significant target market based on their historical presence.

&#160;

As we recognize some customers&#8217; desire to re-capture nutrients from food waste to be used for the generation of electricity via Anaerobic digestion, we have begun to provide the ability to capture effluent from the Eco-Safe Digester as feedstock for the AD process. Testing has been performed in 2015 with a regional anaerobic digestion company to determine whether our units can produce a valuable feedstock with energy value. While testing is continuing, initial trials have been positive. By utilizing our technology, the customer is able to treat waste at its point of generation, measure and analyze waste volumes via the BioHiTech Cloud, transport the residual in a more cost effective and environmentally friendly means and ultimately convert its food to energy via the AD process. This process is hoped to provide a more sustainable model for AD as it may reduce costs of logistics and reduce the need for government subsidy. We hope this solution can be widely deployed in Europe where anaerobic digestion is more widely accepted than in the United States.

&#160;

MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES 

&#160;

As of the date of this Report, BioHiTech has 22 full time and 3 part-time employees. We believe we enjoy good employee relations. None of our employees are members of any labor union, and we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement.

&#160;

PROPERTIES 

&#160;

The Company does not own any physical location. The Company currently leases its corporate headquarters and warehouse in Chestnut Ridge, NY as well as its technology development office in Harrisburg, PA. We believe that our current headquarters and warehouse facility are sufficient in size for current and future operations. The current leases for the headquarters and warehouse expire in 2020 each containing a renewal option for an additional five-year period. The current lease for the Harrisburg, PA technology development office expires in 2018 and has one renewal option for a one-year period. The United Kingdom operations are managed from employee based virtual offices in the UK.

&#160;

7&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

&#160;

The Company generates revenues from sales of its Eco-Safe Digester and related goods and services. The Company's other known potential sources of capital are possible investments and advances from related parties, proceeds from private placements, issuance of notes payable, loans from its officers, and cash from future revenues after the Company commences sales. The Company may require additional financing to continue operations. There is no assurance that such additional financing will be available or that such financing will be on terms that are favorable to the Company.

&#160;

POTENTIAL FUTURE PROJECTS AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 

&#160;

Members of the Company&#8217;s management may serve in the future as an officer, director or investor in other entities. Neither BioHiTech nor any of its shareholders would have any interest in these other companies&#8217; projects. Management believes that it has sufficient resources to fully discharge its responsibilities for all current and future BioHiTech projects.

&#160;

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

&#160; 

We believe we are in compliance with applicable federal, state and other regulations and that we have compliance programs in place to ensure compliance going forward. There are no regulatory notifications or actions pending.

&#160;

LEGAL MATTERS 

&#160;

None.

&#160;

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 

&#160;

BioHitech Realty LLC 

&#160; 

BioHiTech currently rents its corporate headquarters and, its warehousing space, from BioHitech Realty LLC, a company partially owned by Frank E.
