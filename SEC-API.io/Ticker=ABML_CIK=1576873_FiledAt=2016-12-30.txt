Our Company is a start-up, exploration mining company formed to explore mineral properties in the Dominican Republic or elsewhere in the world which, hopefully, will contain gold and other economic minerals. 

The Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Oroplata Exploraciones E Ingenieria, Orexi, S.R.L (herein known as &#34;Oroplata Exploraciones&#34;) acquired the mineral rights to a claim located in the Dominican Republic called Mogollon Gold Claim. As of May 31 st , 2016, no further work was planned for the Mogollon gold claim.

On June 1, 2016, the Company entered into Mineral Claim Purchase Agreement (the &#147;Agreement&#148;) with Plateau Ventures LLC., a Utah corporation (&#147;PVL&#148;). Pursuant to the Agreement, upon the satisfaction of various closing conditions, PVL will sell to the Company the title to five hundred (500) lithium mineral claims, totaling 10,000 acres, called the Western Nevada Basin, situated in Railroad Valley in Nye County, Nevada (the &#147;WNB Claims&#148;). Oroplata then decided to not pursue any further work on the Mogollon Gold Claim.

&#160;

Oroplata has not earned any revenues to date and we do not anticipate earning revenues until such time as we have undertaken sufficient exploration work to identify an ore body. Exploration work will take a number of years and there is no certainty we will ever reach a production stage. Our Company is considered to be in the exploration stage due to not having done exploration work which would result in a development decision.

As at September 30, 2016, the Company has not earned revenue, has a working capital deficit of $215,993, and an accumulated deficit of $28,501,900

&#160;

From our inception on October 6, 2011 through to September 30, 2016, we raised $80,000 in capital in a private placement by issuing 40,000,000 shares of common stock at the price of $0.002 per share to the company&#146;s former CEO. Subsequent to September 30, 2016 we have raised no further funds other than advances from our director for payment of certain Company expenses.

&#160;

Oroplata has two wholly-owned subsidiaries; Oroplata Exploraciones E Ingenieria, Orexi, S.R.L which was incorporated under the laws of the Dominican Republic on January 10, 2012, and Lithortech Resources incorporated under the laws of Nevada on August 8, 2016.
