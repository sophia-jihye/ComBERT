 Item 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS. 

&#160;

History of the Business 

&#160;

Legacy Card Company (&#8220;Legacy&#8221;) was formed as a Limited Liability Company on August 29, 2001. On April 18, 2005, Legacy converted from a California Limited Liability Company to a Nevada Corporation. On November 10, 2005, Legacy merged with Cardiff International, Inc. (&#8220;Cardiff&#8221;, the &#8220;Company&#8221;), a publicly held corporation presently incorporated in Florida. Legacy was formed as a California limited liability company in August 2001. In April 2005, Legacy was converted into a Nevada corporation.

&#160;

As part of the Merger, the officers and directors of Cardiff, resigned from their positions as officers and directors of Cardiff and the officers and directors of Legacy were appointed as officers and directors of Cardiff at the effective time of the Merger.

&#160;

As a result of the Merger described above, on November 1, 2005 Legacy became a subsidiary of Cardiff. Cardiff International, Inc. is the parent company for the Mission Tuition Rewards program, which is targeted to families focused on saving money for educational needs.

&#160;

On February 7, 2006, Cardiff changed its fiscal year end to December 31st from September 30th.

&#160;

In the first quarter of 2013, it was decided to restructure Cardiff into a holding company that adopted a new business model known as &#34;Collaborative Governance,&#34; a form of governance enabling businesses to take advantage of the power of a public company. Cardiff began targeting the acquisition of undervalued, niche companies with high growth potential, income-producing commercial real estate properties, and high return investments, all designed to pay a dividend to our shareholders. The reason for this strategy was to protect our shareholders by acquiring profitable small- to minimum-sized businesses with little to no debt, seeking support with both financing and management that had the ability to offer a return to investors. The plan is to establish new classes of preferred stock to streamline voting rights, negate debt, and acquire new businesses. By December of 2013, we had negated more than 90% of all its debt; by July of 2014, we had completed the acquisition of three businesses: We Three, LLC; Romeo&#8217;s NY Pizza; and Edge View Properties, Inc. We delayed the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K (&#8220;Form 10-K&#8221;) for the year ended December 31, 2014 due to difficulty obtaining information from another acquisition, which was subsequently unwound.

&#160;

In December of 2013 Daniel Thompson was issued 63% of the Common Shares, 720,000 Series B Preferred Shares, $0.001 par value and 1 Series A Preferred Share, $0.00001 par value. In addition, over 3 Million dollars in debt was removed by Novation Agreements issuing Series B and C Preferred Shares.

&#160;
