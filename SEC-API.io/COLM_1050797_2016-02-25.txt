 Item 1. BUSINESS 

General 

Founded in 1938 in Portland, Oregon, as a small, family-owned, regional hat distributor and incorporated in 1961, Columbia Sportswear Company has grown to become a global leader in designing, sourcing, marketing and distributing outdoor and active lifestyle apparel, footwear, accessories and equipment. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221;, &#8220;the Company&#8221; and &#8220;Columbia&#8221; refer to Columbia Sportswear Company, together with its wholly owned subsidiaries and entities in which it maintains a controlling financial interest. 

As one of the largest outdoor and active lifestyle apparel and footwear companies in the world, our products have earned an international reputation for innovation, quality and performance. We design, source, market and distribute outdoor and active lifestyle apparel, footwear, accessories and equipment under four primary brands: 

Columbia &#174; &#160; 

The Columbia brand is our largest brand, offering performance and casual products, including apparel, footwear, accessories and equipment, for a wide variety of activities and consumers. 

Sorel &#174; &#160; 

Acquired in 2000, the Sorel brand offers premium fashion, casual and cold weather footwear, apparel, and accessories for a wide demographic, with a primary emphasis on young, fashion-forward female consumers. 

Mountain Hardwear &#174; &#160; 

Acquired in 2003, the Mountain Hardwear brand, headquartered in Richmond, California, offers premium apparel, accessories and equipment primarily for the high performance needs of mountaineering enthusiasts, as well as for consumers who are inspired by the outdoor lifestyle. 

prAna &#174; &#160; 

Acquired in 2014, the prAna brand, headquartered in Carlsbad, California, offers stylish and functional active lifestyle apparel and accessories designed and manufactured with an emphasis on sustainable materials and processes. 

Other Brands 

The Montrail &#174; &#32;brand, acquired in 2006, offers high-performance running footwear, with an emphasis on trail-running. In February 2016, the Company announced the decision to realign the Montrail brand in spring 2017 as a sub-brand of the Columbia brand. The new sub-brand will expand its offerings to include full head-to-toe assortments of performance footwear, apparel and accessories designed specifically for running on the trail. 

The OutDry &#174; &#32;brand, acquired in 2010, holds various patents pertaining to processes for manufacturing waterproof and breathable apparel, footwear, accessories and equipment. We have incorporated OutDry in select Columbia, Mountain Hardwear, Sorel and Montrail products, and also license the product to other parties. 

The Pacific Trail &#174; &#32;brand, acquired in 2006, is licensed to third parties across a range of apparel, footwear, accessories and equipment. 

Our brands complement each other to address the diverse performance needs of a wide variety of outdoor and active lifestyle consumers. 

We distribute our products through a mix of wholesale distribution channels, our own direct-to-consumer channels (retail stores and e-commerce), independent distributors and licensees. In 2015 , our products were sold in approximately 100 &#32;countries. In 71 &#32;of those countries we sell to independent distributors to whom we have granted distribution rights. Substantially all of our products are manufactured by contract manufacturers located outside the United States. 

Consumer desire for our products is affected by a number of variables, including the popularity of outdoor activities and active lifestyles, weather, changing design trends, consumer adoption of innovative performance technologies and the availability and desirability of competitor alternatives. Therefore, we seek to drive, anticipate and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by developing new products with innovative performance features and designs, creating persuasive and memorable marketing communications to generate consumer awareness, demand and retention, and adjusting the mix and price points of available product offerings. Failure to anticipate or respond to consumer needs and preferences in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. 

Our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Some of these risks and uncertainties are described below under Item 1A, Risk Factors. 

Seasonality and Variability of Business 

Our business is affected by the general seasonal trends common to the industry, including seasonal weather and discretionary consumer shopping and spending patterns. Our products are marketed on a seasonal basis and our sales are weighted substantially toward the third and fourth quarters, while our operating costs are more equally distributed throughout the year. The expansion of our direct-to-consumer operations has increased the proportion of sales, profits and cash flows that we generate in the fourth calendar quarter. In 2015 , approximately 60% &#32;of our net sales and approximately 90% &#32;of our net income was realized in the second half of the year, illustrating our dependence upon sales results in the second half of the year, as well as the less seasonal nature of our operating costs. 

Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period, particularly in light of persistent volatility in global economic and geopolitical conditions and volatility of foreign currency exchange rates, which when combined with seasonal weather patterns and inflationary or volatile input costs, reduce the predictability of our business. 

For further discussion regarding the effects of the macro-economic environment on our business, see Part II, Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Products 

We provide high quality apparel, footwear, accessories and equipment for use in a wide range of outdoor and active lifestyle activities by men, women and youth. A large percentage of our products are also worn for casual or leisure purposes. The durability and functionality of our products make them ideal for a wide range of outdoor and active lifestyle activities, serving a broad range of consumers, including elite skiers and mountain climbers, outdoor enthusiasts, hunting and fishing enthusiasts, top endurance trail runners and outdoor-inspired consumers. 

We develop and manage our merchandise in two principal categories: (1) apparel, accessories and equipment and (2) footwear. The following table presents the net sales and approximate percentages of net sales attributable to each of our principal product categories for each of the last three years ended December 31 (dollars in millions).

Apparel, accessories and equipment 

We design, develop, market and distribute apparel, accessories and equipment for men and women under our Columbia, Mountain Hardwear, Sorel and prAna brands, and for youth under our Columbia and Mountain Hardwear brands. Our products incorporate the cumulative design, fabrication, fit and construction technologies that we have pioneered over several decades and that we continue to innovate. Our apparel, accessories and equipment are designed to be used during a wide variety of outdoor activities, such as skiing, snowboarding, hiking, climbing, mountaineering, camping, hunting, fishing, trail running, water sports and adventure travel. 

Footwear 

We design, develop, market and distribute footwear products for men and women under our Columbia, Sorel and Montrail brands and for youth under our Columbia and Sorel brands. Our footwear products seek to address the needs of outdoor consumers who participate in activities that typically involve challenging or unusual terrain in a variety of weather and trail conditions. Our footwear products include durable, lightweight hiking boots, trail running shoes, rugged cold weather boots for activities on snow and ice, sandals for use in amphibious activities, and casual shoes for everyday use. Our Sorel brand primarily offers premium cold weather and casual footwear for men, women and youth, with a focus on young, fashion-conscious female consumers. 

Product Design and Innovation 

We are committed to designing innovative and functional products for consumers who participate in a wide range of outdoor activities, enabling them to enjoy those activities longer and in greater comfort by keeping them warm or cool, dry and protected. We also place significant value on product design and fit (the overall appearance and image of our products) that, along with technical performance features, distinguish our products in the marketplace. 

Our research and development efforts are led by an internal team of specialists who work closely with independent suppliers to conceive, develop and commercialize innovative technologies and products that provide the unique performance benefits needed by consumers during outdoor activities. We have established working relationships with specialists in the fields of chemistry, biochemistry, engineering, industrial design, materials research, graphic design and related fields. We utilize these relationships, along with consumer feedback, to develop and test innovative performance products, processes, packaging and displays. We believe that these efforts, coupled with our technical innovation efforts, represent key factors in the past and future success of our products. 

Intellectual Property 

We own many trademarks, including Columbia Sportswear Company &#174; , Columbia &#174; , Sorel &#174; , Mountain Hard Wear &#174; , prAna &#174; , Montrail &#174; , OutDry &#174; , Pacific Trail &#174; , the Columbia diamond shaped logo, the Mountain Hardwear nut logo, the Sorel polar bear logo and the prAna sitting pose logo, as well as many other trademarks relating to our brands, products, styles and technologies. We believe that our trademarks are an important factor in creating a market for our products, in identifying our Company, and in differentiating our products from competitors&#8217; products. We have design, process and utility patents as well as pending patent applications in the United States and other nations. We file applications for United States and foreign patents for inventions, designs and improvements that we believe have commercial value; however, these patents may or may not ultimately be issued, enforceable or used in our business. We believe our success primarily depends on our ability to continue offering innovative solutions to consumer needs through design, research, development and production advancements rather than our ability to secure patents. The technologies, processes and designs described in our patents are incorporated into many of our most important products and expire at various times. We vigorously protect these proprietary rights against counterfeit reproductions and other infringing activities. Additionally, we license some of our trademarks across a range of apparel, footwear, accessories and equipment. 

Sales and Distribution 

We sell our products through a mix of wholesale distribution channels, our own direct-to-consumer channels, independent distributors and licensees. The majority of our sales are generated through wholesale channels, which include small, independently operated specialty outdoor and sporting goods stores, regional, national and international sporting goods chains, large regional, national and international department store chains and internet retailers. We sell our products to independent distributors in various countries where we generally do not have direct sales and marketing operations. We also market Columbia brand apparel and accessories under licensing arrangements with various collegiate and professional sports organizations. 

We also sell our products directly to consumers in each of our geographic segments through our own network of branded and outlet retail stores and online. In addition, we have concession-based arrangements with third-parties at branded, outlet and shop-in-shop retail locations in our Latin America and Asia Pacific region, where the company retains ownership of inventory and control over certain aspects of operations. Our direct-to-consumer operations are designed to elevate consumer perception of our brands, manage inventory, increase consumer and retailer awareness of and demand for our products, model compelling retail environments for our products and build stronger emotional brand connections with 

consumers over time. Our branded retail stores and e-commerce sites allow us to showcase a broad selection of products and to support the brand&#8217;s positioning with fixtures and imagery that may then be replicated and offered for use by our wholesale customers. These stores and sites provide high visibility for our brands and products and help us to monitor the needs and preferences of consumers. In addition, we operate outlet stores, which serve a role in our overall inventory management by enabling us to sell excess, discontinued and out-of-season products while maintaining the integrity of our brands in wholesale and distributor channels. 

We operate in four geographic segments: (1) the United States, (2) Latin America and Asia Pacific ("LAAP"), (3) Europe, Middle East and Africa (&#8220;EMEA&#8221;), and (4) Canada, which are reflective of our internal organization, management, and oversight structure. Each geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and distribution of outdoor and active lifestyle apparel, footwear, accessories and equipment. The following table presents net sales to unrelated entities and approximate percentages of net sales by geographic segment for each of the last three years ended December 31 (dollars in millions):

United States 

The United States accounted for 62.6% &#32;of our net sales for 2015 . We sell our products in the United States to approximately 3,600 &#32;wholesale customers and through our own direct-to-consumer channels. As of December 31, 2015 , our United States direct-to-consumer operations consisted of 85 &#32;outlet retail stores, 24 &#32;branded retail stores, 2 employee retail stores and 5 brand-specific e-commerce websites. In addition, we earn licensing income in the United States based on our licensees&#8217; sale of licensed products. 

We distribute the majority of our products sold in the United States from distribution centers that we own and operate in Portland, Oregon and Robards, Kentucky, as well as one that we lease in Carlsbad, California. In some instances, we arrange to have products shipped from contract manufacturers through third party logistics vendors and/or directly to wholesale customer-designated facilities in the United States. 

LAAP 

The LAAP region accounted for 20.2% &#32;of our net sales for 2015 . We sell our products in the LAAP region to approximately 200 &#32;wholesale customers in Japan and Korea and to 14 &#32;independent distributors that sell to approximately 500 &#32;wholesale customers in locations throughout the LAAP region, including Australia, New Zealand, Latin America and Asia. In addition, as of December 31, 2015 , there were 169 &#32;and 241 &#32;concession-based, branded, outlet and shop-in-shop locations in Japan and Korea, respectively. We also sell Columbia, Mountain Hardwear and Sorel products through e-commerce websites in Japan and Korea, and Montrail products through an e-commerce website in Japan. In addition, we earn licensing income in our LAAP region based on our distributors&#8217; production and sale of licensed products. 

We distribute our products to wholesale customers, our own retail stores and licensed stores in Japan through an independent logistics company that owns and operates a warehouse located near Tokyo. We distribute our products to wholesale customers, our own retail stores and licensed stores in Korea from a leased warehouse facility near Seoul. The majority of sales to our LAAP distributors are shipped directly from the contract manufacturers from which we source our products. 

On January 1, 2014, we commenced operations of a majority-owned joint venture with Swire Resources Limited ("Swire") for purposes of continuing the development of our business in China. The joint venture operates approximately 90 &#32;retail locations and brand specific e-commerce websites across multiple platforms, and has distribution relationships with approximately 70 &#32;wholesale dealers that operate approximately 800 &#32;retail locations. As a 60% majority-owned entity 

that we control, the joint venture's operations are included in our consolidated financial results. We distribute our products to wholesale customers, our own retail stores and e-commerce customers in China through independent logistic companies with warehouses in Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou, and from a leased facility in Shanghai that is operated by our joint venture partner, Swire. 

EMEA 

Sales in our EMEA region accounted for 10.0% &#32;of our net sales for 2015 . We sell our products in the EMEA region to approximately 3,200 &#32;wholesale customers and to 10 &#32;independent distributors that sell to approximately 700 &#32;wholesale customers in locations throughout the EMEA region, including Russia, portions of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. In addition, as of December 31, 2015 , we operated 10 &#32;outlet retail stores, 1 &#32;branded retail store and 1 employee retail store in various locations in Western Europe. We also sell Columbia and Sorel products through brand-specific e-commerce websites in Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. 

We distribute the majority of our products sold to EMEA wholesale customers and our own retail stores from a distribution center that we own and operate in Cambrai, France. The majority of sales to our EMEA distributors are shipped directly from the contract manufacturers from which we source our products. 

Canada 

Sales in Canada accounted for 7.2% &#32;of our net sales for 2015 . We sell our products in Canada to approximately 1,100 &#32;wholesale customers. In addition, as of December 31, 2015 , we operated 4 &#32;outlet retail stores and 1 employee retail store in Canada. We also sell Columbia, Mountain Hardwear and Sorel products through brand-specific e-commerce websites in Canada. 

We distribute the majority of our products sold in Canada from a distribution center that we own in London, Ontario. 

Marketing 

Our portfolio of brands enables us to target a wide range of consumers across the globe with differentiated products. Marketing supports and enhances our competitive position in the marketplace, drives global alignment through seasonal initiatives, builds brand equity, raises global brand relevance and awareness, infuses our brands with excitement and, most importantly, stimulates consumer demand for our products worldwide. During 2015 , we invested approximately 5.2% &#32;of net sales in marketing programs. 

Our integrated marketing efforts deliver consistent messages about the performance benefits, features, and styling of our products within each of our brands. Our target audiences vary by brand and we utilize a variety of means to deliver our marketing messages, including online advertising and social media; television and print publications; experiential events; branded retail stores in selected high-profile locations; enhanced product displays in partnership with various wholesale customers and distributors; and consumer focused public relations efforts. 

We work closely with our key wholesale customers to reinforce our brand messages through cooperative online, television, radio and print advertising campaigns, as well as in stores using branded visual merchandising display tools. We also employ teams that visit our customers&#8217; retail locations in major cities around the world to facilitate favorable in-store presentation of our products. 

We operate branded e-commerce websites and marketing websites in North America, Europe, Japan, Korea, and China and maintain a presence on a variety of global social media platforms to connect with consumers. In addition, we authorize many of our wholesale customers and independent distributors to operate e-commerce and/or marketing websites and to maintain a presence on social media platforms that help to reinforce our brand messages. Through digital media, consumers are able to interact with content created to inform and entertain them about our brands and products, to be directed to nearby retailers or to directly purchase our products. Use of digital marketing and social media has become increasingly important within each of our brands&#8217; global efforts to build strong emotional connections with consumers through consistent, brand-enhancing content. 

Working Capital Utilization 

We design, develop, market and distribute our products, but do not own or operate manufacturing facilities. As a result, most of our capital is invested in short-term working capital assets, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable from customers, and finished goods inventory. At December 31, 2015 , working capital assets accounted for approximately 68% &#32;of total assets. Accordingly, the degree to which we efficiently utilize our working capital assets can have a significant effect on our profitability, cash flows and return on invested capital. The overall goals of our working capital management efforts are to maintain the minimum level of inventory necessary to deliver goods on time to our customers to satisfy end consumer demand, and to minimize the cycle time from the purchase of inventory from our suppliers to the collection of accounts receivable balances from our customers. 

Demand Planning and Inventory Management 

As a branded consumer products company, inventory represents one of the largest and riskiest capital commitments in our business model. We begin designing and developing our seasonal product lines approximately 12 months prior to soliciting advance orders from our wholesale customers and approximately 18 months prior to the products' availability to consumers in retail stores. As a result, our ability to forecast and produce an assortment of product styles that matches ultimate seasonal wholesale customer and end-consumer demand and to deliver products to our customers in a timely and cost-effective manner can significantly affect our sales, gross margins and profitability. For this reason, we maintain and continue to make substantial investments in information systems, processes and personnel that support our ongoing demand planning efforts. The goals of our demand planning efforts are to develop a collaborative forecast that drives the timely purchase of an adequate amount of inventory to satisfy demand, to minimize transportation and expediting costs necessary to deliver products to customers by their requested delivery dates, and to minimize excess inventory to avoid liquidating excess, end-of-season goods at discounted prices. Failure to achieve our demand planning goals could reduce our revenues and/or increase our costs, which would negatively affect our gross margins, profitability and brand strength. 

In order to manage inventory risk, we use incentive discounts to encourage our wholesale customers and independent distributors to place orders at least six months in advance of scheduled delivery. We generally solicit orders from wholesale customers and independent distributors for the fall and spring seasons based on seasonal ordering deadlines that we establish to aid our efforts to plan manufacturing volumes to meet demand. 

We use those advance orders, together with forecasted demand from our direct-to-consumer operations, market trends, historical data, customer and sales feedback and other important factors to estimate the volumes of each product to purchase from our suppliers around the world. From the time of initial order through production, receipt and delivery, we attempt to manage our inventory to reduce risk. We typically ship the majority of our advance fall season orders to customers beginning in July and continuing through December. Similarly, we generally ship the majority of our advance spring season orders to customers beginning in January and continuing through June. Generally, orders are subject to cancellation prior to the date of shipment. 

Our inventory management efforts cannot entirely eliminate inventory risk due to the inherently unpredictable nature of unseasonable weather, consumer demand, the ability of customers to cancel their advance orders prior to shipment, and other variables that affect our customers&#8217; ability to take delivery of their advance orders when originally scheduled. To minimize our purchasing costs, the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non-delivery, we place a significant amount of orders for our products with contract manufacturers prior to receiving our customers&#8217; advance orders and we maintain an inventory of select products that we anticipate will be in greatest demand. In addition, we build calculated amounts of inventory to support estimated at-once orders from customers and auto-replenishment orders on certain long-lived styles. &#32; 

Credit and Collection 

We extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of each customer&#8217;s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. To assist us in scheduling production with our suppliers and delivering seasonal products to our customers on time, we offer customers discounts for placing advance orders and extended payment terms for taking delivery before peak seasonal shipping periods. These extended payment terms increase our exposure to the risk of uncollectable receivables. In order to manage the inherent risks of customer receivables, we maintain and continue to invest in information systems, processes and personnel skilled in credit and collections. In some markets and with some customers we use credit insurance or standby letters of credit to minimize our risk of credit loss. 

Sourcing and Manufacturing 

We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities. Virtually all of our products are manufactured to our specifications by contract manufacturers located outside the United States. We seek to establish and maintain long-term relationships with key manufacturing partners, but generally do not maintain formal long-term manufacturing volume commitments. We believe that the use of contract manufacturers enables us to substantially limit our invested capital and to avoid the costs and risks associated with owning and operating large production facilities and managing large labor forces. We also believe that the use of contract manufacturers greatly increases our production capacity, maximizes our flexibility and improves our product pricing. We manage our supply chain from a global and regional perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production environment, including political risks, factory capacity, import limitations and costs, raw material costs, availability and cost of labor and transportation costs. Without long-term commitments, there is no assurance that we will be able to secure adequate or timely production capacity or favorable pricing terms. 

Our apparel, accessories and equipment are manufactured in approximately 15 &#32;countries, with Vietnam and China accounting for approximately 66% &#32;of our 2015 &#32;apparel, accessories and equipment production. Our footwear is manufactured in four &#32;countries, with China and Vietnam accounting for substantially all of our 2015 &#32;footwear production. 

Our five largest apparel, accessories and equipment factory groups accounted for approximately 29% &#32;of 2015 &#32;global apparel, accessories and equipment production, with the largest factory group accounting for 11% &#32;of 2015 &#32;global apparel, accessories and equipment production. Our five largest footwear factory groups accounted for approximately 73% &#32;of 2015 &#32;global footwear production, with the largest factory group accounting for 34% &#32;of 2015 &#32;global footwear production. Most of our largest suppliers have multiple factory locations, thus reducing the risk that unfavorable conditions at a single factory or location will have a material adverse effect on our business. 

We maintain 12 &#32;manufacturing liaison offices in a total of eight &#32;Asian countries. Personnel in these manufacturing liaison offices are direct employees of Columbia and are responsible for overseeing production at our contract manufacturers. We believe that having employees physically located in these regions enhances our ability to monitor factories for compliance with our policies, procedures and standards related to quality, delivery, pricing and labor practices. Our quality assurance process is designed to ensure that our products meet our quality standards. We believe that our quality assurance process is an important and effective means of maintaining the quality and reputation of our products. In addition, independent contractors that manufacture products for us are subject to standards of manufacturing practices (&#8220;SMP&#8221;). Columbia sources products around the world and values legal, ethical and fair treatment of people involved in manufacturing our products. Each factory producing products for us is monitored regularly against these standards. Additional information about SMP and corporate responsibility programs may be found at www.columbia.com and www.prana.com. The content on our websites is not incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K unless expressly noted. 

Competition 

The markets for outdoor and active lifestyle apparel, footwear, accessories and equipment are highly competitive. We believe that the primary competitive factors in the end-use markets are brand strength, product innovation, product design, functionality, durability, market effectiveness and price. 

In each of our geographic markets, our brands face significant competition from numerous competitors, some of which are larger than we are and have greater financial, marketing and operational resources with which to compete, and others that are smaller with fewer resources, but that may be deeply entrenched in local markets. Our China and Korea markets have attracted a large number of competitive local and global brands. In other markets, such as Europe, we face competition from smaller brands that hold significant market share in one or several European markets, but are not significant competitors in other key markets. Some of our large wholesale customers also market competitive apparel, footwear, accessories and equipment under their own private label brand names. In addition, our direct-to-consumer channels expose us to branded competitors and wholesale customers who operate retail stores in key markets, and who sell competitive products online. Our international distributors and licensees also operate in very competitive markets against a variety of local and global brands. 

In addition to competing for end-consumer and wholesale market share, we also compete for manufacturing capacity of independent factory groups, primarily in Asia; for retail store locations in key markets; and for experienced management, staff and suppliers to lead, operate and support our global business processes. Each of these areas of competition requires distinct operational and relational capabilities and expertise in order to create and maintain long-term competitive advantages. 

Government Regulation 

Many of our international shipments are subject to existing or potential governmental tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, such as import duties and potential safeguard measures that may limit the quantity of various types of goods that may be imported into the United States and other countries. These trade barriers often represent a material portion of the cost to manufacture and import our products. Our products are also subject to domestic and foreign product safety and environmental standards, laws and other regulations, which are increasingly restrictive and complex. As we strive to achieve technical innovations, we face a greater risk of compliance issues with regulations applicable to products with complex technical features. Although we diligently monitor these standards and restrictions, a state, federal or foreign government may impose new or adjusted quotas, duties, safety requirements, material restrictions or other restrictions or regulations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015 , we had 5,978 &#32;full-time equivalent employees.
