 Item 1. Business 

Overview 

Great Ajax Corp. is a Maryland corporation that focuses primarily on acquiring, investing in and managing a portfolio of re-performing and non-performing mortgage loans secured by single-family residences and, to a lesser extent, single-family properties. Re-performing loans are loans on which at least five of the seven most recent payments have been made, or the most recent payment has been made and accepted pursuant to an agreement, or the full dollar amount, to cover at least five payments has been paid in the last seven months. Non-performing loans are loans on which the most recent three payments have not been made. We also invest in loans secured by multi-family residential and commercial mixed use retail/&#8203;residential properties, as well as in the properties directly. The multi-family and commercial mixed-use properties generally have loan values of up to approximately $5 million. We refer to these as &#8220;smaller commercial properties.&#8221; We are organized and operated in a manner intended to allow us to qualify as a REIT. 

Our primary strategy is to acquire, own and manage re-performing and non-performing mortgage loans, which are serviced by Gregory Funding LLC (&#8220;Gregory&#8221;), our affiliated servicer. We seek to acquire loans at significant discounts to our estimates of the value of the underlying real estate and of the unpaid principal balance, or UPB, of the loan. Unlike other loan acquirers, who often rely on pooled estimates in analyzing and pricing portfolios, our Manager uses proprietary models and data developed by its affiliates to evaluate individual assets and to help determine cities, neighborhoods and properties that it believes will experience home price appreciation, or HPA. These proprietary analytics have inputs for economic and demographic data that include changes in unemployment rates, median household incomes, housing starts, crime rates, education, electoral participation and other variables that we believe closely correlate to property values. The proprietary models predict probabilistic future cash flows for each loan we seek to acquire. Factors affecting our cash flow projections include resolution method, resolution timeline, foreclosure costs, rehabilitation costs and eviction costs. The database for these proprietary models contains foreclosure timelines on an individual county basis and, in some instances, also on an individual judge basis. We believe that these proprietary models permit us to acquire loans at prices we and the Manager believe represent a discount to UPB and current property values in non-auction purchases. 

We generally securitize our mortgage loans and retain subordinated securities from our securitizations. We also hold &#8220;real estate-owned&#8221; properties, or REO, acquired upon the foreclosure or other settlement of our owned non-performing loans, as well as through outright purchases. Our REO consists principally of single-family homes, although we also may own smaller commercial properties. Our resolution methods are tailored to each loan, based on our Servicer&#8217;s detailed analytics, and include, among others, loan modification, forbearance agreements, foreclosure, short sale and deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. In the event of foreclosure, our Manager determines, in part based on the information obtained from the Servicer regarding historical experience, whether to seek to sell any REO asset, including offering mortgage financing to the purchaser, or to hold the REO as a rental property. We conduct some of these activities through a taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS. As part of our integrated approach, the Servicer focuses on understanding each borrower&#8217;s situation and working closely with the borrower to determine the most appropriate resolution for both parties. We believe that purchasing re-performing and non-performing mortgage loans at significant discounts to UPB and underlying property values, as well as working, through Gregory, to support continuing or new payments by borrowers, allows us to achieve our targeted returns. However, if actual results differ from our assumptions, particularly if the value of the underlying properties were to decrease significantly, we may not achieve our targeted returns. 

We are externally managed by Thetis Asset Management LLC, an affiliated entity. We own a 19.8% equity interest in our Manager through a TRS. In addition, at March 18, 2016, our Manager and the Servicer own in the aggregate 443,855 shares of our common stock. We believe that these ownership interests, combined with our paying a percentage of the base management fee to our Manager in shares of our common stock, align our Manager&#8217;s interests with our interests and those of our stockholders. See &#8220;&#8212; The Management Agreement.&#8221; 

We believe that we benefit from the strategies employed by Aspen Capital, Gregory and our Manager. Aspen Capital and Gregory have successfully competed in the residential loan and property markets based on their ability to evaluate, acquire, manage and service loans on an individual basis rather than on a pooled basis. Using proprietary analytics and data tracking, our Manager and Gregory have the ability to evaluate large numbers of loans efficiently, determine individual valuations and develop resolution and cash flow paths. Consistent with Aspen&#8217;s past residential asset acquisitions and our recent operations, we are able to purchase loans through privately negotiated transactions rather than in the auction market. Since January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2015, over 90% of Aspen&#8217;s acquisitions have been through privately negotiated transactions. 

Manager Experience 

Since 2009 through December 31, 2015, the management team of our Manager, on behalf of Aspen Capital, has invested more than $847.6 million in more than 5,868 residential assets, including the assets in our portfolio, with an aggregate UPB and REO market value at time of purchase or conversion of approximately $1.3 billion. Aspen Capital&#8217;s overall portfolios of loans and properties may differ significantly from the mortgage loans we acquire in terms of interest rates, principal balances, geographic distribution, types of properties, lien priority, origination and underwriting criteria, and other possibly relevant characteristics. In addition, Aspen Capital&#8217;s past performance is not indicative of future results and its results were not achieved by a public company (subject to legal and regulatory expenses) nor by an entity organized as a REIT. Results are necessarily reflective of particular market conditions and current and future market conditions and economic factors beyond management&#8217;s control, which may cause future results to vary. 

The Servicer 

Gregory was formed by the members of our Manager&#8217;s management team to service &#8220;high-touch&#8221; assets, which are loans that require substantial and active interaction with the borrower for modification or other resolution. These loans are to less creditworthy borrowers or for properties the value of which has decreased and are more expensive to service because they require more frequent interaction with customers and greater monitoring and oversight. Gregory, or its wholly owned subsidiary, is licensed to service loans in all states in which it does business and has unsupervised Title II Mortgagee authorization from the Federal Housing Administration, or FHA. Gregory, or its wholly owned subsidiary, is also a licensed mortgage lender in 23 states, and currently has mortgage loan origination staff who are licensed in 11 of those states. As of December 31, 2015, Gregory, for our account, its own account and for affiliated entities comprised primarily of third-party investors, services a portfolio of residential and commercial mortgage loans and REO throughout the United States with UPB and REO principal balance of approximately $1.0 billion. 

Our Manager and the Servicer are located in separate premises in the same building and share IT resources, which should lead to more effective oversight by our Manager. We also believe this close collaboration leads to better communication among our Manager, the Servicer and us and greater ability by our Manager and the Servicer to enhance IT systems and upgrade analytics with desired features, which should enable our Manager and the Servicer to determine the optimal resolution strategy for each loan more quickly. Our Manager communicates an initial pool level strategy to the Servicer and hosts a training session to review priorities and optimal solutions. During the training session, our Manager can discuss any exceptions found during the due diligence process and provide guidance to the Servicer on addressing any issues effectively. In addition to training sessions and informal discussions, both parties meet weekly to review individual modification requests. Every employee of our Manager is very familiar with all functions of the Servicer, which allows them to monitor performance at a granular level to maximize individual asset returns. 

The Servicer must comply with a wide array of U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations that regulate, among other things, the manner in which it services our mortgage loans and manages our real property in accordance with the servicing agreement, including recent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, mortgage servicing regulations promulgated pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act. These laws and regulations cover a wide range of topics. The laws and regulations are complex and vary greatly among the states and localities. In addition, these laws and regulations often contain vague standards or requirements, which make compliance efforts challenging. From time to time, the Servicer may become party to certain regulatory inquiries or proceedings, which, even if unrelated to the residential mortgage servicing operation, may result in adverse findings, fines, penalties or other assessments and may affect adversely the Servicer&#8217;s reputation. 

Strategy 

We are continuing the opportunistic strategy developed by our Manager&#8217;s management team at Aspen in a REIT structure that we believe provides us access to capital and allows us to compete for more significant investment opportunities in the evolving mortgage markets. This strategy enables us to generate attractive current yields and risk-adjusted total returns for our stockholders. We intend to continue to distribute substantially all of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders in accordance with applicable REIT qualification requirements. Our strategy consists of: 

&#8226; 

focusing our investments primarily in loans secured by single-family residences with opportunistic mortgage or direct investment in smaller commercial properties, such as smaller mixed-use commercial facilities with ground floor retail units and residences above them; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

constructing and owning a portfolio of re-performing and non-performing mortgage loans at significant discounts to UPB and underlying property values; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

concentrating our investments in geographic areas, cities and neighborhoods with certain demographic and economic trends and attributes; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

working, through Gregory, to (1) support the continued performance of re-performing loans; (2) convert a portion of our non-performing loans to performing status; (3) determine optimal loss mitigation strategy on an asset-by-asset basis for remaining loans; and (4) manage the process and timelines for converting non-performing loans to sale or rental REO, including potentially offering financing to REO purchasers; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

when economically efficient, securitizing our performing and re-performing whole loan portfolios to create long-term, fixed rate, non-recourse financing, while retaining one or more tranches of any subordinated securities we may create; and 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

opportunistically mitigating our interest rate and prepayment risk by using a variety of hedging instruments. 

&#8203;

We believe that purchasing re-performing and non-performing mortgage loans at significant discounts to UPB and underlying property values, as well as working, through Gregory, to support continuing or new payments by borrowers, allows us to achieve our targeted returns. However, if actual results differ from our assumptions, particularly if the value of the underlying properties were to decrease significantly, we may not achieve our targeted returns. 

We price each loan portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis and focus on the acquisition of loans with the underlying property located in or in close proximity to urban centers where we believe that HPA will outpace the national market. While we expect to purchase loans nationwide, we target urban centers (including densely populated suburbs) because we believe that an increasing number of families and young professionals prefer to live in areas that are in close proximity to employment centers, public transportation and retail and other amenities that are typically more common in such areas, which provides greater potential for HPA. By focusing on urban centers and targeted densely populated suburbs we are able to more efficiently manage our portfolio and scale our high-touch loan servicing platform. 

Gregory has compiled data that suggests that HPA can vary significantly from neighborhood to neighborhood even within the same city. Our proprietary analytics include inputs for economic and demographic data that includes unemployment rates, housing starts, crime rates, education, electoral 

participation and other variables that we believe closely correlate to property values. These analytics help us determine cities, neighborhoods and properties that we believe will experience HPA. 

We seek to build clusters of loans backed by collateral in certain markets. These markets include, but are not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Los Angeles and San Diego, California; Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, Orlando and Tampa, Florida; Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; New York and New Jersey metropolitan area; Dallas and Houston, Texas; and Maryland and Virginia near Washington, DC. In addition to its experienced servicing staff, Gregory has contracted with local experts in areas where it services a significant number of loans that provide local area market intelligence, monitor properties and can manage rehabilitation projects for REO or repairs for rental properties. We believe having affiliated local experts and a centralized management team provides us a competitive advantage and leads to more informed decision-making and better execution. 

Based on the experience of our Manager&#8217;s management team, we believe that acquiring re-performing and non-performing mortgage loans results in higher risk-adjusted returns and provides us a cost advantage over other real property acquisition channels, such as foreclosure auctions and REO acquisitions. 

&#8226; 

We believe that buying re-performing loans is more efficient and lower risk than acquiring REO rentals directly because the net cash flow from the re-performing loans is typically greater than rent cash flow less expenses. Re-performing loans are purchased at a significant discount from UPB and underlying property value, but the borrower pays interest on the full UPB, leading to a higher current yield. The borrower is also responsible for property taxes, insurance and maintenance, which are all costs that the owner of the REO would otherwise have to pay. In addition, to the extent that the UPB exceeds the home&#8217;s value, the lender will benefit from all HPA until such time as the home price exceeds the UPB plus any arrearages and expenses. While the return to the mortgage loan owner is thus capped, there is also risk mitigation if the REO value decreases, until the value is less than the price the lender paid for the loan. 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

The histories of distressed mortgage loans often provide more insight into the likelihood of default than acquiring newly originated mortgage loans, which should allow our Manager to model default risk and price acquisitions more accurately. 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

If a re-performing loan becomes a non-performing loan, or we purchase a non-performing loan, which is typically purchased at a deeper discount than re-performing loans, we, through the Servicer, have a number of ways to mitigate our loss. These loss mitigation techniques include working with the borrower to achieve performance, including through modification of the mortgage loan terms as well as short sale, assisted deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, assisted deed-for-lease, foreclosure and other loss mitigation activities. With each REO acquired, we assess the best potential return, typically either through rental, sale with carryback financing, which we believe will increase the potential pool of purchasers, or sale without our financing the purchase. 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

We believe that we are able to purchase mortgage loans at lower prices than REO properties because sellers of such loans are able to avoid paying the costs typically associated with sales of real estate, whether single-family residences or smaller commercial properties, such as broker commissions and closing costs of up to 10% of gross proceeds of the sale. We believe this motivates the sellers to accept a lower price for the re-performing and non-performing loans than they would if selling REO directly. 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

We believe there are fewer participants in the re-performing and non-performing loan marketplace than in the foreclosure auction and other REO acquisition channels due to the large size of portfolios offered for sale on an &#8220;all or none&#8221; basis and the required operational infrastructure and expertise involved in servicing loans and managing single-family rental properties across various states. Additionally, as the acquirer of loans, we take the risk of delays in the foreclosure process for non-performing loans. We focus on smaller pools of mortgage loan assets that we analyze on a loan-by-loan basis. We are able to aggregate these smaller pools, often at a greater discount than would be available for larger pools. We believe the relatively lower level of competition for re-performing and non-performing loans, particularly in smaller pools, provides buyers with the opportunity for a higher discount rate relative to the foreclosure auction and other REO acquisition channels and therefore a relatively lower cost to acquire REO. 

&#8203;

&#8203;

We use proprietary models to predict probabilistic future cash flows for each loan. Factors affecting our cash flow projections include resolution method, resolution timeline, foreclosure costs, rehabilitation costs and eviction costs. We value each portfolio on a loan-by-loan and property-by-property basis and generate cash flow projections as if each non-performing loan was foreclosed and resolved according to the expected resolution method. Some of the variables used are the specific location of the underlying property, loan-to-value ratio, property age and condition, change and rate of change of borrower credit rating, servicing notes, interest rate, monthly payment amount and neighborhood rents. For loan pool acquisitions, we target a 9 &#8211; 18% return, without taking into account or giving effect to any borrowings, which we refer to as an unlevered return. We forecast the relative likelihood of each resolution method &#8212; foreclosure, deed-in-lieu, short sale and rental &#8212; for non-performing loans. For re-performing pool acquisitions, we analyze each loan for re-default probability, loan-to-value ratio, interest rate and structure of the loan and the likely resolution method in the event the loan stops performing. Each re-performing loan is analyzed through both a performing and non-performing path. 

Our comprehensive loan and property history database and data tracking lead to a deep understanding of our markets. This understanding, coupled with our long-term relationships with loan sellers, allows us to purchase loans at significant discounts to UPB and current property values. Our database contains foreclosure timelines on an individual county basis and in some instances, also on an individual judge basis. In addition to resolution timeline data, we track data by state, MSA (Metropolitan Statistical Area) and zip code basis regarding crime rates, education, electoral participation and other variables that we believe closely correlate with property values. 

Our strategy is adaptable to changing market environments, subject to compliance with the income and other tests that allows us to continue to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes and to maintain our exclusion from regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. As a result, our acquisition and management decisions depend on prevailing market conditions, and our targeted investments may vary over time in response to market conditions. We may change our strategy and policies without a vote of our stockholders. Moreover, although our independent directors will periodically review our investment guidelines and our portfolio, they generally will not review particular proposed asset acquisitions or asset management decisions. See &#8220;&#8212; Investment Guidelines.&#8221; 

Our Portfolio 

We acquire, invest in and manage a portfolio of mortgage loan assets as well as single-family and smaller commercial properties. We focus on acquiring and owning re-performing and non-performing mortgage loans and subordinated MBS securities from our own securitizations. We also hold REO acquired upon the foreclosure or other settlement of our owned non-performing loans or that we acquire in the market, principally single-family homes although we may also own smaller commercial properties. We assess the allocation of investments across asset classes, and within asset classes, based on the risk-adjusted relative value of each asset and the overall contribution of each asset to the anticipated performance of our investment portfolio and the value to be added to our investment portfolio. Additional factors that may affect the allocation of our investments include profiles of borrowers, geographic and demographic information, security, structure, seniority, credit enhancement, and legal matters. Our investment allocations are subject to change based on market changes and our assessment of the factors described above. See also &#8220;&#8212; Financing Strategy and Use of Leverage.&#8221; 

We closely monitor the status of our mortgage loans and, through our Servicer, work with our borrowers to improve their payment records. We have not experienced material write downs or impairments on the mortgage loans we have purchased since we commenced operations in July 2014. As of December 31, 2015, of the 3,250 loans in our portfolio, 85.0% were re-performing loans and 15.0% were non-performing loans. 

Gregory is the holder of record for one loan each in Georgia and Illinois because neither we nor our operating partnership holds the necessary licenses to hold those assets directly in such states. Gregory sells a 95% participation interest in the assets to our subsidiaries in exchange for 95% of the purchase price for the assets to be purchased by Gregory, which pays for the balance of such assets. 

Additional Investments 

Set forth below is a description of the asset classes in which we make investments. 

Residential Mortgage Loans 

Residential mortgage loans are loans secured by single-family residential real properties. We generally focus our residential mortgage loan acquisition efforts on the purchase of loan portfolios that are first lien, single-family fixed rate mortgage loans, ARMs and Hybrid ARMs with original terms to maturity of not more than 40 years and that are either fully amortizing or are interest-only for up to ten years, and fully amortizing thereafter. While we focus on older distressed mortgage loans, we have the ability to invest in newly originated mortgage loans. In most cases, the loans we purchase are re-performing, and non-performing. 

Commercial Mortgage Loans 

We also acquire commercial mortgage loans secured by smaller unit multifamily residences, which are considered commercial mortgage loans, as well as smaller mixed use retail/residential/office properties, which will generally have property values of less than $5 million. As with the single-family residential mortgage loans, we will have the ability to invest in newly originated mortgage loans, but we currently expect to focus on older distressed mortgage loans. 

REO and Other Real Property 

We will acquire individual real properties primarily through workouts of existing loans and foreclosure on defaulted loans as well as, to a much lesser extent, purchases from original owners. These properties consist of single-family residential properties, smaller multifamily residences and commercial mixed use retail/residential properties, such as smaller commercial facilities with ground floor retail units and residences above them. We may acquire on an opportunistic basis portfolios of residential single-family and multi-family properties throughout the United States. 

Investment Process 

Our underwriting process for acquiring re-performing and non-performing loan portfolios relies on extensive research and analysis of the target portfolio&#8217;s loan and borrower characteristics, underlying property values, document integrity, local processes and timelines, and the use of our proprietary models to determine probabilistic future cash flows and returns from various resolution methodologies. Factors affecting our cash flow projections and related pricing include, but are not limited to, property location, property age and condition, resolution method, resolution timeline, foreclosure costs, rehabilitation costs, eviction costs, neighborhood rents, changes and rate of change of borrower credit ratings and targeted return. We value every portfolio on a loan-by-loan and property-by-property basis. 

We generate and analyze multiple models that evaluate the following: 

&#8226; 

loan cash flows as if every non-performing loan is foreclosed and also using deterministic resolution outcomes; and 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

re-performing loans with risk-based cash flows and pricing based on payment history, time series credit scores, geography, effective loan-to-value ratios, likelihood of prepayment and predictive re-default probabilities. 

&#8203;

For pool acquisitions, we target a 9 &#8211; 18% unlevered return. For non-performing loans, we forecast the relative likelihood of each resolution method &#8212; foreclosure, deed in lieu, short sale and rental. For re-performing pool acquisitions, we analyze each loan for re-default probability and resolution method. Each re-performing loan is analyzed through both a performing and non-performing path. 

Purchase prices generally are at a significant discount to UPB and current property value, based in part on at least two unaffiliated broker price opinions for every property. Employees and agents of our Manager frequently visit the exteriors of properties prior to completion of due diligence and the information from such visits is incorporated into final loan pricing negotiations with the seller. 

We estimate our resolution timelines using a combination of proprietary data, modeling and historical trends. Our analysis of the resolution or foreclosure timeline for a mortgage loan is based on its history to date with added time cushion. We have developed a robust database of foreclosure timelines on an individual county basis and in some instances, on an individual judge basis. We also use statistical models to determine the expected modification success probability and the expected short sale success probabilities. We have an extensive due diligence process to validate data consistency, accuracy and compliance and perform document and third-party lien reviews on all loan files. 

The most important factors in analyzing re-performing loans are the level and duration of continued re-performance, the potential for HPA, prevailing interest rates and the potential for economic growth and the availability of financing for the borrower. For non-performing loans, the most important factors are the expected time to either re-performance or foreclosure, the condition of the real property, the potential for HPA (although we do not use an assumption of HPA in our acquisition loan models), whether the property is located in an urban or rural area and its actual geographic location and relative costs of owning versus renting the property. The analysis of all mortgage loan and REO acquisitions is also affected by the supply of existing housing and rate of housing starts as higher construction costs, particularly if replacement cost is greater than market price, can slow the rate of starts and new housing inventory and lead to rising rental rates relative to mortgage payments. We evaluate geographic location priorities based on many different factors and data including, but not limited to, employment rates and the local mismatch between employment rates and housing supply, demographic shifts, cost of new construction, social services, education, crime and voting participation rates. 

The following graphic outlines the process the Manager generally uses for assessing re-performing and non-performing portfolio investment opportunities: 

Gregory Funding &#8212; Loan Servicing and Loan Resolution; Property Management 

Gregory Funding LLC, and in California, its subsidiary, Gregory Funding Inc., sister entities with our Manager and indirect subsidiaries of Aspen, service our mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities, or MBS, REO and other real estate assets. Gregory is licensed to service loans or is exempt from licensing in all states in which it does business. Gregory is also an approved servicer for the FHA and the Veterans Administration, or VA. As of the date of this annual report, Gregory and its subsidiary have approximately 80 employees, agents and independent contractors in nine states engaged in servicing mortgage loans and property management, and is licensed in every state in which licensing is required for such activities. 

The Servicer employs various loan resolution methodologies with respect to our residential mortgage loans, including loan modification, collateral resolution and collateral disposition. To help us achieve our business objective, the Servicer focuses on (1) supporting the continuing performance of our re-performing loans; (2) converting a portion of our re-performing and non-performing loans to performing status; and (3) managing the foreclosure process and timelines with respect to the remainder of those loans. 

Our preferred resolution methodology is typically to cause the re-performing and non-performing loans to perform. Following a period of continued performance, we expect many borrowers will refinance these loans with us or other lenders at or near the estimated value of the underlying property, potentially generating attractive returns for us. We believe loan re-performance followed by refinancing generates near-term cash flows, provides the highest possible stable economic outcome for us and is a socially responsible business strategy because it keeps more families in their homes. In certain circumstances, we may also consider selling these newly re-performing loans. However, based on historical experience, we expect that many of our non-performing residential mortgage loans will enter into foreclosure, ultimately becoming REO that we can, based on our analysis of risk-adjusted returns, sell, often while offering purchase money mortgage financing, or convert into rental properties. If a REO property does not meet our investment criteria, we expect the Servicer to engage in REO liquidation and short sale processes to dispose of the property and generate cash for reinvestment in other acquisitions. We believe that our multifaceted resolution approach generally creates optimal stable returns, as all loans and REO may not be amenable to a single resolution strategy. To avoid the 100% prohibited transaction tax on the sale of dealer property by a REIT, we may dispose of assets that may be treated as held &#8220;primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business&#8221; by contributing or selling the asset to a taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS, prior to marketing the asset for sale. 

The Servicer collects and remits mortgage loan payments, responds to borrower inquiries, accounts for principal and interest, holds custodial and escrow funds for payment of property taxes and insurance premiums, counsel or otherwise work with delinquent borrowers, supervises foreclosures and property dispositions and generally administers the loans. In return for these servicing functions, we pay servicing fees to the Servicer equal to specified percentages of the outstanding unpaid principal balance of the loans being serviced. We are entitled to other forms of servicing compensation, rather than the Servicer, such as late payment or modification fees and any prepayment penalties payable by borrowers. Servicing compensation also includes interest income, or the &#8220;float,&#8221; earned on collections that are deposited in various custodial accounts between their receipt and the scheduled or contractual distribution of the funds to investors. Generally, the Servicer does not advance delinquent monthly payments of interest or principal in respect of mortgage loans but will be obligated to make certain servicing advances. 

The Servicer also services the mortgage loans underlying the MBS we create and sell to investors pursuant to customary agreements. 

Under the servicing agreement, the Servicer also provides property management, lease management and renovation management services associated with the real properties we acquire upon conversion of mortgage loans that we own or that we acquire directly and assists in finding third party financing for such properties. 

The compensation payable by us to the Servicer for servicing our mortgage loans and managing our REO is described in more detail under &#8220;&#8212; Gregory Servicing Agreement.&#8221; 

When we determine to sell a particular REO asset through our Servicer, we have the capability in certain states to underwrite and offer mortgage financing to the purchaser. We rely on Gregory&#8217;s in-depth knowledge of the properties when we facilitate financing in connection with a sale of a property through an unaffiliated lender. Unlike more traditional lenders, which base their underwriting primarily on the FICO&#174; credit risk score, Gregory focuses on the borrower&#8217;s cash flow and residual income after satisfaction of monthly requirements, including the expenses for any dependents, employment stability and the ability to make a cash down payment. We may choose to purchase the loan. We believe that our ability to offer financing tailored to the particular borrower provides another tool to maximize our return by converting REO to long-term significant net yield generating assets. Gregory receives no additional compensation from us for originating REO sale financing or other loans that we acquire. 

Investment Guidelines 

All of our investment activities are conducted by our Manager on our behalf pursuant to the management agreement. Our principal objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders over the long-term through dividends and capital appreciation. 

Our board of directors has adopted an investment policy designed to facilitate the management of our capital and assets and the maintenance of an investment portfolio profile that meets our objectives. The investment policy will help the board of directors oversee our efforts to achieve a return on assets consistent with our business objectives and to maintain adequate liquidity to meet any financial covenants and regular cash requirements. 

Our Manager has established an internal investment committee, consisting of Messrs. Mendelsohn and Schaub and three other Aspen investment professionals experienced in residential and/or smaller commercial real estate investments. Any purchase of re-performing or non-performing residential mortgage loans or of properties are analyzed by the capital markets group of our Manager and presented in written form to its investment committee for approval prior to purchase. Our Manager&#8217;s investment committee&#8217;s role is to act in accordance with the investment policy and guidelines approved by our board of directors for the investment of our capital. The investment committee may, without a vote of our stockholders, consider any investment, including investments in re-performing, non-performing and, as appropriate, performing residential and smaller commercial mortgage loans, consistent with our investment policy. We may also acquire single-family homes, smaller multi-family residential properties and smaller mixed use retail/residential/office properties either upon foreclosure or other settlement of our owned non-performing loans or in the market and opportunistically either sell such REO, including offering mortgage loans to the purchasers, or rent the REO for the short or long term. 

Our Manager&#8217;s investment committee is authorized to finance our investment positions through repurchase agreements, warehouse lines of credit, securitized debt and other financing arrangements provided such agreements are negotiated with counterparties approved by the investment committee. Our Manager believes it is critical to structure any financing facilities to significantly limit the risk to our business from falling collateral values and margin calls. We fund our asset acquisitions with non-recourse securitizations in which the underlying collateral is not marked-to-market and employ repurchase agreements without the obligation to mark to market the underlying collateral to the extent available. We may also hedge our interest rate exposure on our financing activities through the use of interest rate swaps, forwards, futures and options, subject to prior approval from the investment committee. 

Our board of directors has adopted the following additional investment guidelines: 

&#8226; 

investments and acquisitions that exceed 15% of our equity from time to time must be approved by the Investment Supervisory Committee of our board of directors; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

no investment shall be made that would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

no investment shall be made that would cause us to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

our assets will be invested within our target assets, as described above; and 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

until appropriate investments can be identified, we may pay off short-term debt or invest the proceeds of any offering in interest-bearing, short-term investments, including funds that are consistent with qualifying and maintaining our qualification as a REIT. 

&#8203;

Our investment policy and guidelines may be changed from time to time by our board of directors without the approval of our stockholders. 

Broad Investment Policy Risks 

Our investment policy is very broad and, therefore, our Manager has great latitude in determining the types of assets that are appropriate investments for us, as well as the individual investment decisions. In the future, our Manager may make investments on our behalf with lower rates of return than those anticipated 

under current market conditions and/or may make investments with greater risks to achieve those anticipated returns. Our board of directors periodically reviews our investment policy and guidelines and our investment portfolio but does not review or approve each proposed investment by our Manager unless it falls outside our previously approved investment policy or constitutes a related party transaction. In conducting periodic reviews, our board of directors relies primarily on information provided to it by our Manager. Transactions entered into by our Manager may be costly, difficult or impossible to unwind by the time they are reviewed by our board of directors. 

In addition, we may change our business strategy and investment policy and targeted asset classes at any time without the consent of our stockholders, and this could result in our making investments that are different in type from, and possibly riskier, than our current investments or the investments currently contemplated. Changes in our investment strategy and investment policy and targeted asset classes may increase our exposure to interest rate risk, counterparty risk, default risk and real estate market fluctuations, which could materially and adversely affect us. 

Policies with Respect to Certain Transactions 

Other than (i) the transactions pursuant to which we acquired our initial portfolio from Little Ajax II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, or Little Ajax II, and from Gregory (see &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221;), (ii) transactions in which Gregory is the holder of record because we or our subsidiaries may not hold the necessary license to hold those assets directly, but where we are the beneficial owner of at least 95% of the participation rights in those assets, or (iii) as approved by a majority of the independent members of our board of directors, we will not purchase portfolio assets from, or sell them to, our directors or officers or to our Manager, Aspen or any of their affiliates, or engage in any transaction in which they have a direct or indirect pecuniary interest, including in connection with the securitization of any of our mortgage loan assets (other than our agreements with our Manager, the Servicer and Aspen described in more detail herein). 

Policies with Respect to Certain Other Activities 

We intend to raise additional funds through future offerings of equity or debt securities or the retention of cash flow (subject to REIT distribution requirements) or a combination of these methods. In the event that our board of directors determines to raise additional equity capital, it has the authority, without stockholder approval, to issue additional common stock or preferred stock in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate, at any time, subject to compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. 

In addition, we expect to borrow money to finance or refinance the acquisition of re-performing and non-performing residential mortgage loans and REO and for general corporate purposes and we may borrow to finance the payment of dividends. Our investment policy, the assets in our portfolio, the decision to use leverage and the appropriate level of leverage will be based on our Manager&#8217;s assessment of a variety of factors, including our historical and projected financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, financing covenants, the cash flow generation capability of assets, the availability of credit on favorable terms, our outlook for borrowing costs relative to the unlevered yields on our assets, our intention to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT and exemption from the Investment Company Act, applicable law and other factors, as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. Our decision to use leverage is at our Manager&#8217;s discretion and is not subject to the approval of our stockholders. We are not restricted by our governing documents in the amount of leverage that we may use. 

As of the date of this annual report, we do not intend to invest in the securities of other REITs, other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers for the purpose of exercising control over such entities. We do not intend that our investments in securities will require us to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, and we would intend to divest such securities before any such registration would be required. We do not intend to underwrite securities of other issuers. 

Financing Strategy and Use of Leverage 

We finance our assets with what we believe to be a prudent amount of leverage, which will vary from time to time based upon the particular characteristics of our portfolio, availability of financing and market 

conditions. We have funded and intend to continue to fund our asset acquisitions with non-recourse securitizations in which the underlying collateral is not marked-to-market and employ repurchase agreements without the obligation to mark to market the underlying collateral to the extent available. Our repurchase agreements will generally not exceed 65% of our purchase price or 65% of property value, whichever is less. We generally incur more leverage on re-performing loans than on non-performing loans. See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; for a description of our securitizations, our repurchase financing facility and any other outstanding indebtedness. 

In a repurchase agreement, we sell an asset to a counterparty at a discounted value, or the loan amount, and simultaneously agree to repurchase the same asset from such counterparty at a price equal to the loan amount plus an interest factor. Despite being legally structured as sales and subsequent repurchases, repurchase agreements are generally accounted for as debt secured by the underlying assets. During the term of a repurchase agreement, we generally receive the income and other payments distributed with respect to the underlying assets, and pay interest to the counterparty. While the proceeds of our repurchase agreement financings are often used to purchase additional assets subject to the same repurchase agreement, our financing arrangements are not expected to restrict our ability to use proceeds from these arrangements to support our other liquidity needs. Our repurchase agreement arrangements are typically documented under the standard form master repurchase agreement of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, with the ability for both parties to request margin. Given daily market volatility, we and our repurchase agreement counterparties are required to post additional margin collateral to each other from time to time as part of the normal course of our business. Our repurchase agreement financing counterparties generally have the right to determine the value of the underlying collateral for purposes of determining the amount of margin, subject to the terms and conditions of our agreement with the counterparty, including in certain cases our right to dispute the counterparty&#8217;s valuation determination. 

We may utilize other types of borrowings in the future, including but not limited to, debt financing through bank credit facilities, warehouse lines of credit and structured financing arrangements, among others. We may also seek to raise additional capital through public or private offerings of debt or equity securities, depending upon market conditions. However, there can be no assurance as to how much additional financing capacity such efforts will produce, what form the financing will take or that such efforts will be successful. If we are unable to expand our sources of financing, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 

Our use of leverage, especially in order to increase the amount of assets supported by our capital base, may have the effect of increasing losses when these assets underperform. Our charter, bylaws and investment policies require no minimum or maximum leverage and our investment and risk management committees have the discretion, subject to the oversight of our full board of directors, to change both our overall leverage and the leverage used for individual asset classes. Because our strategy is flexible, dynamic and opportunistic, our overall leverage will vary over time. As a result, we do not have a targeted debt-to-equity ratio either in the aggregate or by asset class, although we currently expect that our debt-to-equity ratio will be within a range of 1:1 to 2:1. As of December 31, 2015, we had a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.58:1. 

We currently do not intend to hedge the risk associated with the mortgage loans and real estate underlying our portfolios. However, we may undertake risk mitigation activities with respect to our debt financing interest rate obligations. We expect that our debt financing may at times be based on a floating rate of interest calculated on a fixed spread over the relevant index, as determined by the particular financing arrangement. A significantly rising interest rate environment could have an adverse effect on the cost of our financing. To mitigate this risk, we may use derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and interest rate options in an effort to reduce the variability of earnings caused by changes in the interest rates we pay on our debt, subject to our maintaining compliance with the terms of the no-action letter so that we are not treated as a commodity pool operator for purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act. See &#8220;&#8212; Operating and Regulatory Structure&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Commodity Pool Operator Exemption.&#8221; 

These derivative transactions will be entered into solely for risk management purposes, not for investment purposes. When undertaken, these derivative instruments likely will expose us to certain risks such as price and interest rate fluctuations, timing risk, volatility risk, credit risk, counterparty risk and 

changes in the liquidity of markets. Therefore, although we expect to transact in these derivative instruments purely for risk management, they may not adequately protect us from fluctuations in our financing interest rate obligations. 

The Management Agreement 

On July 8, 2014, we entered into a 15-year management agreement with the Manager, which was amended and restated on October 27, 2015 (the &#8220;Management Agreement&#8221;). Under the Management Agreement, the Manager implements our business strategy and manages our business and investment activities and day-to-day operations, subject to oversight by our board of directors. Among other services, the Manager, directly or through Aspen affiliates, provides us with a management team and necessary administrative and support personnel. 

Under the Management Agreement, we pay a quarterly base management fee based on our stockholders&#8217; equity and a quarterly incentive management fee based on our cash distributions to stockholders. We pay our Manager fees as follows: the initial $1 million of the quarterly base management fee is payable 75% in cash and 25% in shares of our common stock. Any amount of the base management fee in excess of&#8201; $1 million is payable in shares of our common stock until payment is 50% in cash and 50% in shares (the &#8220;50/50 split&#8221;). Any remaining amount of the quarterly base management fee after the 50/50 split threshold is reached is payable in equal amounts of cash and shares. As for the Manager&#8217;s incentive fee, in the event that the payment of the quarterly base management fee has not reached the 50/50 split, all of the incentive fee is payable in shares of our common stock until the 50/50 split occurs. In the event that the total payment of the quarterly base management fee and the incentive fee has reached the 50/50 split, 20% of the remaining incentive fee is payable in shares of our common stock and 80% of the remaining incentive fee is payable in cash. 

Our Manager is entitled to an incentive fee only if our board of directors declares a dividend from REIT taxable income, which on an annualized basis exceeds 8% of our book value per share, and upon earnings exceeding certain thresholds for a given series of calendar quarters. The incentive fee is payable at the same time that the dividend is payable to our stockholders. Our Manager will not receive any incentive fee in respect of a dividend constituting a return of capital. We also reimburse our Manager for all third party, out of pocket costs incurred by our Manager, including third party diligence and valuation consultants, legal expenses, auditors and other financial services. Neither we nor our Manager may terminate the management agreement without cause during the first 24 months of its term. Following such 24-month period, we or the Manager may terminate the management agreement without cause or in connection with any renewal of the management agreement, subject in certain cases, to payment of a termination fee. 

Gregory Servicing Agreement 

Under the servicing agreement, Gregory receives servicing fees ranging from 0.65% &#8201;&#8211;&#8201;1.25% annually of UPB (or the fair market value or purchase of REO we own or acquire). Gregory is reimbursed for all customary, reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in the performance of its obligations, the actual cost of any repairs and renovations. The total fees incurred by us for these services is dependent upon the UPB and type of mortgage loans that Gregory services, property values, previous UPB of the relevant loan, and the number of REO properties. The agreement automatically renews for successive one-year terms, subject to prior written notice of non-renewal. In certain cases, we may be obligated to pay a termination fee. The management agreement will automatically terminate at the same time as the servicing agreement if the servicing agreement is terminated for any reason. 

Competition 

In acquiring our assets, we compete with other mortgage and hybrid REITs, hedge funds, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, investment banking firms, financial institutions, governmental bodies and other entities. Most of our competitors are significantly larger than us, have greater access to capital and other resources and may have other advantages over us. In addition to existing companies, other companies may be organized for similar purposes, including companies focused on purchasing mortgage assets. A proliferation of such companies 

may increase the competition for equity capital and thereby adversely affect the price of our shares of common stock. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of assets and establish more relationships than us. 

In the face of this competition, we rely on our Manager&#8217;s professionals and their industry expertise, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage and helps us assess risks and determine appropriate pricing for certain potential assets. In addition, we believe that these relationships enable us to compete more effectively for attractive asset acquisition opportunities. However, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives due to the competitive risks that we face. 

Operating and Regulatory Structure 

Tax Requirements 

We elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. Provided that we continue to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our REIT taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders. REITs are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that they currently distribute at least 90% of their annual REIT taxable income excluding net capital gains. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to comply with such requirements in the future. Failure to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year would cause us to be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates (and any applicable state and local taxes). Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. taxes on our income. For example, for any business that we conduct through a TRS, the income generated by that subsidiary will be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax. GAJX Real Estate LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of the operating partnership formed to own, maintain, improve and sell certain REO purchased by us. GA-TRS LLC, or Thetis TRS, is a wholly owned subsidiary of our operating partnership that owns our 19.8% equity interest in our Manager. We have elected to treat both GAJX Real Estate LLC and Thetis TRS as taxable REIT subsidiaries under the Code. On February 22, 2016, we received a Private Letter Ruling from the Internal Revenue Service in connection with our income earned through the Manager. Currently, our interest in the Manager is held through a taxable REIT subsidiary and is subject to federal and state income taxes. The ruling affirmed that we can generally own the Manager indirectly through our operating partnership without the associated income impacting our applicable REIT testing requirements. Consistent with the ruling, we are currently exploring options for transferring our interest in the Manager to our operating partnership. 

Investment Company Act Exclusion 

We conduct our operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries is required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer&#8217;s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis, which we refer to as the 40% test. Excluded from the term &#8216;&#8216;investment securities,&#8217;&#8217; among other things, are securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exclusion from the definition of investment company set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. 

We are organized as a holding company and conduct our businesses primarily through wholly owned subsidiaries of our operating partnership. Our operating partnership holds certain real estate and real estate-related assets, directly and through subsidiaries. Neither we nor our operating partnership nor Great Ajax Funding is an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(C). In addition, we conduct our operations so that neither we nor our operating partnership nor Great Ajax Funding come within the definition of an investment company by ensuring that less than 40% of the value of our total assets on an unconsolidated basis consists of&#8201; &#8220;investment securities.&#8221; 

We monitor our compliance with the 40% test and the holdings of our subsidiaries to ensure that each of our subsidiaries is in compliance with an applicable exemption or exclusion from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 

Our 19.8% equity interest in our Manager is owned by Thetis TRS, which is a special purpose subsidiary of our operating partnership. Thetis TRS may rely on Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) for its Investment Company Act exclusion and, therefore, our interest in such subsidiary would constitute an &#8216;&#8216;investment security&#8217;&#8217; for purposes of determining whether we pass the 40% test. We also may form certain other wholly owned or majority-owned subsidiaries that will invest, subject to our investment guidelines, in other real estate-related assets. These subsidiaries may rely upon the exclusion from the definition of investment company under the Investment Company Act pursuant to Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. The securities issued by any wholly owned or majority-owned subsidiary that we may form and that are excluded from the definition of&#8201; &#8220;investment company&#8221; based on Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, together with any other investment securities we may own, may not have a value in excess of 40% of the value of our total assets on an unconsolidated basis. 

In addition, we believe that neither we nor certain of our subsidiaries will be considered investment companies under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act because we and they will not engage primarily or hold themselves out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Rather, we and such subsidiaries will be primarily engaged in non-investment company businesses related to real estate. Consequently, we and our subsidiaries expect to be able to conduct our operations such that none will be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 

The determination of whether an entity is a majority-owned subsidiary of our company is made by us. The Investment Company Act defines a majority-owned subsidiary of a person as a company 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of which are owned by such person, or by another company which is a majority-owned subsidiary of such person. The Investment Company Act further defines voting securities as any security presently entitling the owner or holder thereof to vote for the election of directors of a company. We treat companies in which we own at least a majority of the outstanding voting securities as majority-owned subsidiaries. We also treat the securitization trusts as majority-owned subsidiaries of Great Ajax Funding even though none of the securities issued by such trusts that are held by Great Ajax Funding meets the definition of voting securities under the Investment Company Act. We reached our conclusion in reliance on an opinion of counsel that the Trust Certificates issued by each securitization trust are the functional equivalent of voting securities and that, in any event, each securitization trust should be considered to be a majority-owned subsidiary of Great Ajax Funding. We have not asked the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, for concurrence of our analysis, our treatment of such securities as voting securities, or whether the securitization trusts, or any other of our subsidiaries, may be treated in the manner in which we intend, and it is possible that the SEC staff could disagree with any of our determinations. If the SEC staff were to disagree with our treatment of one or more companies as majority-owned subsidiaries, we would need to adjust our strategy and our assets. Any such adjustment in our strategy could have a material adverse effect on us. 

Certain of our subsidiaries may also rely upon certain exclusions from the definition of investment company under Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act. Section 3(c)(5)(C), as interpreted by the staff of the SEC, requires an entity to invest at least 55% of its assets in &#8220;mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate,&#8221; which we refer to as &#8220;qualifying real estate interests,&#8221; and at least 80% of its assets in qualifying real estate interests plus &#8220;real estate-related assets.&#8221; 

On August 31, 2011, the SEC published a concept release entitled &#8220;Companies Engaged in the Business of Acquiring Mortgages and Mortgage Related Instruments&#8221; (Investment Company Act Rel. No. 29778). This release notes that the SEC is reviewing the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exclusion relied upon by companies similar to us that invest in mortgage loans. There can be no assurance that the laws and regulations governing the Investment Company Act status of companies similar to ours, or the guidance from the SEC or its staff regarding the treatment of assets as qualifying real estate assets or real estate-related assets, will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations as a result of this review. To the extent that the SEC or its staff provides more specific guidance regarding any of the matters bearing upon our exclusion 

&#8203; 

from the need to register under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to adjust our strategy accordingly. Any additional guidance from the SEC staff could provide additional flexibility to us, or it could further inhibit our ability to pursue the strategies that we have chosen. 

The loss of our exemption from regulation pursuant to the Investment Company Act could require us to restructure our operations, sell certain of our assets or abstain from the purchase of certain assets, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure &#8212; Maintenance of our exclusion from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act imposes significant limitations on our operations.&#8221; 

Commodity Pool Operator Exemption 

Under the Dodd-Frank Act, any investment fund that trades in swaps may be considered a &#8220;commodity pool,&#8221; which would cause its operators to be regulated as a &#8220;commodity pool operator,&#8221; or CPO. We have relied on no-action relief from registration from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC and filed our claim with the CFTC to perfect the use of the no-action relief from registration. In order to be exempt from registration as a CPO under the no-action relief, we must, among other non-operation requirements: (1) limit our initial margin and premiums required to establish our swap or futures positions to no more than 5% of the fair market value of our total assets; and (2) limit our net income derived annually from our swaps and futures positions that are not &#8220;qualifying hedging transactions&#8221; to less than 5% of our gross income. The need to operate within these parameters could limit the use of swaps by us below the level that we would otherwise consider optimal or may lead to the registration of our company or our directors as CPOs. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Regulatory and Legislative Actions &#8212; We may be unable to operate within the parameters that allow us to be excluded from regulation as a commodity pool operator, which would subject us to additional regulation and compliance requirements, and could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.&#8221; 

Environmental Matters 

As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance with environmental laws at our properties. Environmental laws can impose liability on an owner or operator of real property for the investigation and remediation of contamination at or migrating from such real property, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of the contaminants. The costs of any required investigation or cleanup of these substances could be substantial. The liability is generally not limited under such laws and could exceed the property&#8217;s value and the aggregate assets of the liable party. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties also may expose us to third-party liability for personal injury or property damage or adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or renovate the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. See also &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Employees 

We do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees in the foreseeable future. Each of our executive officers is an employee or officer or both, of our Manager or of the Servicer, and they are paid by our Manager or the Servicer, as applicable. Our Manager and the Servicer share employees with other affiliates of Aspen as necessary to implement our business strategy. Aspen and its affiliates, including the Servicer, have approximately 83 employees who may provide services to us or to our Manager or the Servicer for our benefit.
