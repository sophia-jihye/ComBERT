General and Historical Development 

RGC Resources, Inc. ("Resources" or the "Company") was incorporated in the state of Virginia on July 31, 1998, for the primary purpose of becoming the holding company for Roanoke Gas Company (&#8220;Roanoke Gas&#8221;) and its subsidiaries. Effective July 1, 1999, Roanoke Gas and its subsidiaries were reorganized into the holding company structure. Resources is currently composed of the following subsidiaries: Roanoke Gas, Diversified Energy Company and RGC Midstream, LLC. 

Roanoke Gas was organized as a public service corporation under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1912. The principal service of Roanoke Gas is the distribution and sale of natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers within its service territory in Roanoke, Virginia and the surrounding localities. Roanoke Gas also provides certain non-regulated services which account for most of the non-gas utility revenue of Resources. 

In July 2015, the Company formed RGC Midstream, LLC, a limited liability company established for the purpose of becoming a 1% investor in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC. Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC was created for the purpose of constructing a natural gas pipeline in West Virginia and Virginia. Additional information regarding this investment is provided under Note 3 of the Company's annual consolidated financial statements and under the Equity Investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline section of Item 7. 

In March 2016, Resources dissolved its subsidiary, RGC Ventures of Virginia, Inc. ("Ventures"). Ventures contained the operations of Application Resources, Inc., which provided information technology consulting services, and The Utility Consultants, which provided utility and regulatory consulting services to other utilities. Both of these operations were insignificant when compared to the overall activities of Resources and represented less than 0.2% of total revenues and less than 6% of other non-utility revenues. 

Diversified Energy Company currently has no active operations.

Roanoke Gas&#8217; regulated natural gas distribution business accounted for approximately 98% of Resources total revenues for fiscal years ending September 30, 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 . The tables above indicates that residential customers represent over 91% of the Company&#8217;s customer total; however, they represent less than 50% of the total gas volumes delivered and more than half of the Company&#8217;s consolidated revenues and margin. Industrial customers include primarily transportation customers that purchase their natural gas requirements directly from a supplier other than the Company and utilize Roanoke Gas&#8217; natural gas distribution system for delivery to their operations. Most of the revenue billed for these customers relates only to transportation service, and not to the purchase of natural gas, causing total revenues generated by these deliveries to be approximately 7% of total revenues, even though they represent 31% of total natural gas deliveries for the year ended September 30, 2016 &#32;and approximately 11% to 12% of gross margin for each of the years presented. 

The Company&#8217;s revenues are affected by changes in gas costs as well as by changes in consumption volume due to weather and economic conditions and changes in the non gas portion of customer billing rates. Increases or decreases in the cost of natural gas are passed on to customers through the purchased gas adjustment mechanism as explained in further detail in Note 1 of the Company&#8217;s annual consolidated financial statements. Significant increases in gas costs may cause customers to conserve or, in the case of industrial customers, to switch to alternative energy sources. 

The Company&#8217;s residential and commercial sales are seasonal and temperature-sensitive as the majority of the gas sold by Roanoke Gas to these customers is used for heating. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 , approximately 64% of the Company&#8217;s total DTH of natural gas deliveries and 72% of the residential and commercial deliveries were made in the five-month period of November through March. These percentages are below the prior two fiscal years due to lower volumes attributable to a much warmer heating season. Total natural gas deliveries were 8.8 million DTH, 9.9 million DTH and 10.1 million DTH in fiscal 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

Suppliers 

Roanoke Gas relies on multiple interstate pipelines including those operated by Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation, LLC and Columbia Gulf Transmission Corporation, LLC (together &#8220;Columbia&#8221;), and East Tennessee Natural Gas, LLC (&#8220;East Tennessee&#8221;), Tennessee Gas Pipeline, Midwestern Gas Transmission Company and Saltville Gas Storage Company, LLC to transport natural gas from the production and storage fields to Roanoke Gas&#8217; distribution system. Roanoke Gas is directly served by two pipelines, Columbia and East Tennessee. Columbia historically has delivered between 50% and 60% of the Company&#8217;s gas supply, while East Tennessee delivers the balance of the Company&#8217;s requirements. The rates paid for natural gas transportation and storage services purchased from the interstate pipeline companies are established by tariffs approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC"). These tariffs contain flexible pricing provisions, which, in some instances, authorize these transporters to reduce rates and charges to meet price competition. The current pipeline contracts expire at various times from 2017 to 2022. The Company anticipates being able to renew these contracts or enter into other contracts to meet customers&#8217; continued demand for natural gas. 

The Company manages its pipeline contracts and liquefied natural gas storage (&#8220;LNG&#8221;) facility in order to provide for sufficient capacity to meet the natural gas demands of its customers. The maximum daily winter capacity for delivery into Roanoke Gas&#8217; distribution system under the interstate pipelines is 78,606 DTH per day. The LNG facility, which is capable of storing up to 200,000 DTH of natural gas in a liquid state for use during peak demand, has the capability of providing an additional 27,000 DTH per day. Combined, the pipelines and LNG facility can provide more than 105,000 DTH on a single winter day. 

The Company uses multi-year contracts to meet its natural gas supply needs. The Company currently contracts with Sequent Energy Management, L.P. to manage its pipeline transportation, storage rights, gas supply inventories and deliveries and serve as the primary supplier of natural gas for Roanoke Gas. Natural gas purchased under the asset management agreement is priced at indexed-based market prices as reported in major industry pricing publications . &#32;The Company expects its firm supply agreements will be sufficient to meet customer demands for natural gas during the term of the agreement, which expires March 31, 2018. 

The Company uses summer storage programs to supplement gas supply requirements during the winter months. During the summer months, the Company injects gas into its LNG facility. In addition, the Company has contracted for storage capacity from Columbia, Tennessee Gas Pipeline and Saltville Gas Storage Company, LLC for a combined total of more than 2.4 million DTH of storage capacity. The balance of the Company&#8217;s annual natural gas requirements are met primarily through market purchases made by its asset manager. 

Competition 

The Company&#8217;s natural gas utility operates in a regulated, monopolistic environment. Roanoke Gas currently holds the only franchises and/or certificates of public convenience and necessity to distribute natural gas in its Virginia service areas. These franchises generally extend for multi-year periods and are renewable by the municipalities, including exclusive franchises in the cities of Roanoke and Salem and the Town of Vinton, Virginia. During fiscal 2016, all three franchise agreements were renewed for a term of 20 years with expiration dates of December 31, 2035. 

Management anticipates that the Company will be able to renew all of its franchises when they expire. There can be no assurance, however, that a given jurisdiction will not refuse to renew a franchise or will not, in connection with the renewal of a franchise, attempt to impose restrictions or conditions that could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business operations or financial condition. Certificates of public convenience and necessity, issued by the Virginia State Corporation Commission (the &#8220;SCC&#8221;), are of perpetual duration and subject to compliance with regulatory standards. 

Although Roanoke Gas has exclusive rights for the distribution of natural gas in its service area, the Company competes with suppliers of other forms of energy such as fuel oil, electricity, propane, coal and solar. Competition can be intense among the other energy sources with the primary driver being price in most instances. This is particularly true for those industrial applications that have the ability to switch to alternative fuels. The relationship between supply and demand has the greatest impact on the price of natural gas. Greater demand for natural gas for electric generation and other uses can provide upward pressure on the price of natural gas. Currently, a plentiful supply of natural gas, mostly due to improved drilling and extraction processes in shale formations, has served to maintain prices at lower levels. The Company continues to see a demand for its product and extends service to the new residential construction markets located along or near gas distribution mains in its service area. Although new construction activity has been limited over the last few years, the Company has been able to grow its customer base through customers converting from an alternative energy source to natural gas. 

Regulation 

In addition to the regulatory requirements generally applicable to all companies, Roanoke Gas is also subject to additional regulation at the federal, state and local levels. At the federal level, the Company is subject to pipeline safety regulations issued by the Department of Transportation and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. 

At the state level, the SCC performs regulatory oversight including the approval of rates and other charges for natural gas sold to customers, the approval of agreements between or among affiliated companies involving the provision of goods and services, pipeline safety, and certain other corporate activities of the Company, including mergers and acquisitions related to utility operations. 

At the local level, Roanoke Gas is further regulated by the municipalities and localities that grant franchises for the placement of gas distribution pipelines and the operation of gas distribution networks within their jurisdictions. 

Employees 

At September 30, 2016 , Resources had 126 &#32;full-time employees and 132 &#32;total employees. As of that date, 34 &#32;employees, or 27% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s full-time employees, belonged to the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied-Industrial International Union, Local No. 515 and were represented under a collective 

bargaining agreement. The union has been in place at the Company since 1952. The current collective bargaining agreement will expire on July 31, 2020. Management maintains an amicable relationship with the union.
