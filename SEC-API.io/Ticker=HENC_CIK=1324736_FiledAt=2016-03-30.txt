Business 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

We were incorporated on May 14, 2004 in Nevada. Between May 2004 and May 2007 we were relatively inactive. In May 2007, we directed our focus to the acquisition, exploration, and development of oil and gas properties. We are currently controlled by Holloman Corporation, a Texas corporation involved in the engineering and construction of pipelines and mid-stream gas processing facilities. 

All of our exploration and development efforts are concentrated in Australia. We hold working interests in petroleum exploration licenses covering 2,252 square kilometers (556,473 gross acres, 283,817 net acres) located on the western flank of Australia&#8217;s Cooper Basin. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

We did not participate in drilling any wells during the three years preceding June 30, 2013. On July 23, 2013, we spudded the Wolfman #1 exploration well on PEL 112. The Wolfman #1 did not encounter oil or gas and was plugged and abandoned. On December 3, 2015, we spudded the Baikal #1 exploration well on PEL 444. The Baikal#1 did not encounter hydrocarbons and was plugged and abandoned. 

&#160; 

As of March 30, 2016 we did not have any proven oil or gas reserves and we did not have any revenue. 

&#160; 

Our Australian assets 

&#160; 

In May 2007 we acquired a 62.5% working interest in an offshore Australian oil and gas exploration permit known as Victoria Permit 60 (&#8220;Vic P60&#8221;). We paid $639,487 in cash plus a 4.00% overriding royalty participation for this interest. On November 21, 2007 we acquired Holloman Petroleum Pty. Ltd. (&#8220;Holloman Petroleum&#8221;) for 18,600,000 shares of our common stock. Holloman Petroleum&#8217;s assets consisted of working interests, varying between 37.5% and 100%, in seven oil and gas permits awarded by the Australian Government. These permits, one of which included the remaining 37.5% working interest in Vic P60, covered 8,087 square kilometers (1,998,348 acres) of land in the Cooper/Eromanga Basin and 2,589 square kilometers (639,755 acres) offshore in the Gippsland Basin and the Barrow Sub-Basin. We have subsequently relinquished the Vic P60 and Barrow Sub-Basin permits and consolidated two of our onshore licenses. 

Onshore licenses &#8211; Cooper Basin 

&#160; 

We currently hold working interests in two onshore Petroleum Exploration Licenses (PELs) in Australia. PEL 112 is comprised of 1,086 square kilometers (268,356 gross acres). PEL 444 is comprised of 1,166 square kilometers (288,117 gross acres). Both licenses are located on the southwestern flank of the Cooper Basin in the State of South Australia. We are obligated to pay 4.53% in royalties on any revenues generated by operations on these licenses. 

The South Australian Energy Resources Division of the Department of State Development (DSD) reports that the South Australia portion of the Cooper/Eromanga Basin has produced over 175 million barrels of oil, 5.2 trillion cubic feet of gas and 160 million equivalent barrels of LPG and condensate. It has in excess of 150,000 line kilometers of 2-D and 3-D seismic data, over 2,300 wells and more than 103 oil and 165 gas fields. From January 2002 through December 2012, 195 exploration wells and 85 appraisal/development wells were drilled by new Operators in and around the South Australia Cooper Basin. Most wells have targeted oil, however both oil and gas have been discovered. Hydrocarbons were found in 89 of these wells (46% technical success rate) and 76 of these wells were cased and suspended as future producers (39% commercial success rate). Our management believes that Australia provides a stable regulatory, tax and business environment in the oil and gas sector. 

&#160;

Heavy rains beginning in February 2010 created wide scale flooding in the Cooper Basin. For nearly eighteen months, the inaccessibility of roads and facilities partially curtailed Cooper Basin oil production and resulted in a general contraction of exploration activity. As a result, we have applied for, and have been granted multiple license extensions on PEL 112 and PEL 444 from the Government of South Australia. Effective January 9, 2012, we were granted a variation of license terms on PEL 112. Under the variation, the minimum work requirements for PEL 112 License Year Three (3) were exchanged for those of PEL 112 License Year Four (4). Accordingly, the timeframe for acquisition of 100 kilometers of 2D seismic data on that license was moved from January 10, 2012 to January 10, 2013. Our seismic obligation on PEL 112 was completed in late September 2012. On January 3, 2013, we were also granted a six-month extension on PEL 444 such that the timeframe for acquisition of 200 kilometers of 2D seismic data on that license was moved from January 10, 2013 to July 11, 2013, and the overall license term for PEL 444 was extended to July 11, 2015. On February 17, 2015 a 6 month extension was granted extending the obligated drill date to January 11, 2016. Seismic acquisition on PEL 444 was completed in July 2013. The Seismic interpretation on PEL 444 was finalized in February 2014 and the registration with the Government of South Australia was completed on May 7, 2014. This fulfills our minimum work requirements for PEL 444 License Year Three (3). Our well obligation for PEL 444 was completed December 9, 2015 finalizing the work requirements of the first five year term. Application for renewal of the second 5 year program was submitted to the Government of South Australia in December 2015. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Under Australian law, at the end of each five year term, one third of the area covered by a petroleum exploration license must be relinquished. In June 2008 the Government of South Australia renewed the lease term and associated work programs for PEL 112 and PEL 444 by five years. In connection with that renewal, we identified and relinquished one-third of the acreage covered by PEL 112 and PEL 444. 

During November 2013, we applied for our final five-year renewal of PEL 112. On December 18, 2013, the Government of South Australia accepted our application and offered to renew PEL 112 in accordance with our suggested terms. In connection with that renewal, we identified and relinquished one-third of the acreage covered by PEL 112. The remaining license acreage contains all areas over which 2D and 3D seismic has been acquired and all existing leads and prospects. We believe the acreage we relinquished was non-prospective. On March 12, 2014, the Government of South Australia finalized its renewal of PEL 112. As a result, we now hold a 48.5003% working interest in PEL 112 (which is comprised of 1,086 square kilometers (268,356 acres) until January 10, 2019. 

On February 17, 2015, the Government of South Australia granted a six month extension on License PEL 444. This extended the drilling commitment from July 11, 2015 to January 11, 2016. 

During December 2015, the Company applied for a five-year renewal of its license on PEL 444. In connection with its application, the Company offered to relinquish 1,192 square kilometers (294,549 acres) of the area covered by that license. The Government of South Australia accepted the Company&#8217;s application and finalized its renewal of PEL 444. The Company&#8217;s management believes the acreage relinquished in connection with this renewal was non-prospective, and intends to develop the prospects identified on its remaining acreage in that concession. 

As a result of the assignments, at December 31, the Company holds 48.5003% working interest in PEL 112 and 53.3336% working interest in PEL 444, of which 4.8333% is currently under dispute. Perseville Investing Inc. holds 30.833% and Terra Nova holds 20.667% in PEL 112 and 31.833% and 14.8334% respectively in PEL 444 of which a total of 5.8333% is currently under dispute. 

To maintain our exploration rights in the Cooper/Eromanga Basin, the Australian Government requires that we fulfill the following minimum work commitments:

Our oil and gas farm-in agreements and exploration activity 

Cooper Basin farm-in agreements 

On May 11, 2012, we entered into an Oil and Gas Farm-In Agreement with Terra Nova Energy Ltd., and its wholly owned subsidiary Terra Nova Resources Inc. (&#8220;Terra Nova&#8221;), Chelsea Oil &#38; Gas Ltd., formerly Australian-Canadian Oil Royalties Ltd. (&#8220;ACOR&#8221;) and Eli Sakhai (&#8220;Sakhai&#8221;) on PEL 112 and 444. The Farm-In Agreement provided terms by which Terra Nova could earn up to a 55% undivided working interest in our Australian licenses in exchange for undertaking certain exploration obligations. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

On May 19, 2015 Terra Nova terminated the Farm-In Agreement. 

&#160;

Cooper Basin exploration activity 

Our Cooper Basin exploration plan includes the reprocessing of 3D seismic data on PEL 112 and PEL 444, and the drilling, completion and equipping of six (6) wells shared across both licenses. Current estimates indicate the costs to perform this work could be AUD$37.5 million (USD$27.4 million). Of this amount, approximately AUD$13.1 million (USD$9.6 million) has already been expended. 

PEL 112 

PEL 112 is comprised of 1,086 square kilometers (268,356 gross acres, 130,153 net acres). 

Acquisition of 127 square kilometers of 3D seismic data on PEL 112 (the &#8220;Mulka Survey&#8221;) was completed in late September 2012. The Mulka Survey fulfilled our minimum work requirements for PEL 112 License Year Four. Geokinetics (Australia) Pty. Ltd. undertook the Mulka Survey on the northern boundary of PEL 112 under the direction of Terra Nova. During February 2013, we received copies of the Mulka Survey data and interpretation from Terra Nova. As a result, Terra Nova completed its seismic Earning Obligation with respect to PEL 112, and earned an undivided 20% working interest in that license. 

Seven drilling targets were identified as a result of the final interpretation of the Mulka Survey data. We believe our primary drilling targets are similar geologically to producing structures observed in existing oil pools (including the Butlers, Perlubie and Parsons fields) located to the north of PEL 112 on the Cooper Basin&#8217;s western-flank. Seismic interpretation indicates that all primary targets display 4-way structural closures. 

Work Area Clearance (&#8220;WAC&#8221;) on PEL 112 access roads and drill site locations began April 20, 2013 and was completed on April 22, 2013. WAC is the process by which anthropologists and representatives of Australia&#8217;s Native Title Holders review exploration sites to ensure planned activity does not harm the cultural integrity of the land to be explored. 

On July 23, 2013, we spudded the Wolfman #1 exploration well on PEL 112. The well&#8217;s primary oil objective, the Namur Sandstone, was encountered at approximately 1,197 meters (3,927 feet) on August 6, 2013. Drilling continued to its secondary targets in the Birkhead formation and Hutton sandstones. Wolfman #1 reached Total Depth of 1,703 meters (5,587 feet), on August 7, 2013. No oil shows were observed in the primary and secondary oil objectives, and the well was plugged and abandoned. The entire cost of the well was paid by Terra Nova in accordance with the terms of the Terra Nova Farm-In Agreement. 

The drilling of Wolfman #1 fulfilled our minimum work requirement for PEL 112 License Year Five. 3D Sesimic data has been acquired on only 11.7% (31,382 of 268,356 gross acres) of the land comprising PEL 112. We believe significant potential remains for future seismic to identify migration trends and additional prospects on PEL 112 during the next exploration term. 

Upon completion of Wolfman #1 Terra Nova earned an additional undivided 5.8333% working interest in PEL 112. 

During November 2013, we applied for a five-year renewal of our license on PEL 112. In connection with our application, we offered to relinquish 1,110 square kilometers (274,287 acres) of the area covered by that license. On March 12, 2014, the Government of South Australia accepted our application and finalized the renewal of PEL 112. As a result, we now hold a 48.5003% working interest in PEL 112 until January 10, 2019. Our management believes the acreage relinquished in connection with this renewal was non-prospective, and intends to develop the prospects identified on our remaining acreage in that concession. 

On May 19, 2015 Terra Nova terminated the Farm-In Agreement and forfeited its right to earn any additional working interest in the license. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

PEL 444 

PEL 444 is comprised of 1,166 square kilometers (288,117 gross acres, 153,663 net acres). 

Acquisition of 80 square kilometers of 3D seismic data on PEL 444 (the &#8220;Wingman Survey&#8221;) began May 28, 2013 and was completed July 2, 2013. The Wingman Survey was conducted over a portion of PEL 444 that lies within the "Western Margin" of the Cooper Basin, which is generally considered highly prospective. This trend is being actively drilled by adjacent licensees including Senex Energy and Beach Energy. 

During February 2014, Terra Nova finalized its interpretation of the Wingman Survey data and earned a 20% working interest in PEL 444. 

On February 17, 2015, the Government of South Australia granted a six month extension on License PEL 444. This extended the drilling commitment from July 11, 2015 to January 11, 2016. 

On May 19, 2015 Terra Nova terminated the Farm-In Agreement and forfeited its right to earn any additional working interest in the license. We are currently disputing rights to operatorship with Terra Nova. Regardless of the outcome of the dispute, we have moved forward with our drilling program on a cooperative basis with our joint interest partners. In that connection we plan to obtain the financing required to fulfill our drilling obligations on a timely basis. 

&#160;

On December 3, 2015 the Baikal #1 Exploration well on PEL 444 was spudded. The Baikal #1 did not encounter hydrocarbons and was plugged and abandoned. 

&#160;

On December 31, 2015, the Company applied for a further five&#8211;year term on PEL 444. The Government of South Australia accepted the application which would extend the work obligations under the license to January 11, 2021. 

&#160;

Working Interest Ownership 

In 2014, ACOR assigned its 12.8332% working interest in PEL 112 and 444 to Perseville Investing Inc. Perseville Investing Inc. assumed all obligations related to the working interest in PEL 112 and PEL 444 previously held by ACOR. 

&#160;

In February 2015, Terra Nova sold a 5.1666% working interest to Perseville Investing Inc. in PEL 112 and PEL 444 for a total of $3,000,000. 

The working interest ownership in our Australian licenses as of December 31, 2015 is shown below: 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; PEL 112 &#160; &#160; PEL 444(1) &#160; Holloman &#160; &#160; 48.5003 % &#160; &#160; 53.3336 % Terra Nova &#160; &#160; 20.6667 % &#160; &#160; 14.8334 % Perseville Investing &#160; &#160; 30.833 % &#160; &#160; 31.8330 % &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160;

(1) 

The ownership of a 5.83333% working interest is in dispute with Terra Nova. The termination of the Farm-in Agreement prior to Terra Nova drilling a well on PEL 444 resulted in Terra Nova&#8217;s obligation to return a 5.8333% working interest that was provisionally transferred to Terra Nova in anticipation of Terra Nova drilling a well on that license. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

The petroleum and natural gas industry is highly competitive. Numerous independent oil and gas companies, oil and gas syndicates and major oil and gas companies actively seek out and bid for oil and gas properties as well as for the services of third party providers, such as drilling companies, upon which we rely. In the Cooper Basin, seismic and drilling contractors are limited. In large part, their schedules are controlled by demand from larger explorers in the area. Certain of our competitors control roads, bridges and other infrastructure we require to access our properties. Our reliance upon their infrastructure may create a competitive disadvantage for us. A substantial number of our competitors have longer operating histories and substantially greater financial and personnel resources than we do, and have demonstrated the ability to operate through industry cycles. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Some of our competitors not only explore for, produce and market petroleum and natural gas, but also carry out refining operations and market the resultant products on a worldwide basis which may provide them with additional sources of capital. Larger and better capitalized competitors may be in a position to outbid us for particular prospect rights. These competitors may also be better able to withstand sustained periods of unsuccessful drilling. Larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. 

&#160; 

Petroleum and natural gas producers also compete with other suppliers of energy and fuel to industrial, commercial and individual customers. Competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation considered from time to time by the governments and/or their agencies and other factors which are out of our control including, international political conditions, terrorism, overall levels of supply and demand for oil and gas, and the markets for synthetic fuels and alternative energy sources. 

&#160; 

&#160; Regulation 

&#160; 

The exploration, production and sale of oil and gas are extensively regulated by governmental authorities. Applicable legislation is under constant review for amendment or expansion. These efforts frequently result in an increase in the regulatory burden on companies in our industry and consequently an increase in the cost of doing business and decrease in profitability. Numerous governmental departments and agencies are authorized to, and have, issued rules and regulations imposing additional burdens on the oil and gas industry that often are costly to comply with and carry substantial penalties for non-compliance. Production operations are affected by changing tax and other laws relating to the petroleum industry, constantly changing administrative regulations and possible interruptions or termination by government authorities. 

&#160; 

Oil and gas mineral rights may be held by individuals, corporations or governments having jurisdiction over the area in which such mineral rights are located. As a general rule, parties holding such mineral rights grant licenses or leases to third parties to facilitate the exploration and development of these mineral rights. The terms of the leases and licenses are generally established to require timely development. Notwithstanding the ownership of mineral rights, the government of the jurisdiction in which mineral rights are located generally retains authority over the drilling and operation of oil and gas wells. 

&#160; 

Environmental considerations 

&#160; 

Our operations are also subject to a variety of constantly changing laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and penalties as well as potential orders suspending or terminating our rights to operate. Some environmental laws to which we are subject provide for strict liability for pollution damage, rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. In addition, we may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances, such as oil and gas related products or for other reasons. 

&#160; 

Some environmental protection laws and regulations may expose us to liability arising out of the conduct of operations or conditions caused by others, or for acts which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time the acts were performed. Changes in environmental laws and regulations, or claims for damages to persons, property, natural resources or the environment, could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us. These laws and regulations may substantially increase the cost of exploring, developing, producing or processing oil and gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given project and thus generally could have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations. Nevertheless, changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or in the interpretations thereof could have a significant impact on us and the oil and gas industry in general. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Other 

&#160; 

We currently have no full-time employees. We use consultants and contractors to provide us, among other things, with executive management and accounting services, and technical engineering support. 

&#160; 

Other than seismic, engineering, geochemical and geophysical programs capitalized in connection with our oil and gas concessions, we have devoted no substantial efforts to research and development within the last two fiscal years. 

&#160; 

Our offices are located at 333 North Sam Houston Parkway East, Suite 410, Houston, Texas 77060. Our offices are provided under the terms of an administrative services agreement with Holloman Corporation, the parent company of our controlling shareholder.
