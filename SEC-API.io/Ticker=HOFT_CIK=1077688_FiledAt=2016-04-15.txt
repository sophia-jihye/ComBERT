 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Except where noted, information contained in Item 1 is as of January 31, 2016, our most recently completed fiscal year and does not include the results of or describe the operations of Home Meridian International, a business whose assets we acquired subsequent to the end of the 2016 fiscal year. 

Hooker Furniture Corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221;) is a home furnishings marketing, design and logistics company offering worldwide sourcing of residential and contract casegoods and upholstery, as well as domestically-produced custom leather and fabric-upholstered furniture. We were incorporated in Virginia in 1924 and are ranked among the nation&#8217;s top 10 largest publicly traded furniture sources, based on 2015 shipments to U.S. retailers, according to a 2015 survey published by Furniture Today , &#160; a leading trade publication. We are a key resource for residential wood and metal furniture (commonly referred to as &#8220;casegoods&#8221;) and upholstered furniture. Our major casegoods product categories include accents, home office, dining, bedroom and home entertainment furniture under the Hooker Furniture brand. Our residential upholstered seating companies include Bradington-Young, a specialist in upscale motion and stationary leather furniture and Sam Moore Furniture, focused on upscale occasional chairs, settees, sofas and sectional seating with an emphasis on cover-to-frame customization. An extensive selection of designs and formats along with finish and cover options in each of these product categories makes us a comprehensive resource for retailers primarily targeting the upper-medium price range. We also market a line of imported leather upholstery under the Hooker Upholstery trade name and work directly with several large customers to develop private-label, unbranded products exclusively for those customers. &#160; Our H Contract division supplies upholstered seating and casegoods to upscale senior living facilities throughout the country, working with designers specializing in the contract industry to provide functional furniture for senior living facilities that meets the style and comfort expectations of today&#8217;s retirees. Homeware is an online-only brand that is sold through leading international e-commerce retailers. It supplies unique chairs, sofas and ottomans designed to be assembled in minutes by the consumer with no tools or hardware required. 

&#160;

For our core product line, our principal customers are both traditional and online retailers of residential home furnishings that are broadly dispersed throughout the United States and in thirty-six other countries around the globe. Our customers include independent furniture stores, specialty retailers, department stores, catalog and internet merchants, interior designers and national and regional chains. They are serviced by over 60 independent North American sales representatives and 8 foreign sales representatives. H Contract&#8217;s customers include designers, design firms, industry dealers and distributors and senior living facilities throughout the United States. It has its own sales force of independent multi-line sales representatives. Homeware&#8217;s customers are primarily online Home furnishings retailers including Wayfair, Hayneedle and One Kings Lane. 

We sold to approximately 3,600 customers during fiscal 2016. No single customer accounted for more than 3.5% of our sales in 2016. No significant part of our business is dependent upon a single customer, the loss of which would have a material effect on our business. However, the loss of several of our major customers could have a material impact on our business. In addition to our broad domestic customer base, 5.4% of our sales in fiscal 2016 were to international customers, which we define as sales outside of the United States. We believe our broad network of retailers and independent sales representatives reduces our exposure to regional recessions and allows us to capitalize on emerging trends in distribution channels. 

The Home Meridian Acquisition 

On January 5, 2016, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the &#8220;Asset Purchase Agreement&#8221;) with Home Meridian International, Inc. (&#8220;HMI&#8221;) to acquire substantially all of HMI&#8217;s assets (the &#8220;Acquisition&#8221;). On February 1, 2016, we closed on the transaction by paying $85 million in cash and issuing 716,910 shares of our common stock (the &#8220;Stock Consideration&#8221;) to designees of HMI as consideration for the Acquisition. The Stock Consideration consisted of (i) 530,598 shares accounting for the $15 million of consideration payable in shares of our common stock under the Asset Purchase Agreement, and (ii) 186,312 shares issued pursuant to working capital adjustments detailed in the Asset Purchase Agreement. The working capital adjustment was driven by an increase in HMI&#8217;s accounts receivable due to strong sales towards the end of calendar 2015. The number of shares of common stock issued at closing for the Stock Consideration was determined by reference to the mean closing price of our common stock for the fifteen trading days immediately preceding the closing date ($28.27). Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, we also assumed certain liabilities of HMI, including approximately $7.8 million of liabilities related to certain retirement plans. The assumed liabilities did not include the indebtedness (as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement) of HMI. We believe this acquisition will more than double the size of the Company on a net sales basis and consequently, make us one of the top five sources for the U.S. furniture market. See Item 7 and note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

The Home Meridian division includes five business units: Pulaski Furniture, Samuel Lawrence Furniture, Samuel Lawrence Hospitality, Prime Resources International and Right 2 Home. HMI has a unique business model which allows the company to create global sourcing solutions for major customers and multiple channels of distribution. This business model, global sourcing and broad experience have allowed HMI to adapt and gain significant market share within the industry. HMI has consistently been recognized as an industry and regional leader in sales gain and growth. Its divisional headquarters is located in High Point, N.C., with distribution centers on both coasts and Asian operations in China, Vietnam and Malaysia.

Sourcing 

Imported Products 

We have sourced products from foreign manufacturers since 1988. Imported casegoods and upholstered furniture together accounted for approximately 70% of net sales in fiscal 2016, 71% of net sales in fiscal 2015, and 72% of net sales in fiscal 2014. We import finished furniture in a variety of styles, materials and product lines. We believe the best way to leverage our financial strength and differentiate our import business from the industry is through innovative and collaborative design, extensive product lines, compelling products, value, consistent quality, excellent customer service, easy ordering and quick delivery through significant finished goods inventories, world-class global logistics and robust distribution systems. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

We import products predominantly from Asia. Because of the large number and diverse nature of the foreign factories from which we source our imported products, we have significant flexibility in the sourcing of products among any particular factory or country. In fiscal 2016, imported products sourced from China and Vietnam accounted for approximately 68% and 26%, respectively, of import purchases. The factory in China from which we directly source the most product, accounted for approximately 58% of our worldwide purchases of imported product. A disruption in our supply chain from this factory, or from China or Vietnam in general, could significantly compromise our ability to fill customer orders for products manufactured at that factory or in that country. If such a disruption were to occur, we believe that we would have sufficient inventory currently on hand and in transit to our U.S. warehouses in Martinsville, Virginia to adequately meet demand for approximately 4.5 months, with up to an additional 1.25 months available for immediate shipment from our primary Asian warehouse. Also, with the broad spectrum of product we offer, we believe that, in some cases, buyers could be offered similar products available from alternative sources. We believe we could, most likely at higher cost, source most of the products currently sourced in China or Vietnam from factories in other countries and could produce certain upholstered products domestically at our own factories. However, supply disruptions and delays on selected items could occur for up to 6 months. If we were to be unsuccessful in obtaining those products from other sources or at a comparable cost, then a disruption in our supply chain from our largest import furniture supplier, or from China or Vietnam in general, could decrease our sales, earnings and liquidity. Given the capacity available in China, Vietnam and other low-cost producing countries, we believe the risks from these potential supply disruptions are manageable. 

Our imported furniture business is subject to inherent risks in importing products manufactured abroad, including, but not limited to, supply disruptions and delays, currency exchange rate fluctuations, transportation-related issues, economic and political developments and instability, as well as the laws, policies and actions of foreign governments and the United States. These acts may include regulations affecting trade or the application of tariffs. 

Manufacturing and Raw Materials 

At January 31, 2016, we operated approximately 507,400 square feet of manufacturing and supply plant capacity in North Carolina and Virginia for our domestic upholstered furniture production. We consider the machinery and equipment at these locations to be generally modern and well-maintained. 

We believe there are continued strong market opportunities for domestically produced upholstery, particularly in the upper and upper-medium price points, which provide two key competitive advantages compared to imported upholstery: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#167; 

the ability to offer customized upholstery combinations to the upscale consumer and interior design trade; and 

&#160; 

&#167; 

the ability to offer quick four-to six-week product delivery of custom products. 

&#160; 

Significant materials used in manufacturing upholstered furniture products include leather, fabric, foam, wooden frames and metal mechanisms. Most of the leather is imported from Italy, South America and China, and is purchased as full hides and cut and sewn in our facilities, or is purchased as pre-cut and sewn kits processed by our vendors to our pattern specifications. 

We believe that our sources for raw materials are adequate and that we are not dependent on any one supplier. Hooker&#8217;s five largest suppliers accounted for approximately 37% of our raw materials supply purchases for domestic upholstered furniture manufacturing operations in fiscal 2016. One supplier accounted for approximately 18% of our raw material purchases in fiscal 2016. Should disruptions with this supplier occur, we believe we could successfully source these products from other suppliers without significant disruption to our operations. 

Products 

Our product lines cover most major style categories, including European and American traditional, contemporary, transitional, urban, country, casual, and cottage designs. We offer furniture in a variety of materials, such as various types of wood, metal, leather and fabric, as well as veneer and other natural woven products, often accented with marble, stone, slate, glass, ceramic, brass and/or hand-painted finishes. 

Major casegoods product categories include accents, home office, dining, bedroom and home entertainment furniture which are marketed under the Hooker Furniture brand name, as well as &#8220;private label&#8221; products marketed under a retailer&#8217;s brand name. Our casegoods are typically designed for and marketed in the upper-medium to lower high-end price range. 

Bradington-Young markets its products under the Bradington-Young brand name, offers a broad variety of residential leather and fabric upholstered furniture and specializes in leather reclining and motion chairs, sofas, club chairs and executive desk chairs. It offers numerous leather and fabric selections for domestically produced upholstered furniture, generally targeted at the upper price range. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Hooker Upholstery is an imported line of leather upholstery and is targeted at the upper-medium price points. It offers numerous leather and fabric selections and offers a broad variety of married cover options on stationary sofa groups, recliners, office chairs, club chairs, motion groups, and decorative ottomans. 

Sam Moore Furniture&#8217;s products, which are primarily domestically produced, are marketed under the Sam Moore brand name or private label and offer upscale occasional chairs, sofas and other seating with an emphasis on fabric-to-frame customization. Sam Moore offers many different styles of upholstered products in numerous fabric and leather selections, including customer supplied upholstery coverings. Sam Moore&#8217;s products are targeted at the upper-medium and upper price ranges. 

H Contract&#8217;s and Homeware&#8217;s products are sourced from Hooker, Sam Moore or domestic or international OEM manufacturers. 

Marketing 

The product life cycle for home furnishings has shortened in recent years as consumers have demanded innovative new features, functionality, style, finishes and fabrics. New styles in each of our product categories are designed and developed semi-annually to replace discontinued products and collections, and in some cases, to enter new product or style categories. Our collaborative product design process begins with the marketing team identifying customer needs and trends and then conceptualizing product ideas and features. A variety of sketches are produced, usually by independent designers, from which prototype furniture pieces are built. We invite some of our independent sales representatives and a representative group of retailers to view and critique these prototypes. Based on this input, we may modify the designs and then prepare samples for full-scale production. We generally introduce new product styles at the International Home Furnishings Market held each Fall and Spring in High Point, N.C., and support new product launches with promotions, public relations, product brochures, point-of-purchase consumer catalogs and materials and online marketing through our websites, as well as through popular social media venues. We schedule purchases of imported furniture and the production of domestically manufactured upholstered furniture based upon actual and anticipated orders and product acceptance at the Spring and Fall markets. The flexibility of both our global-sourcing business model and the quick delivery times provided by our domestic upholstery manufacturing presence gives us the ability to offer a range of styles, items and price points to a variety of retailers serving a range of consumer markets. Based on sales and market acceptance, we believe our products represent good value, and that the style and quality of our furniture compares favorably with more premium-priced products. Our all-digital marketing strategy is centered on directly engaging the consumer, to connect them with Hooker Furniture brands and direct them to our retail partners. 

Warehousing and Distribution 

We sell our products through a large number of distribution channels which include independent furniture retailers, department stores, national membership clubs, regional chain stores, catalog merchandisers, specialty retailers, designers and E-retailers, design firms and senior living facilities. 

We distribute furniture to retailers from our distribution centers and warehouses in Virginia and North Carolina and directly from Asia via our container direct programs. We have a warehousing and distribution arrangement in China with our largest supplier of imported products and a consolidation warehouse in Vietnam, which allows customers to mix containers from several Vietnamese factories. In addition, we also ship containers directly from a variety of other suppliers in Asia. 

We strive to provide imported and domestically produced furniture on-demand for our dealers. During fiscal year 2016, we shipped 80% of all casegoods orders and approximately 61% of all upholstery orders within 30 days of order receipt. It is our policy and industry practice to allow order cancellation for casegoods up to the time of shipment; therefore, customer orders for casegoods are not firm. However, domestically produced upholstered products are predominantly custom-built and shipped within six to eight weeks after an order is received and consequently, cannot be cancelled once the leather or fabric has been cut. 

For imported products, we generally negotiate firm pricing with foreign suppliers in U.S. Dollars, typically for a term of at least one year. We accept the exposure to exchange rate movements beyond these negotiated periods. We do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk but could choose to do so in the future. Since we transact our imported product purchases in U.S. Dollars, a relative decline in the value of the U.S. Dollar could increase the price we pay for imported products beyond the negotiated periods. We generally expect to reflect substantially all of the effects of any price increases from suppliers in the prices we charge for imported products. However, these price changes could adversely impact sales volume and profit margin during affected periods. Conversely, a relative increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar could decrease the cost of imported products and favorably impact net sales and profit margins during affected periods.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Working Capital Practices 

&#160;

The following describes our working capital practices: 

&#160;

Inventory: We generally import casegoods inventory and certain upholstery items in amounts that enable us to meet the delivery requirements of our customers, our internal in-stock goals and minimum &#160; purchase requirements from our sourcing partners. We do not carry significant amounts of domestically produced upholstery inventory, as most of these products are built to order and are shipped shortly after their manufacture. 

&#160;

Accounts receivable: Substantially all of our trade accounts receivable are due from retailers and dealers that sell residential home furnishings, which consist of a large number of entities with a broad geographic dispersion. We perform credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral. For qualified customers, we offer payment terms, generally requiring payment 30 days from shipment. However, we may offer extended payment terms in certain circumstances, including to promote sales of our products. Sam Moore factored substantially all of its accounts receivable prior to implementing our ERP in May 2015 and Bradington-Young currently factors substantially all of its receivables, in most cases on a non-recourse basis; however, in order to realize operational efficiencies, cost savings, leverage best practices and present a single face to our customers, we plan to end our factoring relationship as our new Enterprise Resource Planning system (&#8220;ERP&#8221;) becomes fully operational for Bradington-Young in the first half of fiscal 2017. However, given our current and projected liquidity, we do not expect the transition to have a material adverse effect on our future liquidity. 

&#160;

Accounts payable: Payment for our imported products warehoused first in Asia is due fourteen days after our quality audit inspections are complete and the vendor invoice is presented. Payment for goods which are shipped to Hooker FOB Origin is due upon proof of lading onto a US-bound vessel and invoice presentation. Payment terms for domestic raw materials and non-inventory related charges vary, but are generally 30 days from invoice date. 

&#160;

Order Backlog 

&#160;

At January 31, 2016, our backlog of unshipped orders for our casegoods, upholstery and all other segments were as follows:

&#160; $ 22,423 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4.7 &#160; &#160; $ 24,137 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5.2 &#160; 

&#160;

We consider unshipped order backlogs to be one helpful indicator of sales for the upcoming 30-day period, but because of our relatively quick delivery and our cancellation policies (discussed under Warehousing and Distribution, above), we do not consider order backlogs to be a reliable indicator of expected long-term business. 

&#160;

Seasonality 

In general, the summer months are the slowest for our business, especially for leather upholstery sales in our upholstery segment. We believe that consumer home furnishings purchases are driven by an array of factors, including general economic conditions such as: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#167; 

consumer confidence; 

&#160; 

&#167; 

availability of consumer credit; 

&#160; 

&#167; 

energy and other commodity prices; and 

&#160; 

&#167; 

housing and mortgage markets; 

&#160;

as well as lifestyle-driven factors such as changes in: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#167; 

fashion trends; 

&#160; 

&#167; 

disposable income; and 

&#160; 

&#167; 

household formation and turnover. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Competition 

The furniture industry is highly competitive and includes a large number of foreign and domestic manufacturers and importers, none of which dominates the market in our price points. While the markets in which we compete include a large number of relatively small and medium-sized manufacturers, certain competitors have substantially greater sales volumes and financial resources than we do. U.S. imports of furniture produced overseas, such as from China and other Asian countries, have stabilized in recent years. 

The primary competitive factors for home furnishings in our price points include price, style, availability, service, quality and durability. We believe our design capabilities, ability to import and/or manufacture upholstered furniture, product value, longstanding customer and supplier relationships, significant sales, distribution and inventory capabilities, ease of ordering, financial strength, experienced management and customer support are significant competitive advantages. 

Environmental Matters 

As a part of our business operations, our manufacturing sites generate both non-hazardous and hazardous wastes; the treatment, storage, transportation and disposal of which are subject to various local, state and national laws relating to environmental protection. We are in various stages of investigation, remediation or monitoring of alleged or acknowledged contamination at current or former manufacturing sites for soil and groundwater contamination, none of which we believe is material to our results of operations or financial position. Our policy is to record monitoring commitments and environmental liabilities when expenses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The costs associated with our environmental responsibilities, compliance with federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or costs otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, capital expenditures or competitive position. 

Hooker Furniture is committed to protecting the environment. We participate in a voluntary, industry-wide environmental stewardship program referred to as Enhancing Furniture&#8217;s Environmental Culture or &#8220;EFEC.&#8221; In September of fiscal 2010, the American Home Furnishings Alliance granted us initial EFEC registration, recognizing the successful company-wide implementation of the EFEC program, which includes the successful reduction of water and electricity usage, recycling efforts to reduce landfill use and the implementation of a community outreach program. Since our initial registration we have: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#167; 

recycled over 850,000 pounds of paper, cardboard and plastic; 

&#160; 

&#167; 

reduced electricity usage by an average of 5% per year; and 

&#160; 

&#167; 

reduced natural gas usage by an average of 4% per year. 

&#160;

We are inspected annually by the EFEC organization in order to maintain our registration under this program and are currently certified through January 2017. 

Employees 

As of January 31, 2016, we had 645 full-time employees of which 222 were employed in the casegoods segment, 414 in the upholstery segment and 9 in the All Other segment. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. 

Patents and Trademarks 

The Hooker Furniture, Bradington-Young and Sam Moore trade names represent many years of continued business. We believe these trade names are well-recognized and associated with quality and service in the furniture industry. We also own a number of patents and trademarks, both domestically and internationally, none of which is considered to be material. 

Hooker, the &#8220;H&#8221; logo, Bradington-Young, the &#8220;B-Y&#8221; logo, Sam Moore, H Contract, Homeware, Sam Moore Furniture Industries, Sam Moore Furniture, LLC, America&#8217;s Premier Chair Specialist, America&#8217;s Chairmaker for over 70 Years, Rhapsody, Sanctuary, M&#233;lange, Corsica, Solana, Palisade, Beladora, Classique, Abbott Place, Grandover, North Hampton, Small Office Solutions, Preston Ridge, Waverly Place, Sectional Seating by Design, Accommodations, SmartLiving ShowPlace, SmartWorks Home Office, SmartWorks Home Center and The Great Entertainers are trade names or trademarks of Hooker Furniture Corporation. 

Governmental Regulations 

Our company is subject to U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations in the areas of safety, health, employment and environmental pollution controls, as well as U.S. and international trade laws and regulations. We are also subject to foreign laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not in the past had any material effect on our earnings, capital expenditures, or competitive position in excess of those affecting others in our industry; however, the effect of compliance in the future cannot be predicted. We believe we are in material compliance with applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

The Home Meridian Business 

Some significant differences between the Hooker and Home Meridian businesses include: 

Sales. 100% of HMI&#8217;s sales are sourced from Asia, while only about 70% of Hooker&#8217;s are, with the balance being domestically-produced upholstery products. However, both businesses&#8217; sales are weighted towards casegoods products. Approximately 70% of HMI&#8217;s sales are container direct sales, while less than 10% of Hooker&#8217;s sales fall in this category. HMI&#8217;s sales tend to be lower margin, higher volume sales, while Hooker&#8217;s tend to be the opposite. In terms of seasonality, Hooker&#8217;s sales tend to be the slowest in the summer months, while HMI&#8217;s sales are slowest early in the calendar year. 

Customers . A significant part of HMI&#8217;s business is dependent upon mega accounts and key customers. Though the loss of any one of HMI&#8217;s largest customers would have an impact on the business, only two of the largest customers individually account for more than 10% of total sales. While Hooker and HMI share some larger customers, most of Hooker&#8217;s sales are derived from independent furniture stores and small chains. Average order size for Hooker product is much smaller, due to warehouse oriented business, which services smaller stores and in many cases, individual consumer orders. Many HMI orders are shipped to customer distribution centers for distribution to the customers&#8217; stores. Both companies have a significant and growing ecommerce operation; however HMI&#8217;s is larger and more advanced on an operational basis. 

Asian operations. Both companies have Asian operations.
