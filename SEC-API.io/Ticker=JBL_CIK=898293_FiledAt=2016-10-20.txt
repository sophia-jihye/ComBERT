Industry Background 

The industry in which we operate has historically been composed of companies that provide a range of design and manufacturing services to companies that utilize electronics components. The industry experienced rapid change and growth through the 1990s as an increasing number of companies chose to outsource an increasing portion, and, in some cases, all of their manufacturing. In mid-2001, the industry&#146;s revenue declined as a result of significant cut-backs in customer production requirements, which was consistent with the overall downturn in the technology sector. In response to this downturn in the technology sector, we implemented restructuring programs to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with the geographic production demands of our customers. Industry revenues generally began to stabilize in 2003 and companies began to turn more to outsourcing versus internal manufacturing. In addition, the number of industries serviced, as well as the market penetration in certain industries, by electronic manufacturing service providers has increased over the past several years. In mid-2008, the industry&#146;s revenue declined when a deteriorating macro-economic environment resulted in illiquidity in global credit markets and a significant economic downturn in the North American, European and Asian markets. In response to this downturn, and the termination of our business relationship with BlackBerry Limited, we implemented additional restructuring programs, including the restructuring plans that were approved by our Board of Directors in fiscal year 2014 (the &#147;2014 Restructuring Plan&#148;) and in fiscal year 2013 (the &#147;2013 Restructuring Plan&#148;), to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with the geographic production demands of our customers. 

We continue to try to monitor the current economic environment and its potential impact on both the customers that we serve as well as our end-markets and closely manage our costs and capital resources so that we can respond appropriately as circumstances continue to change. Over the longer term, however, we believe the factors driving our customers and potential customers to utilize our industry&#146;s services include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Reduced Product Cost. Manufacturing service providers are often able to manufacture products at a reduced total cost to companies. These cost advantages result from higher utilization of capacity because of diversified product demand and, generally, a greater focus on elements of manufacturing cost. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Accelerated Product Time-to-Market and Time-to-Volume. Manufacturing service providers are often able to deliver accelerated production start-ups and achieve high efficiencies in transferring new products into production. Providers are also able to more rapidly scale production for changing markets and to position themselves in global locations that serve the leading world markets. With increasingly shorter product life cycles, these key services allow new products to be sold in the marketplace in an accelerated time frame. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Access to Advanced Design and Manufacturing Technologies. Customers gain access to additional advanced technologies in manufacturing processes, as well as product and production design. Product and production design services may offer customers significant improvements in the performance, cost, time-to-market and manufacturability of their products. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Improved Inventory Management and Purchasing Power. Manufacturing service providers are often able to more efficiently manage both procurement and inventory, and have demonstrated proficiency in purchasing components at improved pricing due to the scale of their operations and continuous interaction with the materials marketplace. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Reduced Capital Investment in Manufacturing. Companies are increasingly seeking to lower their investment in inventory, facilities and equipment used in manufacturing in order to allocate capital to other activities such as sales and marketing and research and development (&#147;R&#38;D&#148;). This strategic shift in capital deployment has contributed to increased demand for and interest in outsourcing to external manufacturing service providers. Our Strategy 

We are focused on expanding our position as one of the leading providers of worldwide electronic manufacturing services and solutions. To achieve this objective, we continue to pursue the following strategies: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Establish and Maintain Long-Term Customer Relationships. Our core strategy is to establish and maintain long-term relationships with leading companies in expanding industries with size and growth characteristics that can benefit from highly automated, continuous flow manufacturing on a global scale. Over the past several years, we have made concentrated efforts to diversify our industry sectors and customer base. As a result of these efforts, we have experienced business growth from existing customers and from new customers. Additionally, our acquisitions have contributed to our business growth. We focus on maintaining long-term relationships with our customers and seek to expand these relationships to include additional product lines and services. In addition, we have a focused effort to identify and develop relationships with new customers who meet our profile. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Utilize Business Units. Most of our business units are dedicated to one customer and operate by primarily utilizing dedicated production equipment, production workers, supervisors, buyers, planners and engineers. We believe our customer centric business units promote increased responsiveness to our customers&#146; needs, particularly as a customer relationship grows to multiple production locations. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Expand Parallel Global Production. Our ability to produce the same product on a global scale is a significant requirement of our customers. We believe that parallel global production is a key strategy to reduce obsolescence risk and secure the lowest landed costs while simultaneously supplying products of equivalent or comparable quality throughout the world. Consistent with this strategy, we have established or acquired operations in Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, The Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Scotland, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Ukraine and Vietnam to increase our European, Asian and Latin American presence. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Offer Systems Assembly, Direct-Order Fulfillment and Configure-to-Order Services. Our systems assembly, direct-order fulfillment and configure-to-order services allow our customers to reduce product cost and risk of product obsolescence by reducing total work-in-process and finished goods inventory. These services are available at all of our manufacturing locations. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Offer Design Services. We offer a wide spectrum of value-add design services for products that we manufacture for our customers. We provide these services to enhance our relationships with current customers by allowing them the flexibility to utilize complementary design services to achieve improvements in performance, cost, time-to-market and manufacturability, as well as to help develop relationships with new customers. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Pursue Selective Acquisition Opportunities. Traditionally, EMS companies have acquired manufacturing capacity from customers to drive growth, expand footprint and gain new customers. More recently, our acquisition strategy has expanded beyond focusing on acquisition opportunities presented by companies divesting internal manufacturing operations to include opportunities to acquire DMS and EMS competitors who are focused on our key growth areas which include specialized manufacturing in key markets, materials technology, design operations and/or other acquisition opportunities complementary to our services offerings. The primary goal of our acquisition strategy is to complement our current capabilities, diversify our business into new industry sectors and with new customers and expand the scope of the services we can offer to our customers. As the scope of our acquisition opportunities expands, the risks associated with our acquisitions expand as well, both in terms of the amount of risk we face and the scope of such risks. See &#147;Risk Factors &#150; We have on occasion not achieved, and may not in the future achieve, expected profitability from our acquisitions.&#148; Our Approach to Manufacturing 

In order to achieve high levels of manufacturing performance, we have adopted the following approaches: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Business Units. Most of our business units are dedicated to one customer and are empowered to formulate strategies tailored to individual customer needs. Most of our business units have dedicated production lines consisting of equipment, production workers, supervisors, buyers, planners and engineers. Under certain circumstances, a production line may include more than one business unit in order to maximize resource utilization. Business units have direct responsibility for manufacturing results and time-to-volume production, promoting a sense of individual commitment and ownership. The business unit approach is modular and enables us to grow incrementally without disrupting the operations of other business units. Business unit management reviews the customer financial information in order to assess whether or not the business units are meeting their designated responsibilities and to ensure that the daily execution of manufacturing activities are being effectively managed. The business units aggregate into operating segments based on the economic profiles of the services performed, including manufacturing capabilities, market share strategy, margins, return on capital and risk profiles. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Automated Continuous Flow. We use a highly automated, continuous flow approach where different pieces of equipment are joined directly or by conveyor to create an in-line assembly process. This process is in contrast to a batch approach, where individual pieces of assembly equipment are operated as freestanding work-centers. The elimination of waiting time prior to sequential operations results in faster manufacturing, which improves production efficiencies and quality control, and reduces inventory work-in-process. Continuous flow manufacturing provides cost reductions and quality improvement when applied to volume manufacturing. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Computer Integration. We support all aspects of our manufacturing activities with advanced computerized control and monitoring systems. Component inspection and vendor quality are monitored electronically in real-time. Materials planning, purchasing, stockroom and shop floor control systems are supported through a computerized Manufacturing Resource Planning system, providing customers with a continuous ability to monitor material availability and track work-in-process on a real-time basis. Manufacturing processes are supported by a real-time, computerized statistical process control system, whereby customers can remotely access our computer systems to monitor real-time yields, inventory positions, work-in-process status and vendor quality data. See &#147;Technology&#148; and &#147;Risk Factors &#150; Any delay in the implementation of our information systems could disrupt our operations and cause unanticipated increases in our costs.&#148; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Supply Chain Management. We make available an electronic commerce system/electronic data interchange and web-based tools for our customers and suppliers to implement a variety of supply chain management programs. Most of our customers utilize these tools to share demand and product forecasts and deliver purchase orders. We use these tools with most of our suppliers for just-in-time delivery, supplier-managed inventory and consigned supplier-managed inventory. &#160;

Our Design Services 

We offer a wide spectrum of value-add design services for products that we manufacture for our customers. We provide these services to enhance our relationships with current customers and to help develop relationships with our new customers. We offer the following design services: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Electronic Design. Our Electronic Design team provides electronic circuit design services, including application-specific integrated circuit design, firmware development and rapid prototyping services. These services have been used by our customers for a variety of products including smart phones and accessory products, notebook and personal computers, servers, radio frequency products, video set-top boxes, optical communications products, communication and broadband products, automotive and consumer appliance controls. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Industrial Design Services. Our Industrial Design team designs the &#147;look and feel&#148; of the plastic and metal enclosures that house the electro-mechanics, including the printed circuit board assemblies (&#147;PCBA&#148;). &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Mechanical Design. Our Mechanical Design team specializes in three-dimensional mechanical design with the analysis of electronic, electro-mechanical and optical assemblies using state of the art modeling and analytical tools.

We believe that our CAD services result in PCBA designs that are optimized for manufacturability and cost efficiencies, and accelerate the product&#146;s time-to-market and time-to-volume production. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Product Validation. Our Product Validation team provides complete product and process validation. This includes product system test, product safety, regulatory compliance and reliability test. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Manufacturing Test Solution Development. Our Manufacturing Test Solution Development team works as an integral function to the design team to embed design for testability and minimization of capital and resource investment for mass manufacturing. The use of software driven instrumentation and test process design and management has enhanced our customer product quality and less human dependent test processes. The full electronic test data-log of customer products has allowed customer product test traceability and visibility throughout the manufacturing test process. Our teams are strategically staffed to support Jabil customers for all development projects, including turnkey system design and design for manufacturing activities. See &#147;Risk Factors &#150; We may not be able to maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing process expertise.&#148; 

We are exposed to different or greater potential liabilities from our design services than those we face from our regular manufacturing services. See &#147;Risk Factors &#150; Our design services and turnkey solutions offerings may result in additional exposure to product liability, intellectual property infringement and other claims, in addition to the business risk of being unable to produce the revenues necessary to profit from these services.&#148; 

Our Systems Assembly, Test, Direct-Order Fulfillment and Configure-to-Order Services 

We offer systems assembly, test, direct-order fulfillment and configure-to-order services to our customers. Our systems assembly services extend our range of assembly activities to include assembly of higher-level sub-systems and systems incorporating multiple PCBAs. We maintain systems assembly capacity to meet the demands of our customers. In addition, we provide testing services, based on quality assurance programs developed with our customers, of the PCBAs, sub-systems and systems products that we manufacture. Our quality assurance programs include circuit testing under various environmental conditions to try to ensure that our products meet or exceed required customer specifications. We also offer direct-order fulfillment and configure-to-order services for delivery of final products we assemble for our customers. 

Technology 

We believe that our manufacturing and testing technologies are among the most advanced in the industry. Through our R&#38;D efforts, we intend to continue to offer our customers among the most advanced highly automated, continuous flow manufacturing process technologies for precise and aesthetic mechanical components and system assembly. These technologies include automation, electronic interconnection, advanced polymer and metal material science, automated tooling, single/multi-shot injection molding, stamping, multi-axis Computer Numerical Control, spray painting, vacuum metallization, physical vapor deposition, digital printing, anodization, thermal-plastic composite formation, plastic with embedded electronics, in-mold labeling, metal cover with insert-molded or die-casting features for assembly, seamless display cover with integrated touch sensor, plastic cover with insert-molded glass lens and advanced testing solutions. In addition to our R&#38;D activities, we are continuously making refinements to our existing manufacturing processes in connection with providing manufacturing services to our customers. See &#147;Risk Factors &#150; We may not be able to maintain our engineering, technological and manufacturing process expertise.&#148; 

&#160;

Research and Development 

To meet our customers&#146; increasingly sophisticated needs, we continuously engage in product research and design activities. These activities include electronic design, mechanical design, software design, system level design, material processing research (including plastics, metal, glass and ceramic), component and product validation, as well as other design and process development related activities necessary to manufacture our customers&#146; products in the most cost-effective and consistent manner. We are engaged in advanced research and platform designs for products including: mobile internet devices and associated accessories, multi-media tablets, two-way radios, consumer lifestyles products, health care and life science products, server and storage products, set-top and digital home products, printing products and wearable technologies products. These activities focus on assisting our customers in product creation and manufacturing solutions. For fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, we expended $32.0 million, $27.6 million and $28.6 million, respectively, on R&#38;D activities. 

Financial Information about Business Segments 

We derive revenue from providing comprehensive electronics design, production and product management services. Management evaluates performance and allocates resources on a segment basis. At August 31, 2016, our reportable operating segments consisted of two segments &#150; EMS and DMS. See Note 13 &#150; &#147;Concentration of Risk and Segment Data&#148; to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Customers and Marketing 

Our core strategy is to establish and maintain long-term relationships with leading companies in expanding industries with the size and growth characteristics that can benefit from highly automated, continuous flow manufacturing on a global scale. A small number of customers and significant industry sectors have historically comprised a major portion of our net revenue. The table below sets forth the respective portion of net revenue for the applicable period attributable to our customers who individually accounted for approximately 10% or more of our net revenue in any respective period: 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended August 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2016 &#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; Apple, Inc.

&#160; &#160; &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160;

&#160;

&#160; In fiscal year 2016, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 49% of our net revenue and 85 customers accounted for approximately 90% of our net revenue. We currently depend, and expect to continue to depend, upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue and upon their growth, viability and financial stability. See &#147;Risk Factors &#150; Because we depend on a limited number of customers, a reduction in sales to any one of those customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue,&#148; &#147;Risk Factors &#150; Consolidation in industries that utilize our services may adversely affect our business&#148; and Note 13 &#150; &#147;Concentration of Risk and Segment Data&#148; to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

We have made concentrated efforts to diversify our industry sectors and customer base, including but not limited to increasing our net revenue in the EMS and DMS segments through acquisitions and organic growth. Our Business Unit Managers and Directors, supported by executive management, work to expand existing customer relationships through the addition of product lines and services. These individuals also identify and attempt to develop relationships with new customers who meet our profile. This profile includes financial stability, need for technology-driven turnkey manufacturing, anticipated unit volume and long-term relationship stability. Unlike traditional sales managers, our Business Unit Managers and Directors are responsible for ongoing management of production for their customers. 

International Operations 

A key element of our strategy is to provide localized production of global products for leading companies in the major consuming regions of the Americas, Europe, Asia and Africa. Consistent with this strategy, we have established or acquired operations in Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, The Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Scotland, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Ukraine and Vietnam. 

&#160;

Our European operations provide European and multinational customers with design and manufacturing services to satisfy their local market consumption requirements. 

Our Asian operations enable us to provide local design and manufacturing services and a more competitive cost structure in the Asian market; and serve as a low cost manufacturing source for new and existing customers in the global market. 

Our Latin American operations located in Mexico enable us to provide a low cost manufacturing source for new and existing customers principally in the U.S. marketplace. Our Latin American operations located in South America provide customers with manufacturing services to satisfy their local market consumption requirements. 

Our African operations, located in South Africa, provide energy consulting and monitoring services and products to telecommunication customers throughout Africa. 

See &#147;Risk Factors &#150; We derive a substantial majority of our revenue from our international operations, which may be subject to a number of risks and often require more management time and expense to achieve profitability than our domestic operations&#148; and &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#148; 

Competition 

Our business is highly competitive. We compete against numerous domestic and foreign electronic manufacturing service providers and design providers, including Benchmark Electronics, Inc., Celestica Inc., Flextronics International Ltd., Hon-Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Plexus Corp. and Sanmina Corporation. Our diversified manufacturing services segment competes against numerous domestic and foreign providers, including AptarGroup, Inc., Berry Plastics Group, Inc., Catcher Technology Co., Ltd., Gerresheimer AG, Quanta Computer, Inc. and Zeniya Aluminum Engineering, Ltd. In addition, past consolidation in our industry has resulted in larger and more geographically diverse competitors who have significant combined resources with which to compete against us. Also, we may in the future encounter competition from other large electronic manufacturers, and manufacturers that are focused solely on design and manufacturing services, that are selling, or may begin to sell electronic manufacturing services. Most of our competitors have international operations and significant financial resources and some have substantially greater manufacturing, R&#38;D and marketing resources than we have. 

We also face competition from the manufacturing operations of our current and potential customers, who are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally against the advantages of outsourcing. In the past, some of our customers moved a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to more fully utilize their excess internal manufacturing capacity. 

We may be operating at a cost disadvantage compared to competitors who (a) have greater direct buying power from component suppliers, distributors and raw material suppliers, (b) have lower cost structures as a result of their geographic location or the services they provide, (c) are willing to make sales or provide services at lower margins than we do (including relationships where our competitors are willing to accept a lower margin from certain of their customers for whom they perform other higher margin business) or (d) have increased their vertical capabilities, thereby potentially providing them greater cost savings. As a result, competitors may procure a competitive advantage and obtain business from our customers. Our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection. In addition, companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may enter our market or increase their competition with us. We also expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products or services, to reduce the sales prices of their current products or services and to introduce new products or services that may offer greater performance and improved pricing. Any of these developments could cause a decline in our sales, loss of market acceptance of our products or services, compression of our profits or loss of our market share. See &#147;Risk Factors &#150; We compete with numerous other diversified manufacturing service providers, electronic manufacturing services and design providers and others.&#148; 

Backlog 

Our order backlog at August 31, 2016 and 2015 was valued at approximately $4.5 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively. Our order backlog is expected to be filled within the current fiscal year. Although our backlog consists of firm purchase orders, the level of backlog at any particular time may not be necessarily indicative of future sales. Given the nature of our relationships with our customers, we frequently allow our customers to cancel or reschedule deliveries, and therefore, backlog is often not a meaningful indicator of future financial results. Although we may seek to negotiate fees to cover the costs of such cancellations or rescheduling, we may not always be successful in such negotiations. See &#147;Risk Factors &#150; Most of our customers do not commit to long-term production schedules, or they may cancel their orders, change production quantities, delay production or change their sourcing strategy which makes it difficult for us to schedule production and capital expenditures, and to maximize the efficiency of our manufacturing capacity.&#148; 

&#160;

Seasonality 

Production levels for a portion of the DMS segment are subject to seasonal influences. We may realize greater net revenue during our first fiscal quarter due to higher demand for consumer related products manufactured in the DMS segment during the holiday selling season. 

Components Procurement 

We procure components from a broad group of suppliers, determined on an assembly-by-assembly basis. Almost all of the products we manufacture require one or more components that are only available from a single source. Some of these components are allocated from time to time in response to supply shortages. In some cases, supply shortages will substantially curtail production of all assemblies using a particular component. A supply shortage can also increase our cost of goods sold, as a result of our having to pay higher prices for components in limited supply, and cause us to have to redesign or reconfigure products to accommodate a substitute component. In the past there have been industry wide conditions, natural disasters and global events that have caused material shortages. Such circumstances have produced insignificant levels of short-term interruption of our operations, but they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the future. Our production of a customer&#146;s product could be negatively impacted by any quality, reliability or availability issues with any of our component suppliers. The financial condition of our suppliers could affect their ability to supply us with components and their ability to satisfy any warranty obligations they may have, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. See &#147;Risk Factors &#150; We depend on a limited number of suppliers for components that are critical to our manufacturing processes. A shortage of these components or an increase in their price could interrupt our operations and reduce our profit, increase our inventory carrying costs, increase our risk of exposure to inventory obsolescence and cause us to purchase components of a lesser quality.&#148; 

Proprietary Rights 

We regard certain aspects of our design, production and product services as proprietary intellectual property. To protect our proprietary rights, we rely largely upon a combination of intellectual property laws, non-disclosure agreements with our customers, employees, and suppliers and our internal security systems, policies and procedures. Although we take steps to protect our intellectual property, misappropriation may still occur. We have not historically sought patent protection for many of our proprietary processes, designs or other patentable intellectual property. We currently have a relatively modest number of solely owned and/or jointly held patents for various innovations. We believe that our research and design activities, along with developments relating thereto, may result in growth of our patent portfolio and its importance to us, particularly as we expand our business activities. Other factors significant to our proprietary rights include the knowledge and experience of our management and personnel and our ability to develop, enhance and market manufacturing services. 

We license some technology and intellectual property rights from third parties that we use in providing some of our design, production and product management services to our customers. Generally, the license agreements which govern such third party technology and intellectual property rights grant us the right to use the subject technology anywhere in the world and will terminate upon a material breach by us. In the event of termination, we may not be successful in developing alternatives.
