Industry Background 

Trends Impacting the Video Content Creation and Distribution Markets 

Video traffic is growing at a significant rate. The market trends that are fundamentally impacting video content creation and distribution include the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Increasing Number of Video Capture Devices . Traditionally, HD video has been captured using large, power intensive and expensive dedicated devices. Recent improvements in HD video capture quality, device size and cost have allowed video capture functionality to be incorporated into a broad range of devices. Today, smartphones, tablets, wearable cameras, automotive aftermarket cameras, IP security cameras and UAVs, are increasingly including both HD video capture and high-quality still image capture. In addition to the significant growth in the number of devices, new applications are emerging for video capture devices. Very small HD cameras, or wearable cameras, incorporating connectivity to a smart phone or internet are being developed for new applications such as law enforcement, personal security and social media. In some regions of the world, such as China, Russia, South Korea and Taiwan, video capture devices are being added as aftermarket accessories to automobiles and connected to on-board recording systems to capture video in the event of an incident, which assists the legal and insurance claims process following an accident. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Growing User-Generated Content . Historically, most video content was created by media companies, professional studios and large broadcasters that possessed the equipment, expertise and other resources necessary to produce and distribute such programming. However, with the proliferation of low-cost digital video devices and greater penetration of broadband connectivity, individuals are playing a greater role in content creation and distribution. Websites such as YouTube and Facebook have enabled an effective new channel to widely distribute, store and display video and other rich media. In addition to user-created videos, other user-generated content such as video conferencing and video instant messaging through services provided by Apple, Inc., Google Inc. and Skype, among others, are becoming increasingly popular. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Broadband Penetration Enabling the Proliferation of the Video Cloud . The adoption of high-speed broadband and the proliferation of connected devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktop computers and connected televisions have allowed consumers to more easily download and share IP video accessed upon demand through the video cloud. The video cloud has led to new business models based on personal content such as streaming video provided by services like YouTube. Additionally, consumers are leveraging the video cloud for security by utilizing an IP camera and cloud infrastructure to watch live HD video streaming on any web connected device. This video cloud application has enabled expansion of the connected home to include intelligent IP surveillance systems that detect activity and then stream encrypted HD video through secure servers and alert end users. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Advancements in Display Technology . The increasing proliferation of HD displays in television and in mobile connected devices such as laptops, smartphones and tablets is accelerating HD video content growth. This trend highlights the new paradigm of escalating consumer expectations of video quality, such that video is comparable to high-resolution still images, which drove the transition from standard definition to HD, and will drive the transition to ultra high-definition, or UHD. UHD is commonly referred to as 4K video, which supports up to 4096x2160 pixels per frame, more than four times greater resolution than the current Full HD standard, which supports up to 1920x1080 pixels per frame. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Requirement for Efficient Video Compression . HD video is increasingly a requirement for consumer video cameras, IP security cameras and for the broadcast of television programs, whether via cable, satellite or IP networks. Uncompressed HD video requires massive amounts of digital data to represent it, necessitating the need for video compression technology to reduce da ta rates for storage or for transmission of video over networks with limited bandwidth. In broadcast television, an upgrade of networks from H.264 video compression technology to the new high efficiency video coding, or HEVC, video compression technology w ould support the transition of consumers to 4K video. In consumer cameras, the efficiency of the encoding has a significant impact on video quality, recording time and battery life. In IP security cameras, encoding efficiency is important for realizing the highest image quality possible over bandwidth-limited networks, and for minimizing the costs of cloud-based storage of video content. Additionally, the ability to actively adapt the encoding bit-rate based on changing network bandwidth availability provid es the highest possible video quality and enables network traffic management. As consumers increasingly view video on smartphones and tablets, in addition to traditional televisions and PCs, the ability to trans-rate video content in real time to the vario us resolutions and bit-rates supported by smartphones or tablets is essential. &#160;

Evolving Requirements for Video Capture and Distribution 

Evolving requirements for cameras and broadcast infrastructure equipment typically center around video definition and frame rates, ability to capture high-quality still images and video, advanced video features, analytics, and transcoding capability: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Higher Definition and Higher Frame Rates . The demand for enhanced video resolution has been increasing in both the camera and infrastructure markets. Consumers expect video quality to be closer to high-resolution still images, which continues to drive the transition from standard definition to Full HD and beyond. Similarly, as new display technologies enable higher resolutions and higher frame rates, we believe consumer demand will drive the requirement for UHD or 4K video capture and transmission. In the market for wearable sports cameras, for example, resolution and frame rate have been the primary factor in consumers&#8217; purchasing decisions. In the infrastructure market, consumer demand for viewing Full HD content has prompted broadcasters to seek high-performance solutions. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Ability to Capture High-Quality Still Images and Video . Historically, consumers have purchased devices that either provide high-quality image capture or record high-quality video. This was the result of consumer preference, as reasonably priced and sized devices would provide only one of those attributes. However, as a result of technological improvements, consumer devices that deliver both attributes have proliferated to the point that a pure video capture device or still image capture device is becoming uncommon. Increasingly, devices are able to simultaneously capture HD video and high-quality still images without adversely impacting the quality of either. We believe devices that can capture Full HD video while encoding a second mobile resolution video for uploading to the Internet or streaming over a Wi-Fi network will expand consumer demand for specialized video capture devices. Additionally advanced low-light processing including high dynamic range and high-ISO processing will continue to improve image quality even in challenging lighting conditions. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Connectivity . Integrated wireless capability using wireless links such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi is becoming an increasingly prevalent feature across many classes of video capture devices. Consumers want to watch, control and capture real-time video using their smartphones as the remote control and viewer for wirelessly enabled wearable and sports cameras. Additionally, rather than storing images and video to local media and transferring to a computer later, consumers are demanding the ability to wirelessly transfer and share their video content to websites such as YouTube, Facebook and other online media albums. In video security applications, connectivity to cloud services allows users to monitor surveillance video in real-time on their smartphones or tablets. The storage of video in the cloud also provides protection against theft of the video content and enables users the capability to play back the stored video. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Ability to Deliver Feature-Rich Video . The addition of de-warping capability allows cameras to utilize a wide angle or &#8220;fish eye&#8221; lens to cover a wide viewing area. In security applications this capability can allow a single camera to replace multiple cameras and may also eliminate the need for mechanical pan-tilt-zoom in the cameras. In automotive markets, the ability to combine and display images captured by multiple cameras can allow the automotive camera recorder to capture and display images from the front, rear and sides of the car. Our wide dynamic range, or WDR, and high dynamic range, or HDR, processing capabilities provide greater dynamic range between the lightest and darkest areas of an image, permitting captured still images to reveal details that would otherwise be lost against a bright background. Our new hardware-accelerated three-dimensional image stabilization engine with rolling shutter correction enables stable video recording during high-motion conditions. In flying camera applications this potentially eliminates the need for a mechanical gimbal system. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Computer Vision. Computer vision represents the field of methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding images and high-dimensional data from the real world in order to automate and integrate a wide range of processes. Computer vision is becoming increasingly important for the development of int elligent video cameras. In the IP security camera market, computer vision can be used for various functions including motion detection to trigger alarms, and the counting and tracking of people. The application of computer vision may be also be used to hel p control the video encoding process to reduce video bitrates and maximize network efficiency. In the automotive market, the application of computer vision for advanced driver assistance systems, or ADAS, is increasingly being used to help drivers. Automot ive analytics functions include lane detection warning system (LDWS) and forward collision warning (FCW). In general, powerful CPUs and dedicated computer vision hardware are required to support the advanced analytics algorithms in video cameras. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Transcoding . The ability to decode and simultaneously re-encode high-quality video streams in multiple formats, which is commonly referred to as transcoding, using dense, small form factor and power-efficient hardware is a critical requirement for content providers and the video cloud. Given the differing connection speeds and capacities in current communication networks, broadcasters must be able to deliver video to consumers at varying bit-rate and quality levels. Furthermore, the significant increase in the number and types of devices capable of displaying video, from HD televisions to smartphones, requires broadcasters and other distributors to have the capability to provide video content in multiple formats and source resolutions.

The H2 SoC includes a 1.2 GHz quad-core ARM&#174; Cortex&#174;-A53 CPU with floating point and NEON TM to provide significant processing power for customer applications, including flying camera flight control, video analytics and wireless networking . The H2 SoC also supports live streaming of a second, low-delay, Full HD video stream for wireless monitoring and camera control. Fabricated in 14nm CMOS technology, the H2 SoC offers low power consumption, enabling 4KP60 resolution video cameras with small form factors. 

&#160;

Software Development Kit for Connectivity 

Our video streaming technology enables the camera&#8217;s image to be previewed on a smartphone, so the camera can be optimally set up and controlled remotely, or video can be streamed directly to Internet cloud services. To enable this functionality, end customers deploy our Wireless Camera Developer&#8217;s Kit, or the Kit, which enables the design of cameras that combine still photography and Full or Ultra HD video with wireless video streaming. The Kit leverages our multi-stream encoding capability which supports the recording of Full or Ultra HD video locally while simultaneously recording and streaming a second stream. This Kit enables accelerated end customer product development. 

Computer Vision Technology

Computer vision is a core technology that complements our image processing and video compression technology. Our current SoC solutions have up to four high performance ARM processors with NEON TM acceleration that provide a flexible and cost-effective manner in which to run computer vision algorithms. We are focusing on developing advanced computer vision algorithms and high-performance, low-power hardware acceleration. We believe that enhanced computer vision performance will be critical both to our current video markets, including IP security, wearable, and flying cameras , as well as future markets such as automotive OEM cameras. To accelerate our development, we acquired VisLab S.r.l. in June 2015. VisLab is a developer of computer vision algorithms and intelligent control systems for automotive applications. 

Customers 

We sell our solutions to leading ODMs and OEMs globally. We refer to ODMs as our customers and OEMs as our end customers, except as otherwise indicated or as the context otherwise requires. In the camera market, our video processing solutions are designed into products from leading OEMs including Axis Communications AB, Carcam Electronics Technology Co., Ltd., Dahua Technology Co., Ltd., Dajiang Innovation Technology Inc., Garmin Ltd., GoPro Inc., Hikvision Digital Technology Co., Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd., and Robert Bosch GmbH and affiliated entities, and XiaoYi Technology Co., Ltd., who source our solutions from ODMs including Asia Optical Co. Inc., Chicony Electronics Co., Ltd., DigiLife Technologies Co.Jabil Circuit, Inc., San Jet Technology Corp., Sercomm Corporation, and Sky Light Digital Ltd. In the infrastructure market, our solutions are designed into products from leading OEMs including Harmonic Inc., Motorola Mobility, Inc. (owned by Arris Group, Inc.) and Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson, who source our solutions from leading ODMs such as Plexus Corp. 

Sales to customers in Asia accounted for approximately 91%, 91% and 88% of our total revenue in the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As many of our OEM end customers or their ODM manufacturers are located in Asia, we anticipate that a majority of our revenue will continue to come from sales to customers in that region. Although a large percentage of our sales are made to customers in Asia, we believe that a significant number of the products designed by these customers and incorporating our SoCs are then sold to consumers globally. In fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, 97%, 94% and 88% of our revenue was attributable to sales of our solutions into the camera market, respectively, and 3%, 6% and 12% of our revenue was attributable to sales of our solutions into the infrastructure market, respectively. To date, all of our sales have been denominated in U.S. dollars. 

We work closely with our end customer OEMs and ODMs throughout their product design cycles that often last six to nine months for the camera market, though new products within the camera market may have longer design cycles, and 12 to 18 months for the infrastructure market. As a result, we are able to develop long-term relationships with our customers as our technology becomes embedded in their products. Consequently, we believe we are well positioned to not only be designed into our customers&#8217; current products, but also to continually develop next-generation, HD video and image processing solutions for their future products. 

The product life cycles in the camera market typically range from six to 18 months. The product life cycles in the infrastructure market typically range from two to five years, where new product introductions occur less frequently. For many of our solutions, early engagement with our customers&#8217; technical staff is necessary for success. To ensure an adequate level of early engagement, our application and development engineers work closely with our customers to adjust product specifications and add functionality into their products. 

Approximately 88%, 89% and 85% of our revenue was derived from sales through our logistics provider, Wintech, and through one large direct ODM customer, Chicony Electronics Co., Ltd., or Chicony, for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue. In fiscal year 2016, 2015 and 2014, sales directly and through our logistics providers to our five largest ODM and OEM customers collectively accounted for approximately 56%, 64% and 55% of our total revenues, respectively. In fiscal year 2016, 2015 and 2014, sales to our 10 largest ODM and OEM customers collectively accounted for approximately 69%, 74% and 67% of our total revenues, respectively. 

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

We sell our solutions worldwide using our direct sales force and our logistics providers. We have direct sales personnel covering the United States, Asia and Europe, and we operate sales offices in Santa Clara, California and Hong Kong, and business development offices in China, Japan, South Korea, Sweden and Taiwan. In addition, in each of these locations, other than Sweden, we employ a staff of field applications engineers to provide direct engineering support locally to our customers. 

Our sales cycles typically require a significant investment of time and a substantial expenditure of resources before we can realize revenue from the sale of our solutions, if any. Our typical sales cycle consists of a multi-month sales and development process involving our customers&#8217; system designers and management and our sales personnel and software engineers. If successful, this process culminates in a customer&#8217;s decision to use our solutions in its system, which we refer to as a design win. Our sales efforts are typically directed to the OEM of the product that will incorporate our video and image processing solution, but the eventual design and incorporation of our SoC into the product may be handled by an ODM on behalf of the OEM. Volume production may begin within six to 18 months after a design win, depending on the complexity of our customer&#8217;s product and other factors upon which we may have little or no influence. Once our solutions have been incorporated into a customer&#8217;s design, they are likely to be used for the life cycle of the customer&#8217;s product. Conversely, a design loss to a competitor will likely preclude any opportunity for future revenue from such customer&#8217;s product. 

The end markets into which we sell our products have seen significant changes as consumer preferences have evolved in response to new technologies. As a result, the composition of our revenue may differ meaningfully during periods of technology or consumer preference changes. For example, in fiscal year 2011, pocket video revenue represented approximately 40% of total revenue. The proliferation of smartphones and their ability to capture high-quality video and still images significantly impacted this market, decreasing pocket video cameras&#8217; contribution to approximately zero percent of total revenue in fiscal year 2013. Conversely, our revenue derived from the wearable sports camera market, the IP security camera market, the automotive aftermarket and UAV camera market supported total revenue growth in the 2012-2016 fiscal years despite the loss of our pocket video revenue. We expect shifts in consumer use of video capture to continue to change over time, as more specialized use cases emerge and video capture continues to proliferate. 

Our sales are generally made pursuant to purchase orders received approximately four to 18 weeks prior to the scheduled product delivery date, depending upon agreed terms with our customers and the current manufacturing lead time at the time the purchase order is received. These purchase orders may be cancelled without charge upon notification within an agreed period of time in advance of the delivery date, which may be as short as 30 days. Due to the scheduling requirements of our foundry, assembly and test contractors, we generally provide our contractors with our production forecasts and place firm orders for products with our suppliers up to 20 weeks prior to the anticipated delivery date, usually without a purchase order from our own customers. Our standard warranty provides that our SoCs containing defects in materials, workmanship or performance may be returned for a refund of the purchase price or for replacement, at our discretion. 

Manufacturing 

We employ a fabless business model and use third-party foundries and assembly and test contractors to manufacture, assemble and test our solutions. This outsourced manufacturing approach allows us to focus our resources on the design, sales and marketing of our solutions and avoid the cost associated with owning and operating our own manufacturing facility. Our engineers work closely with foundries and other contractors to increase yields, lower manufacturing costs and improve quality. In addition, we believe outsourcing many of our manufacturing and assembly activities provides us the flexibility needed to respond to new market opportunities, simplifies our operations and significantly reduces our capital requirements. We do not have a guaranteed level of production capacity from any of our suppliers&#8217; facilities to produce our solutions. We carefully qualify each of our suppliers and their subcontractors and processes in order to meet the extremely high-quality and reliability standards required of our solutions. 

Backlog 

Our sales are primarily made through standard purchase orders for delivery of products. Our manufacturing production is based on estimates and advance non-binding commitments from customers as to future purchases. We follow industry practice that allows customers to cancel, change or defer orders with limited advance notice prior to shipment. Given this practice, we do not believe that backlog is a reliable indicator of future revenue levels. 

&#160;

Wafer Fabrication 

We have a history of using several process nodes from 130nm through 28nm. We currently manufacture the majority of our solutions in 45nm, 32nm and 28nm silicon wafer production process geometries utilizing the services of several different foundries. In fiscal year 2015, we began investing in development of our next generation SoCs in the 14nm process node, and we announced our first 14nm SoC in January 2016. Currently, the majority of our SoCs are supplied by Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., or Samsung, in South Korea, from whom we have the option to purchase both fully-assembled and tested products as well as tested die in wafer form for assembly. We also have products supplied by Global UniChip Corporation, or GUC, in Taiwan, from whom we purchase fully-assembled and tested products. The wafers used by GUC in the assembly of our products are manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd., or TSMC, in Taiwan. 

Assembly and Testing 

Samsung subcontracts the assembly and initial testing of the assembled chips it supplies to us to Signetics Corporation and STATS ChipPAC Ltd. In the case of purchases of tested die from Samsung, we contract the assembly to Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., or ASE. GUC subcontracts the assembly of the products it supplies to us to ASE and Powertech Technology Inc. Final testing of all of our products is handled by King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd. or Sigurd Corporation under the supervision of our engineers. All test software and related processes for our products are developed by our engineers. We continually monitor the results of testing at all of our test contractors to ensure that our testing procedures are properly implemented. 

As part of our total quality assurance program, our quality management system has been certified to ISO 9001:2000 standards. Our foundry vendors are also ISO 9001 certified. 

Research and Development 

We believe our technology is a competitive advantage and we engage in substantial research and development efforts to develop new products and integrate additional features and capabilities into our HD and UHD video processing solutions. We believe that our continued success depends on our ability to both introduce improved versions of our existing solutions and to develop new solutions for the markets that we serve. Our research and development team is comprised of both semiconductor and software designers. Our semiconductor design team has extensive experience in large-scale semiconductor design, including architecture description, logic and circuit design, implementation and verification. Our software design team has extensive experience in development and verification of software for the HD video market. Because the integration of hardware and software is a key competitive advantage of our solutions, our hardware and software design teams work closely together throughout the product development process. The experience of our hardware and software design teams enables us to effectively assess the tradeoffs and advantages when determining which features and capabilities of our solutions should be implemented in hardware and in software. 

We have assembled a core team of experienced engineers and systems designers in four research and development design centers located in the United States, China, Italy and Taiwan. 

For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our research and development expense was $82.9 million, $58.0 million and $48.8 million, respectively. 

Competition 

The global semiconductor market in general, and the video and image processing markets in particular, are highly competitive. We expect competition to increase and intensify as more and larger semiconductor companies enter our markets. Increased competition could result in price pressure, reduced profitability and loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, revenue and operating results. 

&#160;

Currently, our competitors range from large, international companies offering a wide range of semiconductor products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets. In the wearable sports camera market, our primary competitors are vertically integrated divisions of camera device OEMs, including Sony Corporation , or Sony, and Panasonic Corporation, as well as HiSilicon Technologies Co., Ltd. , or HiSilicon, and Socionext Inc. , or Socionext, a new entity created from the merger of the system LSI businesses of Fujitsu Ltd. and Panasonic Corporation. In the IP security camera market, our primary competitors include Geo Semiconductor, Inc., Grain Media, Inc., HiSilicon, Intel Corp oration, or Intel, Movidius Ltd., Qualcomm Incorporated, or Qualcomm, Realt ek Semiconductor Corp., Socionext, and Texas Instruments Incorporated, as well as vertically integrated divisions of IP s ecurity camera device OEMs, including Axis Communications AB and Sony. In the market for automotive aftermarket cameras, we compete against Allwinner Technology Co., Ltd., Alpha Imaging Technology Corp., Core Logic, Inc., Novatek Microelectronics Corp. and Sunplus Technology Co. Ltd. Our primary competitors in the UAV camera market include HiSilicon, Intel, NVIDIA Corporation and Qualcomm. Our primary competitors in the infrastructure market include Intel, Magnum Semiconductor, Inc. and Texas Instruments In corporated. Certain of our customers and suppliers also have divisions that produce products competitive with ours. We expect competition in our current markets to increase in the future as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings and as potential new competitors, such as Broadcom Corporation, MediaTek, Inc. and Samsung, enter these markets. 

Our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control, including industry and general economic trends. Many of our competitors are substantially larger, have greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, customer support and other resources, are more established than we are, and have significantly better brand recognition and broader product offerings which may enable them to develop and enable new technology into product solutions better or faster than us and to better withstand adverse economic or market conditions in the future. 

Our ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving HD video market depends on several factors, including: 

&#160;

&#183; 

the design and manufacturing of new solutions that anticipate the video processing and integration needs of our customers&#8217; next-generation products and applications; 

&#160;

&#183; 

performance, as measured by video and still picture image quality, resolution and frame processing rates; 

&#160;

&#183; 

power consumption; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the ease of implementation by customers; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the strength of customer relationships; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the selection of the foundry process technology and architecture tradeoffs to meet customers&#8217; product requirements in a timely manner; 

&#160;

&#183; 

reputation and reliability; 

&#160;

&#183; 

customer support; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

the cost of the total solution. 

We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors, particularly because our solutions typically provide high-performance and low power consumption video, efficient integration of our advanced algorithms, exceptional storage and transmission efficiencies at lower power, highly integrated SoC solutions based on a scalable platform, and comprehensive and flexible software. We cannot ensure, however, that our solutions will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products introduced by existing or new competitors. 

Intellectual Property 

We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, and contractual protections, to protect our core technology and intellectual property. As of January 31, 2016, we had 45 issued and allowed patents in the United States plus 28 additional continuation patents, five patents issued in Europe, three issued patents in China, five issued patents in Japan and 57 pending and provisional patent applications in the United States. The issued and allowed patents in the United States expire beginning in 2024 through 2033. Many of our issued patents and pending patent applications relate to image and video processing and HD video compression. 

We may not receive competitive advantages from any rights granted under our patents, and our patent applications may not result in the issuance of any new patents. In addition, any patent we hold may be opposed, contested, circumvented, designed around by a third party or found to be unenforceable or invalidated. Others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies, duplicate our proprietary technologies or design around patents owned or licensed by us. 

&#160;

In addition to our own intellectual property, we also use third-party licenses for certain technologies embedded in our SoC solutions. These are typically non-exclusive contracts provided under royalty-accruing or paid-up licenses. These licenses are generally perpetual or automatically renewed for so l ong as we continue to pay any maintenance fees that may be due. To date, maintenance fees have not constituted a significant portion of our capital expenditures. While we do not believe our business is dependent to any significant degree on any individual third-party license, we expect to continue to use and may license additional third-party technology for our solutions. 

We generally control access to and use of our confidential information through employing internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors and customers. We rely in part on U.S. and international copyright laws to protect our mask work. All employees and consultants are required to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment and consulting relationships with us. We also require them to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived or made in connection with the employment or consulting relationship. 

Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software, technology or other information that we regard as proprietary intellectual property. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries. 

The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights and positions, which has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies. Our customers have in the past received, and we expect that in the future we may receive, communications from various industry participants alleging infringement of their patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights by our solutions. In addition, certain of our end customers have been the subject of lawsuits alleging infringement of patents by products incorporating our solutions. Any lawsuits could subject us to significant liability for damages, invalidate our proprietary rights and harm our business and our ability to compete. Any litigation, regardless of success or merit, could cause us to incur substantial expenses, reduce our sales and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. In the event we receive an adverse result in any litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, seek licenses from third parties, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, cease sale of products, expend significant resources to develop alternative technology or discontinue the use of processes requiring the relevant technology. 

Employees 

At January 31, 2016, we employed a total of 640 people, including 140 in the United States, 466 in Asia, primarily in China and Taiwan and 34 in Europe. We also engage temporary employees and consultants. None of our employees are either represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. 

Information concerning revenue, results of operations, assets and revenue by geographic area is set forth in Item 6, &#8220;Selected Financial Data&#8221; and Note 15, &#8220;Segment Reporting,&#8221; of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
