 Item 1 &#x2013; Our Business 

GENERAL 

Reading International, Inc., a Nevada corporation (&#x201C;RDI&#x201D; and collectively with our consolidated subsidiaries and corporate predecessors, the &#x201C;Company,&#x201D; &#x201C;Reading&#x201D; and &#x201C;we,&#x201D; &#x201C;us,&#x201D; or &#x201C;our&#x201D; ), was incorporated in 1999 incident to our reincorporation in Nevada. Our class A non-voting common stock (&#x201C;Class A Stock&#x201D;) and class B voting common stock (&#x201C;Class B Stock&#x201D;) are listed for trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market (Nasdaq-CM) under the symbols RDI and RDIB, respectively. Our principal executive offices are located at 6100 Center Drive, Suite 900, Los Angeles, California 90045. Our general telephone number is (213) 235-2240 and our website is www.readingrdi.com . It is our practice to make available free of charge on our website our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we have electronically filed such material with or furnished it to the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

We are an internationally diversified company principally focused on the development, ownership and operation of entertainment and real property assets in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. Currently, we have two business segments: 

&#xB7; 

Cinema Exhibition, through our 58 cinemas, and 

&#xB7; 

Real Estate, including real estate development and the rental or licensing of retail, commercial and live theater assets. 

We synergistically bring together real-estate based entertainment and real estate and believe that these two business segments complement one another, as our cinemas have historically provided the steady cash flows that allow us to be opportunistic in acquiring and holding real estate assets (including non-income producing land) and support our real estate development activities. Our real estate allows us to develop an asset base that will stand the test of time and develop a long-term asset base that is capable of being leveraged. More specifically, the combination of these two segments provides advantages as follows: 

&#xB7; 

Cinemas can be used as anchors for larger retail developments (referred to as entertainment-themed centers, or ETCs), and our involvement in the cinema business can give us an advantage over other real estate developers or redevelopers who must identify and negotiate with third-party anchor tenants. We have used cinemas to create our own anchors in our Sydney, Australia, Belmont, Australia, and Wellington, New Zealand ETCs and are adding a new cinema to our Brisbane, Australia shopping center , and, we have acquired the real estate underlying our cinema in Townsville, Australia. 

&#xFEFF; 

&#xB7; 

Pure cinema operators can encounter financial difficulty as demands upon them to produce cinema-based earnings growth tempt them into reinvesting their cash flow into increasingly marginal cinema sites or overpaying for existing cinemas. While we believe that there will continue to be attractive opportunities to acquire cinema assets and/or to develop upper end specialty type theaters in the future, we do not feel pressure to build or acquire cinemas for the sake of adding units or building gross revenues. This strategy has, over the years, allowed us to acquire cinemas at multiples of trailing theater cash flow below those paid by third parties in recent acquisitions. We intend to focus our use of cash flow on our real estate development and operating activities, to the extent that attractive cinema opportunities are not available to us. 

&#xFEFF; 

&#xB7; 

We are always open to the idea of converting an entertainment property to another use, if there is a higher and better use for the property, or to sell individual assets, if we are presented with an attractive opportunity. Our fee interests on Union Square and on Third Avenue (near 60 th Street) in New York City, each of which is now slated for redevelopment, were initially acquired as, and in the case of our Third Avenue property, continues to be used as, entertainment properties. 

&#xFEFF; 

Insofar as we are aware, we are the only publicly traded company in the world to apply this two-track, synergistic approach to the cinema and real estate development businesses on an international basis. None of the major cinema exhibition companies (other than Marcus Theatres) have any material landholdings as they operate on a leased-facility model. 

&#xFEFF; 

We have worked to maintain a balance between our U . S . and our Australia/New Zealand assets. In recent periods, this has adversely impacted our reported revenues and earnings, as the Australian Dollar has since 2010 dropped 28 % from 1.0122 to 0. 7286 and the New Zealand Dollar has ove r that same period de creased 11 % from 0.7 6 87 to 0.6842. However, we continue to believe that, over the long term, this is a prudent diversification of risk. In recent periods, the Australian Dollar has traded as high as 1. 1001 and the New Zealand Dollar has traded as high as 0.8776. Australia has been identified by the United Nations as having the highest natural resources per person in the world . In 2013, the Organisation for Econom ic Co-operation and Development rated Australia as the best place to live and work in the world . Dalian Wanda Group ("Wanda") , the purchaser of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. ("AMC"), in June 2015, has recently purchased Hoyt s, the second largest exhibiter in Australia and New Zealand. 

At December 31, 2015, the b ook value of our asset s was $375 .1 million, and, as of that same date, we had a consolidated s tockholders&#x2019; book equity of $13 7.2 million. Calculated based on book value, $107.8 million , or 29 % of our assets , relate to our cinema exhibition activities and $219.8 million , o r 58 %, of our assets , relate to our real estate activities. 

&#xFEFF; 

For additional segment financial information, please see Note 1 &#x2013; Description of B usiness and Segments Reporting to our 2015 c onsolidated f inancial s tatements. 

We have diversified our assets among three countries: the United State s, Australia, and New Zealand. Based on book value, at December 31, 2015, we had approximately 35% of our assets in the United States, 46% in Australia and 19% in New Zealand compared to 35%, 44%, and 21% respective ly, at the end of 2014. 

At December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $ 19.7 million, which are accounted for as a corporate asset. Our cash included $ 9.3 million denominated in U.S. dollars, $6.8 million (AU$9.3 million) in Australian dollars, and $3.6 million (NZ$5.2 million) in New Zealand dollars. W e had non-current assets of $113.3 million in the United States, $16 1.2 million (AU$221.2 million) in Australia and $63.6 million in New Zealand (NZ$93.0 million). 

For 2015, our gross revenue in these jurisdictions was $138.2 million, $93.5 million, and $25.6 million, respectively, compared to $130.8 million, $97.3 million, and $26.6 million for 201 4 . These changes are due primarily to the increased box office sales experienced in the United States, due primarily to higher average ticket prices, compared to reduced revenue in o ur Australia and New Zealand operations . Revenues fell in Australia and New Zealand primarily as a result of the strengthening U.S. dollar when compared to the Australian and New Zealand dollars ; this was partially offset by greater box office and concession sales in local currencies as a result of higher attendance. Measured in local currency, revenues in Australia and New Zealand both increased. 

&#xFEFF; 

&#xFEFF; 

CINEMA EXHIBITION 

We are dedicated to creating inspiring cinema experiences for our guests through hospitality-styled comfort and service, cinematic presentation, uniquely designed venues, curated film and event programming, and crafted food and beverage options. We manage our worldwide cinema exhibition business under various brands: 

&#xB7; 

In the U.S.: under the Reading Cinemas, Angelika Film Center, Consolidated Theatres, and City Cinemas brands; 

&#xB7; 

In Australia: under the Reading Cinemas brand; and 

&#xB7; 

In New Zealand: under the Reading Cinemas and Rialto brands. 

&#xFEFF; 

Historically, we have focused on the ownership and/or operation of three categories of cinemas: 

&#xFEFF; 

&#xB7; 

Modern stadium-seating multiplex cinemas featuring conventional film product; 

&#xB7; 

Specialty and art cinemas, such as Angelika Film Centers in the U.S. and Rialto Cinema in New Zealand; and 

&#xB7; 

Conventional sloped-floor cinemas in certain markets, including New York City with its prohibitory occupancy and construction costs and small town markets that will not support the development of a modern stadium-design multiplex cinema. 

Currently, we are focused on upgrading our existing cinemas and developing new cinema opportunities to provide our customers with premium offerings, including luxury seating, state-of-the-art presentation including sound, lounges, caf&#xE9;s and bar service, and other amenities. In 2015, we added the first IMAX auditorium to our circuit, but endeavor, where possible to include one or more large format TITAN XC screen offerings. 

We believe that the cinema exhibition business will continue to generate fairly consistent cash flows in the years ahead, even in recessionary or inflationary environments, because people will continue to spend a reasonable portion of their entertainment dollars on entertainment outside of the home. When compared to other forms of outside-the-home entertainment, movies continue to be a popular and competitively priced option. 

Although the cinema exhibition business is considered a mature business, we see growth opportunities in our cinema exhibition business principally from (i) the enhancement of our existing cinemas, (ii) the development in select markets of art and specialty cinemas, (iii) the development of new state-of-the-art cinemas on land that we already own or may in the future acquire, and (iv) the development of new cinemas in selected markets. While we continue to consider possible opportunities in third party developments, we prefer to put our capital to work on properties that we own rather than take on potentially burdensome lease obligations. Our circuit has been completely converted to digital projection and sound systems. 

We continue to expand and upgrade our circuit on an opportunistic basis. During 2015 we opened a new state-of-the-art cinema (eight screens) in Auckland , New Zealand, and entered into a lease for a to-be-built state-of-the art eight -screen cinema in Kapolei, Hawaii. We anticipate that the Kapolei theater will open in the fourth quarter of this year. We completed the re novation and rebranding as an &#x201C;Angelika&#x201D; luxury art cinema of our conventional cinema at the Carmel Mountain Plaza in San Diego , California and completely renovated our fourteen -screen Ha r bourtown cinema in Queen sland, Australia, converting an auditorium in that theater to a TITAN XC auditorium . We added the first IMAX to our circuit, which opened at our Bakersfield cinema in time for the opening of &#x201C;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&#x201D; . We continue to progress the construction of a new state-of-the art eight -screen cinema at our Newmarket Shopping Center in Brisbane, Australia. We anticipate opening that cinema in the fourth quarter of 2017 . 

In 2015 we upgraded the food and beverage menu at a number of our U.S. cinemas. We are focused on the renovation and upgrading of our existing U.S. cinemas, along the lines of our Carmel Mountain cinema. Working with veteran Food Network Executive Bruce Seidel of Hot Lemon Productions and chef Santos Loo we are upgrading our food and beverage offerings. We have obtained beer and wine, and in some cases liquor, licenses for six of our venues and are in the application process for an additional 10 venues. We intend to be able to offer alcoholic beverages at 16 or more of our venues by the end of 2017. 

As discussed in greater detail below, as a part of our real estate operations, we acquired the fee interest in the ETC in which our Townsville, Australia cinema is located and in the adjacent discount center. 

In January of 2015 , we amended the lease of our Ward Theater in Honolulu as part of a planned renovation and further developmen t by The Howard Hughes Company of i ts Ward Village development. 

On January 31, 2016, following our run of &#x201C;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&#x201D; , we surrendered our Gas lamp Cinema in San Diego. We paid the landlord a $1.0 million negotiated termination fee, which was less expensive than continuing to operate an unprofitable 

theater at this location. This cinema was acquired in 2008 as a part of the acquisition of a package of 15 lo cations from Pacific Theatres. The cinema was , at that time, a substantial money-loser and the purchase price was calculated taking into account the losses generated by that cinema and the likelihood that such losses would continue into the future. 

In 2014, we completed an upgrade of our Cinemas 1,2,3 in New York City, which included the installation of luxury recliner seats. This property is slated for redevelopment. No determination has been made as to whether a cinema use will be maintained as a part of that redevel opment. If it is not, then the equipment used at this property will be used elsewhere in our circuit. 

In 2014, we entered into a long-term lease for a new, state-of-the-art Angelika Film Center in the Union Market district of Washington D.C. However, the lease was terminated as the anticipated location for this cinema ultimately was determined by the landlord, Edens, to not be feasible. We are currently finalizing with Edens the terms and conditions of a new lease for a cinema in a different location in the Union Market area. 

REAL ESTATE 

We engage in real estate development and the ownership and rental or licensing to third parties of retail, commercial and live theater assets. We own the fee interests in all of our live theaters, and in 11 of our cinemas. Our real estate business creates long-term value for our stockholders through the continuous improvement and development of our investment and operating properties, including our ETCs. 

Our real estate activities have historically consisted principally of: 

&#xB7; 

the ownership of fee or long-term leasehold interests in properties used in our cinema exhibition activities or which were acquired for the development of cinemas or cinema-based real estate development projects; 

&#xB7; 

the acquisition of fee interests in land for general real estate development; 

&#xB7; 

the licensing to production companies of our live theaters; and 

&#xB7; 

the redevelopment of our existing fee-owned cinema or live theater sites to their highest and best use. 

&#xFEFF; 

Given the subs tantial increase in Manhattan rents and commercial real estate values in recent periods, we are currently advancing plans for the redevelopment of our Union Square and Cinemas 1,2,3 properties. 

We currently anticipate that our Union Square property will be redeveloped into approximately 70,200 square feet of net leaseable area, comprised of retail and office space. BKSK Architects has designed the building with an iconic glass dome which has been approved by the City of New York Landmarks Preservation Commission. On March 22, 2016, our application for a variance was approved by the Board of Standards and Appeals. This was the last major regulatory hurdle to our commencement of construction at the site. While our building plans still must be approved by the New York City Department of Buildings, we do not currently anticipate encountering any material issues in obtaining such approval. All tenancies have been terminated. The building has been vacated, and we have begun internal demolition activities at the site. We currently anticipate that construction will be completed by the second quarter of 2018. We have retained Edifice Real Estate Partners, LLC as our development manager, Newmark Grubb Knight Frank as our leasing agent, and, an affiliate of CNY Construction LLC to provide pre-construction management services. BKSK and Gensler have assisted with the internal layout and interior design of the building. 

We have completed a preliminary feasibility study and are currently in negotiations with the owner of the approximately 2,600 square foot corner parcel adjacent to our Cinemas 1,2,3 property on the corner of 60 th Street and 3 rd Avenue for the joint development of our properties. A combination of the properties would produce approximately 121,000 square foot of FAR and approximately 140,000 square feet of gross buildable area. N o assurances can be given that we will be able to come to terms with the adjacent owners. 

On April 11, 2016 , we purchase d for $11.2 million a 24,000 square foot Class B office building with 72 parking spaces located at 5995 Sepulveda Boulevard in Culver City, California. We intend to use approximately 50% of the leasable area for our headquarters offices and to lease the remainder to unaffiliated third parties. Culver City has in recent years developed as a center of entertainment and high-tech activity in Los Angeles County. Major tenants in the area include SONY and Google, with Facebook slated to take space in the near future . We anticipate, when the move is complete and the excess space is leased, we will be able to reduce our headquarters occupancy cost by approximately $350,000 per annum. 

Overseas, on December 23 , 2015, we acquired two adjoining ETCs in Townsville, Queensland, Australia for a total of $2 4.3 million (AU$33.6 million) comprising approximately 5.6 acres. The total gross leasable area of the two properties, the Cannon Park City Centre and the Cannon Park Discount Centre, is 133,000 square feet. Our multiplex cinema at the Cannon Park City Centre is the anchor tenant of that center. This acquisition is consistent with our business plan to own, where practical, the land underlying our entertainment assets. For additional information, see Note 4 &#x2013; Acquisitions, Disposals, and Assets Held for Sale &#x2013; 2015 Transactions &#x2013; Cannon Park, Queensland, Australia . 

We continue to w ork on the expansion of our Aub u r n ETC in Sydney, Australia, our Newmarket Shopping Center in Brisbane, Australia, and our Courtenay Central ETC in Wellington, New Zealand. 

At Auburn, we have entered into agreements to lease for approximately 15,000 square feet of to-be-constructed retail space. Upon completion, this will increase the square footage of that center from approximately 117,000 to approximately 132,000 square feet. 

At Newmarket, we have received all necessary land use approvals for the addition of a state-of-the art eight-screen cinema, approximately 10,000 square feet of additional retail space and approximately 142 additional car parks. Construction is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2016, with a projected opening in the fourth quarter of 2017. On November 30, 2015, we acquired an approximately 23,000 square foot parcel adjacent to our tenant Coles supermarket. This property is currently improved with an office building. We intend, over time, to integrate this property into our Newmarket development. This will increase our Newmarket footprint from approximately 204,000 to approximately 227,000 square feet. 

At Courtenay Central, we continue to advance the addition of an approximately 36,000 square foot Countdown supermarket and approximately 4, 0 00 square feet of general retail space. The agreement to lease the supermarket was signed in 2013, all necessary land use approvals have been obtained, construction budgets for the supermarket have been approved by all parties, and we anticipate beginning construction in the third quarter of this year and occupancy by the fourth quarter 2017 . Simultaneously, we are working on the renovation of our existing center and the seismic upgrading of the contiguous 9-story parking structure. 

In addition to certain historic railroad properties (such as our 2.1 acre Viaduct Property in downtown Philadelphia) and certain expansion space associated with our existing ETC operations, we have two unimproved properties that we acquired for , and are currently being held for, development: our 202-a cre parcel in Coachella, California (near Palm Springs) and our 70.4 acre parcel in Manukau, a suburb of Auckland, New Zealand (located adjacent to the Auckland Airport). The Coachella property is currently zoned for residential and mixed-use uses. The Manukau property is currently zoned for agricultural purposes, but we are in the process of seeking a zoning change to industrial . 

Over the past 24 months, we have culled our real estate holdings to focus on those projects which we believe offer more upside potential to us. As part of this process we sold our property in Lake Taupo, New Zealand, for $2.5 million (NZ$3.4 million), which close d in two tranches, with a balance of $821,000 (NZ$1.2 million) received on March 31, 2016. We sold our land holdings in Moonee Ponds, Australia on April 15, 2015 for $17.8 million (AU$23.0 million), for which all monies have now been received and our land holdings in Burwood, Australia, for $47.4 million (AU$65.0 million) on May 12, 2014, with a balance due of $42.6 million (AU$58.5 million) scheduled to be paid at closing in December 2017. Our Burwood agreement provides for mandatory pre-payments in the event that any of the land is sold by the buyer, any such prepayment being in an amount equal to the greater of (a) 90% of the net sales price or (b) the balance of the purchase price multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the square footage of property being sold by the buyer and the denominator of which is the original square footage of the property being sold to the buyer. The buyer has informed us that it is under contract to sell a portion of this property and a potential prepayment of approximately $18.2 million (AU$25 million) is possible in 2016. We sold our Doheny Drive Condominium in Los Angeles for $3.0 million, which closed on February 25, 2015. These sales were made based on our belief that the assets involved had reached the highest value that we could reasonably achieve without investing substantial additional sums for land use planning, construction, and marketing. 

OPERATIN G INFORMATION 

At December 31, 2015 , our principal tangible assets included: 

&#xB7;

&#xFEFF; 

Although we operate cinemas in three jurisdictions, the general nature of our operations and operating strategies does not vary materially fro m jurisdiction-to-jurisdiction. In each jurisdiction, our gross receipts are primarily from box office receipts, food and beverage sales, concession sales, and screen advertising. Our ancillary revenue is created principally from theater rentals (for example, for film festivals and special events), and ancillary programming (such a s concerts and sporting events) . 

Our cinemas generated approximately 65% of their 2015 revenue from box office receipts. Ticket prices vary by location , and we offer reduced rates for senior citizens, children and, in certain markets, military and students. 

Show times and features are placed in advertisements on our various websites, on internet sites and, in some markets, in local newspapers. Film distributors may also advertise certain feature films in various print, radio and television media, as well as on the internet, and those costs are generally paid by distributors. We are increasing our presence in social media, thereby reducing our dependency on print advertising . 

Concession sales accounted for approximately 29% of our total 2015 cinema revenue. Although certain cinemas have licenses for the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages, historically concession products have been primarily popcorn, candy, and soda. This is changing, as more of our theaters are offering expanded food and beverage offerings. One of our focuses for 2016 and 2017 is to upgrade our existing cinemas with expanded food and beverage offerings . We intend to have alcoholic beverage licenses for at least 16 of our domestic cinemas by 2017 . 

Screen advertising and other revenue contribute approximately 6% of our total 2015 cinema revenue. With the exception of certain rights that we have retained to sell to local advertisers, generally speaking , we are not in the screen advertising business and nationally recognized screen-advertising companies provide such advertising for us. 

In New Zealand, we also own a one-third interest in Rialto Distribution, an unincorporated joint venture engaged in the business of distributing art film in New Zealand and Australia. The remaining two-thirds interest in Rialto Distribution is owned by the founders of Rialto Distribution, who have been in the art film distribution business since 1993 . 

Management of Cinemas 

With the exception of our three unconsolidated cinemas , we manage all of our cinemas with ex ecutives located in Los Angeles; Manhattan; Melbourne, Australi a; and Wellington, New Zealand. Approximately 2,506 individuals were employed (on a full-time or part- time basis) in our cinema operations as of December 31, 2015 . Our two New Zealand Rialto cinemas are owned by a joint venture 

in which Reading New Zealand is a 50% joint venture partner. While we are principally responsible for the booking of the se two cinemas, our joint venture partner, Event Cinemas, manages their day-to-day operations. In addition, we have a one-third interest in a 16-screen Brisbane cinema managed by Event Cinemas. 

Licensing and Pricing 

Film product is available from a variety of sources, ranging from the major film distributors, such as Paramount Pictures, Twentieth Century Fox, Warner Bros, Buena Vista Pictures (Disney), Sony Pictures Releasing, Universal Pictures and Lionsgate, to a variety of smaller independent film distributors. In Australia and New Zealand, some of those major distributors distribute through local unaffiliated distributors. Worldwide, the major film distributors dominate the market for mainstream conventional films. In the U.S. art and specialty film is distributed through the art and specialty divisions of these major distributors, such as Fox Searchlight and Sony Pictures Classics, and through independent distributors such as The Weinstein Company. Generally speaking, film payment terms are based upon an agreed-upon percentage of box office receipts that will vary from film-to-film. 

Competition 

In certain markets in the U.S. in which we operate, film may be allocated by the distributor among competitive cinemas, commonly known as &#x201C;clearance&#x201D;, while in other U.S. markets we have access to all available film. This is discussed in greater detail below . Accordingly, we, from time-to-time, are unable to license every film that we may desire to play. In the Australian and New Zealand markets, we generally have access to all available film product. 

We believe that the success of a cinema depends on its access to popular film product because film patrons tend to decide on a film they would like to see first and then a cinema where the film is available. If a particular film is only offered at one cinema in a given market, then customers wishing to see that film will, of necessity, go to that cinema. If two or more cinemas in the same market offer the same film, then customers will typically take into account factors such as the relative convenience, quality and cost of the various cinemas. For example, most cinema patrons seem to prefer a modern stadium-design multiplex to an older sloped-floor cinema, and to prefer a cinema that either offers convenient access to free parking (or public transport) over a cinema that does not. 

This view is being challenged by some exhibitors, who are now promoting a &#x201C;dine-in&#x201D; concept. These exhibitors believe that if offered the right environment, consumers will choose the venue first, and the movie second. We believe that the jury is out as to the economic viability of this concept given, among other things, the space and fit-out costs involved, the necessarily reduced seat count where food is served at the seat, the split between consumers who want and who oppose having in-auditorium dining (some people just want to see the movie, and find in-auditorium service and dinning to be a distraction from the movie itself), and the pricing of such offerings. It also appears to us, that one still needs to at least offer top film product. So, even with these dine-in theaters, access to film remains a principal concern. 

In the United States in certain markets, distributors typically take the position that they are free to provide or not provide their films to particular exhibitors, at their complete and absolute discretion, even though the number of &#x201C;digital prints&#x201D; is theoretically unlimited and all advertising for conventional film is paid for by the distributors. Some competitors, like AMC, are becoming increasing aggressive in their efforts to prevent competitors&#x2019; access to film product in film zones where they have cinemas. We face clearance situations in several markets in which we show film. 

The use of clearances is currently under attack. We believe that, as the two principal justifications for clearances (the cost of producing an additional print and the shared advertising cost) no longer exist, that ultimately clearances should (except in exceptional cases &#x2013; for example where a distributor&#x2019;s strategy is for a limited or staged release) go away. If this occurred, on balance, we believe that this will be a positive development for us, as it will generally speaking increase our access to film in competitive markets. Pressure on the major chains to stop using &#x201C;clearances&#x201D; is increasing. An investigation by the United States Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, into the possible anticompetitive activities of major chains has been initiated. Also, there have been private lawsuits by small chains to stop the practice. For example, iPic Theaters has obtained a temporary injunction against clearance practices by one major chain in Harris County, Texas, and is seeking further injunctions against other major chains in Texas as well as in other jurisdictions, such as the District of Columbia . 

For now, competition for films can be intense, depending upon the number of cinemas in a particular market. Our ability to obtain top grossing first run feature films may be adversely impacted by our comparatively small size, and the limited number of screens and markets that we can supply to distributors. Moreover, in the United States, because of the dramatic consolidation of screens into the hands of a few very large and powerful exhibitors such as Regal, AMC, Cinemark and Carmike, these mega-exhibition companies are in a position to offer distributors access to many more screens in major markets than we can. Also, the majors have a significant number of markets where they operate without material competition, meaning that the distributors have no alternative exhibitor for their films in these markets. Accordingly, distributors may decide to give preference to these mega-exhibitors when it comes to licensing top grossing films, rather than deal with independents such as ourselves. The situation is different in Australia and New Zealand, where typically every major multiplex cinema has access to all of the film currently in distribution, regardless of the 

ownership of that multiplex cinema. However, on the reverse side, we have suffered somewhat in these markets from competition from boutique operators, who are able to book top grossing commercial films for limited runs, thus increasing competition for customers wishing to view such top grossing films . 

Generally speaking, our cinemas are modern multiplex cinemas with good and convenient parking. The availability of state-of-the-art technology and/or luxury seating can also be a factor in the preference of one cinema over another . In recent periods, a number of cinemas have been opened or re-opened featuring luxury seating and/or expanded food and beverage service, including the sale of alcoholic beverages and food served to the seat. We have for a number of years offered alcoholic beverages in certain of our Australia and New Zealand cinemas and at certain of our Angelika Film Centers in the U.S. We are currently working to upgrade the seating and food and beverage offerings (including the offering of alcoholic beverages) at a number of our existing cinemas. 

The film exhibition markets in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand are to a certain extent dominated by a limited number of major exhibition companies. The principal exhibitors in the United States are Regal (with 7,361 screens in 572 cinemas), AMC (with 4,937 screens in 348 cinemas), Cinemark (with 4,489 screens in 334 cinemas), and Carmike (with 2,881 screens in 270 cinemas). As of December 31, 2015 , we were the 11th largest exhibitor with 1% of the box office in the United States with 252 screens in 27 cinemas under manage ment. AMC and Carmike have recently announced the acquisition of Carmike by AMC. If this acquisition goes through, AMC/Carmike will be the largest exhibitor in the United States with 9,426 screens in 682 theaters. 

The principal exhibitors in Australia are Greater Union, which does business under the Event Cinemas name (a subsidiary of Amalgamated Holdings Limited), Hoyts Cinemas (&#x201C;Hoyts&#x201D;), and Village Cinemas . The major exhibitors control approximately 65% of the total cinema box office: Event 31% , Hoyts 19% , and Village 15% . Event has 503 screens nationally, Hoyts 344 screens, and Village 214 screens. By comparison, our 141 screens (excluding any partnership theaters) represent approximately 7% of the total box office. In June 2015, Hoyts was acquired by Wanda, which also holds a controlling interest in AMC. 

The princi pal exhibitors in New Zealand are Event Cinemas with 105 screens nationally and Hoyts with 63 screens. Reading has 54 screens (excluding its interest in unconsolidated joint ventures). The major exhibitors in New Zealand control approximately 56% of the total box office: Event 35% and Hoyts 21% . Reading has 13% of the market (Event and Reading mark et share figures exclude any partnership theaters). 

In Australia and New Zealand , the industry is somewhat vertically integrated in that Roadshow Film Distributors, a subsidiary of Village, serves as a distributor of film in Australia and New Zealand for Warner B rothers. Films produced or distributed by the majority of the local international independent producers are also distributed by Roadshow Film Distributors . 

Many of our competitors have substantial financial resources which could allow them to operate in a more competitive manner than we can. 

In-Home and Mobile Device Competition 

The &#x201C;in-home&#x201D; and mobile device entertainment industry has experienced significant leaps in recent periods in both the quality and affordability of in-home and mobile device entertainment systems and in the accessibility to and quality of entertainment programming through cable, satellite, internet distribution channels, and Blu-ray/DVD. The success of these alternative distribution channels puts additional pressure on film distributors to reduce and/or eliminate the time period between theatrical and secondary release dates and the willingness of consumers to take the time and pay the admission price to go to the movie theater. To a certain extent, it appears that consumers are willing to trade convenience for presentation. These are issues common to both our U.S. and international cinema operations. 

Competitive issues are discussed in greater detail under the caption, Item 1A - Risk Factors . 

Seasonality 

Major films are generally relea sed to coincide with holidays. With the exception of Christmas and New Year&#x2019;s Days, this fact provides some balancing of our revenue because there is no material overlap between holidays in the United States and those in Australia and New Zealand. Distributors will delay, in certain cases, releases in Australia and New Zealand to take advantage of Australian and New Zealand holidays that are not ce lebrated in the United States. However, the deferral of releases is becoming increasing less common, given the need to address internet and other channels of distribution that operate on a worldwide basis. 

Real Estate 

Our real estate activities have historically consisted principally of: 

&#xB7; 

the ownership of fee or long-term leasehold interests in properties used in our cinema exhibition activities or which were acquired for the de velopment of cinemas or cinema- based real estate development projects; 

&#xB7; 

the operation of our various ETCs and shopping centers and properties, 

&#xB7; 

the acquisition of fee interests in land for general real estate development; 

&#xB7; 

the leasing to production companies of our live theaters; and 

&#xB7; 

the re development of our existing fee- owned cinema or live theater sites to their highest and best use. 

While we report our real estate as a separate segment, it has historically operated as an integral portion of our overall business and, historically, has principally been in support of that business. We have, however, acquired or developed certain properties that do not currently have any cinema or other entertainment component. 

Our real estate activities, holdings and developments are described in greater detail in Item 2 &#x2013; Properties . 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 88 full- time executive and administrative employees and 2,506 cinema employees. A small number of our cinema employees in New Zealand are union members, as are our projectionists in Hawaii. None of our Australian-based employees or other employees are subject to union contracts. Overall, we are of the view that the existence of these collective-bargaining agreements does not materially increase our costs of labor or our ability to compete. We believe our relations with our employees to be generally good.
