 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. &#160; 

&#160; 

General Development of Business 

Hickok Incorporated was founded in 1910 and organized in 1915 as an Ohio corporation, and first offered its securities to the public in 1959. Except as otherwise stated, the terms "Company" or "Hickok" as used herein mean Hickok Incorporated and its three wholly-owned subsidiaries, Supreme Electronics Corp., Federal Hose Manufacturing LLC, and Waekon Corporation. Hickok develops and manufactures products used by companies in the transportation, oil drilling, and agriculture industries. Primary markets served are automotive, heavy truck, emissions testing, aircraft, locomotive, oil exploration, and agriculture product handling with sales both to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and to the aftermarkets. 

&#160; 

The Company's Internet address is http://www.hickok-inc.com . Hickok makes available free of charge on or through its website its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 12(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such materials with, or furnishes it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains these reports at www.sec.gov . 

&#160; 

The Company was founded producing D&#8217;Arsonval indicators and continues to manufacture these products today. The current Indicator product line is focused on highly reliable specialized indicators used in the cockpits of certain aircraft, locomotives, and transit vehicles. It is a stable line of business with few competitors in the market. The indicator business represents approximately 18% of the Company&#8217;s revenue. 

&#160; 

Until the mid-1980s, Hickok was known primarily for its ability to develop and manufacture electronic instruments for electronic servicers, precision indicating instruments for aircraft, locomotive, and industrial applications, and electronic teaching systems for vocational schools. For the past twenty-eight years, the Company has used this expertise to develop and manufacture electronic diagnostic tools and equipment used by automotive technicians in the automotive service market. This is now the Company's second largest business segment. The Company generated approximately 56% of its fiscal 2016 revenue from designing and manufacturing diagnostic tools for automotive diagnostics and testing. These tools enable service technicians to identify problems in both electronic systems and other non-electronic systems in automobiles and trucks. On July 1, 2016, the Company purchased Federal Hose Manufacturing LLC (Federal Hose). Because only three months of Federal Hose results are included in this report, that segment generated approximately 26% of the Company&#8217;s fiscal 2016 revenue. It is expected that the Federal Hose segment will become the largest segment of the Hickok business in fiscal 2017. 

&#160; 

Twenty years ago, two large automotive original equipment manufacturers (&#8220;OEMs&#8221;) comprised over 80% of the Company's business. A substantial portion of this business was contingent on large programs initiated by these OEMs on a year-to-year basis. The Company recognized that OEMs were changing and that the likelihood of the continuation of these yearly large programs was diminishing. Recognizing that customer diversification was desirable and that much of the technology that had been developed for OEMs could have application to the non-dealer service market (known as the aftermarket), the Company added new products, customers and an established aftermarket sales channel with the acquisition of Waekon Industries in 1998. As a result, the Company executed a strategy to use this existing technical and manufacturing expertise and to develop sales and marketing skills applicable to the automotive aftermarket service industry. The Company uses Waekon, Hickok, and Hickok/Waekon as the brands of its products that are primarily marketed to aftermarket service organizations. 

&#160; 

The Company continues to develop aftermarket service tools and in recent years has successfully cultivated relationships with Tier 1 OEM service tool suppliers as well. The Company has increased its revenue from these customers in the past several years and now puts as much emphasis on this market segment as it does with respect to tools for the aftermarket. Most of these tools are branded to the Tier 1 supplier&#8217;s requirements. These tools tend to be more complex than typical aftermarket tools, but the technology developed often has application to subsequent aftermarket products. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

On July 1, 2016, the Company purchased the Federal Hose segment of the business. Federal Hose is a distributor of silicone rubber hoses and a manufacturer of flexible interlocking metal hose, supplying flexible metal exhaust hoses to major heavy-duty truck and bus manufacturers and all the major aftermarket programs in the Americas. Federal Hose also manufactures hoses for sale into the agricultural, industrial and petrochemical markets. Federal Hose&#8217;s metal hoses are constructed from a variety of materials, including four grades of stainless steel, aluminized steel and galvanized steel and are used to pneumatically convey dry bulk materials such as plastic pellets, grains, powder and other dry materials. Federal Hose also manufactures specialized hoses to convey tar and asphalt. For the petrochemical industry, armor is constructed for blow-out prevention hoses and large drainage hoses for rain water runoff from oil storage tanks. Federal Hose manufactures its metal hoses at its facility in Painesville, Ohio, and sells its metal and silicone rubber products through distributors, wholesalers and to OEMs throughout the Americas, Europe and Asia. Federal Hose was originally incorporated in 1921 under the name of Federal Metal Hose Corporation. 

&#160; 

The Company's operations are currently concentrated in the United States of America. Sales are primarily to domestic customers, although the Company also makes sales to international customers through domestically based distribution companies. 

&#160; 

Operating Segment Information &#160; 

The Company's operations are combined into three reportable business segments: 1) indicators and gauges, 2) automotive diagnostic tools and equipment and 3) flexible metal hose and silicone hose. Reference is made to "Segment and Related Information" included in the notes to the financial statements. 

&#160; 

Indicators and Gauges &#160; 

For over one hundred years the Company has developed and manufactured precision indicating instruments used in aircraft, locomotives and other applications. In recent years, the Company has specialized in aircraft and locomotive cockpit instruments. Within the aircraft market, instruments are sold primarily to manufacturers or servicers of business, military, and pleasure aircraft. Within the locomotive market, indicators are sold to both original equipment manufacturers and to operators of railroad equipment. Indicators and gauges represented approximately 18%, 22%, and 24% of the Company's sales for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. A number of the Company's aircraft instruments are FAA certified and a number of others are type certified with aircraft manufacturers. A significant revenue source within this segment is for high reliability ruggedized movements used on certain military aircraft. However, these products are subject to federal government funding of military programs and can vary significantly from year to year. 

&#160; 

Although the Company does not view this segment as having a high growth potential, it does contribute significant revenues and margins. The Company believes year to year variation of revenue is more dependent on customer timing than any general market direction. 

&#160; 

Automotive Diagnostic Tools and Equipment &#160; 

The Company has concentrated on designing and marketing instruments used to diagnose automotive electronic systems. These products were initially sold to one OEM but are now sold to several automotive OEMs through Tier 1 suppliers, and to the aftermarket using jobbers, wholesalers and mobile distributors. Sales of products designed specifically to OEM requirements have been balanced with products developed for automotive aftermarket servicers and the emissions testing industry. The aftermarket accounted for approximately 27% of the Company's automotive diagnostic and specialty tool sales in fiscal 2016 and 28% for fiscal 2015. As a whole, automotive diagnostic tools and equipment represented approximately 56%, 78% and 76% of the Company's sales for fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. The decrease as a percentage of total Company sales in 2016 was due primarily to the addition of the Federal Hose business in July 2016. 

&#160; 

The Company's primary expertise in the automotive segment is electronic measurement of physical properties. The Company has cultivated a reputation for developing innovative tools for automotive diagnostics. The Company uses this reputation as leverage when it introduces new offerings. Our recent focus on tools for automotive technicians results in low cost tools that are easy to use, save technicians time, and improve diagnostic accuracy. OEM tools tend to be tools that are sophisticated and allow the technician diagnostic access to vehicle systems that are otherwise inaccessible for the technician to pinpoint the vehicle&#8217;s issue. An example of this is the Active Fuel Injector Tester ("AFIT"), which the Company introduced several years ago, to General Motors dealers. Subsequently when General Motors introduced direct injection motors the Company developed an accessory that adapts the AFIT unit to the new fuel injection method. General Motors decided to equip their North American dealers with technology to diagnose fuel issues on their Gas Direct Injection (&#8220;GDI&#8221;) engines and the Company furnished over 4,200 adapters to the AFIT Tester during fiscal 2014 and additional cables/adapter interfaces for new Powertrain Control Modules (&#8220;PCMs&#8221;) in 2015 and 2016. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In addition to General Motors, the Company produces several testers for use on Chrysler and John Deere products as well as several other OEMs that are also sold through Tier 1 suppliers. 2016 benefited from over 80 new mechanically oriented tools for servicing Chrysler vehicles which was a new arena for the Company&#8217;s offerings. Several OEM customers continue to show interest in a number of products that were developed for aftermarket customers and the Company continues to pursue those opportunities in addition to responding to requests for tools specified by OEMs. 

&#160; 

New products are particularly important in the aftermarket but because of certain commitments Hickok did not introduce any new aftermarket products during 2016. Over the previous three years, the Company updated its aftermarket products and about two years ago, introduced a unique product that economically offers a service person the capabilities of an oscilloscope to view waveforms, but with the simple operation of a digital camera. 

&#160; 

Aftermarket sales channels are always changing and 2016 was no exception. The most effective way to introduce new products has been to grant a major distributor an exclusive right to purchase and market the product for an initial period during introduction because they historically put a great emphasis on the product for the duration of the exclusivity period. The AutoWave single channel oscilloscope referred to above is an example of the success this approach can yield. The Company&#8217;s plan is to continue to develop new and unique products for the automotive aftermarket and likely we will continue to use the exclusive distributor introduction strategy. 

&#160; 

During 2016, the Company launched a marketing effort on slightly modified versions of its automotive products to service technicians in non-automotive repair professions such as industrial machine repair, air conditioning and appliance repair. This initiative has not been successful to date. 

&#160; 

Emissions testing products for gas caps and gas tanks were a major revenue contributor for the Company for a number of years as new state testing programs were implemented. Despite very few state programs being implemented in recent years, the Company continues to enjoy a base level of business for these products as replacements and as new stations join the various state programs. In 2013, the only competing manufacturer of gas cap testers announced that it was discontinuing the manufacture and service of their gas cap testers. Except for a short flurry of increased sales immediately after this announcement, the gas cap tester product sales have remained steady over the past number of years. In late 2016 the State of Pennsylvania announced a new emissions program would be implemented in mid-2017. The program requires stations wishing to participate in the program purchase a new analyzer and that analyzer includes a gas cap tester. The Company is hopeful that most of the analyzer manufacturers will use the Hickok gas cap tester in their offerings. 

&#160; 

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials &#160; 

Raw materials essential to the business are acquired from a large number of United States of America manufacturers and some materials are now purchased from European and Southeast Asian sources. Materials acquired from the electronic components industry include transistors, integrated circuits, resistors, capacitors, switches, potentiometers, micro controllers, and other passive parts. Fabricated metal or plastic parts are generally purchased from local suppliers or manufactured by the Company from raw materials. In general, the required materials are available, if ordered with sufficient lead times, from multiple sources at current prices. 

&#160; 

Federal Hose uses various materials in the manufacture of its products, including steel fittings and hose packing consisting of silicone, cotton and copper wire. Two suppliers provide over 50% of Federal Hose&#8217;s inventory purchases. If any one of these sources of supply were interrupted for any reason, Federal Hose would need to devote additional time and expense in obtaining the same volume of supply from its other qualified sources. The Company believes it has adequate sources of supply for its primary raw materials and components and has not had difficulty in obtaining the raw materials, component parts or finished goods from its suppliers. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Importance of Patents, Licenses, Franchises, Trademarks and Concessions &#160; 

The Company presently has several patents that relate to several of its products. The Company believes that its position in the industry is dependent upon its present level of engineering skill, research, sales relationships, production techniques and service. The Company has several basic methodology patents related to products it offers that it considers very important to future revenue. Of the Company's most critical patents, one is related to the testing of evaporative emissions systems that was the basis for the Company's product offering for the State of California. This patent expires in the year 2022. Another critical patent is related to vehicle fuel cap testing which expires in 2018. The Company monitors the marketplace for infringement of its patents and intends to pursue its rights should an infringement take place. The Company is currently engaged in such a proceeding, and has recently agreed to settle this matter. See Item 3 Legal Proceedings. Other than the names "Hickok", "Waekon", and &#8220;Federal Hose&#8221; the Company does not have any material licenses, trademarks, franchises or concessions. 

&#160; 

Seasonality &#160; 

The Company believes that there is a seasonality to the automotive aftermarket revenues. Typically, the first and fourth quarters tend to be weaker than the other two quarters in this market. Orders for OEM or emissions testing products are primarily subject to customer timing requirements and have no known seasonality aspect to them. As a result, operating results can fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year. In light of the markets served by its products, the Company does not believe that its Federal Hose business is seasonal in nature. 

&#160;

Practices Relative to Working Capital Items &#160; 

The nature of the Company's business requires it to maintain sufficient levels of inventory to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers. The Company provides its customers with payment terms prevalent in the industry. 

&#160; 

Dependence on Single or Few Customers &#160; 

Several aftermarket distribution companies and several equipment OEMs have become significant sources of revenue for the Company. Sales in fiscal 2016 to Bosch, a Tier 1 supplier to numerous OEMs, was approximately $1,306,000 or 20% of the consolidated sales of the Company. In fiscal 2015 sales to Bosch amounted to approximately $2,158,000 or 37% of the consolidated sales of the Company. Sales in fiscal 2014 to Bosch amounted to approximately $2,768,000 or 44% of the consolidated sales of the Company. The Company does not have exclusive supply agreements or long-term contractual relationships with these large customers. 

&#160; 

Backlog 

The Company's order backlog as of September 30, 2016, totaled $953,000 as compared to $648,000 as of September 30, 2015, and $539,000 as of September 30, 2014. The increase in fiscal 2016 was primarily related to the acquisition of Federal Hose as approximately $366,000 of the increase was directly related to the addition of this segment. The increase in fiscal 2015 versus 2014 was due primarily to increased orders for automotive diagnostic products orders to OEM's of approximately $122,000. 

&#160; 

Government Contract Renegotiation 

No major portion of the business is open to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the United States Government. The amount of revenue derived from government contracts is currently minimal and not material. 

&#160; 

Competitive Conditions 

The Company is engaged in highly competitive industries and faces competition from domestic and international firms. Several of the Company's competitors have greater financial resources and larger sales organizations than the Company. Competition with respect to the Company's diagnostic tool business arises from the existence of a number of other significant manufacturers in the field, such as Bosch and Snap-On, which dominate the available market in terms of total sales. The instrumentation industry is composed primarily of companies that specialize in the production of particular items as compared to a full line of instruments. The Company believes that its competitive position in this field is in the area of smaller, specialized products, an area in which the Company has operated and in which the Company has established itself competitively by offering high-quality, high-performance products in comparison to high-volume, mass-produced items. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s automotive segment depends on the automotive industry for sales of its OEM and aftermarket products. The Company anticipates that it will continue to face significant challenges due to competition. The OEM market tends to be driven by the need for new tools due to the introduction of new technologies in vehicles or excessive warranty costs. Because of dealership economics, OEMs are reluctant to require dealers to purchase service tools. The aftermarket is largely driven by the economics of fixing vehicles. During poor economic times, purchases can be delayed. Although aftermarket parts suppliers have done well during the past few years, aftermarket tool suppliers have not. The Company&#8217;s strategy of developing products that target the technician and low cost tools for shop use is an outgrowth of these realities in the marketplace. The Company believes substantial opportunities for growth depend primarily on the introduction of new and innovative products to the sectors served. In addition to automotive service products, the Company diversified some years ago into the emissions testing market. This market has also been depressed partially because EPA requirements for state emissions testing program requirements have changed and partially because state budgets have not allowed the implementation of new testing programs. The Company briefly experienced improved sales of emissions products in part due to the discontinuance of certain emissions products by a competitor and we expect the market to remain at historical levels. 

&#160; 

Research and Development Activities &#160; 

The Company expensed as incurred product development costs of $1,050,157 in 2016, $1,015,414 in 2015, and $965,975 in 2014. These expenditures included engineering product support and development of manuals for both of the Company's business segments. In the Federal Hose segment research and development cost is minimal and not separated from other operating costs of the segment. 

&#160; 

Compliance with Environmental Provisions &#160; 

The Company's capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position are not materially affected by compliance with federal, state and local environmental provisions which have been enacted or adopted to regulate the distribution of materials into the environment. 

&#160; 

Number of Persons Employed &#160; 

Total employment by the Company at September 30, 2016 was 95 full-time employees which represents an increase from 83 employees in fiscal 2015. The increase in employees was solely due to the acquisition of Federal Hose in 2016. Full time employees were 87 in fiscal 2014. None of the employees are represented by a union. The Company considers its relations with its employees to be good. 

&#160; 

Financial Information Concerning Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales &#160; 

During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, all manufacturing, research and development and administrative operations were conducted in the United States of America. Revenues derived from export sales approximated $125,000 in 2016, $174,000 in 2015, and $156,000 in 2014. Shipments to Australia, Canada, England, Mexico and Taiwan make up the majority of export sales.
