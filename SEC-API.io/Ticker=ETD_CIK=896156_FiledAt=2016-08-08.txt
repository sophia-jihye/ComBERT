Operating Segments 

&#160; 

Our products are sold through a dedicated global network of approximately 300 retail design centers. As of June 30, 2016, the Company operated 143 design centers (our retail segment) and our independent retailers operated 153 design centers (as compared to 144 and 155, respectively, at the end of the prior fiscal year). Our wholesale segment net sales include sales to our retail segment (which are eliminated in consolidation), and sales to our independent retailers. Our retail segment net sales accounted for 79% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2016. Our wholesale segment net sales to independent retailers accounted for 21%, including approximately 10.5% of our net sales in fiscal 2016 to the ten largest independent retailers, who operate 102 design centers. Our independent retailer in China operated 83 of these locations at the end of fiscal 2016. 

&#160; &#160; 

Our wholesale and retail operating segments represent strategic business areas of our vertically integrated business that operate separately and provide their own distinctive services (further outlined below). This vertical structure enables us to offer our complete line of home furnishings and accents more effectively while controlling quality and cost. For certain financial information regarding our operating segments, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Annual Report and incorporated herein by reference. 

&#160; 

Our home furnishings and accents are marketed and sold in a similar manner in our wholesale and retail segments, although the type of customer (wholesale versus retail) and the specific services that each operating segment provides are different. Within the wholesale segment, we maintain revenue information according to each respective product line (i.e. case goods, upholstery, or home accents and other). Case goods include items such as beds, dressers, armoires, tables, chairs, buffets, entertainment units, home office furniture, and wooden accents. Upholstery items include sleepers, recliners and other motion furniture, chairs, ottomans, custom pillows, sofas, loveseats, cut fabrics and leather. Skilled artisans cut, sew and upholster custom-designed upholstery items which are available in a variety of frame, fabric and trim options. Home accent and other items include window treatments and drapery hardware, wall decor, florals, lighting, clocks, mattresses, bedspreads, throws, pillows, decorative accents, area rugs, wall coverings and home and garden furnishings. 

&#160; 

We evaluate performance of the respective segments based upon revenues and operating income. Inter-segment transactions result, primarily, from the wholesale sale of inventory to the retail segment, including the related profit margin.

The wholesale segment, principally involved in the development of the Ethan Allen brand, encompasses all aspects of design, manufacture, sourcing, sale, and distribution of our broad range of home furnishings and accents. Wholesale revenue is generated upon the wholesale sale and shipment of our products to our network of independently operated design centers and Company operated design centers (see Company operated retail comments below) through its national distribution center and one other smaller fulfillment center. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

ETHAN ALLEN INTERIORS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES &#160;

&#160;

During the past year, independent retailers opened 15 new design centers and closed 16, two of which were relocations. We continue to promote the growth and expansion of our independent retailers through ongoing support in the areas of market analysis, site selection, and business development. As in the past, our independent retailers are required to enter into license agreements with us, which (i) authorize the use of certain Ethan Allen trademarks and (ii) require adherence to certain standards of operation, including a requirement to fulfill related warranty service agreements. We are not subject to any territorial or exclusive retailer agreements in North America. The wholesale segment also develops and implements related marketing and brand awareness programs. 

&#160; 

Wholesale profitability includes (i) the wholesale gross margin, which represents the difference between the wholesale net sales price and the cost associated with manufacturing and/or sourcing the related product, and (ii) other operating costs associated with wholesale segment activities. 

&#160; 

Approximately 75% of the products sold by the Company are manufactured in its North American plants. During fiscal 2016, the Company&#8217;s case goods manufacturing footprint increased 59,000 square feet, further increasing throughput in our Honduras facility. In our upholstery plants in Maiden, North Carolina we expanded production capacity and built a new R&#38;D facility. A 300,000 square foot expansion is underway at our upholstery plant in Mexico which we anticipate completing during fiscal 2017. We operate four case good plants (two in Vermont including one sawmill, one in North Carolina, and one in Honduras), four upholstery plants (three at our North Carolina campus, and one in Mexico) and one home accent plant in New Jersey. We also source selected case goods, upholstery, and home accent items from third-party suppliers domestically and abroad. 

&#160; 

As of June 30, 2016, our wholesale backlog was $40.3 million (as compared to $63.7 million as of June 30, 2015) which is anticipated to be serviced in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. This backlog fluctuates based on the timing of net orders booked, manufacturing schedules and efficiency, the timing of sourced product receipts, the timing and volume of wholesale shipments, and the timing of various promotional events. Because orders may be rescheduled and/or canceled and the sourcing timing may change, the measure of backlog at a point in time is not necessarily indicative of future sales performance. 

&#160; 

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2016, net orders booked at the wholesale level, which includes orders generated by independently operated and Company operated design centers, totaled $470.7 million as compared to $487.4 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2015. In any given period, net orders booked may be impacted by the timing of floor sample orders received in connection with new product introductions. New product offerings may be made available to the retail network at any time during the year, including in connection with our periodic retailer conferences.

Retail net sales for each of the last three fiscal years, allocated by product line, were as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; Fiscal Year Ended June 30,

The retail segment sells home furnishings and accents to consumers through a network of Company operated design centers. The Company also offers access to its products to qualified independent interior designers through our interior design affiliate (&#8220;IDA&#8221;) program. Retail revenue is generated upon the retail sale and delivery of our products to our retail customers through our network of service centers. Retail profitability reflects (i) the retail gross margin, which represents the difference between the retail net sales price and the cost of goods, purchased primarily from the wholesale segment, and (ii) other operating costs associated with retail segment activities. 

&#160; 

We measure the performance of our design centers based on net sales and written orders booked on a comparable period basis. Comparable design centers are those which have been operating for at least 15 months. During the first three months of operations of newly opened (including relocated) design centers, written orders are booked but minimal net sales are achieved through the delivery of products. Design centers we acquire from independent retailers are included in comparable design center sales in their 13th full month of Ethan Allen-owned operations. The frequency of our promotional events as well as the timing of the end of those events can also affect the comparability of orders booked during a given period. 

&#160; 

We pursue further expansion of the Company operated retail business by adding interior design professionals and expanding the IDA program, opening new design centers, relocating existing design centers and, when appropriate, acquiring design centers from independent retailers. During fiscal 2016 our reach was expanded further through our launch of our gift registry, and through establishing licensing arrangements with Disney Consumer Products, an affiliate program with the Army and Air Force Exchange Service and marketing agreements with several leading national real estate brokerages. During fiscal 2016, we opened ten new design centers, six of which were relocations. The geographic distribution of retail design center locations is included under Item 2 of Part I of this Annual Report. 

&#160; 

Products 

&#160; 

Our strategy has been to position Ethan Allen as a preferred brand offering complimentary design service together with products of superior style, quality and value to provide consumers with a comprehensive, one-stop shopping solution for their home furnishing and interior design needs. In carrying out our strategy, we continue to expand our reach to a broader consumer base through a diverse selection of attractively priced products, designed to complement one another, reflecting current fashion trends in home decorating. During fiscal 2016, the Company continued to strengthen its product offerings by introducing new products to retail consumers in case goods, upholstery, and home accents, by introducing a very large collection of new products and existing products in new finishes under the umbrella of &#8220;Romantic Classics&#8221;, &#8220;Casual Classics&#8221;, and the expansion of our custom quick-ship program. Much of our furniture is built by hand, one piece at a time, in our North American workshops. Most frames are hand-assembled and stitching is guided by hand. We select international partners who are as committed to quality as we are. All case good frames are made with premium lumber and veneers. We use best-in-class construction techniques, including mortise and tenon joinery and four-corner glued dovetail joinery on drawers. We combine technology with personal service and maintain an up-to-date broad range of styles and custom options in keeping with today&#8217;s home decorating trends. These factors continue to define Ethan Allen, positioning us as a leader in home fashion. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

ETHAN ALLEN INTERIORS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

&#160; 

The interior of our design centers, which were substantially refreshed during the past two fiscal years, are organized to facilitate display of our product offerings, both in room settings that project the category lifestyle and by product grouping to facilitate comparisons of the styles and tastes of our clients. To further enhance the experience, technology is used to expand the range of products viewed by including content from our website in applications used on large touch-screen flat panel displays. 

&#160; 

We continuously monitor changes in home fashion trends through attendance at international industry events and fashion shows, internal market research, and regular communication with our retailers and design center design consultants who provide valuable input on consumer trends. We believe that the observations and input gathered enable us to incorporate appropriate style details into our products to react quickly to changing consumer tastes. 

&#160;

Product Development and Sourcing Activities 

&#160; 

Using a combination of on staff and outsourced product designers, we design the majority of the products we sell; all of which are branded Ethan Allen. This important facet of our vertically integrated business enables us to control the design specifications and establish consistent levels of quality across the products in our own North American plants. To capitalize on this vertical integration, between the fall of 2014 and the spring of 2016, the Company undertook a significant redesign of products. Much of the product design took advantage of the Company&#8217;s custom manufacturing capabilities in its North American plants, where we manufacture and / or assemble approximately 75% of the products we sell, making us one of the largest manufacturers of home furnishings in the United States. Our main manufacturing facilities are located in the Northeast and Southeast regions of the United States supported by an upholstery plant in Mexico and a case goods plant in Honduras. Our plants are located near sources of raw materials and skilled artisans. We source approximately 25% of the products we sell from third-party suppliers, most of which are located outside the United States, primarily in Asia. We carefully select our sourcing partners and require them to provide products according to our specifications and quality standards. We believe that strategic investments in our manufacturing facilities balanced with outsourcing from foreign and domestic suppliers will accommodate significant future sales growth and allow us to maintain an appropriate degree of control over cost, quality and service to our customers. 

&#160; 

We are focused on environmental and social responsibility and incorporating uniform environment, health and safety programs into our manufacturing standards. Our &#8220;green&#8221; initiatives include but are not limited to the use of responsibly harvested Appalachian woods, water based finishes and measuring our carbon footprint, greenhouse gases and recycled materials from our operations. We have implemented the Enhancing Furniture&#8217;s Environmental Culture (EFEC) environmental management system sponsored by the American Home Furnishing Alliance (AHFA) at all of our domestic manufacturing, distribution and service center facilities, and have begun to expand these effort to our retail design centers. Our domestic manufacturing, distribution and service centers have also achieved Sustainable by Design (SBD) registration under the EFEC program. Our Silao Mexico facility has also been audited and registered under the AHFA&#39;s EFEC program. SBD provides a framework for home furnishings companies to create and maintain a corporate culture of conservation and environmental stewardship by integrating socio-economic policies and sustainable business practices into their manufacturing operations and sourcing strategies. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials and Other Suppliers 

&#160; 

The most important raw materials we use in furniture manufacturing are lumber, veneers, plywood, hardware, glue, finishing materials, glass, laminates, fabrics, foam, and filling material. The various types of wood used in our products include cherry, ash, oak, maple, prima vera, African mahogany, birch, rubber wood and poplar. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

ETHAN ALLEN INTERIORS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES &#160; 

&#160;

Fabrics and other raw materials are purchased both domestically and outside the United States. We have no significant long-term supply contracts, and have sufficient alternate sources of supply to prevent disruption in supplying our operations. We maintain a number of sources for our raw materials, which we believe contribute to our ability to obtain competitive pricing. Lumber prices and availability fluctuate over time based on factors such as weather and demand. The cost of some of our raw materials such as foam and shipping costs are dependent on petroleum cost. Higher material prices, cost of petroleum, and costs of sourced products could have an adverse effect on margins. 

&#160; 

Appropriate amounts of lumber and fabric inventory are typically stocked to maintain adequate production levels. We believe that our sources of supply for these materials are sufficient and that we are not dependent on any one supplier. 

&#160; 

We enter into standard purchase agreements with certain foreign and domestic suppliers to source selected case goods, upholstery, and home accent items. The terms of these arrangements are customary for the industry and do not contain any long-term contractual obligations on our behalf. We believe we maintain good relationships with our suppliers. 

&#160; &#160; 

Distribution and Logistics 

&#160; 

We distribute our products through three distribution centers, owned by the Company, strategically located in New Jersey, Oklahoma, and Virginia. These distribution centers provide efficient cross-dock operations to receive and ship product from our manufacturing facilities and third-party suppliers to our network of Company and independently operated retail service centers. Retail service centers prepare products for delivery into clients&#8217; homes. At June 30, 2016, the Company operated retail design centers were supported by 13 Company operated retail service centers and 14 service centers operated by third parties. 

&#160; 

While we manufacture to custom order the majority of our products, we also stock selected case goods, upholstery and home accents to provide for quick delivery of in-stock items and to allow for more efficient production runs. Wholesale shipments utilize our own fleet of trucks and trailers or are subcontracted with independent carriers. Our fleet of trucks are financed under capital lease agreements with remaining terms ranging from less than two to over three years, and all of our trailers are owned. 

&#160; 

Our practice has been to sell our products at the same delivered cost to all Company and independently operated design centers in North America, regardless of their shipping point. This policy creates pricing credibility with our wholesale customers while providing our retail network the opportunity to achieve more consistent margins by removing fluctuations attributable to the cost of shipping. Further, this policy eliminates the need for our independent retailers to carry significant amounts of inventory in their own warehouses. As a result, we obtain more accurate consumer product demand information. 

&#160; 

Marketing Programs 

&#160; 

Our marketing and advertising strategies are developed to drive traffic into our network of design centers and to ethanallen.com. We believe these strategies give Ethan Allen a strong competitive advantage in the home furnishings industry. We create and coordinate print, digital and television campaigns nationally, as well as assist in international and local marketing and promotional efforts. The Company&#8217;s network of approximately 300 retail design centers, along with the over 6,000 independent members of the Interior Design Affiliate program, benefit from these marketing efforts, and we believe these efforts position us to consistently fulfill our brand promise as America&#39;s Classic Design Brand. 

&#160; 

Our team of advertising specialists creates consistent, clear messages that Ethan Allen is a leader in home fashion, designer services and classic style, with everything for the well designed home. We use several forms of media to communicate our message, including social media, digital advertising, television (national and local), direct mail, newspapers and national shelter magazines. These messages are also conveyed on our website at ethanallen.com. A strong email marketing program delivers promotional messages, inspiration, design ideas and product brochures to a growing database of clients. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

ETHAN ALLEN INTERIORS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

&#160; 

Our national television, social media, online and print advertising campaigns are designed to leverage our strong brand equity, finding creative and compelling ways to remind consumers of our tremendous range of products, services, special programs, and custom options. Coordinated local digital, television and print advertising also serve to support our national programs. 

&#160; 

The Ethan Allen direct mail magazine, which emphasizes the eclectic mix of our wide breadth of products and services, is a key marketing tool. We publish these magazines and sell them to Company and independently operated design centers that use demographic information collected internally and through independent market research to target potential clients. Given the importance of this advertising medium, direct mail marketing lists are continually refined to target those consumers who are most likely to purchase, and improve the return on direct mail expenditures. Approximately 23 million copies of our direct mail magazine were distributed to consumers during fiscal 2016. 

&#160; 

At ethanallen.com we provide our clients and our associates with the tools they need to shop, design and buy. The website features inspiring photography, engaging video content, and all our latest news and promotional information. This year we launched an enhanced user experience and streamlined the path to purchase by updating the designs to our category pages, product types, and checkout. 

&#160; 

Ethan Allen also has local websites in various international regions to support our international licensees. These websites, some in local languages, provide a regionalized presentation of the brand while also linking to our main website. 

&#160; 

We l aunched an online specialty store in partnership with the Army and Air Force Exchange Service. The specialty online store accessible through shopmyexchange.com is an Exchange members-only website. The Army and Air Force Exchange Service is dedicated to ensuring active and retired soldiers, airmen, and their families have access to U.S. goods and services, wherever they serve or live. 

&#160; 

To enhance the Ethan Allen client experience, our design centers have interactive touchscreens, where users can browse our full product catalog, check out hundreds of fully designed rooms, print product descriptions, learn about promotions, and much more. Our design consultants utilize customized tablets so they can be more productive in our design centers and in our clients&#8217; homes. 

&#160; 

Our social media platforms offer fans and followers inspirational images, trend information, and design ideas, as well as tips for how to bring distinctive Ethan Allen style to their homes. We have a robust and loyal following on Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, LinkedIn and Houzz. Our products are available to buy on Pinterest where we were one of the first brands to launch with Pinterest&#8217;s buyable pins program. 

&#160; 

Our new mover and marketing program with major realtors brings Ethan Allen into targeted homes at the moment homeowners are most likely in the market for new furnishings. This program educates qualified consumers about our services and product offerings and is an extension of our designers&#8217; grassroots marketing efforts. 

&#160; 

We also have a robust and informative extranet available to our retailers and design professionals. It is the primary source of communication in and among members of our retail network. It provides information about every aspect of the retail business at Ethan Allen, including advertising materials, prototype floor plan displays, and extensive product details. 

&#160; 

Retail Design Center Network 

&#160; 

Ethan Allen design centers are typically located in busy retail settings as freestanding destinations or as part of suburban strip malls or shopping malls, depending upon the real estate opportunities in a particular market. Our design centers average approximately 16,000 square feet in size with 75% between 15,000 and 25,000 square feet and 20% less than 15,000 square feet and 5% greater than 25,000 square feet. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

ETHAN ALLEN INTERIORS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

&#160; 

Combining technology with personal service in our design centers has allowed us to reduce the size of our design centers. At June 30, 2016 we operated 19 design centers that have opened in the past three years, and these average 8,700 square feet. These smaller footprint design centers reflect our direction as we move forward in repositioning our retail design center network. These new and relocated design centers also reflect our shift from destination and shopping mall locations to lifestyle centers that better project our brand and offer increased traffic opportunities. &#160; 

&#160; 

We maintain consistency of presentation throughout the retail design center network through a comprehensive set of standards and display planning assistance. These interior display design standards assist each design center in presenting a high quality image by using focused lifestyle settings and select product category groupings to display our products and information to facilitate design solutions and to educate consumers. We also create a consistent brand projection through our exterior facades and signage. The establishment of these standards has helped position Ethan Allen as a leader in home furnishings retailing. 

&#160; 

We continue to strengthen the retail network with many initiatives, including the opening of new and relocating design centers in desirable locations, updating presentations and floor plans, strengthening of the professionalism of our designers through training and certification, and the consolidation of certain design centers and service centers. 

&#160; 

People 

&#160; 

At June 30, 2016, the Company , through its subsidiaries, had approximately 5,200 employees (&#8220;associates&#8221;), none of whom are represented by unions. We believe we maintain good relationships with our employees. 

&#160; 

The retail network, which includes both Company subsidiaries and independently operated design centers, is staffed with a sales force of interior design consultants and service professionals who provide customers with complimentary home decorating and interior design solutions. Our interior design associates receive specialty training with respect to the distinctive design and quality features inherent in each of our products and programs. This enables them to more effectively communicate the elements of style and value that serve to differentiate us from our competition. As such, we believe our design consultants, and the complimentary service they provide, create a distinct competitive advantage over other home furnishing retailers. We continue to strengthen the level of service, professionalism, interior design competence, efficiency, and effectiveness of retail design center associates. The Company&#8217;s interior design affiliate program adds further strength and breadth to our interior design reach. We believe that this program augments the design center design staff to reach more clients and improve market penetration. 

&#160; 

We recognize the importance of our retail design center network to our long-term success. Accordingly, we believe we (i) have established a strong management team within Company operated design centers and (ii) continue to work closely with our independent retailers in order to assist them. With this in mind, we make our services available to every design center, whether independently operated or Company operated, in support of their marketing efforts, including coordinated advertising, merchandising and display programs, and by providing extensive training seminars and educational materials. We believe that the development of design consultants, service and delivery personnel, and independent retailers is important for the growth of our business. As a result, we have committed to make available comprehensive retail training programs intended to increase the customer service capabilities of each individual.

Competition 

&#160; 

The domestic and global home furnishings industry faces numerous challenges, which include an influx of low-priced products from overseas. As a result, there is a high degree of competition in our markets. We differentiate ourselves as a preferred brand by adhering to a business strategy focused on providing (i) high-quality, well designed and often custom, handmade products at good value, (ii) a comprehensive complement of home furnishing design solutions, including our complimentary design service, and (iii) excellence in customer service. We consider our vertical integration a significant competitive advantage in the current environment as it allows us to design, manufacture and source, distribute, market, and sell our products through one of the industry&#8217;s largest single-source retail networks. 

&#160; 

The internet also provides a highly competitive medium for the sale of a significant amount of home furnishings each year, and we believe it is becoming increasingly important. Although much of that product is sold through commodity oriented, low priced and low service retailers, we believe consumers are spending more time window shopping on the internet and are thus better informed when they do visit our brick and mortar facilities. At Ethan Allen, the ultimate goal of our internet strategy is to drive traffic into our network of design centers by combining technology with excellent personal service. At ethanallen.com, customers have the opportunity to buy our products online but we take the process further. With so much of our product offering being custom, we encourage our website customers to get help from our network of interior design professionals. This complimentary interior design support creates a competitive advantage through our excellent personal service. This enhances the online experience and regularly leads to internet customers becoming clients of our network of interior design centers. 

&#160; 

Industry globalization has provided us an opportunity to adhere to a blended sourcing strategy, establishing relationships with certain manufacturers, both domestically and outside the United States, to source selected case goods, upholstery, and home accent items. We intend to continue to balance our own North American production with opportunities to source from foreign and domestic manufacturers, as appropriate, in order to maintain our competitive advantage. 

&#160; 

We believe the home furnishings industry competes primarily on the basis of product styling and quality, personal service, prompt delivery, product availability and price. We further believe that we effectively compete on the basis of each of these factors and that, more specifically, our direct manufacturing, product presentations, website, and complimentary design service create a distinct competitive advantage, further supporting our mission of providing consumers with a complete home decorating and design solution. We also believe that we differentiate ourselves further with the quality of our design service through our intensive training. Our objective is to continue to develop and strengthen our retail network by (i) expanding the Company operated retail business through the repositioning of and opening of new design centers, and (ii) obtaining and retaining independent retailers, encouraging such retailers to expand their business through the opening or relocation of new design centers with the objective of increasing the volume of their sales (iii) further expanding our sales network through our IDA and realtor referral programs and (iv) further expanding our ecommerce.
