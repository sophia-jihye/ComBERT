 Item 1. Business.

&#160;

In this Report, we use the terms &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;XsunX,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our,&#8221; unless otherwise indicated, or the context otherwise requires, to refer to XsunX, Inc.

Organization

XsunX, Inc. (&#8220;XsunX,&#8221; the &#8220;Company&#8221; or the &#8220;issuer&#8221;) is a Colorado corporation formerly known as Sun River Mining Inc. &#8220;Sun River&#8221;). The Company was originally incorporated in Colorado on February 25, 1997. Effective September 24, 2003, the Company completed a plan of reorganization and name change to XsunX, Inc.

&#160;

Business Overview/Summary

&#160;

XsunX specializes in the sale, design, and installation of solar photovoltaic power generation (PV), and energy saving technologies to provide our clients long term savings, predictability, and control of their energy costs. Making solar energy a good investment for our clients is our mission.

&#160;

We service the commercial and residential PV markets in California providing project assessment and installation services to our customers including technology selection, system engineering, procurement, permitting, construction, grid connection, warranty, system monitoring and maintenance. We offer a wide variety of energy production and management technologies, design our systems in-house to ensure that the performance of the systems we deliver match the financial projections, and our full time project management and licensed assembly crews ensure a seamless process, from start to finish.

The Company operates as licensed contractor in California, and our executive management provides over 30 years of extensive experience in all aspects of construction and project assembly to ensure the accuracy and quality of systems, the continued integrity of the improved building or site, and compliance with all construction codes.

We guide our performance by striving to deliver consistently on the following core objectives:

&#9679; Commitment &#8211; &#160; to keeping the customer&#8217;s best interests at the forefront at all times; and,

&#9679; Value &#8211; &#160; through a focus &#160; on performance and follow through that meets or exceeds customer expectations.

Recent Developments

In the 2016 period we began to focus our marketing efforts on the sale and delivery of commercial solar carport, truckport, and covered storage canopy systems. While we believe that commercial and residential rooftop solar will continue to offer sales growth opportunities, non-residential solar canopy systems can, in many instances, provide the opportunity to offer customers diverse installation options, larger project sizing, greater electricity savings, and the ability to differentiate XsunX from competitors.

To support a competitive advantage in the solar canopy market we have established in-house capabilities to design, directly source all of the major system components, and deliver solar canopy systems allowing us to eliminate reliance on costly third party specialty subcontractors whom we believe the majority of our competitors rely on. This has allowed us to reduce our solar canopy structure installation costs by approximate 35%, and this savings in turn provides us with an average overall PV system cost reduction of approximately 15% which, we believe, provides us with a distinct pricing advantage for solar canopies within the California markets that we serve.

We plan to continue to focus the majority of our marketing efforts on the advantages offered through our solar canopy products.

Market Drivers for Solar Power

&#160;

We believe that a significant demand for solar power energy solutions is developing as a result of following drivers:

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

&#160;

Solar provides the ability to control and predict future energy costs . Our customers invest in the ability to self-generate power to offset and/or eliminate the purchase of third party utility provided electric energy. These investments provide predictability and control of energy costs, and can significantly reduce overall energy costs while insulating clients from rising retail electricity prices.

&#160;

&#8226;

&#160;

Maturity and dependability of solar technologies . The results and benefits from investments in solar power systems have produced extensive statistical performance data. This historical performance data allows investment benefits for near and long term future operations to be accurately estimated. This provides customers greater reliance on future results, and the confidence to make investments in solar.

&#160;

&#8226;

&#160;

Rapid capital recovery of solar investments . Reports provided by U.S. Energy Department continue to indicate that the installed price reductions for solar PV systems are driving record installation demand. These cost reductions for the major components that make up PV systems allow us to provide per watt pricing that, coupled with tax and operating benefits, can often result in capital investment recovery within 3 to 4 years.

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

&#160;

Government Incentives. Helping to further facilitate the market for investments into solar power are Federal, State, and local government tax and investment incentives. Federal, state and local government bodies provide incentives to owners, operators, and end users of solar energy systems to promote solar energy in the form of rebates, tax credits, exclusion of solar energy systems from property tax assessments and, to a diminishing degree, other financial incentives such as system performance payments , payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and. These incentives help to drive customer acceptance of solar energy as an alternative to utility-provided power.

&#160;

The Federal government currently offers a 30% Investment Tax Credit (&#8220;ITC&#8221;) under Section 48(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, or the ITC, for the installation of certain solar power facilities until December 31, 2016. By statute, this tax credit was scheduled to decrease to 10% on January 1, 2017, but was extended in December by Congress through 2019, after which it will fall to 26 percent in 2020, 22 percent in 2021 and 10 percent in 2022.

&#160;

The investment economics for purchasing a solar energy system are also increased through its eligibility for accelerated depreciation, also known as the modified accelerated cost recovery system, or MACRS, depreciation, which allows for the depreciation of equipment according to an accelerated schedule set forth by the Internal Revenue Service. This acceleration of the investment depreciation creates a valuable tax benefit that reduces the overall cost of the solar energy system and improves the return on solar investment.

Company Operations

What We Do

&#160;

XsunX specializes in the sale, design, and installation of solar photovoltaic power generation (PV), and energy saving technologies to provide our clients long term savings, predictability, and control of their energy costs. Making solar energy a good investment for our clients is our mission.

&#160;

Our customer relationship development begins with a financial analysis providing estimated investment benefits detailing the first twenty five years of a solar power systems life span. Through this process we tailor our system designs to maximize the financial benefits and returns for each customer. Our strategy is to develop and deliver systems that can provide the client with the greatest benefits. We then focus on 100% customer satisfaction through consistently matching customer expectations with our performance, and the delivery of our systems.

&#160;

The key elements of our approach include:

&#160;

&#8226;

&#160;

Lead Generation . We market our services utilizing efforts that include internet marketing, website, search engine optimization, direct mailer campaigns, and customer referrals. Our sales development efforts work with prospective customers from initial interest through tailored proposals and, ultimately, signed contracts.

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

&#160;

Detailed Investment Analysis . We use information related to our customer&#8217;s energy usage, costs, planned operations, and tax basis to determine optimal solar system and investment sizing. We combine this data and provide customers with 25 year investment projections that detail capital recovery expectations, system performance and energy savings, tax and operating benefits, and property re-sale value improvement estimates.

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

&#160;

Financing . We have established relationships with lenders and have been approved to offer their finance options to prospective customers. Through our lender association network we offer customers financing options that include commercial equipment loans, lease options, power purchase agreements (PPA&#8217;s), PACE &#38; HERO financing through property tax assessment, and we offer clients the option to apply tax or local utility incentives towards system purchase buy-downs thereby reducing up front out of pocket expenditures or the amount of capital financed.

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

&#160;

Design &#38; Engineering . To ensure accuracy we perform our site surveys directly and do not rely on third party services. We then finalize designs that will match proposed financial results, and work with a highly skilled team of qualified engineers with extensive commercial solar experience to ensure compliance with all codes, and best practices for the solar system operation.

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

&#160;

Installation . We make the installation process simple for our customers. Once we complete the design and engineering of a solar energy system, we obtain all necessary building permits. Then, as the general contractor and construction manager, we provide all materials and components and use qualified licensed contractors with commercial and solar experience to provide on-site assembly of solar systems, utility interconnections, and roofing or structural work. We manage and ensure local building department approvals, and arrange for interconnection to the power grid with the utility.

&#160;

&#160;

&#8226;

&#160;

Monitoring, Maintenance, and Service . We provide our customers with real-time facility wide monitoring of solar energy generation, and facility wide energy consumption. In addition to providing clients with a better understanding of their energy usage, and the opportunity to modify their usage to realize savings, these monitoring systems allow us to confirm the continuing proper operation of installed solar energy systems. We also service what we sell and provide customers with a single source for all system maintenance or warranty coordination and service.

&#160;

Customers

&#160;

The majority of our revenue comes from installations of commercial solar systems in California. Approximately 90% of our sales in 2016 were in the commercial market and approximately 10% were generated by residential sales. We anticipate that through our expanding efforts to promote the sale of our solar canopy offerings revenues for commercial sales will continue to outpace residential sales through the 2017 period.

&#160;

Our commercial system sales service the needs of property owners installing systems typically larger than 20kW. However, system size and installation type can vary significantly in scope from rooftop solar only installations to solar rooftop and carport, truckport, or covered storage combined installations with integrated whole building energy management solutions. The average cycle time for commercial rooftop installs range approximately 6 to 8 weeks with solar canopies such as carports, truck ports, and covered storage requiring as much as twelve to twenty weeks due to additional permitting requirement and reviews. We help to facilitate financing options to fit the specific needs of each customer.

&#160;

Our residential sales address the needs of property owners typically installing systems smaller than 15kW. The average cycle time for residential rooftop installs is approximately 6 weeks. We help to facilitate financing options to fit the specific needs of each customer.

&#160;

Sales, Marketing, and Planned Operations

&#160;

We have focused our sales efforts and operations on the delivery of commercial solar power systems in the California market. We believe that our focus provides us long term benefits for brand development as a commercial solar power specialist within a market that we believe to be in the early stages of growth, and poised for a broad adoption of solar power generation. 

We see this as a significant business development opportunity as management has the skillset associated with construction management, the licensing qualifications necessary for us to operate as a contractor in California, we have extensive experience associated with solar PV technologies and the design requirements associated with the delivery of a commercial solar power system, and there is a market demand available for us to provide these services to. We believe that these efforts will provide us with the fastest path to increasing revenue generation.

&#160;

In the 2016 period we began to focus our marketing efforts on the sale and delivery of commercial solar carport, truckport, and covered storage canopy systems. We have established in-house capabilities to design, directly source all of the major system components, manage the installation process, and deliver solar carport systems allowing us to eliminate reliance on costly third party specialty subcontractors whom we believe the majority of our competitors rely on. This elimination of dependency on a &#8220;middle man&#8221; has allowed us to reduce our solar canopy structure installation costs by approximate 35%. This reduction to structure installation costs can provide us with reductions to the overall PV system cost by approximately 15% which, we believe, provides us with a distinct pricing advantage for solar canopies within the California markets that we serve.

While the commercial and residential rooftop solar will continue to offer sales growth opportunities, we believe that our focus on non-residential solar canopy systems can, in many instances, provide us with opportunities to offer customers diverse installation options, larger project sizing, greater electricity savings, and the ability to differentiate XsunX from competitors.

We plan to continue to focus our marketing efforts in the 2017 period highlighting the advantages of the solar canopy investments through efforts that include web advertising, direct outside sales, targeted direct marketing, commissioned consultants, and the referral of satisfied customers. 

&#160;

Operations and Supply

&#160;

We purchase major components such as solar panels, inverters, and solar module mounting hardware directly from manufacturers and supply houses. When possible, we have establish direct factory purchasing relationships. We have selected these suppliers and components based on cost, reliability, warranty coverage, ease of installation, application design and suitability, and technology advantages.

&#160;

Additionally, to compete favorably we have establish relationships with lenders through which we can introduce financing options for the systems we design and install. These financing options provide an alternative cash management solution for our target customers, and a sales inducement to purchase systems.

&#160;

For the foreseeable future we anticipate that we will purchase the system components for each project on an as-needed basis from suppliers at the then-prevailing prices pursuant to purchase orders issued. Due to the volatility of component pricing we do not anticipate any supplier arrangements that will contain long-term pricing or volume commitments. Should our sales results, volume, and market conditions warrant we may in the future elect to make purchase commitments to ensure sufficient supply and reduced pricing of the components that we use.

&#160;

Our operations focus is to provide complete solar power project design, management of engineering, facility preparation, installation of systems, repair or restoration to all affected areas resulting from the installation process, and any ongoing maintenance agreements as may be sold. To accomplish this we use the services of licensed service professionals in each of the representative trades or specialties necessary. Additionally, we provide qualified staff to supervise project operations, inspections, and system start up and energizing. In the 2017 fiscal period we anticipate that the addition of direct delivery of solar carport systems will allow our sales to increase, and we plan to expand our direct project management capabilities through the addition of qualified field supervisory and engineering staff.

&#160;

Competition

&#160;

We compete with companies that offer solar and energy saving technologies. Many of these competitors have greater resources and access to broader national markets than we do. Our primary areas of competition in the California markets we serve are on pricing, the ability to deliver designs and technology integration that match client goals, service, and the ability to arrange financing. However, when competing for solar installation projects our experience has shown that there is no clear preferred competitor in the markets in which we compete. We also compete with traditional utilities who have well-established relationships with our target customers providing the ease of a status quo relationship without upfront investment costs. The advantages we offer over traditional utilities is that we offer customers the opportunity to create their own electricity, detach from the traditional electrical grid dependency, and create profitable long term investments in energy.

Intellectual Property

The following is an outline of certain patents and technologies we have developed, attempted to develop, have acquired, or licensed:

&#160;

The Company has previously worked to develop a hybrid manufacturing solution to produce high performance Copper Indium Gallium (di) Selenide (CIGS) thin film solar cells. Our technology, which we call CIGSolar&#174;, focuses on the mass production of individual thin-film CIGS solar cells that match silicon solar cell dimensions and could offered as a non-toxic, high-efficiency and lowest-cost alternative to the use of silicon solar cells.

In April 2012 we filed claims related to our thermal effusion source design. In October 2014 we received a Restriction Requirement from the United States Patent and Trademark Office that reports the results of the initial examination of the patent application. The examination by the USPTO asserts that the application is directed to two distinct inventions and has issued a restriction requirement. The term &#8220;restriction&#8221; is applied where the Examiner believes that two (2) or more inventions are separately claimed in the same patent application. Thus, by issuing the restriction requirement, the Examiner is asserting that our application covers more than one invention. 

&#160;

After completing a review of options related to modifying our patent application, and the limited market conditions related to the demand for thin film technologies, we elected to abandon our claims. We do not anticipate any further efforts related to filing or pursuing patent claims related to our prior thin film CIGS efforts.

&#160;

In September 2003, the Company was assigned the rights to three patents as part of an Asset Purchase Agreement with Xoptix Inc., a California corporation. The patents acquired were No. 6,180,871 for Transparent Solar Cell and Method of Fabrication (Device), granted on January 30, 2001; No. 6,320,117 for Transparent Solar Cell and Method of Fabrication (Method of Fabrication), granted on November 20, 2001; and No. 6,509,204 for Transparent Solar Cell and Method of Fabrication (formed with a Schottky barrier diode and method of its manufacture), granted on January 21, 2003. We do not currently employ nor envision the use of the above named patents in the development or commercialization of our CIGSolar&#174; technology. Because of technological and business developments within the solar industry, we believe that these patents no longer provide business opportunities for the Company to pursue.

On July 10, 2012, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued a certificate of registration No. 4,172,218 granting the Company a trademark for the use of &#8220;CIGSolar&#8221;.

We rely on trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have not been subject to any intellectual property claims.

Company History

XsunX is a Colorado corporation formerly known as Sun River Mining Inc. (&#8220;Sun River&#8221;). The Company was originally incorporated in Colorado on February 25, 1997. Effective September 24, 2003, the Company completed a Plan of Reorganization and Asset Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Plan&#8221;).

Pursuant to the Plan, the Company acquired the following three patents from Xoptix, Inc., a California corporation for Seventy Million (70,000,000) shares of common stock (post reverse split one for twenty): No. 6,180,871 for Transparent Solar Cell and Method of Fabrication (Device), granted on January 30, 2001; No. 6,320,117 for Transparent Solar Cell and Method of Fabrication (Method of Fabrication), granted on November 20, 2001; and No. 6,509,204 for Transparent Solar Cell and Method of Fabrication (formed with a Schottky barrier diode and method of its manufacture), granted on January 21, 2003.

Pursuant to the Plan, the Company authorized the issuance of 110,530,000 (post reverse split) common shares. Prior to the Plan, the Company had no tangible assets and insignificant liabilities. Subsequent to the Plan, the Company completed its name change from Sun River Mining, Inc. to XsunX, Inc. The transaction was completed on September 30, 2003.

Government Contracts

There are no government contracts as of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.

Compliance with Environmental Laws and Regulations

The operations of the Company are subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. Compliance with these regulations by the Company has required that, when necessary, we retain the use of engineering and design firms of systems related to equipment operations, and occupancy fire and safety construction standards to deal with compliance of safety standards. We do not anticipate that these costs will have a material effect on the Company&#8217;s operations or competitive position as these requirements apply to our competition as well, and the cost of such compliance is typically incorporated into projects costs. The Company is unable to assess or predict at this time what effect additional regulations or legislation could have on its activities.

&#160;

To operate our systems we obtain interconnection permission from the applicable local primary electric utility. Depending on the size of the solar energy system and local law requirements, interconnection permission is provided by the local utility. In almost all cases, interconnection permissions are issued on the basis of a standard process that has been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over net metering procedures. As such, no additional regulatory approvals are required once interconnection permission is given.

&#160;

Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws, including regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations. A primary area of compliance are the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, or OSHA, and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety.

Employees and Consultants

As of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, we had three full-time employees including Mr. Tom Djokovich who is President and CEO. While we do add to, and reduce, the size of our workforce based on current needs this represents no full-time employee change to the same period ended 2015. To compensate our need for additional staff the Company also relies on qualified consultants and licensed professionals to perform specific functions that otherwise would require an employee. As we continue to expand our business developments efforts we may need to add staff to adequately respond to sales inquiries, project management, and general labor as warranted. We consider relations with our employees and consultants to be good.

&#160;

Seasonality

Our operations can experience some seasonality for commercial sales with increased demand early and later in in each year. We believe that this trend may be related to late year project sales stemming from clients interest in accessing same year tax benefits for solar investments, and early year sales related to fiscal budgeting for energy projects that will be installed.
