 Item 1. Business. 

&#160;

Patriot Berry Farms, Inc. (&#8220;Patriot Berry&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 15, 2010 under the name of Gaia Remedies, Inc.). Since 2013, the Company has been in the business of acquiring and establishing profitable berry farms throughout the United States. The main focus of the Company has been on blueberry production with a secondary focus on strawberry and raspberry production. Patriot Berry has only received one year of revenue from its 2014 harvest of Morningstar farm, but has since sold the property due to financial restraints. Although still openly seeking investment to continue within the berry sector, the Company has received interest to potentially rebrand itself into a technology company and is currently considering its options to increase shareholder value. 

&#160;

On December 27, 2012, a change in control occurred as an officer and director of the Company purchased 54,400,000 shares of common stock of the Company&#8217;s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the &#8220;Common Stock&#8221;), of which 19,200,000 shares were subsequently voluntarily cancelled for no consideration. On January 28, 2013, the Company changed its name to Patriot Berry Farms, Inc. 

&#160;

An additional change in control occurred pursuant to a stock purchase agreement (the &#8220;Stock Purchase Agreement&#8221;), dated March 21, 2014, whereby the Company&#8217;s President and sole director sold 35,200,000 shares of Common Stock to Daniel Cattlin for an aggregate price of $20,000, which sale of common stock constituted a controlling interest in Company, or 50.5% of the Company&#8217;s then issued and outstanding common stock. In connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company&#8217;s former President, Alexander Houstoun-Boswall resigned from his positions of President, Chief Executive Officer, Treasurer, and member of the board of the directors, while remaining with the Company in the capacity of a business development consultant. The Company&#8217;s board of directors accepted the resignation of Mr. Houstoun-Boswall and appointed Mr. Cattlin to serve as the Company&#8217;s President, Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, Treasurer, and sole director of the Company.

Description of Business 

&#160;

On July 7, 2016, the Company received funding from its CEO in order to bring its SEC filings up to date and start seeking investment so that the Company can continue looking for possible acquisitions within the berry market. The CEO has been unable to secure the necessary investment to pursue this option and has since been contacted by a third party who is interested in supporting a rebrand of the Company into the technology sector. Extensive talks have occurred with this third party to potentially vend a software company into Patriot Berry once all its filings are current. The software company in question has developed content filtering software. No Letter of Intent or definitive agreement has been signed with this company and there is no assurance that an agreement will be signed with this company in the future. 

&#160;

There has been a very limited activity within the Company since September 2014 due to the fact that the Company has not been able to secure the necessary financing to sustain its operations. 

&#160;

Morningstar Farm 

&#160; 

On November 15, 2013, the Company closed on a contract for sale and purchase, dated August 27, 2013, with Douglas and Gail Harmon, for the purchase of an operational blueberry farm in Levy County, Florida (the &#8220;Morningstar Farm&#8221;). In accordance with the terms of the contract the Company paid $400,000, plus $2,765 in closing costs, for a total purchase price of $402,765. In conjunction with the acquisition of the Morningstar Farm, the Company originated a $280,000, non-interest bearing note payable with the seller. The terms of the promissory note require the Company to remit payments of principal in the amount of $20,000 in fourteen (14) equal monthly installments until paid in full. If payment has not been remitted on the first of each respective month, a late fee of $1,000 will be assessed. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

Due to financial restraints, the Company was not able to keep up payments on The Morningstar Farm which required the Company to sell the property on April 23, 2015 for $235,000 with the promise that all outstanding mortgage payments totaling $200,000 and outstanding costs for the farm upkeep, the farmer and the harvest would be forgiven. The sale of the Company&#8217;s sole asset allowed the Company&#8217;s to look at other potential opportunities both in and outside of its current sector. 

&#160; 

Exclusive Blueberry Sales Agreement

&#160;

While in possession of the Morningstar Farm, on April 4, 2014, the Company, through Douglas Harmon (the Grower), who was the Company&#8217;s Farm Manager (the Farm), entered into an exclusive sales agreement (the Agreement) with Dole Berry Company (Dole). Pursuant to the Agreement, Dole was acting as the exclusive sales agent of the Company to market and sell all of the blueberries produced from the Farm for a period of five (5) harvest years beginning January 1, 2014 until December 31, 2018 unless terminated earlier. The Company received advances equal to $1.00 per pound of finished product weight each week minus receiving and handling charges, as well as 10% commission to be paid to Dole. The Company agreed to pay to the Grower a commission equal to 2% of the revenues from the sales of finished products. 

&#160;

The Company had sales of $0, $117,120 and $0 for the year ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Sales in connection with the Agreement represented 88% of sales during the year ended March 31, 2015.

Berry Market Overview 

&#160;

Blueberries have been transformed from a niche market to a global commodity marked by increasing, year-round demand.

&#160;

While North America represents nearly 90% of the global production of blueberries, the US is the world's largest single producer, with 667.6 million pounds harvested in 2014 alone. In the US blueberries are the second most important berry crop, representing over 24% of the nation's $3.5 billion strawberry-blueberry-raspberry market.

&#160;

Driving the market is increased consumption by existing blueberry eaters, the introduction of new consumers, and market expansion into new domestic regions and growing export regions.

&#160;

In turn, the strength of the blueberry market represents many new opportunities, particularly in terms of improved grower economics and new end market users.

&#160;

Not surprisingly, US blueberry growers are highly optimistic about the long-term the future of what they consider an increasingly dynamic industry.

&#160;

Projects 

&#160;

May 2014 saw a successful end to Patriot Berry&#8217;s 2014 harvest, with its last batch of early-ripened Florida Blueberry&#8217;s being delivered to Dole Berry Company, LLC, on May 11th, 2014. The harvest, which commenced on April 16, 2014, amassed 32,196 lb.&#8217;s of Florida Blueberry&#8217;s, more than double when compared to 2012&#8217;s crop.

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

Due to Morningstar&#8217;s geographical position, (being placed in North-Central Florida), Patriot Berry Farm was able to benefit financially from the &#8216;Early Crop&#8217; Florida Blueberry Market, which for a six-week period supplies the United States with blueberries exclusively.
