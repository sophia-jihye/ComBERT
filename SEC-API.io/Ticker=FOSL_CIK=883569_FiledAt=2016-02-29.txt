 Item 1. Business 

General 

We are a global design, marketing and distribution company that specializes in consumer fashion accessories. Our principal offerings include an extensive line of men's and women's fashion watches and jewelry, handbags, small leather goods, belts, sunglasses and soft accessories. In the watch and jewelry product categories, we have a diverse portfolio of globally recognized owned and licensed brand names under which our products are marketed. Our products are distributed globally through various distribution channels, including wholesale in countries where we have a physical presence, direct to the consumer through our retail stores and commercial websites and through third-party distributors in countries where we do not maintain a physical presence. Our products are offered at varying price points to meet the needs of our customers, whether they are value-conscious or luxury oriented. Based on our extensive range of accessory products, brands, distribution channels and price points, we are able to target style-conscious consumers across a wide age spectrum on a global basis. 

Domestically, we sell our products through a diversified distribution network that includes department stores, specialty retail locations, specialty watch and jewelry stores, Company-owned retail and outlet stores, mass market stores and through our FOSSIL&#174; website. Our wholesale customer base includes, among others, Amazon.com, Dillard's, JCPenney, Kohl's, Macy's, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Target and Wal-Mart. In the United States ("U.S."), our network of Company-owned stores included 99 &#32;retail stores located in premier retail sites and 139 &#32;outlet stores located in major outlet malls as of January 2, 2016 . In addition, we offer an extensive collection of our FOSSIL brand products through our website at www.fossil.com , as well as proprietary and licensed watch and jewelry brands through other managed and affiliate websites. 

Internationally, our products are sold to department stores, specialty retail stores, and specialty watch and jewelry stores in approximately 150 &#32;countries worldwide through 23 &#32;Company-owned foreign sales subsidiaries and through a network of approximately 80 &#32;independent distributors. Our products are offered on airlines and cruise ships and in international Company-owned retail stores. Internationally, our network of Company-owned stores included 250 &#32;retail stores and 131 &#32;outlet stores as of January 2, 2016 . Our products are also sold through licensed and franchised FOSSIL retail stores, retail concessions operated by us and kiosks in certain international markets, as well as our websites in certain countries. 

We are a Delaware corporation formed in 1991 and are the successor to a Texas corporation formed in 1984. In 1993, we completed an initial public offering of 13,972,500 shares of our common stock. Domestically, we conduct a majority of our operations through Fossil Partners, L.P., a Texas limited partnership formed in 1994 of which we are the sole general partner. We also conduct operations domestically and in certain international markets through various owned subsidiaries. Our principal executive offices are located at 901 S. Central Expressway, Richardson, Texas 75080, and our telephone number at that address is (972) 234-2525. Our European headquarters is located in Basel, Switzerland, and our Asian headquarters is located in Hong Kong. Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol FOSL. We make available free of charge through our website at www.fossilgroup.com &#32;our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). You may also obtain any materials we file with, or furnish to, the SEC on its website at www.sec.gov . 

Business segments 

Our operations and financial reporting are primarily divided into three distinct geographic segments: (i) Americas; (ii) Europe; and (iii) Asia. Each segment includes wholesale, retail, e-commerce and catalog activities based on the geographic location of those activities. Except to the extent that differences between operating segments are material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole, the description of our business in this report is presented on a consolidated basis. Corporate expenses include certain administrative, legal, accounting, technology support costs, equity compensation costs, payroll costs attributable to executive management, brand management, product development, art, creative/product design, marketing, strategy, compliance and back office supply chain expenses. For financial information about our operating segments and geographic areas, refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth in Part II, Item 7 and Note 18&#8212;Major Customer, Segment and Geographic Information to our consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Business strengths 

We believe that we have several business strengths which allow us to differentiate ourselves and achieve our key operating and financial goals. These business strengths include: 

Brand strength. We believe a brand's image, individuality, consistency and connection with its customers is paramount in building and sustaining the brand. We believe that our FOSSIL brand name is recognized on a global basis as a vintage-inspired aspirational lifestyle brand with a focus on fashion accessories. The FOSSIL brand has developed from its origin as a watch brand to encompass other accessory categories, including handbags, belts, small leather goods, jewelry, soft accessories and sunglasses. We believe the FOSSIL brand is one of our most valuable assets, serves as a foundational piece of our business and remains very marketable across product lines, geographic areas and distribution channels. Since our inception in 1984, we have continued to develop, acquire or license other nationally or internationally recognized brand names, such as ADIDAS&#174;, ARMANI EXCHANGE&#174;, BURBERRY&#174;, CHAPS BY RALPH LAUREN&#174;, DIESEL&#174;, DKNY&#174;, EMPORIO ARMANI&#174;, KARL LAGERFELD&#174;, KATE SPADE NEW YORK&#174;, MARC BY MARC JACOBS&#8482;, MICHAEL KORS&#174;, MICHELE&#174;, MISFIT&#174;, RELIC&#174;, SKAGEN&#174;, TORY BURCH&#174; and ZODIAC&#174;, in order to appeal to a wide range of consumers. Our industry is highly competitive and subject to changing preferences in style, taste and price points. The success of our business model depends upon offering a wide range of branded products that appeal to the various tastes and fashion preferences of our customers. We must also maintain the relevance of these products by continually anticipating customer needs and desires as they relate to both the brands and categories of products we offer. We have teams of designers and brand specialists assigned to each of our brands. The objectives of these designers and brand specialists are to immerse themselves in their assigned brand and product area, identify their customers' preferences, interpret global fashion trends and develop style-right offerings to generate volume purchasing. By owning the vast majority of our global distribution, we are also able to create and execute consistent pricing strategies and brand image presentations that protect and enhance our proprietary brands and those of our licensors. 

Licensing strength. Since 1997, we have attracted highly recognized and respected brand names to license within our watch and jewelry portfolios. We believe we attract such quality brands due to our ability to provide them with access to our global design, production, distribution and marketing infrastructure. As a result of our vertical integration, we, unlike many of our competitors, can offer an integrated solution to launch or increase an accessory category presence on a worldwide basis in a consistent, timely and focused manner. All of our major licensing relationships are exclusive to us and the licensors, which substantially minimizes risks to the licensor associated with dealing with multiple licensees in different geographic regions. Additionally, in order to develop a broader relationship and maintain brand consistency across the accessory categories, we have broadened our infrastructure, that allows us to expand our licensing activities to products beyond the watch category, including our DIESEL, DKNY, EMPORIO ARMANI and MICHAEL KORS jewelry product lines. 

Breadth of brands and retail price points. Through the multiple brands we distribute, we have developed a broad spectrum of retail price points. Within our watch collections, core retail price points vary from approximately $7 in the mass market channel up to retail price points of $3,995 in the luxury distribution channel, although the majority of our collections focus on price points ranging from $85 to $600. The breadth of our brands allows us to anchor a brand to a given price point range and distribution channel, thereby maintaining a consistent brand image while focusing on the quality/value relationship important to the customer and not diluting the brand through overlapping distribution channels. The breadth of price points allows us to cater to various age and income groups while continuing to participate in sales consistently, regardless of a shift in income or the price/value preferences of our customers. 

International penetration. Since our initial public offering in 1993, we have continued to extend our reach beyond the U.S. by forming and acquiring internationally-based subsidiaries, licensing and developing internationally recognized brands and investing in the growth of our business within many major countries of the world. For fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , &#32; 53.8% , 54.7% &#32;and 53.2% &#32;of our consolidated net sales were generated outside of the U.S., respectively. 

Breadth of distribution channels. Our products are sold through multiple distribution channels including department stores, specialty retail stores, specialty watch and jewelry stores, mass market stores, cruise ships, airlines, Company-owned retail stores, licensed and franchised FOSSIL stores, retail concessions operated by us and e-commerce sites. As we expand our presence in existing distribution channels and add new distribution channels, as well as develop new product lines and expand our geographic reach, our revenues have become less dependent on any one distribution channel or geographic region. Our Company-owned retail stores, websites and catalog venues allow us to enhance the related brand image by offering a targeted message to the customer, showcasing the array of product availability, influencing the merchandising and presentation of the products and testing new product introductions. 

In-house creative team. Since our inception, we have developed a talented pool of creative individuals who design our retail stores, websites, products, packaging, graphics, presentation displays and marketing materials, allowing us to deliver a 

unique and cohesive style and image for each of our brands. We believe our emphasis on constant innovation and distinctive design has made us a leader in the branded accessory category. The breadth of talent and vertical integration of our design teams allows us to minimize the need for, and associated expense of, outside creative talent and advertising agencies. 

International sourcing. The vast majority of our products are sourced internationally. Most watch product sourcing from Asia is coordinated through our Hong Kong subsidiary, Fossil (East) Limited ("Fossil East"). During fiscal year 2015 , approximately 49% &#32;of our non-Swiss made watch production was assembled through wholly or majority owned factories. This vertical integration of our business allows for better flow of communication, consistent quality, product design protection and improved supply chain speed, while still allowing us to utilize non-owned production facilities for their unique capabilities and to cover production needs over internal capacities. Establishing our watch assembly facilities near the component manufacturers also allows us to operate a more efficient supply chain. We have also been successful in leveraging our jewelry production needs through our watch assembly factory infrastructure. Our other accessory products are purchased from many third-party manufacturers with whom we have long-standing relationships and, in the case of our leathers business, we typically represent a meaningful portion of their businesses. 

Operating cash flow. Our business model has historically generated strong operating cash flows, including $360.8 million &#32;in fiscal year 2015 , and $1.2 billion &#32;and $1.9 billion &#32;over the past three fiscal years and five fiscal years, respectively. This strong cash flow has allowed us to fund capital expenditures, Company-owned retail store growth, product line expansions, common stock repurchase programs and acquisitions. 

Information systems. Operating and managing a global company requires sophisticated and reliable management information systems to assist in the planning, order processing, production and distribution functions and accounting of each relevant business. We mainly operate an SAP Enterprise Resource Planning system ("ERP") in the U.S. and most of Europe. For our subsidiaries in Asia, we operate Microsoft's Dynamics Navision Enterprise Resource Planning System ("Navision"). Our e-commerce platform is based on IBM's WebSphere Commerce platform and we continue to invest in other parts of our e-commerce infrastructure, which will allow us to leverage the success of our U.S.-based web business across many of the countries where we currently distribute products. During 2015, we implemented Adobe Experience Manager within our e-commerce environment to provide a more agile approach in support of our online brand experiences and the required content management. We have also implemented SAP's IS Retail platform combined with the WINCOR point-of-sale and the SAP point-of-sale systems to improve our ability to manage our growing Company-owned retail stores globally. Our products are principally distributed from three primary warehouses, one located in Texas near our headquarters, one located in southern Germany and the other located in Hong Kong. Our facilities in Texas and Germany utilize sophisticated automated material handling equipment and software designed to improve accuracy, speed and quality in our warehousing operations. 

For financial reporting, we use software solutions from Oracle Corporation: Hyperion Financial Management, Essbase and Hyperion Planning. This software was implemented in 2014 to increase the overall efficiency of our consolidation and financial reporting process, provide an analytical application to view and interpret data, and to improve predictability in the budgeting and forecasting process. 

Growth strategy 

In order to expand our global market share in a profitable manner, we continually establish and implement business initiatives that we believe will build brand equity, increase revenues and improve profitability across three distinct areas of the business&#8212;FOSSIL, SKAGEN and our multi-brand watch portfolio. Our strategy for growing the business includes the following: 

FOSSIL. Realizing the full potential of this vintage American lifestyle brand is a key element of our long-term growth strategy. Our goal is to continue to grow the brand through innovation and increasing global awareness. 

SKAGEN. Growing SKAGEN into a multi-category lifestyle brand by leveraging the Fossil Group infrastructure, proving a unique brand experience and delivering great Danish-inspired product is an important element of our long-term growth strategy. 

Portfolio. Our multi-brand watch portfolio is a powerful tool enabling us to gain share in the growing global watch market. Our innovation, design, supply chain and global distribution network provide us the opportunity to work with lifestyle brands around the world and position them across a broad spectrum of market segments. Our goal is to employ all of our strategic advantages to realize the full potential of our brands. 

Global diversification. International expansion and gaining market share are key elements in expanding the distribution of our brands. We have continued to increase our penetration of the international market by building brand name recognition, broadening the selection of merchandise through existing distribution channels by introducing new products or brands, &#32; 

extending product categories under our existing portfolio of brands, purchasing former distributors to gain increased control over international businesses, establishing owned, franchised or licensed retail stores, expanding into retail concessions operated by us and entering new geographic markets through owned subsidiary or third-party distributor relationships. For example, on February 1, 2015, we acquired a majority ownership of the South Africa-based distributor S. Keren Watch Group (&#8220;SKWG&#8221;). SKWG had been a distribution partner for over 23 years, representing all Fossil brands and most of our licensed brands in South Africa. SKWG was renamed Fossil Accessories South Africa Pty, Ltd and has been included in our consolidated financial statements since February 1, 2015. 

Leverage existing infrastructure. We have built our design, marketing, assembly and distribution infrastructure to allow us to manage and grow our businesses. As we continue to develop additional products, acquire or license additional brands and seek additional businesses to complement our existing offering, we believe we will be able to leverage our infrastructure and continue to increase the efficiency of our operations over the long-term. 

Extend product categories of existing brands. We frequently introduce new accessory product categories within our existing proprietary and licensed brands to further leverage our branded portfolio. For example, we introduced jewelry collections under the DIESEL, DKNY, EMPORIO ARMANI, FOSSIL and MICHAEL KORS brands after first establishing a market for the brands in watches. Wearable technology is an opportunity to extend the reach of our brands and offer customers new functionality with accessories, including activity trackers and smart watches. With the category evolving quickly, we have developed our capabilities through our partnerships with Google and Intel and launched connected accessories under the FOSSIL line in 2015. Additionally, on December 22, 2015, we acquired Misfit, Inc. ("Misfit"), an innovator and distributor of wearable technology and stylish connected devices. Misfit was a U.S.-based privately held company. The primary purpose of the acquisition was to acquire a scalable technology platform that can be integrated across our multi-brand portfolio, a native wearable technology brand and a pipeline of innovative products. Misfit&#8217;s position in the wearable technology space combined with their software and hardware engineering teams enables us to expand our addressable market with new distribution channels, products, brands and enterprise partnerships. Additionally, the acquisition of Misfit further enhances our capabilities to innovate and drive growth in the traditional watch market, bringing fashion and branding to technology in a very unique way. 

Introduce new brands. We have introduced new brands through the development or acquisition of proprietary brands and licensing agreements related to recognizable global fashion lifestyle brands to attract a wide range of consumers with differing tastes and lifestyles. Our current portfolio of proprietary and licensed watch brands allows us to compete for market share from the luxury branded market to the mass market level. In April 2012, we completed the acquisition of Skagen Designs, Ltd. ("Skagen Designs") and certain of its international subsidiaries. Skagen Designs is an international company offering contemporary Danish design accessories including watches, jewelry, sunglasses and clocks. In February 2013 and February 2015, we announced an exclusive global licensing agreement with Tory Burch and Kate Spade &#38; Company, respectively, for watches under the TORY BURCH and KATE SPADE NEW YORK labels. In 2015, we also announced a global licensing agreement with Ralph Lauren&#174; to design, develop and distribute watches under the CHAPS label, which will launch in 2016. 

Invest in direct-to-consumer and omni-channel capabilities. Distribution through our Company-owned retail stores has allowed us to raise awareness of the FOSSIL brand and showcase a broad assortment of FOSSIL branded products in a warm and inviting atmosphere. Our FOSSIL retail stores, combined with our FOSSIL branded catalogs and website, have continued to build brand equity, present a consistent brand image, influence the merchandising and presentation of our products at other retailers and have allowed us to test new product categories and designs. With consumers shopping preferences evolving beyond traditional retail stores, we are investing in other direct-to-consumer channels, including e-commerce and omni-channel initiatives. Of the 619 &#32;Company-owned retail stores open as of January 2, 2016 , 490 of these stores are FOSSIL branded stores. We also sell certain of our proprietary and licensed watch products, as well as upscale watch brands of other companies, such as Citizen and Swiss Army, at our Company-owned Watch Station International full-price retail and outlet stores. As of January 2, 2016 , we operated 100 Watch Station International stores. We plan to open approximately &#32;25 to 30 &#32;additional stores in fiscal year 2016 , depending upon available retail locations and lease terms that meet our requirements, the majority of which will be our FOSSIL full-price accessory and outlet concepts. During fiscal year 2016 , we also expect to close approximately 30 &#32;stores. 

Operating strategy 

Fashion orientation and design innovation. We are able to market our products to consumers with differing tastes and lifestyles by offering a wide range of brands and product categories at varying price points. We attempt to stay abreast of emerging fashion and lifestyle trends, and we respond to these trends by making adjustments in our product lines several times each year. We differentiate our products from those of our competitors principally through innovations in fashion details, including variations in both the materials and treatments used for dials, crystals, cases, straps and bracelets for our watches, and innovative treatments and details in our other accessories. 

Coordinated product promotion. We internally coordinate product design, packaging, advertising, websites, catalogs and in-store presentations to effectively communicate to our target markets the themes and images associated with our brands. For example, many of our watch products and certain of our accessory products are packaged in metal tins decorated with designs consistent with our marketing strategy and product image. In certain parts of the world, we market our non-watch fashion accessory lines through the same distribution channels as our watch lines, using similar in-store presentations, graphics and packaging. 

Captive suppliers. A substantial percentage of our watches and jewelry products are assembled or manufactured by entities that are majority owned by us. In addition, although we do not have long-term contracts with our unrelated watch and accessory manufacturers, we maintain long-term relationships with several manufacturers. These relationships developed due to the significant length of time we have conducted business with the same manufacturers. We believe that we are able to exert significant operational control with regard to our principal watch assemblers because of our level of ownership and long standing relationships. In addition, we believe that the relative size of our business with non-owned watch manufacturers gives us priority within their production schedules. Furthermore, the manufacturers understand our quality standards, which allow us to produce quality products and reduce the delivery time to market, improving overall operating margins. 

Actively manage retail sales. We manage the retail sales process with some of our wholesale customers by monitoring consumer purchases and retail inventory levels by product category and style, primarily through electronic data interchange, and by assisting some of our wholesale customers in the conception, development and implementation of their marketing programs. Through our merchandising unit, we work with some retailers to ensure that our products are properly stocked and displayed in accordance with our visual standards. As a result, we believe we enjoy close relationships with some of our principal wholesale customers, often allowing us to influence the mix, quantity and timing of their purchasing decisions. 

Centralized distribution. We distribute substantially all of our products sold in North America from our warehouse and distribution centers located in Texas. In Europe, we distribute our products primarily through our warehouse and distribution center located in Germany. In Asia, we primarily distribute our products through our distribution warehouse located in Hong Kong and through smaller distribution warehouses in those countries where we maintain a physical presence. We believe our centralized distribution capabilities in the U.S. and Europe enable us to reduce inventory risk, increase flexibility in achieving delivery requirements of our customers and maintain cost advantages as compared to our competitors. 

Industry overview 

Watch products 

We believe that the current traditional watch market can generally be divided into four segments. One segment of the market consists of fine watches characterized by internationally known brand names such as Audemars Piguet, Cartier, Omega, Patek Philippe, Piaget and Rolex. Watches offered in this segment are usually made of precious metals or stainless steel and may be set with precious gems. These watches are almost exclusively manufactured in Switzerland and are sold by trade jewelers and in the fine jewelry departments of select department stores and other purveyors of luxury goods at retail prices ranging from $4,000 to in excess of $20,000. Selected limited editions of our BURBERRY and MICHELE lines compete in this market. A second segment of the traditional watch market consists of fine premium branded and designer watches produced in Switzerland and Asia such as Gucci, Movado, Raymond Weil, Seiko, TAG Heuer and Tissot. These watches are sold at retail prices generally ranging from $495 to $4,000. Our BURBERRY, EMPORIO ARMANI, EMPORIO ARMANI Swiss, FOSSIL Swiss, MICHELE, TORY BURCH and ZODIAC lines generally compete in this market segment. A third segment of the traditional watch market consists of watches sold by mass marketers, which typically consist of digital and analog watches manufactured in Asia. Well-known brands in this segment include Armitron, Casio and Timex. Retail prices in this segment range from $7 to $60. We compete in this segment through the design and production of private label watch products for Kmart, Target and Wal-Mart. 

The fourth segment of the traditional watch market consists of moderately priced watches characterized by contemporary fashion and well-known fashion brand names. Moderately priced watches are typically produced in China or Hong Kong and are sold by department stores and specialty stores at retail prices ranging from $60 to $1,000. We target this market segment with our FOSSIL, RELIC and SKAGEN lines, along with our principal competitors, including the companies that market watches under the Anne Klein II, Guess?, Kenneth Cole and Swatch brand names, whose products attempt to reflect emerging fashion trends in accessories and clothing. Our ARMANI EXCHANGE, DIESEL, DKNY, KARL LAGERFELD, MARC BY MARC JACOBS, KATE SPADE NEW YORK and MICHAEL KORS lines generally compete in this segment as well. We compete in the sports specialty area of this segment with our ADIDAS line of women's and men's sport timepieces. We believe that a number of consumers regard branded fashion watches not only as timepieces, but also as fashion accessories, and that has historically resulted in consumers owning multiple watches that may differ significantly in terms of style, features and cost. 

Traditional watches typically utilize either a mechanical or quartz-analog movement to maintain their time keeping function. Mechanical watches utilize intricate arrangements of wheels, jewels and winding and regulating mechanisms to keep time, while quartz-analog watches are precisely calibrated to the regular frequency of the vibration of a quartz crystal powered by a battery. Although quartz-analog movements typically maintain their time keeping functions more precisely than mechanical movements, mechanical movements are prized for their craftsmanship and are generally associated with high-end luxury. 

Wearable technology / Connected accessories 

A quickly emerging and evolving segment within the accessories market is wearable technology. As technology improves, including smaller hardware size and longer battery life, incremental functionality within accessories is becoming more important to the consumer. We first partnered with Google and Intel, experts in technology, in 2014 and launched our first line of connected accessories under the FOSSIL line in 2015. Competitors in this segment include traditional watch manufacturers as they venture into wearable technology and also technology brands such as Apple and Samsung and fitness brands such as Fitbit. 

In December 2015, we acquired Misfit, an innovator in wearable technology. We believe the acquisition will expand our addressable market, enabling us to offer consumers fashionable connected accessories in addition to our existing line of traditional watches and accessories. 

We believe the acquisition of Misfit accelerates and expands our ability to compete in the connected accessories market and provides us with a scalable cloud and app platform, a software and hardware engineering team, a native wearable technology brand and a pipeline of innovative products. 

The acquisition will enable us to scale Misfit&#8217;s technology across our portfolio of owned and licensed brands and expand our market with new distribution channels, new products, new brands and new enterprise partnerships, including music, fitness, healthcare and digital entities. 

Fashion accessories 

In addition to watches, the fashion accessories market also includes an array of products such as small leather goods, handbags, belts, sunglasses and jewelry. We believe that a number of consumers view accessories as fashion statements, and as a result, purchase brand name, quality items that complement other fashion items. These fashion accessory products are generally marketed through department stores, specialty retailers and mass merchandisers, depending upon price and quality. Higher price point items include products offered by fashion names such as Louis Vuitton and Prada. 

Moderately priced fashion accessories are typically marketed in department stores and are characterized by contemporary fashion and well-known brand names at reasonable price points, such as our FOSSIL and RELIC brands. We currently offer small leather goods, handbags, belts and sunglasses for both men and women through department stores and specialty retailers in the moderate to upper-moderate price ranges. Our competitors in this market include companies such as Coach, Guess?, Kenneth Cole, Liz Claiborne and Nine West. In addition, we currently offer fashion jewelry sold under the DIESEL, DKNY, EMPORIO ARMANI, FOSSIL, MICHAEL KORS and SKAGEN brands. 

Our products 

We design, develop, market and distribute fashion accessories, including fragrances, handbags, jewelry, belts, small leather goods, sunglasses and watches under proprietary and licensed brand names. Additionally, we manufacture or distribute private label brands as well as branded products we purchase for resale in certain of our non-FOSSIL retail stores. The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the breakdown of our net sales and percentage of growth between proprietary, licensed and other brands for the fiscal years indicated (in millions, except for percentage data).

Sales of our licensed watch products accounted for 46.1% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal year 2015 . Our MICHAEL KORS product sales, including jewelry, accounted for 25.4% &#32;of our consolidated net sales for fiscal year 2015 . In fiscal year 2011, we entered into an exclusive global licensing agreement with Karl Lagerfeld for watches, which launched worldwide in the first quarter of 2013. In February 2013, we announced an exclusive global licensing agreement with Tory Burch for watches, which launched globally in late 2014. We launched EMPORIO ARMANI Swiss made watches in the first quarter of 2014. In February 2015, we announced and launched an exclusive global licensing agreement with Kate Spade &#38; Company. In January 2016, Burberry announced they are exiting the watch business and do not intend to renew our license agreement upon its expiration at the end of 2017. 

Private label and other. We design, market and source manufacturing of certain retailers' private label and owned brand watches or as premium and incentive items for use in various corporate events. Under these arrangements, we perform design and product development functions, as well as act as a sourcing agent for our customers by contracting for and managing the manufacturing process, purchasing and inspecting the finished product and arranging for shipment. Participation in the private label and premium businesses provides us with certain advantages, including increased assembly volume, which may reduce the costs of assembling our other products, and the strengthening of business relationships with our manufacturing sources. 

Fashion accessories 

In order to leverage our design and marketing expertise and our close relationships with our principal retail customers, primarily in the U.S. and Europe, we have developed a line of fashion accessories for both men and women, including belts, handbags, jewelry, small leather goods and sunglasses. Our handbags are made of a variety of fine leathers and other materials that emphasize classic styles and incorporate a variety of creative designs. Our small leather goods are typically made of fine leathers or other man-made materials and include items such as coin purses, cosmetic bags, mini-bags and wallets. Our jewelry lines include bracelets, cufflinks, earrings, necklaces and rings marketed under the DIESEL, DKNY, EMPORIO ARMANI, FOSSIL, MICHAEL KORS and SKAGEN brands and typically include materials such as base metals, stainless steel, semi-precious stones and sterling silver. We offer 100% UV protected fashion sunglasses in the FOSSIL brand. We currently sell our fashion accessories through a number of our existing major department store and specialty retail store customers, as well as our Company-owned retail stores, www.fossil.com &#32;and other internationally-owned e-commerce sites. In the U.S. and certain international markets, we generally market our fashion accessory lines through the same distribution channels as our watches using similar in-store presentations, graphics and packaging. These fashion accessories are typically sold in locations adjacent to watch departments, which may lead to purchases by persons who are familiar with our watch brands. Sales of our accessory lines for fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;accounted for approximately 21.6%, 20.2% and 21.1%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales.

Licensed eyewear 

In fiscal year 2013, our FOSSIL and RELIC brands were licensed to the Safilo Group, who manufactured, marketed, and sold optical frames under the FOSSIL and RELIC brands in the U.S. and Canada. Effective January 1, 2014, we expanded our license agreement with the Safilo Group to include both FOSSIL branded sunglasses and optical frames worldwide. The license agreement provides for royalties to be paid to us based on a percentage of net sales and includes certain guaranteed minimum royalties. Sales of licensed eyewear for fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;accounted for approximately 0.5%, 0.4% and 0.7%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. 

Design and development 

We believe one of our key strengths is our internal creative team. Our watch and accessory products are created and developed by our in-house design staff primarily located in the U.S., Germany, Hong Kong and Switzerland. When developing products under our various licensed brands, we often coordinate our efforts with our licensors' design teams to provide for a more fluid design approval process and to fully incorporate the image of the respective brand into the product. Product design ideas are drawn from various sources and are reviewed and modified by our design staff to ensure consistency with our existing product offerings and the themes and images associated with our brands. Senior management is actively involved in the design process. 

In order to respond effectively to changing consumer preferences, we attempt to stay abreast of emerging lifestyle and fashion trends impacting our product categories. In addition, we attempt to take advantage of the constant flow of information from our customers and our retail stores and e-commerce sites regarding the retail performance of our products. We review weekly sales reports provided by a substantial number of our customers, as well as daily sales reports generated from our Company-owned retail stores and e-commerce sites, containing information with respect to sales and inventories by product category and style. Once a trend in the retail performance of a product category or style has been identified, our design and marketing staffs review their product design decisions to ensure that key features of successful products are incorporated into future designs. Other factors having an influence on the design process include the availability of components, the capabilities of the factories that will manufacture the products for us and the anticipated retail prices and profit margins for the products. Our creative teams have access to our product design archives and are regularly updated on all the various new components, hardware and materials that become available. Over the last few years, our focus has been on transforming our approach in design and development from an assortment-rich offering to an iconic platform presentation. This has enhanced our ability to develop and share compelling stories within the platforms through a narrower range of product offerings, thereby reducing inventory risk and improving lead times. We initially developed this approach in our watch business, and we are now in the early stages of applying a similar approach to our leather and jewelry businesses. 

We differentiate our products from those of our competitors principally by incorporating into our product designs innovations in fashion details, including variations in the materials and treatments used for dials, crystals, cases, straps and bracelets for our watches, and innovative details and treatments in our other accessories. We also incorporate certain proprietary technology or integrate our suppliers' technologies in certain of our watch products. In some instances, we believe that such innovations have allowed us to achieve significant improvements in consumer acceptance of our product offerings. We believe that the substantial experience of our design staff will assist us in maintaining our current leadership position in the watch category, continuing to enhance our handbag offering and expanding the scope of our product offerings. 

Marketing and promotion 

Our marketing strategy for each of our proprietary brands is to deliver a coordinated and consistent brand image to the consumer regardless of where the consumer comes into contact with the brand. This includes point-of-sale merchandise displays, print and media advertising, our websites, catalogs, retail stores, and the product packaging to the product itself. We have been investing in our omni-channel initiatives to further develop a consistent brand image and message across all of the channels we serve. We have created a global CRM database to encourage on-going communication with our customers in an effort to foster brand loyalty and facilitate customer engagement and repeat purchases. For our proprietary brands, we identify our advertising themes and coordinate our packaging, advertising and point-of-sale material around these themes. These themes are carefully coordinated in order to convey classic, American styling and the aspirational viewpoint that we associate with our products. Our vintage-inspired tin packaging concept for many of our watch products and certain of our accessories is an example of these marketing themes. While our marketing themes typically change each year, the core image of the brand is designed to endure, only changing slightly to keep it fresh and relevant to our targeted consumer. For our licensed brands, we incorporate many of the same concepts but derive the themes generally from the licensors. 

We participate in cooperative advertising programs with our major retail customers, whereby we share the cost of certain of their advertising and promotional expenses. An important aspect of the marketing process involves the use of in-store visual support and other merchandising materials, including packages, signs, posters and fixtures. Through the use of these materials, 

we attempt to differentiate the space used to sell our products from other areas of our customers' stores. We also promote the use of our shop-in-shop concept for watches, jewelry, handbags and small leather goods and, primarily in Asia and Europe, watch and jewelry concessions. Our shop-in-shop concept involves the use of dedicated space within a customer's store to create a brand "shop" featuring our products and visual displays. The concessions we run allow us to essentially operate all or a portion of the watch and jewelry department within our customers' stores, thereby permitting us to control merchandising, inventory levels, build-out and branding decisions and, more importantly, the interaction with the end consumer. We also provide our customers with a large number of preprinted customized advertising inserts and from time to time stage promotional events designed to focus public attention on our products. 

Our in-house art department designs, develops and implements all of the packaging, advertising, marketing and other promotional aspects of our products. The art staff uses graphic design techniques to generate the images presented on product packaging and other advertising materials. Senior management is involved in monitoring our advertising and promotional activities to ensure that themes and ideas are communicated in a cohesive manner to our target audience. 

Sales and customers 

General. Domestically, we sell our products in retail locations in the U.S. through a diversified distribution network that includes department stores, specialty retail locations, specialty watch and jewelry stores and mass market stores. For our FOSSIL, MICHELE and licensed branded products, our primary department store customers include Bloomingdales, Dillard's, Macy's, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue. For our RELIC brand, our primary customers include JCPenney and Kohl's. For our SKAGEN brand, our primary customers include Dillard's, Macy's and Nordstrom. Many of our licensed branded products are also sold through each respective licensor's boutique stores and websites. We maintain sales offices in several major cities across the U.S. staffed with sales associates to assist in managing our department and specialty store accounts and employ a nationwide staff of merchandise coordinators who work with the stores to ensure that our products are displayed appropriately. We also sell certain of our FOSSIL branded products at Company-owned FOSSIL retail stores and outlet stores located throughout the U.S., and through our website at www.fossil.com . In addition, we sell certain of our proprietary and licensed watch products, as well as upscale watch brands of other companies, such as Citizen and Swiss Army, at our Company-owned Watch Station International retail stores in the U.S. and through our website at www.watchstation.com . 

We maintain subsidiary offices in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and Vietnam. Our European headquarters is located in Basel, Switzerland, and our Asian headquarters is located in Hong Kong. 

Internationally, our products are sold to department stores and specialty retail stores in approximately 150 &#32;countries worldwide through 23 &#32;Company-owned foreign subsidiaries, a network of approximately 80 &#32;independent distributors, Company-owned retail stores and websites and licensed or franchised FOSSIL retail stores, retail concessions operated by us and kiosks. Foreign distributors generally purchase products from us at uniform prices established by us for all international sales and resell them to department stores and specialty retail stores. We generally receive payment from our foreign distributors in U.S. dollars. We generally do not have long-term contracts with any of our retail customers. All transactions between us and our retail customers are conducted on the basis of purchase orders, which generally require payment of amounts due to us on a net 30 day basis for most of our U.S.-based customers and up to 120 days for certain international customers. No customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net sales in fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32;or 2013 . Net sales for geographic segments are based on the location of the selling entity. For more information on our geographic segments, see Note 18&#8212;Major Customer, Segment and Geographic Information to our consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

United States sales. For fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , U.S. sales accounted for 46.2% , 45.3% &#32;and 46.8% &#32;of our consolidated net sales, respectively, and the aggregate sales to our 10 largest customers in the U.S. represented approximately 21.3%, 18.9% and 20.5% of consolidated net sales, respectively. 

International sales. For fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , Europe sales accounted for 33.1% , 34.1% &#32;and 32.3% &#32;of consolidated net sales, respectively, Asia sales accounted for 15.4% , 16.1% &#32;and 15.4% &#32;of consolidated net sales, respectively, and other international sales accounted for 5.3% , 4.5% &#32;and 5.5% &#32;of consolidated net sales, respectively. 

Company-owned stores 

Our various retail store formats focus on creating emotional connections with our customers through an intense branding experience and personalized customer service. We strive to provide an inviting and welcoming environment for our customers that enhance our brand image and seek brand loyalty by continually delivering innovative vintage-inspired products that meet our customers' tastes. Our goal is to provide the customer with a consistent brand experience and message across the various channels we serve, including our retail stores, wholesale partners and e-commerce channels. Our on-going investments in our omni-channel initiatives help facilitate this goal and are critical components of our growth strategy going forward.

Accessory stores 

We operate full-price FOSSIL and SKAGEN accessory retail stores ("Accessory Stores") in order to broaden the recognition of our brand names. Accessory Stores carry a full assortment of FOSSIL or SKAGEN watches and other accessories that are generally sold at the suggested retail price. At the end of fiscal year 2015 , the average size of our Accessory Stores was 1,546 &#32;square feet, but each store can vary in size based on its geographic location. For example, our international-based stores are generally smaller in square footage than our U.S.-based stores due to smaller retail store configurations generally available in international markets.

Outlet stores 

The majority of our outlet stores are FOSSIL branded and operate at selected major outlet malls throughout the U.S. and certain international locations. We also operate outlets under the SKAGEN and Watch Station International names. Our outlets operating under the FOSSIL and SKAGEN names not only increase our brand awareness, but also enable us to liquidate excess inventory generally at significantly better prices than we would obtain through third-party liquidators. We generally discount products in our outlet stores from 25% to 75% off our suggested retail price. The table below sets forth information about our outlet stores during the last five fiscal years:

Other retail and e-commerce 

We sell certain of our proprietary and licensed brand watches, as well as watches manufactured by other companies in our Watch Station International stores. 

We have an agreement with the House of Fraser ("HOF"), a U.K.-based department store, which allows us to operate the watch department in certain HOF stores. Under this agreement, we own the inventory within the HOF store, provide the labor to operate the department and pay HOF a commission on the retail watch sales generated in the stores. As of January 2, 2016 , we operated the watch department in 50 HOF stores and HOF Online, although we do not include the number of locations associated with this arrangement in our retail store count. 

Internet sales. Our U.S. e-commerce website for FOSSIL branded products is www.fossil.com. &#32;We also operate e-commerce websites in Australia, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom. In October 2012, we began shipping to Canada and Mexico through a third-party e-commerce website. Each website features a full selection of geographically specific FOSSIL branded products. Certain of our websites also provide customer service, company news and shareholder information. Our websites are continually updated to provide a fresh look and an easy-to-navigate interface that enhances our brand image, while allowing consumers a pleasing shopping experience or a preview of what they may find at their local store carrying the brand. Since its launch, the www.fossil.com &#32;website has been promoted consistently in support of online brand and direct sales goals. Our online marketing efforts include the following: search/keyword marketing programs through major search partners including Google, Bing and Yahoo!; regular e-mail communications sent using our e-mail service provider to over one million registered consumers; product and promotional banners presented on affiliate networks and display banner networks; and online brand initiatives through social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube, WeChat and Weibo in support of viral and traditional brand initiatives. Through our Misfit acquisition in December 2015, we have acquired the www.misfit.com &#32;website. We have leveraged our e-commerce infrastructure by opening websites to support our licensed and owned brands, including www.michele.com, www.skagen.com, and www.watchstation.com. 

Catalogs. In fiscal year 2015 , we distributed approximately 8.0 million FOSSIL catalogs and postcards in the U.S., an increase from 3.1 million in fiscal year 2014 , and we did not distribute any FOSSIL catalogs internationally, a decrease from 0.2 million in fiscal year 2014 . We increased the overall distribution in the U.S. during fiscal year 2015 to drive traffic in our stores and e-commerce businesses. Throughout 2015, we leveraged our Customer Relationship Management ("CRM") database to optimize our direct mail strategy to drive incremental store and e-commerce traffic. Our catalogs are a key communication and advertising vehicle for the FOSSIL brand, serving to enhance our brand's image, increase awareness, and promote sales across all of our distribution channels. 

Facilitating our wholesale distribution 

We utilize an in-house sales staff and, to a lesser extent, independent sales representatives to promote the sale of our products to retail accounts. Our in-house sales personnel receive a salary and, in some cases, a commission based on a percentage of sales attributable to specified accounts. Independent sales representatives generally do not sell competing product lines and are under contracts with us that are generally terminable by either party upon notice ranging from 15 days to six months. These independent contractors are primarily compensated on a commission basis. 

We have developed an approach to managing the retail sales process that involves monitoring our customers' sales and inventories by product category and style, primarily through electronic data interchange. We review weekly selling and inventory information to ensure our products are properly stocked and replenished on a timely basis. We also assist many of our customers in the conception, development and implementation of their marketing programs. We also participate in cooperative advertising programs with our major retail customers. We believe that management of the retail sales process has resulted in close relationships with our principal wholesale customers, often allowing us to influence the mix, quantity and timing of their purchasing decisions. 

We believe that our sales approach has historically accounted for high retail turnover in our products, which can result in attractive profit margins for our wholesale customers. We believe that the resulting profit margins for our wholesale customers encourage them to devote greater selling space to our products within their stores. We are also able to work closely with buyers for our wholesale customers in determining the mix of products a store should carry. In addition, we believe that the buyers' familiarity with our sales approach has facilitated, and should continue to facilitate, the introduction of new products through our existing distribution network. 

We permit the return of damaged or defective products. In addition, although we have no obligation to do so, we accept limited amounts of product returns from our wholesale customers in other instances. Accordingly, we provide allowances for the estimated amount of product returns. The allowances for product returns as of the end of fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;were $68.7 million , $68.2 million &#32;and $63.1 million, respectively. We have not historically experienced returns in excess of our aggregate allowances. 

Backlog 

It is the practice of a substantial number of our customers not to confirm orders by delivering a formal purchase order until a relatively short time prior to the shipment of goods. As a result, the amount of unfilled customer orders includes confirmed orders and orders that we believe will be confirmed by delivery of a formal purchase order. A majority of such amounts represent orders that have been confirmed. The remainder of such amounts represents orders that we believe, based on industry practice and prior experience, will be confirmed in the ordinary course of business. Our backlog at a particular time is affected by a number of factors, including seasonality and the scheduling of the manufacture and shipment of our products. Accordingly, a comparison of backlog from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of eventual actual shipments. At the end of fiscal year 2015 , we had unfilled customer orders of approximately $84.9 million, compared to $185.1 million and $194.5 million at the end of fiscal years 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

Manufacturing 

Watches and jewelry. During fiscal year 2015 , approximately 49% &#32;of the watches we procured from Asia were assembled through our two &#32;majority-owned entities. The remaining watches we procured from Asia were assembled by approximately 38 unrelated factories located primarily in China and Hong Kong, which includes almost all the production and assembly of our digital and mass market watches. During fiscal year 2015 , our Swiss-made watches were assembled primarily by one of our majority-owned entities and three third-party factories in Switzerland. During fiscal year 2015 , approximately 59% of our jewelry products were manufactured by one of our majority-owned entities. The remaining 41% of our jewelry products were manufactured by approximately 17 factories located primarily in China. Although we have no ownership interest in these unrelated watch and jewelry factories, Fossil East maintains oversight and control of the supply chain from design through final delivery of the finished product as it does with our related factories. We believe substantial ownership of the assembly factories that produce a significant amount of our fashion watches and jewelry is critical to our operating model, as we believe this allows us to keep our designs proprietary, control the size of our production runs and vertically manage our supply chain. 

The principal components used in the assembly of our watches are cases, crystals, dials, movements, hands, bracelets and straps. These components are obtained from a large number of suppliers located principally in China, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland and Thailand. The majority of the movements, cases, dials, bracelets and hands used in the assembly of our watches are supplied by nine principal vendors. During fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , one vendor was responsible for supplying approximately 43%, 41% and 36% of our case and bracelet components, respectively. Additionally, two vendors were responsible for supplying approximately 73%, 87% and 86% of our movements in fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32; 

and 2013 , respectively. The principal materials used in the manufacture of our jewelry products are base metals, stainless steel, semi-precious stones or silver jewelry with 18K gold plating on top. These components are primarily obtained from the same factories that we use for our watches. Except for the one case and bracelet vendor and the two movement vendors noted above, we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on any single component supplier. 

We believe that we have established and maintain close relationships with a number of component manufacturers and assembly factories primarily located in China, Hong Kong and Switzerland. The loss of any one of these manufacturers could temporarily disrupt shipments of certain of our watch and jewelry products. In addition, we believe that losing one or more of the component vendors, watch assembly factories or jewelry manufacturers could have a material impact on our ability to source these products and meet our sales plans. Our future success will generally depend upon our ability to maintain close relationships with, or ownership of, our current watch assembly and jewelry manufacturing factories and to develop long-term relationships with other vendors and manufacturers that satisfy our requirements for price, quality and production flexibility. 

Other Accessories. &#32;&#32;During fiscal year 2015 , all of the manufacturing of our handbags, small leather goods and belts was outsourced. We believe that our policy of outsourcing the production of these product categories allows us flexibility in selecting our suppliers while avoiding significant capital expenditures, build-ups of work-in-process inventory and the costs of managing a substantial production work force. 

General. &#32;&#32;We have a Code of Conduct for Manufacturers ("Manufacturer Code") that sets forth the corporate responsibility requirements for our suppliers, including compliance with international labor and human rights standards and environmental laws and regulations. Before supplying products to us, our manufacturers sign an agreement that includes a commitment to abide by our Manufacturer Code. For more information on our Manufacturer Code, see "Code of Conduct for Manufacturers." 

Our products are assembled or manufactured according to plans that reflect management's estimates of product performance based on recent sales results, current economic conditions and prior experience with manufacturing sources. The average lead time from the commitment to purchase products through the production and shipment thereof ranges from two to four months for our watches, leather goods, and jewelry. We believe that the close relationships, including ownership interests in some cases, we have established and maintain with our principal assembly or manufacturing sources constitute a significant competitive advantage and allow us to quickly and efficiently introduce innovative product designs and alter production in response to the retail performance of our products. 

Code of Conduct for Manufacturers 

We are committed to ethical and responsible conduct in all of our operations and respect for the rights of all individuals. We strive to ensure that human rights are upheld for all workers involved in our supply chain, and that individuals experience safe, fair and non-discriminatory working conditions. In addition, we are committed to compliance with applicable environmental requirements and are committed to seeing that all of our products are manufactured and distributed in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We expect that our business partners will share these commitments, which we enforce through our Manufacturer Code. 

Our Manufacturer Code specifically requires our manufacturers to not use child, forced or involuntary labor and to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We provide training to our factories related to our Manufacturer Code and the applicable laws in the country in which the factory is located. The training provides the factories with a more in-depth explanation of our Manufacturer Code. 

In addition to the contractual obligation, we evaluate our suppliers' compliance with our Manufacturer Code through audits conducted both by our employees and third-party compliance auditing firms. In most cases, the audits are announced. If we believe that a supplier is failing to live up to the standards of our Manufacturer Code, we may terminate the supplier or provide the supplier with an opportunity to remedy the non-compliance through the implementation of a corrective action plan. For those suppliers on a corrective action plan, we will work with the supplier as necessary to help them understand the non-compliance and provide advice on how to remedy the non-compliance. We conduct a follow-up audit to confirm compliance after the implementation of the corrective action plan. Should the supplier continue to fail to meet our standards, we may seek to eliminate such supplier from our supply chain. 

Quality control 

Our quality control program attempts to ensure that our products meet the standards established by our product development staff. Samples of products are inspected by us prior to placing orders with factories to ensure compliance with our technical design specifications. We also typically inspect "top of production" prototypes of each product before commencing production. The operations of our Hong Kong and Chinese factories are monitored on a periodic basis by Fossil East, and the operations of our Swiss factories are monitored on a periodic basis by Montres Antima SA, one of our foreign operating subsidiaries. Substantially all of our watches, jewelry and certain of our other accessories are inspected by personnel of Fossil East or by the assembly/manufacturing facility prior to shipment to our distribution centers. Final inspections, on a sampling basis, occur when the products are received in our distribution centers. We believe that our policy of inspecting our products at the assembly/manufacturing facility, upon receipt at our distribution facilities and prior to shipment to our customers is important to maintain the quality, consistency and reputation of our products. 

Distribution 

Upon completion of assembly/manufacturing, the majority of our products are shipped to one of our warehousing and distribution centers in Texas, Germany or Hong Kong, from which they are shipped to subsidiary warehouses or directly to customers in selected markets. Our centralized warehouse and distribution facilities allow us to maximize our inventory management and distribution capabilities and more readily meet the varying distribution requirements placed on us by our customers at a lower cost. Our facilities in Texas and Germany are equipped with automated material handling equipment operated by software from SAP and Manhattan Associates. The automated equipment and operating systems, in conjunction with the continual sampling of our outgoing orders prior to shipment, are important in maintaining the quality, accuracy, speed and reputation of our products and distribution service. 

Our warehouse and distribution facilities in Texas operate in a special purpose sub-zone established by the U.S. Department of Commerce Foreign Trade Zone Board. This sub-zone provides the following economic and operational advantages to us: (i) we do not have to pay duty on imported merchandise until it leaves the sub-zone and enters the U.S. market, (ii) we do not have to pay any U.S. duty on merchandise if the imported merchandise is subsequently shipped to locations outside the U.S. and (iii) we do not have to pay local property tax on inventory located within the sub-zone. 

Information technology systems 

General. &#32;&#32;We believe that automation, reliable and scalable systems, accurate reporting and rapid flow of communication is essential to maintain our competitive position and support our key operating and financial goals. Therefore, we continue to invest in computer hardware, system applications and telecommunication networks. Our information technology systems consist of a wide spectrum of financial, distribution, human resources, merchandising, planning, point-of-sale, supply chain and other solutions. Where possible and cost effective, we leverage our various systems on a global basis, which enhances the accuracy, timeliness and accessibility of the relevant data. 

Inventory control. &#32;&#32;We maintain inventory control systems at our facilities that enable us to track each product from the time it is shipped from our factory through shipment to our customers, or consumer in the case of our retail stores, concessions and websites. To facilitate this tracking, a significant number of products sold by us are pre-ticketed and bar coded. Our inventory control systems report shipping, sales and individual stock keeping unit level inventory information. We manage the retail sales process by monitoring customer sales and inventory levels of our products by product category and style, primarily through electronic data interchange. We believe that our distribution capabilities enable us to reduce inventory risk and increase flexibility in responding to the delivery requirements of our customers. Our management believes that our electronic data interchange efforts will continue to grow in the future as customers focus further on increasing operating efficiencies. In addition, we maintain systems that are designed to track inventory movement through our Company-owned stores. Detailed sales transaction records are accumulated on each store&#8217;s point-of-sale system and polled by us. 

Enterprise resource planning. We have implemented SAP ERP in our U.S. operations and throughout most of Europe. This software is installed on a single site platform located in our U.S. headquarters facility. The software currently supports the human resources, sales and distribution, inventory planning, retail merchandising and operational and financial reporting systems of our U.S. businesses and most subsidiary operations in Europe. It also supports manufacturing operations in India and Europe. Additionally, we have implemented other non-SAP systems for the purpose of merchandise planning and product lifecycle management. 

We continue to monitor the growth of our subsidiary sales operations in Asia and will migrate these operations at the appropriate time to effectively benefit from our global SAP platform. However, we do operate SAP human resource, financial planning and warehouse management modules in Hong Kong to provide efficiencies to further support our regional warehouse in Hong Kong and the related supply chain associated with our local country operations, including our Company-owned retail 

stores throughout Asia. We have implemented Navision as our standard system throughout most of our Asia distribution and manufacturing subsidiary operations. The Navision system supports many of the same functions as our SAP system on a local country level. 

Enterprise performance management systems. We have implemented customized Hyperion financial reporting software from Oracle Corporation. The software increases the efficiency of our consolidation and reporting process, and provides a more dynamic way to view and analyze data. The Hyperion planning tool also improves budgeting and forecasting processes, resulting in more predictability in our business. 

Product lifecycle management. We have implemented Dassault Systemes Enovia in our product development function. This system enables our global product development process across our multiple brands and product categories. Besides aligning this process, the platform will enable a global solution for collaboration, sample management, design tool integration, and calendar management. 

Cyber/Data security. Our business involves the receipt and storage of personal information about customers and employees, the protection of which is critical to us. If we experience a significant breach of customer, employee, and/or company data it could attract a substantial amount of media attention, damage our customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales, fines, or lawsuits. Our Board of Directors and/or our Audit Committee reviews our data security risks and strategy on a quarterly basis, and we have obtained insurance liability coverage for certain data security or privacy breaches. 

IT support services. &#32; In the third quarter of 2015, we moved the following IT functions to a global IT service provider in order to gain long-term IT operational maturity, resource flexibility and improved financial leverage of our IT support costs: service desk, application support, administration and infrastructure administration. 

Warranty and repair 

Our watch products are covered by limited warranties against defects in materials or workmanship. Our FOSSIL watch products sold in the U.S. are covered for a period of 11 years, our RELIC watch products sold in the U.S. are covered for a period of 12 years, and our SKAGEN branded watches are covered by a lifetime warranty. Generally, all other products sold in the U.S. and internationally are covered by a comparable one to two year warranty. &#32;The majority of our defective watch products returned by consumers in the Americas are processed at our repair facilities in Texas while defective watch products returned by consumers in Europe are processed at our repair facilities in France. We also maintain repair facilities at a majority of our subsidiaries, as well as through our network of third-party distributors to handle repairs which are minor in nature or are not convenient to one of our centralized repair facilities. In most cases, defective products under warranty are repaired by our personnel or third-party distributors. We attempt to retain adequate levels of component parts to facilitate after-sales service of our watches, even after specific styles are discontinued. We have a component parts system that tracks the inventory of our various component replacement parts that can be utilized by our repair facilities for identifying stock levels and availability for procurement. Watch and non-watch products under warranty that cannot be repaired in a cost-effective manner are replaced by us at no cost to the customer. Our warranty liability at the end of fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;was $13.7 million , $13.5 million &#32;and $15.7 million , respectively. Repair services accounted for approximately 1.1% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal year 2015 &#32;and 1.0% in both fiscal years 2014 &#32;and 2013 . 

Governmental regulations 

Imports and import restrictions. Most of our products are assembled or manufactured overseas. As a result, the U.S. and countries in which our products are sourced or sold may from time to time modify existing or impose new quotas, duties (including antidumping or countervailing duties), tariffs or other restrictions in a manner that adversely affects us. For example, our products imported to the U.S. are subject to U.S. customs duties and, in the ordinary course of our business, we may from time to time be subject to claims by the U.S. Customs Service for duties and other charges. Factors that may influence the modification or imposition of these restrictions include the determination by the U.S. Trade Representative that a country has denied adequate intellectual property rights or fair and equitable market access to U.S. firms that rely on intellectual property, trade disputes between the U.S. and a country that leads to withdrawal of "most favored nation" status for that country and economic and political changes within a country that are viewed unfavorably by the U.S. government. We cannot predict the effect these events would have on our operations, if any, especially in light of the concentration of our assembly and manufacturing operations in Hong Kong and China. 

General. We are subject to laws regarding customs, tax, employment, privacy, truth-in-advertising, consumer product safety, zoning and occupancy and other laws and regulations that regulate and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of consumer products and our corporate, retail and distribution operations. 

Intellectual property 

Trademarks. We use our FOSSIL, MICHELE, MISFIT, RELIC, SKAGEN and ZODIAC trademarks, as well as other trademarks, on certain of our watches, leather goods and other fashion accessories in the U.S. and in a significant number of foreign countries. We also use FOSSIL, SKAGEN, WATCH STATION INTERNATIONAL&#174;, and WSI&#174; as trademarks on retail stores and online e-commerce sites. We have taken steps to establish or provide additional protection for our trademarks by registering or applying to register our trademarks for relevant classes of products in each country where our products are sold in addition to certain foreign countries where it is our intent to market our products in the future. Each registered trademark may be renewable indefinitely, so long as we continue to use the mark in the applicable jurisdiction and make the appropriate filings when required. We aggressively protect our trademarks and trade dress and pursue infringement both domestically and internationally. We also pursue counterfeiters both domestically and internationally through leads generated internally, as well as through our business partners worldwide. 

Patents. We continue to explore innovations in the design and assembly of our watch products. As a result, we have been granted, and have pending, various U.S. and international design and utility patents related to certain of our watch designs and features. We also have been granted, and have pending, various U.S. patents related to certain of our other products and technologies. As of January 2, 2016 , none of our patents were material to our business. 

License agreements. A significant portion of our sales and net income is, and is expected to continue to be, derived from the sales of products produced under licensing agreements with third-parties. Under these license agreements, we generally have the right to produce, market and distribute certain products utilizing the brand names of other companies. Our significant license agreements have various expiration dates between 2017 and 2025 . In 2015, we entered into an exclusive global licensing agreement with Kate Spade, LLC for KATE SPADE NEW YORK branded watches. Additionally, in 2015, we also entered into a license with PRL USA, Inc. and The Polo/Lauren Company, L.P. related to the use of the CHAPS brand on watches. 

Seasonality 

Although the majority of our products are not seasonal, our business is seasonal by nature. A significant portion of our net sales and operating income is generated during the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year, which includes the "back to school" and Christmas seasons. Additionally, as our retail and e-commerce sales continue to maintain a significant percentage of our sales mix, they will benefit our sales and profitability in our fiscal fourth quarter, generally at the expense of our fiscal first and second quarters when it is more difficult to leverage our retail and e-commerce expenses against the related sales. The amount of net sales and operating income generated during our fiscal fourth quarter also depends upon the anticipated level of retail sales during the Christmas season, as well as general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control. In addition, the amount of net sales and operating income generated during our fiscal first quarter depends in part upon the actual level of retail sales during the Christmas season. For example, lower levels of inventory held by our wholesale customers at the end of the Christmas season may result in higher levels of restocking orders placed by them during our fiscal first quarter. 

Competition 

The businesses in which we compete are highly competitive and fragmented. We believe that the current market for traditional watches can be divided into four segments, ranging from lower price point watches that are typically distributed through mass market channels to luxury watches at higher price points that are typically distributed through fine watch departments of upscale department stores or upscale specialty watch and fine jewelry stores. Our watch business generally competes in these segments with a number of established manufacturers, importers and distributors, including Armitron, Citizen, Gucci, Guess?, Kenneth Cole, LVMH Group, Movado, Raymond Weil, Seiko, Swatch, Swiss Army, TAG Heuer and Timex. In addition, our leather goods, sunglasses, and jewelry businesses compete with a large number of established companies that have significant experience developing, marketing and distributing such products. In all of our businesses, we compete with numerous manufacturers, importers and distributors who may have significantly greater financial, distribution, advertising and marketing resources than us. Our competitors include distributors that import watches and accessories and from abroad, U.S. companies that have established foreign manufacturing relationships and companies that produce accessories domestically. 

Although the level and nature of competition varies among our product categories and geographic regions, we believe that we compete on the basis of style, price, value, quality, brand name, advertising, marketing, distribution and customer service. We believe that our ability to identify and respond to changing fashion trends and consumer preferences (including wearable technology), to maintain existing relationships and develop new relationships with manufacturing sources, to deliver quality merchandise in a timely manner, to manage the retail sales process, and integrate Misfit&#8217;s technology platform into our business model are important factors in our ability to compete. We also believe that our distinctive business model of owning the distribution in many key markets and offering a globally recognized portfolio of proprietary and licensed products allows for 

many competitive advantages over smaller, regional or local competitors. This "ownership of the market" allows us to bypass the local distributor's cost structure in certain countries, resulting in more competitively priced products while also generating higher product and operating margins. 

We believe the risk of significant new competitors is mitigated to some extent by barriers to entry such as high startup costs and the development of long-term relationships with customers and manufacturing sources. However, in the expanding wearable technology industry we face relatively new competition from technology brands such as Apple and Samsung, from fitness brands such as Fitbit, as well as from many established traditional watch manufacturers as they enter into the wearable technology category. As this segment evolves and grows, there will likely be increased competition as well. 

Employees 

As of January 2, 2016 , we employed approximately 15,100 persons, including approximately 8,900 persons employed by our foreign operating subsidiaries. 

None of our domestic or foreign-based employees are represented by a trade union. However, certain European-based employees are represented by work councils, which include certain of our current employees who negotiate with management on behalf of all the employees. We have never experienced a work stoppage and consider our working relationship with our employees and work councils to be good.
