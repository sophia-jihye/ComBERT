Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. (&#8220;Omega,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated in the State of Maryland on March 31, 1992. We are a self-administered real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;), investing in income producing healthcare facilities, principally long-term care facilities located in the United States and the United Kingdom. We provide lease or mortgage financing to qualified operators of skilled nursing facilities (&#8220;SNFs&#8221;) and, to a lesser extent, assisted living facilities (&#8220;ALFs&#8221;), independent living facilities and rehabilitation and acute care facilities. We have historically financed investments through borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, private placements or public offerings of our debt and equity securities, the assumption of secured indebtedness, retention of cash flow, or a combination of these methods.

&#160;

In April 2015, Aviv REIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation (&#8220;Aviv&#8221;), merged (the &#8220;Aviv Merger&#8221;) with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Omega, pursuant to the terms of that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 30, 2014 (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;), by and among the Company, Aviv, OHI Healthcare Properties Holdco, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Omega (&#8220;Merger Sub&#8221;), OHI Healthcare Properties Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership (&#8220;Omega OP&#8221;), and Aviv Healthcare Properties Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership (the &#8220;Aviv OP&#8221;).

&#160;

Prior to April 1, 2015 and in accordance with the Merger Agreement, Omega restructured the manner in which it holds its assets by converting to an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust structure (the &#8220;UPREIT Conversion&#8221;). As a result of the UPREIT Conversion and following the consummation of the Aviv Merger, substantially all of the Company&#8217;s assets are held by Omega OP. Omega OP is governed by the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of OHI Healthcare Properties Limited Partnership, dated as of April 1, 2015 (the &#8220;Partnership Agreement&#8221;). Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, the Company and Merger Sub are the general partners of Omega OP, and have exclusive control over Omega OP&#8217;s day-to-day management. As of December 31, 2015, the Company owned approximately 95% of the issued and outstanding units of partnership interest in Omega OP (&#8220;Omega OP Units&#8221;), and other investors owned approximately 5% of the Omega OP Units.

&#160;

In 2015, we completed the following transactions totaling approximately $4.4 billion in new investments:

&#160;

&#183; On April 1, 2015, Omega completed the Aviv Merger, which was structured as a stock-for-stock merger. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of Aviv common stock was converted into 0.90 of a share of Omega common stock. In connection with the Aviv Merger, Omega issued approximately 43.7 million shares of common stock to former Aviv stockholders. As a result of the Aviv Merger, Omega acquired 342 facilities, two facilities subject to direct financing leases, one medical office building, two mortgages and other investments. The facilities are located in 31 states and are operated by 38 third-party operators. Omega also assumed certain outstanding equity awards and other debt and liabilities. Based on the closing price of Omega&#8217;s common stock on April, 1, 2015, we estimate the fair value of the consideration exchanged or assumed to be approximately $3.9 billion. &#160;

&#183; On May 1, 2015, we closed a purchase/leaseback transaction (the &#8220;Care Homes Transaction&#8221;) of approximately $193.8 million for 23 care homes located in the United Kingdom. As part of the transaction, we acquired title to the 23 care homes with 1,018 registered beds and leased them back to Healthcare Homes Holding Limited (&#8220;Healthcare Homes&#8221;) pursuant to a 12-year master lease agreement with an initial annual cash yield of 7%, and annual escalators of 2.5%. The care homes, comparable to ALFs in the United States, are located throughout the East Anglia region (north of London) of the United Kingdom. &#160;

&#183; In addition to aforementioned acquisitions, we also completed approximately $228.7 million of acquisitions throughout the Unites States. Specifically, we acquired 13 SNFs and 4 ALFs with 1,542 operating beds. &#160;

&#183; $101.0 million of investments in our capital expenditure programs. &#160;

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, our portfolio of investments included 949 healthcare facilities located in 42 states and the United Kingdom that are operated by 83 third-party operators. We use the term &#8220;operator&#8221; to refer to our tenants and mortgagees and their affiliates who manage and/or operate our properties. This portfolio was made up of:

&#160;

&#8226; 782 SNFs, 85 ALFs, 16 specialty facilities and one medical office building; &#8226; fixed rate mortgages on 56 SNFs and two ALFs; and &#8226; seven facilities closed or held-for-sale. &#160;

As of December 31, 2015, our gross investments in these facilities, net of impairments and before reserve for uncollectible loans, totaled approximately $8.0 billion. In addition, we held miscellaneous investments of approximately $89.3 million at December 31, 2015, consisting primarily of secured loans to third-party operators of our facilities.

Description of the Business 

&#160;

Investment Strategy. We maintain a portfolio of long-term healthcare facilities and mortgages on healthcare facilities located in the United States and the United Kingdom. Our investments are generally geographically diverse and operated by a diverse group of established, middle-market healthcare operators that meet our standards for quality and experience of management and creditworthiness. Our criteria for evaluating potential investments includes but is not limited to:

&#160;

&#8226; the quality and experience of management and the creditworthiness of the operator of the facility; &#8226; the facility's historical and forecasted cash flow and its ability to meet operational needs, capital expenditure requirements and lease or debt service obligations; &#8226; the construction quality, condition and design of the facility; &#8226; the location of the facility; &#8226; the tax, growth, regulatory and reimbursement environment of the applicable jurisdiction; &#8226; the occupancy rate for the facility and demand for similar healthcare facilities in the same or nearby communities; and &#8226; the payor mix of private, Medicare and Medicaid patients at the facility. &#160;

We seek to obtain (i) contractual rent escalations under long-term, non-cancelable, &#8220;triple-net&#8221; leases and (ii) fixed-rate mortgage loans. We typically obtain substantial liquidity deposits, covenants regarding minimum working capital and net worth, liens on accounts receivable and other operating assets, and various provisions for cross-default, cross-collateralization and corporate and or personal guarantees, when appropriate.

&#160;

We prefer to invest in equity ownership of properties. Due to regulatory, tax or other considerations, we may pursue alternative investment structures. The following summarizes our primary investment structures. The average annualized yields described below reflect existing contractual arrangements. However, due to the nature of the long-term care industry, we cannot assure you that the operators of our facilities will meet their payment obligations in full or when due. Therefore, the annualized yields as of January 1, 2016, set forth below, are not necessarily indicative of future yields, which may be lower.

&#160;

Triple-Net Operating Leases. Triple-net operating leases typically range from 5 to 15 years, plus renewal options. Our leases generally provide for minimum annual rentals that are subject to annual formula increases based on factors such as increases in the Consumer Price Index. At January 1, 2016, our average annualized yield from operating leases was approximately 9.3%.

&#160;

Direct Financing Leases. In addition to our typical lease agreements, seven of our leases are being accounted for as direct financing leases which include annual escalators. At January 1, 2016, our annualized yield from the direct financing leases was 10.5%.

&#160; 

Fixed-Rate Mortgages. Our mortgages typically have a fixed interest rate for the mortgage term and are secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying real estate and personal property of the mortgagor. At January 1, 2016, our average annualized yield on these investments was approximately 9.7%.

&#160;

The table set forth in &#8220; Item 2 &#8211; Properties &#8221; contains information regarding our properties and investments as of December 31, 2015.

&#160;

Borrowing Policies. We generally attempt to match the maturity of our indebtedness with the maturity of our investment assets and employ long-term, fixed-rate debt to the extent practicable in view of market conditions in existence from time to time.

&#160;

We may use the proceeds of new indebtedness to finance our investments in additional healthcare facilities. In addition, we may invest in properties subject to existing loans, secured by mortgages, deeds of trust or similar liens on properties.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Policies With Respect To Certain Activities. With respect to our capital requirements, we typically rely on equity offerings, debt financing and retention of cash flow (subject to provisions in the Internal Revenue Code (the &#8220;Code&#8221;) concerning taxability of undistributed REIT taxable income), or a combination of these methods. Our financing alternatives include bank borrowings, publicly or privately placed debt instruments, purchase money obligations to the sellers of assets or securitizations, any of which may be issued as secured or unsecured indebtedness.

&#160;

We have the authority to issue our common stock or other equity or debt securities in exchange for property and to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our securities.

&#160;

Subject to the percentage of ownership limitations and gross income and asset tests necessary for REIT qualification, we may invest in securities of other REITs, other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers, including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities.

&#160;

We may engage in the purchase and sale of investments. We do not underwrite the securities of other issuers.

&#160;

Our officers and directors may change any of these policies without a vote of our stockholders. In the opinion of our management, our properties are adequately covered by insurance.

&#160;

Competition. The healthcare industry is highly competitive and will likely become more competitive in the future. We face competition from other REITs, investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, healthcare operators, lenders, developers and other institutional investors, some of whom have greater resources and lower costs of capital than us. Our operators &#160; compete on a local and regional basis with operators of facilities that provide comparable services. The basis of competition for our operators includes the quality of care provided, reputation, the physical appearance of a facility, price, the range of services offered, family preference, alternatives for healthcare delivery, the supply of competing properties, physicians, staff, referral sources, location and the size and demographics of the population and surrounding areas.

&#160;

Increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives. Our ability to compete is also impacted by national and local economic trends, availability of investment alternatives, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, existing laws and regulations, new legislation and population trends. For additional information on the risks associated with our business, please see &#8220; Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors &#8221; below.

Taxation of Omega 

&#160; 

The following is a general summary of the material United States federal income tax considerations applicable to (i) us, (ii) the holders of our securities and (iii) our election to be taxed as a REIT. It is not tax advice. This summary is not intended to represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences applicable to a particular holder of our securities in view of any person&#8217;s particular circumstances, nor is it intended to represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences applicable to holders of our securities subject to special treatment under the federal income tax laws such as insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, financial institutions, securities broker-dealers, non-U.S. persons, persons holding our securities as part of a hedge, straddle, or other risk reduction, constructive sales or conversion transaction, investors in pass-through entities, expatriates and taxpayers subject to alternative minimum taxation.

&#160;

The following discussion, to the extent it constitutes matters of law or legal conclusions (assuming the facts, representations and assumptions upon which the discussion is based are accurate), represents some of the material United States federal income tax considerations relevant to ownership of our securities. The sections of the Code relating to the qualification and operation as a REIT are highly technical and complex. The following discussion sets forth certain material aspects of those sections. The information in this section is based on, and is qualified in its entirety by the Code; current, temporary and proposed Treasury Regulations (&#8220;Treasury Regulations&#8221;) promulgated under the Code; the legislative history of the Code; current administrative interpretations and practices of the Internal Revenue Service (&#8220;IRS&#8221;); and court decisions, in each case, as of the date of this report. In addition, the administrative interpretations and practices of the IRS include its practices and policies as expressed in private letter rulings, which are not binding on the IRS, except with respect to the particular taxpayers who requested and received those rulings.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

General . We have elected to be taxed as a REIT, under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 1992. We believe that we were organized and have operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT. We intend to continue to operate in a manner that will allow us to maintain our qualification as a REIT, but no assurance can be given that we have operated or will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.

&#160;

If we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on our net income that is currently distributed to stockholders. However, we will be subject to certain federal income taxes as follows. First, we will be taxed at regular corporate rates on any undistributed REIT taxable income, including undistributed net capital gains; provided, however, that if we have a net capital gain, we will be taxed at regular corporate rates on our undistributed REIT taxable income, computed without regard to net capital gain and the deduction for capital gains dividends, plus a 35% tax on undistributed net capital gain, if our tax as thus computed is less than the tax computed in the regular manner. Second, under certain circumstances, we may be subject to the &#8220;alternative minimum tax&#8221; on our items of tax preference that we do not distribute or allocate to our stockholders. Third, if we have (i) net income from the sale or other disposition of &#8220;foreclosure property,&#8221; which is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, or (ii) other nonqualifying income from foreclosure property, we will be subject to tax at the highest regular corporate rate on such income. Fourth, if we have net income from prohibited transactions (which are, in general, certain sales or other dispositions of property (other than foreclosure property) held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business by us, (i.e., when we are acting as a dealer), such income will be subject to a 100% tax. Fifth, if we should fail to satisfy the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test (as discussed below), but nonetheless have maintained our qualification as a REIT because certain other remedial requirements have been met, we will be subject to a 100% tax on an amount equal to (a) the gross income attributable to the greater of the amount by which we fail the 75% or 95% test, multiplied by (b) a fraction intended to reflect our profitability. Sixth, if we should fail to distribute by the end of each year at least the sum of (i) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for such year, (ii) 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for such year, and (iii) any undistributed taxable income from prior periods, we will be subject to a 4% excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the amounts actually distributed. Seventh, we will be subject to a 100% excise tax on transactions with a taxable REIT subsidiary (&#8220;TRS&#8221;) that are not conducted on an arm&#8217;s-length basis. Eighth, if we acquire any asset that is defined as a &#8220;built-in gain asset&#8221; from a C corporation that is not a REIT (i.e., generally a corporation subject to full corporate-level tax) in a transaction in which the basis of the built-in gain asset in our hands is determined by reference to the basis of the asset (or any other property) in the hands of the C corporation, and we recognize gain on the disposition of such asset during the 5-year period (or, for dispositions made in taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 2015, the 10-year period) beginning on the date on which such asset was acquired by us (such period, the &#8220;recognition period&#8221;), then, to the extent of the built-in gain (i.e., the excess of (a) the fair market value of such asset on the date such asset was acquired by us over (b) our adjusted basis in such asset on such date), our recognized gain will be subject to tax at the highest regular corporate rate. The results described above with respect to the recognition of built-in gain assume that we will not make an election pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.337(d)-7(c)(5).

&#160;

Requirements for Qualification. The Code defines a REIT as a corporation, trust or association: (1) which is managed by one or more trustees or directors; (2) the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares, or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest; (3) which would be taxable as a domestic corporation, but for Sections 856 through 859 of the Code; (4) which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company as defined in provisions of the Code; (5) the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons; (6) during the last half year of each taxable year not more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities); and (7) which meets certain other tests, described below, regarding the nature of its income and assets and the amount of its annual distributions to stockholders. The Code provides that conditions (1) to (4) inclusive, must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition (5) must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of twelve months, or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than twelve months. For purposes of conditions (5) and (6), pension funds and certain other tax-exempt entities are treated as individuals, subject to a &#8220;look-through&#8221; exception in the case of condition (6). We may avoid disqualification as a REIT for a failure to satisfy any of these tests if such failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, and we pay a penalty of $50,000 for each such failure.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Income Tests . To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we annually must satisfy two gross income requirements. First, at least 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) for each taxable year must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property (including generally &#8220;rents from real property,&#8221; interest on mortgages on real property, and gains on sale of real property and real property mortgages, other than property described in Section 1221(a)(1) of the Code) and income derived from certain types of temporary investments. Second, at least 95% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) for each taxable year must be derived from such real property investments, dividends, interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities other than property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business.

&#160;

Rents received by us will qualify as &#8220;rents from real property&#8221; in satisfying the gross income requirements for a REIT described above only if several conditions are met. First, the amount of the rent must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person. However, any amount received or accrued generally will not be excluded from the term &#8220;rents from real property&#8221; solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales. Second, the Code provides that rents received from a tenant (other than rent from a tenant that is a TRS that meets the requirements described below) will not qualify as &#8220;rents from real property&#8221; in satisfying the gross income tests if we, or an owner (actually or constructively) of 10% or more of the value of our stock, actually or constructively owns 10% or more of such tenant, which is defined as a related party tenant taking into account certain complex attribution rules. Third, if rent attributable to personal property, leased in connection with a lease of real property, is greater than 15% of the total rent received under the lease, then the portion of rent attributable to such personal property will not qualify as &#8220;rents from real property.&#8221; Finally, for rents received to qualify as &#8220;rents from real property,&#8221; we generally must not operate or manage the property or furnish or render services to the tenants of such property, other than through an independent contractor from which we derive no revenue. We may, however, directly perform certain services that are &#8220;usually or customarily rendered&#8221; in connection with the rental of space for occupancy only and are not otherwise considered &#8220;rendered to the occupant&#8221; of the property. In addition, we may directly provide a minimal amount of &#8220;non-customary&#8221; services to the tenants of a property as long as our income from the services does not exceed 1% of our income from the related property. Furthermore, we may own up to 100% of the stock of a TRS, which may provide customary and non-customary services to our tenants without tainting our rental income from the related properties.

&#160;

The term &#8220;interest&#8221; generally does not include any amount received or accrued (directly or indirectly) if the determination of such amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person. However, an amount received or accrued generally will not be excluded from the term &#8220;interest&#8221; solely by reason of being based on (i) a fixed percentage or (ii) percentages of gross receipts or sales. In addition, an amount that is based on the income or profits of a debtor will be qualifying interest income as long as the debtor derives substantially all of its income from the real property securing the debt from leasing substantially all of its interest in the property, but only to the extent that the amounts received by the debtor would be qualifying &#8220;rents from real property&#8221; if received directly by a REIT.

&#160;

If a loan contains a provision that entitles us to a percentage of the borrower&#8217;s gain upon the sale of the real property securing the loan or a percentage of the appreciation in the property&#8217;s value as of a specific date, income attributable to that loan provision will be treated as gain from the sale of the property securing the loan, which generally is qualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests.

&#160;

Interest on debt secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property generally is qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test. However, if the highest principal amount of a loan outstanding during a taxable year exceeds the fair market value of the real property securing the loan as of the date we agreed to originate or acquire the loan, a portion of the interest income from such loan will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test, but will be qualifying income for purposes of the 95% gross income test. The portion of the interest income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test will be equal to the portion of the principal amount of the loan that is not secured by real property. Prior to January 1, 2016, in the case of a mortgage loan that is secured by both real and personal property, an allocation of the interest received between qualified mortgage interest and interest that was not qualified mortgage interest on the loan was required to be made if the fair market value of the real property at the time the loan was made was less than the principal amount of the loan. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015, in the case of a mortgage loan that is secured by both real and personal property, such allocation is required only if the fair market value of the personal property exceeds 15% of the value of the property. We do not expect the change in the rules for allocation of mortgage interest to have an impact on our ability to satisfy either of the gross income tests going forward.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

A modification of a mortgage loan, if it is deemed significant for income tax purposes, could be considered to be the deemed issuance of a new mortgage loan that is subject to re-testing under these rules, with the possible re-characterization of the mortgage interest on such loan as non-qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test (but not the 95% gross income test, which is discussed below), as well as non-qualifying assets under the asset test (discussed below) and the deemed exchange of the modified loan for the new loan could result in imposition of the 100% prohibited transaction tax (also discussed below). The IRS recently issued guidance providing relief in the case of certain existing mortgage loans held by a REIT that are modified in response to these market conditions such that (i) the modified mortgage loan need not be re-tested for purposes of determining whether the income from the mortgage loan continues to be qualified income for purposes of the 75% gross income test or whether the mortgage loan retains its character as a qualified REIT asset for purposes of the asset test (discussed below), and (ii) the modification of the loan will not be treated as a prohibited transaction. At present, we do not hold any mortgage loans that have been modified, which would require us to take advantage of these rules for special relief. We monitor our mortgage loans and direct financing leases for compliance with the above rules.

&#160;

Prohibited Transactions . We will incur a 100% tax on the net income derived from any sale or other disposition of property, other than foreclosure property, that we hold primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. We believe that none of our assets is primarily held for sale to customers and that a sale of any of our assets would not be in the ordinary course of our business. Whether a REIT holds an asset primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends, however, on the facts and circumstances in effect from time to time, including those related to a particular asset. Nevertheless, we will attempt to comply with the terms of safe-harbor provisions in the federal income tax laws prescribing when an asset sale will not be characterized as a prohibited transaction. The Code also provides a number of alternative exceptions from the 100% tax on &#8220;prohibited transactions&#8221; if certain requirements have been satisfied with respect to property disposed of by a REIT. These requirements relate primarily to the number and/or amount of properties disposed of by a REIT, the period of time the property has been held by the REIT, and/or aggregate expenditures made by the REIT with respect to the property being disposed of. The conditions needed to meet these requirements have been lowered for taxable years beginning in 2009 and thereafter. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with the safe-harbor provisions or that we would be able to avoid the 100% tax on prohibited transactions if we were to dispose of an owned property that otherwise may be characterized as property that we hold primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business.

&#160; 

Foreclosure Property . We will be subject to tax at the maximum corporate rate on any income from foreclosure property, other than income that otherwise would be qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test, less expenses directly connected with the production of that income. However, gross income from foreclosure property is treated as qualifying for purposes of the 75% and 95% gross income tests. Foreclosure property is any real property, including interests in real property, and any personal property incident to such real property:

&#160;

&#183; that is acquired by a REIT as the result of (i) the REIT having bid on such property at foreclosure, or having otherwise reduced such property to ownership or possession by agreement or process of law, after there was a default, or (ii) default was imminent on a lease of such property or on indebtedness that such property secured; &#160;

&#183; for which the related loan or lease was acquired by the REIT at a time when the default was not imminent or anticipated; and &#160;

&#183; for which the REIT makes a proper election to treat the property as foreclosure property. &#160;

Such property generally ceases to be foreclosure property at the end of the third taxable year following the taxable year in which the REIT acquired the property, or longer (for a total of up to six years) if an extension is granted by the Secretary of the Treasury. In the case of a &#8220;qualified health care property&#8221; acquired solely as a result of termination of a lease, but not in connection with default or an imminent default on the lease, the initial grace period terminates on the second (rather than third) taxable year following the year in which the REIT acquired the property (unless the REIT establishes the need for and the Secretary of the Treasury grants one or more extensions, not exceeding six years in total, including the original two-year period, to provide for the orderly leasing or liquidation of the REIT&#8217;s interest in the qualified health care property). This grace period terminates and foreclosure property ceases to be foreclosure property on the first day:

&#160;

&#183; on which a lease is entered into for the property that, by its terms, will give rise to income that does not qualify for purposes of the 75% gross income test, or any amount is received or accrued, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a lease entered into on or after such day that will give rise to income that does not qualify for purposes of the 75% gross income test; &#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; on which any construction takes place on the property, other than completion of a building or any other improvement, where more than 10% of the construction was completed before default became imminent; or &#160;

&#183; which is more than 90 days after the day on which the REIT acquired the property and the property is used in a trade or business that is conducted by the REIT, other than through an independent contractor from whom the REIT itself does not derive or receive any income or, with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015, through a TRS. &#160;

The definition of foreclosure property includes any &#8220;qualified health care property,&#8221; as defined in Code Section 856(e)(6) acquired by us as the result of the termination or expiration of a lease of such property. We have from time to time operated qualified healthcare facilities acquired in this manner for up to two years (or longer if an extension was granted). However, we do not currently own any property with respect to which we have made foreclosure property elections. Properties that we had taken back in a foreclosure or bankruptcy and operated for our own account were treated as foreclosure properties for income tax purposes, pursuant to Code Section 856(e). Gross income from foreclosure properties was classified as &#8220;good income&#8221; for purposes of the annual REIT income tests upon making the election on the tax return. Once made, the income was classified as &#8220;good&#8221; for a period of three years, or until the properties were no longer operated for our own account. In all cases of foreclosure property, we utilized an independent contractor to conduct day-to-day operations to comply with certain REIT requirements. In certain cases, we operated these facilities through a taxable REIT subsidiary. For those properties operated through the taxable REIT subsidiary, we utilized an eligible independent contractor to conduct day-to-day operations to comply with certain REIT requirements. As a result of the foregoing, we do not believe that our participation in the operation of nursing homes increased the risk that we would fail to qualify as a REIT. Through our 2015 taxable year, we had not paid any tax on our foreclosure property because those properties had been producing losses. We cannot predict whether, in the future, our income from foreclosure property will be significant and whether we could be required to pay a significant amount of tax on that income.

&#160;

Hedging Transactions . From time to time, we may enter into hedging transactions with respect to one or more of our assets or liabilities. Our hedging activities may include entering into interest rate swaps, caps and floors, options to purchase these items and futures and forward contracts. To the extent that we enter into an interest rate swap or cap contract, option, futures contract, forward rate agreement, or any similar financial instrument to hedge our indebtedness incurred to acquire or carry &#8220;real estate assets,&#8221; any periodic income or gain from the disposition of that contract should be qualifying income for purposes of the 95% gross income test, but not the 75% gross income test. Accordingly, our income and gain from our interest rate swap agreements generally is qualifying income for purposes of the 95% gross income test, but not the 75% gross income test. To the extent that we hedge with other types of financial instruments, or in other situations, it is not entirely clear how the income from those transactions will be treated for purposes of the gross income tests. We have structured and intend to continue to structure any hedging transactions in a manner that does not jeopardize our status as a REIT. For tax years beginning after 2004, we were no longer required to include income from hedging transactions in gross income (i.e., not included in either the numerator or the denominator) for purposes of the 95% gross income test and we are no longer required to include in gross income (i.e., not included in either the numerator or the denominator) for purposes of the 75% gross income test any gross income from any hedging transaction entered into after July 30, 2008. We did not engage in hedge transactions in 2012, 2013, or 2014. We commenced a hedging transaction in the fourth quarter of 2015, which has been structured to satisfy the requirements of the tax treatment outlined above, and anticipate engaging in hedging transactions from time to time going forward.

&#160;

TRS Income . A TRS may earn income that would not be qualifying income if earned directly by the parent REIT. Both the subsidiary and the REIT must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a TRS. A corporation of which a TRS directly or indirectly owns more than 35% of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a TRS. Overall, no more than 25% of the value of a REIT&#8217;s assets may consist of securities of one or more TRSs and, with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, no more than 20% of the value of a REIT&#8217;s assets may consist of securities of one or more TRSs. Prior to 2009, a TRS was not permitted to directly or indirectly (i) operate or manage a health care (or lodging) facility, or (ii) provide to any other person (under a franchise, license, or otherwise) rights to any brand name under which a health care (or lodging) facility is operated. Beginning in 2009, TRSs became permitted to own or lease a health care facility provided that the facility is operated and managed by an &#8220;eligible independent contractor.&#8221; A TRS will pay income tax at regular corporate rates on any income that it earns. In addition, the new rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a TRS to its parent REIT to assure that the TRS is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation. The rules also impose a 100% excise tax on transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT or the REIT&#8217;s operators that are not conducted on an arm&#8217;s-length basis. As stated above, we do not lease any of our facilities to any of our TRSs.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Failure to Satisfy Income Tests . If we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75% or 95% gross income tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless qualify as a REIT for such year if we are entitled to relief under certain relief provisions of the Code. These relief provisions will be generally available if our failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, we attach a schedule of the sources of our income to our tax return, and any incorrect information on the schedule was not due to fraud with intent to evade tax. It is not possible, however, to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions. Even if these relief provisions apply, we would incur a 100% tax on the gross income attributable to the greater of the amounts by which we fail the 75% and 95% gross income tests, multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability and we would file a schedule with descriptions of each item of gross income that caused the failure.

&#160;

Asset Tests . At the close of each quarter of our taxable year, we must also satisfy the following tests relating to the nature of our assets. First, at least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets (including (i) our allocable share of real estate assets held by partnerships in which we own an interest and (ii) stock or debt instruments held for less than one year purchased with the proceeds of a stock offering or long-term (at least five years) debt offering of our company), cash, cash items and government securities. Second, of our investments not included in the 75% asset class, the value of our interest in any one issuer&#8217;s securities may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets. Third, we may not own more than 10% of the voting power or value of any one issuer&#8217;s outstanding securities. Fourth, with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015, no more than 25% of the value of our total assets may be represented by nonqualified publicly offered REIT debt instruments. Fifth, no more than 25% of the value of our total assets may consist of the securities of one or more TRSs and, with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, no more than 20% of the value of our total assets may consist of the securities of one or more TRSs. Sixth, no more than 25% of the value of our total assets may consist of the securities of TRSs and other non-TRS taxable subsidiaries and other assets that are not qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% asset test.

&#160;

For purposes of the second and third asset tests described above the term &#8220;securities&#8221; does not include our equity or debt securities of a qualified REIT subsidiary, a TRS, or an equity interest in any partnership, since we are deemed to own our proportionate share of each asset of any partnership of which we are a partner. Furthermore, for purposes of determining whether we own more than 10% of the value of only one issuer&#8217;s outstanding securities, the term &#8220;securities&#8221; does not include: (i) any loan to an individual or an estate; (ii) any Code Section 467 rental agreement; (iii) any obligation to pay rents from real property; (iv) certain government issued securities; (v) any security issued by another REIT; and (vi) our debt securities in any partnership, not otherwise excepted under (i) through (v) above, (A) to the extent of our interest as a partner in the partnership or (B) if 75% of the partnership&#8217;s gross income is derived from sources described in the 75% income test set forth above.

&#160;

We may own up to 100% of the stock of one or more TRSs. However, overall, no more than 25% (or 20% with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017) of the value of our assets may consist of securities of one or more TRSs, and no more than 25% of the value of our assets may consist of the securities of TRSs and other non-TRS taxable subsidiaries (including stock in non-REIT C corporations) and other assets that are not qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% asset test. We do not anticipate that the reduction in value of TRSs that may be owned by a REIT will have an impact on us as we believe that the value of our TRSs is substantially less than 20% of the value of our assets and we do not expect the value of our TRSs to increase materially in the future.

&#160;

If the outstanding principal balance of a mortgage loan exceeds the fair market value of the real property securing the loan, a portion of such loan likely will not be a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the 75% test. The nonqualifying portion of that mortgage loan will be equal to the portion of the loan amount that exceeds the value of the associated real property. Prior to January 1, 2016, in the case of a mortgage loan that is secured by both real and personal property, a portion of the mortgage loan was required to be treated as a nonqualifying assets for purposes of the 75% tests if the fair market value of the real property at the time the loan was made was less than the principal amount of the loan. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2015, in the case of a mortgage loan that is secured by both real and personal property, such allocation is required only if the fair market value of the personal property exceeds 15% of the value of the property. We do not expect the change in the rules for allocation of mortgage interest to have an impact on our ability to satisfy either of the asset test going forward. As discussed under the 75% gross income test (see above), the IRS recently provided relief from re-testing certain mortgage loans held by a REIT that have been modified as a result of the current distressed market conditions with respect to real property. At present, we do not hold any mortgage loans that have been modified, which would require us to take advantage of these rules for special relief.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

After initially meeting the asset tests at the close of any quarter, we will not lose our status as a REIT for failure to satisfy any of the asset tests at the end of a later quarter solely by reason of changes in asset values. If the failure to satisfy the asset tests results from an acquisition of securities or other property during a quarter, the failure can be cured by disposition of sufficient nonqualifying assets within 30 days after the close of that quarter.

&#160;

Subject to certain de minimis exceptions, we may avoid REIT disqualification in the event of certain failures under the asset tests, provided that (i) we file a schedule with a description of each asset that caused the failure, (ii) the failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, (iii) we dispose of the assets within 6 months after the last day of the quarter in which the identification of the failure occurred (or the requirements of the rules are otherwise met within such period) and (iv) we pay a tax on the failure equal to the greater of (A) $50,000 per failure and (B) the product of the net income generated by the assets that caused the failure for the period beginning on the date of the failure and ending on the date we dispose of the asset (or otherwise satisfy the requirements) multiplied by the highest applicable corporate tax rate.

&#160;

Annual Distribution Requirements . To qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute dividends (other than capital gain dividends) to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to (A) the sum of (i) 90% of our &#8220;REIT taxable income&#8221; (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain) and (ii) 90% of the net income (after tax), if any, from foreclosure property, minus (B) the sum of certain items of noncash income. Such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for such year and paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration. In addition, such distributions are required to be made pro rata, with no preference to any share of stock as compared with other shares of the same class, and with no preference to one class of stock as compared with another class except to the extent that such class is entitled to such a preference. To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain, or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100% of our &#8220;REIT taxable income,&#8221; as adjusted, we will be subject to tax thereon at regular ordinary and capital gain corporate tax rates.

&#160;

Furthermore, if we fail to distribute during a calendar year, or by the end of January following the calendar year in the case of distributions with declaration and record dates falling in the last three months of the calendar year, at least the sum of:

&#160;

&#8226; 85% of our REIT ordinary income for such year;

&#160;

&#8226; 95% of our REIT capital gain income for such year; and

&#160;

&#8226; any undistributed taxable income from prior periods,

&#160;

we will incur a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the amounts we actually distribute. We may elect to retain and pay income tax on the net long-term capital gain we receive in a taxable year. If we so elect, we will be treated as having distributed any such retained amount for purposes of the 4% excise tax described above. We have made, and we intend to continue to make, timely distributions sufficient to satisfy the annual distribution requirements. We may also be entitled to pay and deduct deficiency dividends in later years as a relief measure to correct errors in determining our taxable income. Although we may be able to avoid income tax on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends, we will be required to pay interest to the IRS based upon the amount of any deduction we take for deficiency dividends.

&#160;

The availability to us of, among other things, depreciation deductions with respect to our owned facilities (which reduce our taxable income and the amount of our required dividend distributions) depends upon the determination that, for federal income tax purposes, we are the true owner of such facilities for federal income tax purposes, which is dependent on the classification of the leases to operators or our facilities as &#8220;true leases&#8221; rather than financing arrangements for federal income tax purposes. The determinations of whether (1) we are the owner of such facilities, and (2) the leases are true leases, for federal tax purposes are essentially factual matters. We believe that we will be treated as the owner of each of the facilities that we lease, and such leases will be treated as true leases for federal income tax purposes. However, no assurances can be given that the IRS will not successfully challenge our status as the owner of our facilities subject to leases, and the status of such leases as true leases, asserting that the purchase of the facilities by us and the leasing of such facilities merely constitute steps in secured financing transactions in which the lessees are owners of the facilities and we are merely a secured creditor. In such event, we would not be entitled to claim depreciation deductions with respect to any of the affected facilities. As a result, we might fail to meet the 90% distribution requirement or, if such requirement is met, we might be subject to corporate income tax or the 4% excise tax.

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Reasonable Cause Savings Clause . We may avoid disqualification in the event of a failure to meet certain requirements for REIT qualification if the failures are due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, and if the REIT pays a penalty of $50,000 for each such failure. This reasonable cause safe harbor is not available for failures to meet the 95% and 75% gross income tests or the assets tests.

&#160;

Failure to Qualify . If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, and the reasonable cause relief provisions do not apply, we will be subject to tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify will not be deductible, and our failure to qualify as a REIT would reduce the cash available for distribution by us to our stockholders. In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as dividend income, to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. However, in such a case, subject to certain limitations of the Code, corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividends received deduction with respect to dividends that we make, and in the case of an individual, trust, or an estate, dividends are treated the same as capital gain income, which currently is subject to a maximum income tax rate that is lower than regular income tax rates. In addition, in the case of an individual, trust or an estate, to the extent such taxpayer&#8217;s unearned income (including dividends) exceeds certain threshold amounts, the Medicare Tax on unearned income also will apply to dividend income. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we would also be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost. It is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to such statutory relief. Failure to qualify could result in our incurring indebtedness or liquidating investments to pay the resulting taxes.

&#160;

Our Subsidiaries. We own and operate a number of properties through subsidiaries and the classification of such subsidiaries varies for federal income tax purposes as described in this section. Some of the subsidiaries elected to be taxed as REITs beginning with the calendar year ending December 31, 2015. The stock of the REIT subsidiaries, and dividends received from the REIT subsidiaries, will qualify under the asset tests and income tests, respectively, as described above, provided that such subsidiaries maintain their REIT qualification.

&#160;

Some of the subsidiaries are classified as qualified REIT subsidiaries, which we refer to as QRSs. Code Section 856 (i) provides that a corporation that is a QRS shall not be treated as a separate corporation, and all assets, liabilities, and items of income, deduction, and credit of a qualified REIT subsidiary shall be treated as assets, liabilities and such items (as the case may be) of the REIT. Thus, in applying the tests for REIT qualification described above, the QRSs will be ignored, and all assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction, and credit of such QRSs will be treated as our assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction, and credit.

&#160;

Some of the subsidiaries are classified as TRSs. As described above, a TRS may earn income that would not be qualifying income if earned directly by the parent REIT; however, no more than 25% of the value of a REIT&#8217;s assets may consist of securities of one or more TRSs and, with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, no more than 20% of the value of a REIT&#8217;s assets may consist of securities of one or more TRSs. One or more of our TRSs hold a number of assets that cannot be owned directly by a REIT. The value of the securities of our TRSs is far less than the permitted percentage thresholds described in this section.

&#160;

Some of the subsidiaries are classified as partnerships. In the case of a REIT that is a partner in a partnership, such REIT is treated as owning its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership and as earning its allocable share of the gross income of the partnership for purposes of the applicable REIT qualification tests. Thus, our proportionate share of the assets, liabilities, and items of income of any partnership, joint venture, or limited liability company that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes in which we own an interest, directly or indirectly, will be treated as our assets and gross income for purposes of applying the various REIT qualification requirements. See &#8220; Tax Aspects of Our Investments in the Operating Partnership and Subsidiary Partnership s&#8221; below.

&#160; 

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Tax Aspects of Investments in the Operating Partnership and Subsidiary Partnerships 

&#160;

The following discussion summarizes certain federal income tax considerations applicable to our direct or indirect investments in our operating partnership, Omega OP, and any subsidiary partnerships or limited liability companies that we form or acquire (each, a &#8220;Partnership&#8221;, and collectively, the &#8220;Partnerships&#8221;). This discussion does not cover state or local tax laws or any federal tax laws other than income tax laws.

&#160;

Classification as Partnerships. We will be entitled to include in our income our distributive share of each Partnership&#8217;s income and to deduct our distributive share of each Partnership&#8217;s losses only if such Partnership is classified for federal income tax purposes as a partnership (or an entity that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes if the entity is treated as having only one owner for federal income tax purposes) rather than as a corporation or an association taxable as a corporation. An unincorporated entity with at least two owners or members will be classified as a partnership, rather than as a corporation, for federal income tax purposes if it:

&#160;

&#183; is treated as a partnership under the Treasury Regulations relating to entity classification (the &#8220;check-the-box regulations&#8221;); and &#183; is not a &#8220;publicly-traded partnership.&#8221; &#160;

Under the check-the-box regulations, an unincorporated entity with at least two owners or members may elect to be classified either as an association taxable as a corporation or as a partnership. If such an entity fails to make an election, it generally will be treated as a partnership (or an entity that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes if the entity is treated as having only one owner for federal income tax purposes) for federal income tax purposes. The Operating Partnership intends to be classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and will not elect to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation under the check-the-box regulations.

&#160;

A publicly traded partnership is a partnership whose interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof. A partnership whose interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof, and thus will be characterized as a publicly traded partnership that is characterized as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, may avoid characterization as a corporation for any taxable year if, for each taxable year beginning after December 31, 1987, in which it was classified as a publicly traded partnership, 90% or more of the partnership&#8217;s gross income for such year consists of certain passive-type income, including real property rents, gains from the sale or other disposition of real property, interest, and dividends (the &#8220;Qualifying Income Exception&#8221;). The Treasury Regulations provide limited safe harbors under which certain transfers of interests in the partnership may be ignored or not taken into account in the determination of whether a partnership&#8217;s interests are considered to be readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof (the &#8220;PTP Transfer Exceptions&#8221;). The Operating Partnership&#8217;s partnership agreement contains provisions enabling its general partner to take such steps as are necessary or appropriate to prevent the issuance and transfers of interests in the Operating Partnership that do not satisfy one of the PTP Transfer Exceptions, and thus, cause the Operating Partnership to be treated as a publicly traded partnership. To date, we believe that all transfers of our OP Units have satisfied one of the PTP Transfer Exceptions. However, even if the transfers of OP Units failed to qualify for any of the PTP Transfer Exceptions, and our Operating Partnership was considered to be a publicly traded partnership, we believe that our Operating Partnership would have sufficient qualifying income to satisfy the Qualifying Income Exception, and therefore, would not be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

&#160;

We have not requested, and do not intend to request, a ruling from the IRS that the Operating Partnership will be classified as a partnership and not as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. If for any reason the Operating Partnership were taxable as a corporation, rather than as a partnership, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we likely would not be able to qualify as a REIT unless we qualified for certain relief provisions. See the discussions entitled &#8220;Failure to Satisfy Income Tests,&#8221; &#8220;Asset Tests&#8221; and &#8220;Failure to Qualify&#8221; set forth above. In addition, any change in a Partnership&#8217;s status for tax purposes might be treated as a taxable event, in which case we might incur tax liability without any related cash distribution. See &#8220; Annual Distribution Requirements &#8221; above. Further, items of income and deduction of such Partnership would not pass through to its partners, and its partners would be treated as stockholders for tax purposes. Consequently, such Partnership would be required to pay income tax at corporate rates on its net income, and distributions to its partners would constitute dividends that would not be deductible in computing such Partnership&#8217;s taxable income.

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Partners, Not the Partnerships, Subject to Tax. A partnership is not a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes. Rather, we are required to take into account our allocable share of each Partnership&#8217;s income, gains, losses, deductions, and credits for any taxable year of such Partnership ending within or with our taxable year, without regard to whether we have received or will receive any distribution from such Partnership.

&#160;

Partnership Allocations. Although a partnership agreement generally will determine the allocation of income and losses among partners, such allocations will be disregarded for tax purposes if they do not comply with the provisions of the Code and Treasury Regulations governing partnership allocations. If an allocation is not recognized for federal income tax purposes, the item subject to the allocation will be reallocated in accordance with the partners&#8217; interests in the partnership, which will be determined by taking into account all of the facts and circumstances relating to the economic arrangement of the partners with respect to such item.

&#160;

Tax Allocations With Respect to Partnership Properties. Income, gain, loss, and deduction attributable to property that has appreciated or depreciated that is contributed to a partnership in exchange for an interest in the partnership must be allocated in a manner such that the contributing partner is charged with, or benefits from, respectively, the unrealized gain or unrealized loss associated with the property at the time of the contribution (the &#8220;704(c) Allocations&#8221;). The amount of such unrealized gain or unrealized loss, referred to as &#8220;built-in gain&#8221; or &#8220;built-in loss&#8221;, generally is equal to the difference between the fair market value of the contributed property at the time of contribution and the adjusted tax basis of such property at the time of contribution (a &#8220;book-tax difference&#8221;). Allocations with respect to book-tax differences are solely for federal income tax purposes and do not affect the book capital accounts or other economic or legal arrangements among the partners. A book-tax difference attributable to depreciable property generally is decreased on an annual basis as a result of the allocation of depreciation deductions to the contributing partner for book purposes but not for tax purposes. The Treasury Regulations require entities taxed as partnerships to use a &#8220;reasonable method&#8221; for allocating items with respect to which there is a book-tax difference and outline several reasonable allocation methods.

&#160;

Any gain or loss recognized by a Partnership on the disposition of contributed properties will be allocated first to the partners of the Partnership who contributed such properties to the extent of their built-in gain or loss on those properties for federal income tax purposes. The partners&#8217; built-in gain or loss on such contributed properties will equal the difference between the partners&#8217; proportionate share of the book value of those properties and the partners&#8217; tax basis allocable to those properties at the time of the contribution as reduced for any decrease in the book-tax difference. Any remaining gain or loss recognized by the Partnership on the disposition of the contributed properties, and any gain or loss recognized by the Partnership on the disposition of the other properties, generally will be allocated among the partners in accordance with the partnership agreement, unless such allocations and agreement do not satisfy the requirements of applicable Treasury Regulations, in which case the allocation will be made in accordance with the partners&#8217; interests in the partnership.

&#160;

On April 1, 2015, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Aviv REIT, Inc., through a merger of Aviv REIT, Inc., with and into our wholly-owned subsidiary, which merger included a combination which resulted in the acquisition by the Operating Partnership of substantially all of our assets and all of the assets of Aviv Healthcare Properties Limited Partnership. We treated such transfer of the properties to the Operating Partnership as a contribution to which the Operating Partnership received a &#8220;carryover&#8221; tax basis in the contributed properties. As a result, such properties had significant built-in gain or loss subject to Section 704(c) of the Code. As general partner of the Operating Partnership, we may account for the book-tax difference with respect to the properties contributed to the Operating Partnership under any method approved by Section 704(c) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations, except with respect to those properties acquired by the Operating Partnership that were contributed by Aviv REIT, Inc., with respect to which the Operating Partnership elected to use the &#8220;remedial method&#8221; of allocation pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-3(d).

&#160;

Sale of a Partnership&#8217;s Property. Generally, any gain realized by a Partnership on the sale of property held by the Partnership for more than one year will be long-term capital gain, except for any portion of such gain that is treated as depreciation or cost recovery recapture. Our share of any gain realized by a Partnership on the sale of any property held by the Partnership as inventory or other property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the Partnership&#8217;s trade or business will be treated as income from a prohibited transaction that is subject to a 100% penalty tax. Such prohibited transaction income also may have an adverse effect upon our ability to satisfy the income tests for REIT status. See &#8220; Income Tests &#8221; above. We do not presently intend to acquire or hold or to allow any Partnership to acquire or hold any property that represents inventory or other property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our or such Partnership&#8217;s trade or business.

Government Regulation and Reimbursement 

&#160; 

The healthcare industry is heavily regulated. Our operators are subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local healthcare laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent and substantial changes resulting from the adoption of new legislation, rules and regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law. The ultimate timing or effect of these changes, which may be applied retroactively, cannot be predicted. Changes in laws and regulations impacting our operators, in addition to regulatory non-compliance by our operators, can have a significant effect on the operations and financial condition of our operators, which in turn may adversely impact us. The following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to our operators, and in certain cases, to us.

&#160; 

Healthcare Reform . A substantial amount of rules and regulations have been issued under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively referred to as the &#8220;Healthcare Reform Law&#8221;). We expect additional rules, regulations and interpretations under the Healthcare Reform Law to be issued that may materially affect our operators&#8217; financial condition and operations.

&#160;

Under the Healthcare Reform Law, a Federal Commission on Long-Term Care was established which issued its report in September 2013. One of its recommendations was the convening of the White House Conference on Aging which met in July, 2015. At that meeting, it was announced that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;) was issuing a proposed rule on July 16, 2015 that included a significant number of revisions to the regulations covering the conditions of participation for SNFs to receive Medicare and Medicaid payments. These proposed regulations will substantially impact SNFs because they reflect the advances made over the past 24 years in the theory and practices of service delivery and safety, including the impact of other recent legislation emphasizing service quality, value over volume of services, and consistency in reporting. A final rule has not yet been published.

&#160;

Given the complexity of the Healthcare Reform Law and the substantial requirements for regulation thereunder, the impact of the Healthcare Reform Law on our operators or their ability to meet their obligations to us cannot be predicted. The Healthcare Reform Law could result in decreases in payments to our operators or otherwise adversely affect the financial condition of our operators, thereby negatively impacting our financial condition. Our operators may not be successful in modifying their operations to lessen the impact of any increased costs or other adverse effects resulting from changes in governmental programs, private insurance and/or employee welfare benefit plans. The impact of the Healthcare Reform Law on each of our operators will vary depending on payor mix, resident conditions and a variety of other factors. In addition to the provisions relating to reimbursement, other provisions of the Healthcare Reform Law may impact our operators as employers (e.g., requirements related to providing health insurance for employees).

&#160;

Reimbursement Generally . A significant portion of our operators&#8217; revenue is derived from governmentally-funded reimbursement programs, consisting primarily of Medicare and Medicaid. As federal and state governments focus on healthcare reform initiatives, and as the federal government and many states face significant current and future budget deficits, efforts to reduce costs by government payors will likely continue, which may result in reductions in reimbursement at both the federal and state levels. These cost-cutting measures could result in a significant reduction of reimbursement rates to our operators under both the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Additionally, new and evolving payor and provider programs, including but not limited to Medicare Advantage, dual eligible, accountable care organizations, and bundled payments could adversely impact our tenants&#8217; and operators&#8217; liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.

&#160;

We currently believe that our operator coverage ratios are adequate and that our operators can absorb moderate reimbursement rate reductions and still meet their obligations to us. However, significant limits on the scopes of services reimbursed and/or reductions of reimbursement rates could have a material adverse effect on our operators&#8217; results of operations and financial condition, which could adversely affect our operators&#8217; ability to meet their obligations to us.

&#160;

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Medicaid . State budgetary concerns, coupled with the implementation of rules under the Healthcare Reform Law, may result in significant changes in healthcare spending at the state level. Many states are currently focusing on the reduction of expenditures under their state Medicaid programs, which may result in a reduction in reimbursement rates for our operators. The need to control Medicaid expenditures may be exacerbated by the potential for increased enrollment in Medicaid due to unemployment and declines in family incomes. Since our operators&#8217; profit margins on Medicaid patients are generally relatively low, more than modest reductions in Medicaid reimbursement or an increase in the number of Medicaid patients could adversely affect our operators&#8217; results of operations and financial condition, which in turn could negatively impact us.

&#160;

The Healthcare Reform Law provided for Medicaid coverage to be expanded to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level, beginning January 1, 2014. The federal government committed to paying the entire cost for Medicaid coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries from 2014 through 2016. In 2017, the federal share will decline to 95%; in 2018, to 94%; in 2019, to 93%; and in 2020 and subsequent years, to 90%.

&#160;

On June 28, 2012, however, the Supreme Court ruled that states could not be required to expand Medicaid or risk losing federal funding of their existing Medicaid programs. As of December 31, 2015, thirty-one states including the District of Columbia have expanded or are expanding Medicaid coverage as contemplated by the Healthcare Reform Law, with many of the remaining states involved in a variety of legislative proposals or discussions.

&#160;

Medicare . On April 1, 2014, President Obama signed the &#8220;Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014&#8221; which calls for the United States Department of Health and Human Services (&#8220;HHS&#8221;) to develop a value based purchasing program for SNFs aimed at lowering readmission rates beginning on October 1, 2018.

&#160;

On July 30, 2015, the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;) issued a final rule outlining the FY 2016 Medicare payment rates for SNFs. Aggregate payments to SNFs are projected to increase by $430 million, or 1.2%, from payments in FY 2015. This estimated increase is attributable to a 2.3% market basket increase, reduced by a 0.6% forecast error adjustment and further reduced by 0.5% in accordance with the multifactor productivity adjustment required by law. The final rule also includes policies that advance setting measurable goals and timelines for paying SNFs based on the quality rather than the quantity of care to patients.

&#160;

The &#8220;Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015&#8221; extended the Medicare therapy cap exceptions process through December 31, 2017. The statutory Medicare Part B outpatient cap for occupational therapy is $1,960 for 2016, and the combined cap for physical therapy and speech therapy is also $1,960 for 2016. These caps do not apply to therapy services covered under Medicare Part A for SNFs, although the caps apply in most other instances involving patients in SNFs or long-term care facilities who receive therapy services covered under Medicare Part B. The exception process permits medically necessary therapy services beyond the cap limits. Expiration of the therapy cap exceptions process in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operators&#8217; financial condition and operations, which could adversely impact their ability to meet their obligations to us.

&#160;

The &#8220;Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015&#8221; (&#8220;BBA&#8221;) was signed by President Obama on November 2, 2015. While the BBA provides $80 billion in discretionary spending sequestration relief over two years, it also extended Medicare sequestration, which generally cuts Medicare provider and plan payments by 2% across the board, for an additional year, through 2025. The BBA also provides a uniform 2% reduction for 2024 instead of applying different rates during the first and second halves of the fiscal year. However, the fiscal year 2025 sequestration will be &#8220;front loaded,&#8221; such that, a 4% reduction will apply during the first six months of the fiscal year and no reduction will be imposed during the second half of the fiscal year.

&#160;

Quality of Care Initiatives . CMS has implemented a number of initiatives focused on the quality of care provided by nursing homes that could affect our operators. For instance, in December 2008, CMS released quality ratings for all of the nursing homes that participate in Medicare or Medicaid under its &#8220;Five Star Quality Rating System.&#8221; Facility rankings, ranging from five stars (&#8220;much above average&#8221;) to one star (&#8220;much below average&#8221;) are updated on a monthly basis. SNFs are required to provide information for the CMS Nursing Home Compare website regarding staffing and quality measures. Based on this data and the results of state health inspections, SNFs are then rated based on the five-star rating system. In 2015, CMS made changes to the rating system including: (1) revising scoring methodology by which quality measure ratings are calculated for SNFs; (2) increasing the number and type of quality measures that are not solely based on self-reported data and (3) adding critical measures to staffing such as turnover and retention. It is possible that this or any other ranking system could lead to future reimbursement policies that reward or penalize facilities on the basis of the reported quality of care parameters.

&#160;

&#160; 15 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

CMS has incorporated hospital readmissions review into the Quality Indicators Survey. Under Medicare&#8217;s Inpatient Prospective Payment System, CMS began adjusting payments to hospitals for excessive readmissions of patients for heart attacks, heart failure and pneumonia during fiscal years beginning on and after October 1, 2012. Long term care facilities are under increased scrutiny to prevent residents from being readmitted to hospitals for these conditions in particular, and have an opportunity to demonstrate their quality of care by reducing their hospital readmission rates. It is anticipated that hospital readmissions will be a consideration in the future in the CMS five-star rating system.

&#160;

Office of the Inspector General Activities . The Office of Inspector General&#8217;s (the &#8220;OIG&#8221;) Work Plan for government fiscal year 2016, which describes projects that the OIG plans to address during the fiscal year, includes two projects related specifically to nursing homes. (1) compliance with various aspects of the SNF prospective payment system; and (2) background checks for employees.

&#160;

Fraud and Abuse . There are various federal and state civil and criminal laws and regulations governing a wide array of healthcare provider referrals, relationships and arrangements, including laws and regulations prohibiting fraud by healthcare providers. Many of these complex laws raise issues that have not been clearly interpreted by the relevant governmental authorities and courts.

&#160;

These laws include: (i) federal and state false claims acts, which, among other things, prohibit providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs; (ii) federal and state anti-kickback and fee-splitting statutes, including the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute, which prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals or recommendations of healthcare items or services, such as services provided in a SNF; (iii) federal and state physician self-referral laws (commonly referred to as the Stark Law), which generally prohibit referrals by physicians to entities for designated health services (some of which are provided in SNFs) with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship; (iv) the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the knowing presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for certain healthcare services and (v) federal and state privacy laws, including the privacy and security rules contained in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which provide for the privacy and security of personal health information.

&#160;

Violations of healthcare fraud and abuse laws carry civil, criminal and administrative sanctions, including punitive sanctions, monetary penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and potential exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs. Additionally, there are criminal provisions that prohibit filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment or certification under Medicare and Medicaid, as well as failing to refund overpayments or improper payments. Violation of the anti-kickback statute or Stark Law may form the basis for a federal False Claims Act violation. These laws are enforced by a variety of federal, state and local agencies and can also be enforced by private litigants through, among other things, federal and state false claims acts, which allow private litigants to bring qui tam or whistleblower actions, which have become more frequent in recent years.

&#160;

Privacy . Our operators are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect the confidentiality and security of patient health information, including the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and the corresponding regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively referred to herein as &#8220;HIPAA&#8221;). HHS has been conducting audits of covered entities to evaluate compliance with HIPAA, and it will continue its audit program in 2016 which will also include an audit of business associates and a focus on security risk assessments.

&#160;

Various states have similar laws and regulations that govern the maintenance and safeguarding of patient records, charts and other information generated in connection with the provision of professional medical services. These laws and regulations require our operators to expend the requisite resources to secure protected health information, including the funding of costs associated with technology upgrades. Operators found in violation of HIPAA or any other privacy law or regulation may face large penalties. In addition, compliance with an operator&#8217;s notification requirements in the event of a breach of unsecured protected health information could cause reputational harm to an operator&#8217;s business.

&#160;

Licensing and Certification . Our operators and facilities are subject to various federal, state and local licensing and certification laws and regulations, including laws and regulations under Medicare and Medicaid requiring operators of SNFs and ALFs to comply with extensive standards governing operations. Governmental agencies administering these laws and regulations regularly inspect our operators&#8217; facilities and investigate complaints. Our operators and their managers receive notices of observed violations and deficiencies from time to time, and sanctions have been imposed from time to time on facilities operated by them. In addition, many states require certain healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need, which requires prior approval for the construction, expansion or closure of certain healthcare facilities, which has the potential to impact some of our operators&#8217; abilities to expand or change their businesses.

&#160;

&#160; 16 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Americans with Disabilities Act (the &#8220;ADA&#8221;) . Our properties must comply with the ADA and any similar state or local laws to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined in those statutes. The ADA may require removal of barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. Should barriers to access by persons with disabilities be discovered at any of our properties, we may be directly or indirectly responsible for additional costs that may be required to make facilities ADA-compliant. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. Our commitment to make readily achievable accommodations pursuant to the ADA is ongoing, and we continue to assess our properties and make modifications as appropriate in this respect.

&#160;

Other Laws and Regulations . Additional federal, state and local laws and regulations affect how our operators conduct their operations, including laws and regulations protecting consumers against deceptive practices and otherwise generally affecting our operators&#8217; management of their property and equipment and the conduct of their operations (including laws and regulations involving fire, health and safety; quality of services, including care and food service; residents&#8217; rights, including abuse and neglect laws; and the health standards set by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration).

&#160;

General and Professional Liability. Although arbitration agreements have been effective in limiting general and professional liabilities for SNF and long term care providers, there have been numerous lawsuits challenging the validity of arbitration agreements in long term care settings. On July 16, 2015, CMS issued a proposed rule on, Reform of Requirements for Long-Term Care Facilities, which would require SNFs to explain binding arbitration agreements to residents and their families before they sign them. The rule would also prohibit requiring arbitration agreements as a condition of admission. While a final rule has not been promulgated, if this rule is finalized as proposed, there would likely be an increase in liabilities for SNF and long term care providers.

&#160;
