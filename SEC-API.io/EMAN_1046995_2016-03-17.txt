 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Introduction 

&#160; 

eMagin Corporation (&#8220;eMagin, &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our company,&#8221; or &#8220;us,&#8221;) is a leader in the manufacture of microdisplays using OLED (organic light emitting diode) technology. We design, develop, manufacture, and market OLED on silicon microdisplays, virtual imaging products that utilize OLED microdisplays, and related products. We also perform research in the OLED field. Our virtual imaging products integrate OLED technology with silicon chips to produce high-resolution microdisplays smaller than one-inch diagonally which, when viewed through a magnifier, create virtual images that appear comparable in size to that of a computer monitor or a large-screen television. Our products enable our original equipment manufacturer (&#8220;OEM&#8221;) customers to develop and market improved or new electronic products, especially products that are mobile and highly portable so that people have immediate access to information and can experience immersive forms of communications and entertainment. 

&#160; 

We believe our OLED microdisplays offer a number of significant advantages over comparable liquid crystal microdisplays (&#8220;LCDs&#8221; and &#8220;LCOS&#8221;) including greatly increased power efficiency, less weight, more compact size, negligible image smearing and dramatically higher contrast. Using our active matrix OLED technology, many computer and electronic system functions can be built directly into the OLED microdisplay silicon backplane, resulting in compact, high resolution, power efficient systems. Already proven in military and commercial systems, our portfolio of OLED microdisplays deliver high-resolution, flicker-free virtual images that perform effectively even in extreme temperatures and high-vibration conditions We have developed our own intellectual property and accumulated over 15 years of manufacturing know-how to create high performance OLED microdisplays. 

&#160; 

eMagin Corporation was created through the merger of Fashion Dynamics Corporation (&#34;FDC&#34;), which was organized on January 23, 1996 under the laws of the State of Nevada, and FED Corporation (&#34;FED&#34;), a developer and manufacturer of optical systems and microdisplays for use in the electronics industry. Simultaneous with this merger, we changed our name to eMagin Corporation. eMagin is incorporated in the state of Delaware. 

&#160; 

We derive the majority of our revenue from sales of our OLED microdisplay products. We also earn revenue from government and commercial development contracts that may complement and support our internal research and development programs. In addition, we generate sales from optics and microdisplays combined with optics (&#8220;microviewers&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Our Technology Platforms 

&#160; 

Small Molecule, Top-Emitting Active Matrix OLED Technology 

&#160; 

There are two basic classes of OLED technology, dubbed single molecule, or small molecule (monomer), and polymer. Our microdisplays are currently based upon active matrix small molecule OLED technology, which we refer to as active matrix OLED (&#8220;AMOLED&#8221;) because we build the displays directly onto silicon chips. Our AMOLED technology uniquely permits millions of individual low-voltage light sources to be built on low-cost, silicon computer chips to produce single color, white or full-color display arrays. Using our OLED technology, many computer and video electronic system functions can be built directly into the silicon chip, under the OLED film, resulting in very compact, integrated systems with lower overall system costs relative to alternative technologies. 

&#160; 

OLEDs are thin films of stable organic materials that emit light of various colors when a voltage is impressed across them. OLEDs are emissive devices, which means that they create their own light, as opposed to liquid crystal displays (&#8220;LCD&#8221;), which require a separate light source. As a result, our OLED microdisplays use less power and can be capable of higher brightness and fuller color than liquid crystal microdisplays. Unlike LCD displays which use crossed polarizers to generate black level, OLED displays exhibit an extremely high contrast ratio which results in very vivid images. Because the light they emit is Lambertian, which means that it appears equally bright from most forward directions, a moderate movement in the eye does not change the image brightness or color as it does in other technologies. 

&#160; 

Our technology is based on integrating a proprietary OLED device with a uniquely designed silicon backplane to produce efficient and high performance AMOLED microdisplays. Our OLED displays incorporate a unique, top-emitting structure for our OLED devices that enables OLED displays to be built on opaque silicon integrated circuits rather than only on glass. Our OLED microdisplays emit full visible spectrum light that is isolated with color filters to create full color images. Our microdisplays have a brightness that can be greater than that of a typical notebook computer and can have a potential useful life of over 50,000 operating hours, in certain applications. New processes and device improvements, such as our OLED-XLS&#8482; technology, offer even better performance for brightness, efficiency, and lifespan. Our ongoing efforts to develop extremely bright OLED microdisplays are on track. We have recently demonstrated high resolution (WUXGA) microdisplays with brightness in excess of 6,500 nits, which is the world&#8217;s highest resolution and brightness. In addition to our AMOLED technology, we have developed compact optic and lens enhancements which, when coupled with the microdisplay, provide our high quality large screen appearance that we believe a large proportion of the marketplace demands. 

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

We believe that our AMOLED technology provides significant advantages over other microdisplay technologies in our targeted microdisplay markets. We believe these key advantages include: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; &#160; Low power consumption for improved battery life and longer system life; &#183; &#160; &#160; High-speed performance resulting in clear video images; &#183; &#160; &#160; Wide angle light emission resulting in large apparent screen size; &#183; &#160; &#160; Wide operating temperature range; &#183; &#160; &#160; Good environmental stability (vibration and humidity); &#183; &#160; &#160; Low manufacturing cost; and &#183; &#160; &#160; Low cost system solutions. &#160; 

Prism Optics 

&#160; 

High quality, large view lenses with a wide range for eye positioning are essential for using our displays in near-eye systems. We have developed advanced molded plastic prism lenses that permit our AMOLED microdisplays to provide large field of view images that can be viewed for extended periods with reduced eye-fatigue. We have engaged a firm to manufacture our lenses in order to provide them in larger quantities to our customers. We have developed an additional prism optic for a project that will pair with our SXGA096 display.

&#160;

Our Market Opportunities 

&#160; 

The markets we target broadly fall into the categories of military, industrial/medical, and consumer though many of our products serve multiple markets (&#8220;dual use&#8221;). Within each of these market sectors, we believe that our OLED microdisplays, when combined with compact optic lenses, can become a key component for a number of mobile electronic products. Many of these products employ head-wearable displays that incorporate microdisplays mounted in or on eyeglasses, goggles, simple headbands, helmets, or hardhats, and are often referred to as head-mounted displays (HMDs) or headsets. Head-wearable displays may block out surroundings for a fully immersive experience, or be designed as &#34;see-through&#34; or &#34;see-around&#34; to the user's surroundings. They may contain one (monocular) or two (binocular) displays. Some of the increased current interest among prospective customers is due to accelerating the timetable to adapt such systems for military and commercial pilot&#8217;s aviation helmets and potentially large consumer virtual and augmented reality applications. 

&#160; 

Military/Aviation 

&#160; 

Properly implemented, we believe that head-mounted systems incorporating our microdisplays increase the user&#8217;s effectiveness by allowing hands-free operation and increasing situational awareness with enough brightness for use in daylight, yet controllable for nighttime light security. As a COTS (commercial off the shelf) component, OLED microdisplays intrinsically demonstrate performance characteristics important to military and other demanding commercial and industrial applications including high contrast, wide dimming range, shock and vibration resistance and insensitivity to high G-forces. The image does not suffer from flicker or color breakup in vibrating environments and the microdisplay's wide viewing angle allows ease of viewing for long periods of time. Most importantly, our OLED's very low power consumption reduces battery weight and increases allowed mission length. The OLED's inherent wide operating temperature range is of special interest for military applications because the display can turn on instantly at temperatures far below freezing and can operate at very high temperatures in desert conditions. Our microdisplay products provide power advantages over other microdisplay technologies, particularly liquid crystal displays which require backlights and heaters and cannot provide instant-on capabilities at low temperatures. 

&#160; 

Our products&#8217; military applications primarily fall into three broad areas: (1) helmet-mounted displays for situational awareness and data; (2) night vision/thermal imaging goggles, rifles and targeting sights, and handheld viewers; and (3) training and simulation devices. Similar systems are of interest for other military applications as well as for demanding operations such as urban security, homeland defense, fire and rescue. 

&#160; 

Situational Awareness. Situational awareness products include head-mounted displays that are used to display such things as digital map, sensor imagery and pilot aviation information. Handheld imagers also provide improved situational awareness for surveillance and training. In certain situations, these products are combined with a weapon system to give the user the capability of selecting targets without direct exposure. Our OLED microdisplays have been incorporated into both U.S. and foreign military situational awareness programs. The use of OLED microdisplays for aviation helmets is possible because of newly developed high brightness OLED technology at eMagin.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

Night Vision/Thermal Imaging. Night vision goggles allow the user to see in low light conditions. Most versions include two different technologies: infrared/thermal and image intensification. Third and fourth generation military devices generally use some combination of the two technologies. Thermal imagers detect infrared energy (heat) and convert it into an electronic signal. The resulting signal needs to be presented on a display. Heat sensed by an infrared camera can be very precisely quantified, or measured, allowing the user to not only monitor thermal performance, but also identify and evaluate the relative severity of heat-related problems. Thermal imaging systems can be stand-alone handheld systems or integrated as part of the aiming mechanism for a larger system. Advances in sensor technology, both in sensitivity and resolution as well as economic efficiency, have been the driving factors in the adoption of thermal technologies for military applications. The power efficiency and environmental ruggedness of our products are strong competitive advantages, particularly for smaller handheld non-cooled systems. Fielded products incorporating our OLED microdisplays include Exelis&#8217; Enhanced Night Vision Goggle for the U.S. Army, L-3&#8217;s Javelin medium-range anti-tank missile system, Northrop Grumman&#8217;s Lightweight Laser Designator Rangefinders (LLDR), Thales&#8217; SOPHIE&#8482; handheld thermal imagers, and Thales&#8217; MINIE&#8482;, LUCIE&#8482;, and MONIE&#8482; night vision goggles. 

&#160; 

Training and Simulation. Our OLED microdisplays are purchased by OEMs for use with their simulation and training products. The companies that incorporate our OLEDs in their training and simulation products include Quantum 3D, Rockwell Collins, Intevac Vision Systems, and Sensics. 

&#160; 

Our displays have been commercialized or prototyped for situational awareness and night vision/thermal imaging applications by military systems integrators including Elbit, L-3 Communications, Intevac Vision Systems, Nivisys, BAE Systems Technology, DRS, Exelis Inc. (formerly ITT), Intevac Vision Systems, Qioptiq, Rockwell Collins, SA Photonics, Saab, Sagem DS, and Thales, among many others. 

&#160; 

Commercial, Industrial, and Medical 

&#160; 

We believe that a wide variety of commercial and industrial markets offer significant opportunities for our products due to increasing demand for instant data accessibility in mobile workplace environments and due to the benefit of mobile displays to enhance visual performance. Some examples of potential microdisplay applications include enhanced visualization during ocular surgery, mobile ultrasound, mobile nondestructive testing, enhanced vision for those with visual impairments, immediate access to inventory or maintenance and construction manuals; routine quality assurance inspection; and real-time viewing of images and data for a variety of applications. As one potential example, a user wearing an HMD while operating test equipment, such as an oscilloscope, can view technical data while simultaneously probing printed circuit boards. Current commercial products equipped with our OLED microdisplays in these sectors include those produced by BCF, Liteye, FLIR Systems, Nordic NeuroLab, VRmagic GmbH, Sensics and Total Fire Group, among others. 

&#160; 

Consumer 

&#160; 

We believe that the most significant driver of the longer term near-eye virtual imaging microdisplay market is the growing consumer demand for mobile access to larger volumes of information and entertainment in smaller and more affordable packages. This desire for mobility has resulted in the development of mobile video personal viewer products in three general categories: (i) an emerging market for immersive virtual reality headset-application platforms such as accessories for gaming computers, portable DVD systems and wearable telepresence systems; (ii) an emerging market for augmented reality electronic viewers incorporated in products such as data glasses and personal viewers for cell phones; and (iii) a growing market in low cost thermal and low light images and scopes for hunting and other outdoor activities. 

&#160; 

As we manufacture our OLED displays in higher volumes at reduced costs, we believe that our products will be increasingly well positioned to compete with and displace liquid crystal displays in the rapidly growing consumer market, particularly as the demand grows for sophisticated mobile personal viewers offering higher resolution and better image quality. Potential applications for these personal viewers include handheld personal computers and mobile devices, like smartphones, whose small, direct view screens limit the amount of information that can be displayed but which are now capable of running more complex software applications. Examples encompass applications where hands-free viewing is desired, such as maintenance activities; e ntertainment and gaming video headset systems; and night time or thermal imaging devices for hunting, camping, and other outdoor activities. Current commercial products equipped with our OLED microdisplays in these sectors include those produced by IR Defense, among others. In addition, in late 2015, we entered into a Head Mounted Display technology licensing deal with an unnamed company which includes the use of our 2K x 2K displays in its consumer headsets.

Our Products 

&#160; 

Our first commercial microdisplay, the SVGA+ OLED, was introduced in 2001. In 2008, we introduced engineering samples of our SXGA120 OLED microdisplays and began selling significant quantities of the product in 2010. In late 2011, we began selling pre-production samples of the WUXGA OLED microdisplay which is now qualified and in production. The pace of product introductions and upgrades has increased over the past two years. In 2014, we released our Digital SVGA and in 2015 we released our smaller pixel pitch digital SXGA, SXGA096, as well as an upgrade to the SXGA120 . eMagin OLED display products are being applied or considered for near-eye and headset applications in products to be manufactured by OEM customers for a wide variety of military, medical, industrial, and consumer applications. We offer our products to OEMs and other buyers as both separate components, integrated bundles coupled with our own optics, or full systems. We also offer engineering support to enable customers to quickly integrate our products into their own product development programs and design customized displays with resolutions or features to meet special customer requirements. In 2015 we announced the development of a prototype 2K x 2K immersive headset that uses our prototype 2K x 2K display. With the addition of these new displays, we now offer the widest variety of OLED microdisplay options to our customers.

&#160; 

SVGA+ OLED Microdisplay Series (Super Video Graphics Array of 852x600). This 0.62 inch diagonal microdisplay has a resolution of 852x600 triad pixels (1.53 million picture elements). The display also has an internal NTSC monochrome video decoder for low power night vision systems. The SVGA+ Rev3 OLED-XL microdisplay is a power efficient OLED display solution for near-eye personal viewer applications which uses less than 115 mW power in monochrome for thermal imaging applications, and lower than 175 mW at 200 cd/m2 for full color video. 

&#160;

Digital SVGA OLED-XL. The Digital SVGA or DSVGA OLED-XL was released for production in Q2 2014. This is an 800 x 600 display with 15 micron pixels and a 0.6 inch diagonal. It has all the benefits of eMagin&#8217;s other digital displays including lower power (100 mW monochrome and 135 mW color), high (10,000 to 1) contrast, and also features a digital composite signal interface, enabling a minimal physical interface for color applications

&#160;

SXGA096 OLED-XL/XLS (Super eXtended Graphics Array, 1024 x 1024). This new display introduced in Q3 2015, features a 9.6-micron color pixel and was designed with the same level of feature integration as the DSVGA microdisplay, as well as low pin-count high speed LVDS (Low Voltage Differential Signaling) data interface. The compactness and high information content of the SXGA096 makes it ideal for small form factor applications such as commercial headsets and smart weapon sights. New with this microdisplay is the availability of the OLED XLS technology that more than doubles the OLED XL brightness. This expands the range of optical solutions that can be used with this display to result in smaller and lighter display modules.

&#160;

SXGA OLED-XL (Super eXtended Graphics Array, 1280 x 1024 ). Our SXGA OLED microdisplay with a 0.77 inch diagonal active area provides 3,932,160 sub-pixels in an active area. The display&#8217;s pixel array comprises triads of vertical sub-pixels stacked side by side to make up each 12 x 12mm color pixel. The SXGA OLED-XL microdisplay offers digital signal processing, requiring less than 200mW under typical operation. The supported video formats are SXGA, 720p, DVGA (through 1280 x 960 pixel doubling), and both frame sequential and field sequential stereovision. 

&#160; 

VGA OLED-XL (Video Graphics Array, 640 x 480 ). The VGA OLED-XL microdisplay was added to eMagin&#8217;s product line in April 2011 and is our smallest (0.5 inches) and lowest powered (&#60;60 mW monochrome/&#60;100 mW color). The VGA OLED-XL utilizes the same voltage pixel drive architecture and &#8220;Deep Black&#8221; technology as the SXGA and WUXGA designs and includes motion artifact reduction technology like the WUXGA. Also like the SXGA and WUXGA, the VGA provides a FPGA driver design for maximum flexibility and versatility. The VGA interface is 30-bit digital RGB. 

&#160; 

WUXGA OLED-XL (Widescreen Ultra eXtended Graphics Array, 1920 x 1200 ). Our WUXGA OLED-XL microdisplay provides higher resolution than most HD (High Definition) flat screen televisions. With a triad sub-pixel structure this display is built of 7,138,360 active dots at 3.2 microns each. The WUXGA OLED-XL is built upon the voltage pixel drive approach first developed for the SXGA OLED-XL which provides improved uniformity, ultra-high contrast (measured at greater than 100,000:1) and lower power. The advanced WUXGA design features eMagin&#8217;s proprietary &#8220;Deep Black&#8221; architecture that ensures that off-pixels are truly black, automatically optimizes contrast under all conditions, and delivers better pixel to pixel uniformity. The WUXGA OLED-XL includes a very low-power, low-voltage-differential-signaling (LVDS) serial interface and the overall display power requirement is typically less than 350 mW running standard video. Also included is eMagin&#8217;s proprietary motion enhancement technology which smoothes video display and virtually eliminates unwanted artifacts. Like the SXGA, the WUXGA provides a FPGA driver design available on a separate, lower power driver board, or as source code for integration into end product electronics giving OEM developers maximum versatility and flexibility. On-board circuitry ensures consistent color and brightness over a wide range of operating temperatures. 

&#160; 

Lens and Design Reference Kit s . We offer a WF05 prism optic with mounting brackets or combined with OLED microdisplays to form an optic-display module. We provide Design Reference Kits, which include a microdisplay and associated electronics to help OEMs evaluate our microdisplay products and to assist their efforts to build and test new products incorporating our microdisplays. 

&#160; 

Integrated Modules. We provide near-eye virtual imaging modules that incorporate our OLED-on-silicon microdisplays with our lenses and electronic interfaces for integration into OEM products. We have shipped customized modules to several customers, some of which have incorporated our products into their own commercial products. 

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Headsets (&#8220;HMDs&#8221;). In 2014, eMagin developed and demonstrated a new Immersive Head Mounted Display (IHMD) with a different look and superior performance than other Virtual Reality (VR) HMDs. Compared to other VR HMDs, it has 4 times the resolution, no pixelization, and a much smaller form factor. It incorporates our latest 2K by 2K high-resolution OLED microdisplays and patented optics, giving it significantly sharper resolution than a cell phone display and conventional optics. The field of view (&#8220;FOV&#8221;) of the IHMD exceeds one hundred (100) degrees and it has a resolution of four (4) megapixels per eye. We entered into a nonexclusive license to the technology used in this immersive HMD to an undisclosed company in late 2015. This company will incorporate our 2K x 2K displays in headsets that use the technology. Improvements in our 2K by 2K display are in process and a qualified version will be available in early 2016. &#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

We comply with all applicable export control laws including the Export Administration Regulations (&#8220;EAR&#8221;) and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (&#8220;ITAR&#8221;). Certain of our products may be deemed to be controlled for export by the U.S. Commerce Department&#8217;s Bureau of Industry and Security under the EAR or by the U.S. State Department&#8217;s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (&#8220;DDTC&#8221;) under the ITAR. Most of our ITAR products are custom displays developed for a specific military program or purpose. Failure to comply with these export control laws can lead to severe penalties, both civil and criminal, and can include debarment from contracting with the U.S. Government. 

&#160;

Government Contract Funding 

&#160; 

We derive a portion of our revenue from funding that we receive pursuant to research contracts or subcontracts funded by various agencies of the United States Government. The revenue that we recognize from these contracts represents reimbursement by various government entities. In 2007, we were awarded a contract for the development of power efficient microdisplays for the United States Army Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (&#8220;NVESD&#8221;). In 2008, this agreement was renewed through 2010; it was renewed again though 2011. In 2010, we were awarded a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement by NVESD for the Development, Evaluation and Characterization of Active Matrix Organic Light Emitting Diode (AMOLED) displays for use in HMDs. 

&#160; 

In 2007, we were awarded a contract for the development of an ultra-high resolution display for the United States Army Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (&#8220;TATRC&#8221;). In 2008 and 2009, this agreement was renewed through the first quarter of 2012. In February 2012, we were awarded a Small Business Innovation Research contract by the United States Special Operations Command to optimize our WUXGA (1920x1200) microdisplay for mass production for dual use applications. 

&#160; 

The U.S. Navy awarded eMagin a contract in 2011 for research and development of microdisplays using Silicon on Insulator technology. In 2012, we were awarded a follow-on contract for development of a high-brightness, high resolution microdisplay to be used for head-mounted avionics applications. Work on this contract continued throughout 2013 and was completed in 2014. 

&#160; 

In 2014, eMagin was awarded several new R&#38;D contracts totaling over $7 million. The largest of these was a contract to develop and produce an ultra-high resolution, high brightness, high contrast, full color OLED microdisplay at a low unit cost . This Defense-wide Manufacturing Science &#38; Technology (DMS&#38;T) award (also known as ManTech) is funded by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition , Technology, and Logistics (USD AT&#38;L) and will be administered by the US Army RDECOM CERDEC Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) Science and Technology (S&#38;T) Division. eMagin is currently about halfway through the work on this contract. 

&#160;

In 2015, eMagin was awarded two new development programs that are continuing into 2016. The first program is a Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program with the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and the second, a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program with the United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM). Both programs are investigating improved OLED micro display design and performance.

&#160;

Also in 2015, eMagin was awarded a contract for a feasibility study for a new microdisplay based on an improved backplane design. This contract has been extended to the next phase, and is worth over $1.1 million if all phases are contracted. Our government contracts require us to conduct the research effort described in the statement of work section of the contract. These contracts may be modified or terminated at the discretion of the government and are subject to authorization, appropriation and allocation of the required funding on an annual basis. On contracts for which we are the prime contractor, we subcontract portions of the work to various entities and institutions. Approximately 14% of 2015 revenue was related to research contracts funded by the U.S. Government as compared to 4% in 2014.

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

Our strategy is to strengthen our leadership position as a worldwide supplier of microdisplays and virtual imaging technology solutions for applications in high growth segments of the electronics industry by capitalizing on our experience and expertise in active matrix OLED technology and silicon wafer design. We aim to provide microdisplays and complementary accessories to enable OEM customers to develop and manufacture new and enhanced electronic products. Some key elements of our strategy to achieve these objectives include the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; &#160; Strengthen our technology leadership . As the first to exploit AMOLED microdisplays and the only benefactor of U.S. Government Contract Research and Development programs for OLED microdisplays, we believe that we enjoy a significant advantage in bringing this technology to market. By continuing to invest in research and development, and protecting our intellectual property, we expect to further develop performance improvements and provide a competitive edge for our customers who integrate our displays into their end products. &#183; &#160; &#160; Optimize microdisplay manufacturing efficiencies while protecting proprietary processes and partner with large volume manufacturers to bring our technology into high volume production. We intend to reduce our production costs primarily by increasing manufacturing yield and lowering fixed costs through reduced cycle time and increased automation as well as equipment upgrades. We outsource certain portions of microdisplay production, such as chip fabrication, to minimize our costs and time to market. We intend to retain the OLED-related processes in-house, where we have a core competency and manufacturing expertise. We also believe that by keeping these processes under tight control we can better protect our proprietary technology and process know-how. We believe that this strategy will also enhance our ability to continue to optimize and customize processes and devices to meet customer needs. In order to address emerging high volume consumer electronics OLED microdisplay requirements, we are actively seeking manufacturing partners who can help us realize that objective. &#183; &#160; &#160; Build and maintain strong design capabilities. We employ in-house design capabilities supplemented by outsourced design services. Building and maintaining this capability allows us to reduce engineering costs, accelerate the design process and enhance design accuracy to respond to our customers' needs as new markets develop. Contracting third party design support to meet demand and for specialized design skills may also remain a part of our overall long term strategy. Given these capabilities we continue to look for opportunities to add value to our displays to increase revenue. &#183; &#160; &#160; Leverage strategic relationships. External relationships play an important role in our research and development efforts. Suppliers, equipment vendors, government organizations, contract research groups, external design companies, customer and corporate partners, consortia, and university relationships all enhance the overall research and development effort and bring us new ideas and solutions. In addition, we participate in industry associations such as Society Information Display (&#8220;SID&#8221;), SPIE, the international society for optics and photonics, and the Army Aviation Association of America, among others. We believe that strategic relationships allow us to better determine the demands of the marketplace and, as a result, allow us to focus our future research and development activities to satisfy our customers&#8217; evolving requirements. &#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

We primarily provide our OLED display and optics components for OEMs to incorporate into their branded products and sell through their own well-established distribution channels. We have traditionally marketed and sold our products to customers through targeted selling, promotions, select advertising and attendance at trade shows. We identify companies with end products and applications for which we believe our products will provide a key differentiator. Marketing efforts focus on identifying prospects and communicating the product performance attributes foremost in the minds of purchasing decision-makers. We believe that this approach positions us to achieve the highest possible return on investment for our marketing expense. 

&#160; 

We market our products in North America, Asia, and Europe directly from our sales office located in our Hopewell Junction, NY facilities. We also have distributors in China and Korea. 

&#160; 

An OEM design cycle typically requires between 6 and 36 months, depending on the uniqueness of the market, the complexity of the end product or, in the case of military OEM customers, government procurement schedules. Because our microdisplays are the main functional component that defines many of our customers' end products, we work closely with customers to provide technical assistance throughout the product evaluation and integration process. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

Customers for our products include both large multinational and smaller OEMs. We maintain relationships with OEMs in a diverse range of industries encompassing the military, industrial, medical, and consumer market sectors. The following table estimates net product revenues in the market sectors.

&#160; &#160; For the Years Ended &#160; &#160; &#160; December 31, &#160; Geographic Location &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; United States &#160; &#160; 63% &#160; &#160; 51% International &#160; &#160; 37% &#160; &#160; 49% 

&#160; 

In 2015 and 2014 we had 10 customers that accounted for approximately 55% and 50%, respectively, of our total revenue. In 2015 we had two customers that accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue and in 2014 we had no customer that accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue. 

&#160; 

Backlog 

&#160; 

As of January 31, 2016, we had a backlog of approximately $6.9 million for purchases through December 2016. This backlog primarily consists of non-binding purchase orders and purchase agreements for delivery over the next six months but does not include expected revenue from R&#38;D contracts or expected NRE (non-recurring engineering) programs under development. Most purchase orders are subject to rescheduling or cancellation by the customer with no or limited penalties. We believe that the backlog metric is of limited utility in predicting future sales because many of our OEM customers operate on a ship-to-order basis. Variations in the magnitude and duration of purchase orders and customer delivery requirements may result in substantial fluctuations in backlog from period to period. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing Facilities 

&#160; 

Our manufacturing facilities are located about 70 miles north of New York City in Hopewell Junction, NY. We lease approximately 37,000 square feet of space from GLOBALFOUNDRIES which houses our own equipment for OLED microdisplay fabrication and research and development, includes a 16,300 square foot class 10 clean room space, additional lower level clean room space, assembly space and administrative offices. 

&#160;

Facilities services provided by GLOBALFOUNDRIES include our clean room, pure gases, high purity de-ionized water, compressed air, chilled water systems, and waste disposal support. This infrastructure provided by our lease with GLOBALFOUNDRIES provides us with many of the resources of a larger corporation without the added overhead costs. It further allows us to focus our resources more efficiently on our product development and manufacturing goals. 

&#160; 

We believe manufacturing efficiency is an important factor for success, especially in the consumer markets. Although we currently have the equipment needed for profitable production in place, we purchased $1.2 million and $1.5 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, of additional equipment mainly related to manufacturing and we plan to add up to $5.6 million of equipment in 2016 to increase capacity and yield and to meet expected demand for our microdisplays. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We face competition from legacy technologies such as transmissive liquid crystal microdisplays (&#8220;LCDs&#8221;) and Liquid Crystal on Silicon (&#8220;LCOS&#8221;) displays as well as from alternative flat panel display technologies such as virtual scanning retinal displays. There are many large and small companies that manufacture or have in development, products based on these technologies. 

&#160; 

There are a few manufacturers of high resolution OLED microdisplays that produce microdisplays that compete with our microdisplay products. They are Yunnan OLiGHTECK Opto-Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Olightek&#8221;) in China and MicroOLED in France. Both are shipping OLED microdisplays into the market. Sony Mobile Display Corp., in Japan, produces OLED microdisplays for integration into Sony&#8217;s own higher-level systems such as digital cameras and HMDs and is now selling microdisplays to some commercial customers. 

&#160; 

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We may also compete with potential licensees of Universal Display Corporation or Global OLED Technology LLC, among others, each of which potentially can license OLED technology portfolios. If other new OLED-based companies enter our markets with directly relevant display designs and without manufacturing and reliability issues, we will face additional competition, though we believe that our progress to date in this area gives us a significant advantage. 

&#160; 

In the future, we believe that competition will come from LCOS, small transmissive LCDs, and OLED microdisplays manufactured by competitors. While we believe that OLED technology is technically superior providing higher quality images, greater environmental ruggedness, reduced electronics cost and complexity, and improved power efficiency microdisplays, there is no assurance that we will continue to be the dominant OLED microdisplay supplier. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We believe we have developed a substantial intellectual property portfolio of patents, trade secrets and manufacturing know-how. It is important to protect our investment in technology by obtaining and enforcing intellectual property rights, including rights under patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws. We seek to protect inventions we consider significant by applying for patents in the United States and other countries when appropriate. The U.S. Government holds licenses to much of our technology as a result of its funding a significant portion of our research and development. 

&#160; 

Our intellectual property covers a wide range of materials, device structures, processes, and fabrication techniques, primarily concentrated in the following areas: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; &#160; OLED Devices, Architecture, Structures, and Processes; &#183; &#160; &#160; Display Color Processing and Sealing; &#183; &#160; &#160; Active Matrix Circuit Methodologies and Designs; &#183; &#160; &#160; Lenses and Tracking (Eye and Head); &#183; &#160; &#160; Ergonomics and Industrial Design; &#183; &#160; &#160; Wearable Computer Interface Methodology; &#183; &#160; &#160; Legacy Field Emission and General Display Technologies; and &#183; &#160; &#160; Head-mounted display technology. &#160; 

We believe that, in addition to patent protection, our success is dependent upon trade secrets, technical expertise and know-how. To protect this information and know-how from unauthorized use or disclosure, we use nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our proprietary rights, and we require all employees, and where appropriate, contractors, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality and non-competition agreements. We believe that our intellectual property portfolio, coupled with our strategic relationships and accumulated manufacturing know-how in OLED, gives us a significant advantage over potential competitors. 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

As of January 31, 2016, we had a total of 90 employees, of which 87 were full time. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good.
