Business 

&#160; 

Consumers Bancorp, Inc. (Corporation), is a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended and is a registered bank holding company, and was incorporated under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1994. In February 1995, the Corporation acquired all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Consumers National Bank (Bank), a bank chartered under the laws of the United States of America. The Corporation&#8217;s activities have been limited primarily to holding the common stock of the Bank. 

&#160; 

Since 1965, the Bank&#8217;s main office has been serving the Minerva, Ohio area from its location at 614 East Lincoln Way, Minerva, Ohio. The Bank&#8217;s business involves attracting deposits from businesses and individual customers and using such deposits to originate commercial, mortgage and consumer loans in its market area, consisting primarily of Carroll, Columbiana, Stark, Summit, Wayne and contiguous counties in Ohio. The Bank currently has twelve branch locations and two loan production offices. The Bank also invests in securities consisting primarily of obligations of U.S. government sponsored entities, municipal obligations and mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. 

&#160; 

Supervision and Regulation 

&#160; 

The Corporation and the Bank are subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and other federal and state regulators. The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole and not for the protection of shareholders and creditors. Earnings and dividends of the Corporation are affected by state and federal laws and regulations and by policies of various regulatory authorities. Changes in applicable law or in the policies of various regulatory authorities could affect materially the business and prospects of the Corporation and the Bank. The following describes selected federal and state statutory and regulatory provisions that have, or could have, a material impact on the Corporation. The following discussion of supervision and regulation is qualified in its entirety by reference to the statutory and regulatory provisions discussed. 

&#160; 

Regulation of the Corporation: 

&#160; 

The Bank Holding Company Act: As a bank holding company, the Corporation is subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (BHCA) and the examination and reporting requirements of the Federal Reserve Board. Under the BHCA, the Corporation is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve Board and required to file periodic reports regarding its operations and any additional information that the Federal Reserve Board may require. 

&#160; 

The BHCA generally limits the activities of a bank holding company to banking, managing or controlling banks, furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries and engaging in any other activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related to banking or to managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident to those activities. In addition, the BHCA requires every bank holding company to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board prior to acquiring substantially all the assets of any bank, acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of a bank or merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. 

&#160; 

Under Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to each subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support those subsidiary banks. Under this policy, the Federal Reserve Board may require a bank holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank and may disapprove of the payment of dividends to shareholders if the Federal Reserve Board believes the payment of such dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice. The Federal Reserve Board has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. 

&#160; 

Privacy Provisions of Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act: The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 contains extensive provisions on a customer&#8217;s right to privacy of non-public personal information. Under these provisions, a financial institution must provide to its customers the institution&#8217;s policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers&#8217; non-public personal information. Except in certain cases, an institution may not provide personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses that such information may be disclosed and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. The Corporation and the Bank are also subject to certain state laws that deal with the use and distribution of non-public personal information. 

&#160; 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act: The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 contains important requirements for public companies in the area of financial disclosure and corporate governance. In accordance with section 302(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, written certifications by the Corporation&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required. These certifications attest that the Corporation&#8217;s quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Regulation of the Bank: 

&#160; 

As a national bank, Consumers National Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). These examinations are designed primarily for the protection of the depositors of the Bank. 

&#160; 

Dividend Restrictions: Dividends from the Bank are the primary source of funds for payment of dividends to our shareholders. However, there are statutory limits on the amount of dividends the Bank can pay without regulatory approval. Under regulations promulgated by the OCC, the Bank may not declare a dividend in excess of its undivided profits. Additionally, the Bank may not declare a dividend if the total amount of all dividends, including the proposed dividend, declared by the Bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its retained net income of that year to date, combined with its retained net income of the two preceding years, unless the dividend is approved by the OCC. The Bank may not declare or pay any dividend if, after making the dividend, the Bank would be &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; as defined in the federal regulations. 

&#160; 

FDIC: The FDIC is an independent federal agency, which insures the deposits of federally insured banks and savings associations up to certain prescribed limits and safeguards the safety and soundness of financial institutions. The deposits of the Bank are subject to the deposit insurance assessments of the Bank Insurance Fund of the FDIC. Under the FDIC&#8217;s deposit insurance assessment system, the assessment rate for any insured institution varies according to regulatory capital levels of the institution and other factors such as supervisory evaluations. 

&#160; 

The FDIC is authorized to prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity that poses a serious threat to the insurance fund and may initiate enforcement actions against banks, after first giving the institution&#8217;s primary regulatory authority an opportunity to take such action. The FDIC may also terminate the deposit insurance of any institution that has engaged in or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. 

&#160; 

FHLB: The Bank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (FHLB), which is a privately capitalized, government sponsored enterprise that expands housing and economic development opportunities throughout the nation by providing loans and other banking services to community-based financial institutions. 

&#160; 

Risk-Based Capital Requirements: The Federal Reserve Board and the OCC employ similar risk-based capital guidelines in their examination and regulation of bank holding companies and national banks. The Corporation meets the definition of a Small Bank Holding Company and, therefore, is exempt from consolidated risk-based and coverage capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies. The guidelines involve a process of assigning various risk weights to different classes of assets, then evaluating the sum of the risk-weighted balance sheet structure against the capital base. If capital falls below the minimum levels established by the guidelines, the bank holding company or bank may be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non-bank businesses or to open new facilities. In addition, failure to satisfy capital guidelines could subject a banking institution to a variety of enforcement actions by federal bank regulatory authorities, including the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC and a prohibition on the acceptance of &#8220;brokered deposits.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Prior to January 1, 2015, the minimum requirement for the total risk-based capital ratio was 8% and the minimum requirement for the Tier I risk-based capital ratio and Tier I leverage ratio was 4%. On January 1, 2015, new Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations became effective. Under Basel III, the Bank is required to maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%, a total capital ratio of 8%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. Basel III also established a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements, which must consist entirely of common equity Tier 1 capital and will be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increase by that amount each year until fully implemented in January 2019. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a common equity Tier 1 ratio to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. 

&#160; 

The OCC and the FDIC may take various corrective actions against any undercapitalized bank and any bank that fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement a plan accepted by the OCC or the FDIC. These powers include, but are not limited to, requiring the institution to be recapitalized, prohibiting asset growth, restricting interest rates paid, requiring prior approval of capital distributions by any bank holding company that controls the institution, requiring divestiture by the institution of its subsidiaries or by the holding company of the institution itself, requiring new election of directors, and requiring the dismissal of directors and officers. The OCC&#8217;s final supervisory judgment concerning an institution&#8217;s capital adequacy could differ significantly from the conclusions that might be derived from the absolute level of an institution&#8217;s risk-based capital ratios. Therefore, institutions generally are expected to maintain risk-based capital ratios that exceed the minimum ratios. At June 30, 2016, the Bank exceeded minimum regulatory capital requirements to be considered well-capitalized. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act: The Dodd-Frank Act created many new restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions, including depository institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and giving it responsibility for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than $10 billion in assets, as well as their affiliates. Although the CFPB does not have direct supervisory authority over banks with less than $10 billion in assets, the CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit &#8220;unfair, deceptive or abusive&#8221; acts and practices. Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that materially interfere with a consumer&#8217;s ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of a consumer&#8217;s (i) lack of financial savvy, (ii) inability to protect himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services, or (iii) reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumer&#8217;s interests. The Corporation is closely monitoring all relevant sections of the Dodd-Frank Act to ensure continued compliance with these regulatory requirements and assess their potential impact on our business. 

&#160; 

Interstate Banking and Branching: The Interstate Banking and Branch Efficiency Act of 1995 has eased restrictions on interstate expansion and consolidation of banking operations by, among other things: (i) permitting interstate bank acquisitions regardless of host state laws, (ii) permitting interstate merger of banks unless specific states have opted out of this provision, and (iii) permitting banks to establish new branches outside the state provided the law of the host state specifically allows interstate bank branching. 

&#160; 

Community Reinvestment Act: The Community Reinvestment Act requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas, including low and moderate-income areas, consistent with safe and sound banking practices. Under this Act, each institution is required to adopt a statement for each of its market areas describing the depository institution&#8217;s efforts to assist in its community&#8217;s credit needs. Depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance and assigned ratings. Banking regulators consider these ratings when considering approval of a proposed transaction by an institution. 

&#160; 

USA Patriot Act: In 2001, Congress enacted the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA Patriot Act) Act of 2001 (Patriot Act). The Patriot Act is designed to deny terrorists and criminals the ability to obtain access to the United States&#8217; financial system and has significant implications for depository institutions, brokers, dealers, and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The Patriot Act mandates financial services companies to implement additional policies and procedures with respect to additional measures designed to address any or all of the following matters: money laundering, terrorist financing, identifying and reporting suspicious activities and currency transactions, and currency crimes. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of June 30, 2016, the Bank employed 110 full-time and 18 part-time employees. None of the employees are represented by a collective bargaining group. Management considers its relations with employees to be good.
