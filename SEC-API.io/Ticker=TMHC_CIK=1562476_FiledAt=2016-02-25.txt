 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General Overview 

We are one of the largest public homebuilders in the United States. We are also a real estate developer, with a portfolio of lifestyle and master-planned communities. We provide a diverse assortment of homes across a wide range of price points in order to appeal to a broad spectrum of customers. Our primary focus is on move-up buyers in traditionally high growth markets, where we design, build and sell single-family detached and attached homes. We operate under the Taylor Morrison and Darling Homes brand names. We also provide financial services to customers through our wholly owned mortgage subsidiary, Taylor Morrison Home Funding, LLC (&#8220;TMHF&#8221;) and title insurance and closing settlement services through our title company, Inspired Title Services, LLC (&#8220;Inspired Title&#8221;). Our business is organized into 15 operating divisions aggregated into three reportable homebuilding segments, East, Central, and West, and our Mortgage Operations segment, which includes the activities of TMHF and Inspired Title. 

Our long-term strategy is built on four pillars: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

pursuing core locations; 

&#8226; 

building distinctive communities; 

&#8226; 

maintaining a cost-efficient culture; and 

&#8226; 

appropriately balancing price with pace in the sale of our homes. 

We are committed to building authentic homes and engaging communities that inspire, delight and enhance the lives of our customers. Delivering on this commitment involves thoughtful design and analysis to accommodate the needs of our customers and the surrounding community. The Taylor Morrison difference begins with providing our customers with a home that is both conducive to their lifestyle and that is built to last. We take pride in our quality construction, superior design and customer service. Our dedication to customer service defines our customer experience and acknowledges homeowners&#8217; suggestions to build style, quality and sustainability into every home we build. Our commitment to quality prioritizes the long-term satisfaction of our homeowners. Our communities are typically built in locations in close proximity to schools and shopping, often have many amenities and public gathering areas, with a focus on delivering superior lifestyles to customers and their families. In recognition of our commitment to home buyers, we were awarded America&#8217;s Most Trusted Home Builder TM &#32;by Lifestory Research in 2015, a study which is based on the reviews of more than 35,000 consumers. We are also ranked the second highest in the active adult resort home builder brands according to Lifestory Research America&#8217;s Most Trusted&#8482; 2016 Active Adult Home Builder Brand Study which was based on almost 11,000 consumers. 

During the year ended December 31, 2015 our operations were located in eight states and generated home closings revenue of $2.9 billion and adjusted home closings gross margin of 21.3%. We increased home closings by 11.9% to 6,311 homes compared to the prior year. We grew our average community count by 25.7% &#32;to 259 for 2015 with $1.4 billion in sales order backlog at December 31, 2015. We believe we benefit from a well-located land portfolio, primarily in homebuilding markets that have been leading the housing recovery. At December 31, 2015, we owned or controlled over 43,000 lots. 

We are well positioned in our markets with a top-10 market share (based on 2015 home closings as reported by Metrostudy) in 14 of our 19 metropolitan markets. At December 31, 2015, we were operating in the following metropolitan areas:

2015 Highlights and Recent Developments 

&#8226; 

On January 28, 2015, we closed on the sale of Monarch Corporation, our former Canadian operating segment (&#8220;Monarch&#8221;). We used a foreign currency forward to hedge our exposure to the Canadian dollar in conjunction with the disposition of the Monarch business, which resulted in a final settlement gain of $30.0 million &#32;on January 30, 2015. As a result of the sale, we have exited the Canadian market and high-rise product development. 

&#8226; 

On April 16, 2015, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2023 (the &#8220;2023 Senior Notes&#8221;) and in turn, used such proceeds to redeem our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2020 (the &#8220;2020 Senior Notes&#8221;). 

&#8226; 

On April 24, 2015, we amended our Revolving Credit Facility, increasing borrowing capacity to $500.0 million and extended the maturity to April 2019. 

&#8226; 

On April 30, 2015, we acquired JEH Homes, an Atlanta based homebuilder, for a purchase price of approximately $63.2 million , excluding contingent consideration. The acquisition of JEH and the entry into the Atlanta market allows us to further strengthen our product offerings to entry-level buyers as the average price point for homes is in the low-to-mid $200 thousands. 

&#8226; 

On May 22, 2015, we announced our joint venture investment in Pacifica San Juan in San Juan Capistrano, California. This community began development in the early 2000s under a former owner who built only approximately 25% of the over 400 planned homes prior to the homebuilding downturn in 2008. 

&#8226; 

In the second quarter we launched our wholly-owned title services company, Inspired Title, which currently provides title insurance and closing settlement services to homebuyers in our Florida and Texas markets. We expect to make Inspired Title&#8217;s services available to customers in other markets in which we operate in the course of 2016. 

&#8226; 

On July 21, 2015, we acquired three &#32;divisions of Orleans Homes for a purchase price of approximately $167.3 million . Collectively, these divisions yielded approximately 2,100 lots in new markets within Charlotte, Chicago and Raleigh, further expanding our geographic footprint. 

&#8226; 

On November 10, 2015, we announced the grand opening of our joint venture project, Sea Summit at Marblehead in San Clemente, California. This coastal project offers over 300 luxury single-family homes ranging in price from the low $1 millions to the mid $2 millions, a planned resort inspired clubhouse and 116 acres of nature preserves. 

&#8226; 

In the fourth quarter of 2015, we realigned our homebuilding reporting segments into the East, Central and West regions. The change in our segments is as a result of our geographic expansion, recent acquisitions and re-alignment of our leadership group. 

&#8226; 

During the year ended December 31, 2015 we repurchased 934,434 &#32;shares of Class A Common Stock for approximately $15.0 million . During the year ended December 31, 2014 there was no repurchase activity. 

&#8226; 

On January 8, 2016, we acquired Acadia Homes in Atlanta for approximately $85 million. This acquisition which yields approximately 1,100 additional lots with deliveries of homes at price points in the low $400 thousands, allows us to further diversify our product offerings in the Atlanta market. 

Business Strategy 

We execute our strategy by opportunistically acquiring prime land assets in core locations, focusing on the preferences of our buyers, building distinctive communities, constantly evaluating and analyzing overhead efficiency and optimizing profit by managing volume. We constantly assess our capital allocation strategy to drive long-term shareholder return. We also take advantage of opportunities to partner in joint ventures as they arise in order to secure desirable land, share risk and maximize returns. 

We believe our extensive land position and pipeline, located in highly desirable submarkets, have positioned us for strategic growth and increased profitability in an improving housing market. We execute this strategy by: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Driving revenue by strategically opening new communities from existing land supply; 

&#8226; 

Combining land acquisition and development expertise with homebuilding operations; 

&#8226; 

Focusing offerings on specific customer groups; 

&#8226; 

Building aspirational homes for our customers and delivering superior customer service; 

&#8226; 

Maintaining a strong capital structure; 

&#8226; 

Selectively pursuing acquisitions; and 

&#8226; 

Employing and retaining a highly experienced management team with a strong operating track record. 

Homebuilding Operations 

Homebuilding Overview 

We focus on developing &#8220;lifestyle&#8221; communities in core locations, which have many distinguishing attributes, including proximity to job centers, strong school systems and a variety of local amenities in well-regarded submarkets. We offer a range of award-winning and innovative designs, through our single-family detached and attached product lines. We engineer our homes for energy-efficiency and cost savings to reduce the impact on the environment. Although the majority of the communities we build primarily attract move-up buyers, our portfolio also includes quality entry-level, luxury and 55 or better products. We serve all generational groups through our products and focus on the needs of homebuyers. During 2015, the allocation of sales in our portfolio, based on price point, was 22% entry-level, 47% first move up, 18% second move-up, 12% 55 or better and 1% urban infill. 

We strive to maintain product and price level differentiation through market and customer research. We target a balance of regional market portfolios across a variety of demographics. Our ability to build at multiple price points enables us to respond to changing consumer preferences and address shifts in affordability. We also use key indicators of market specific supply and demand characteristics to determine an optimal matching of consumer groups and specific land position. 

We generally operate as community developers. Community development includes the acquisition and development of communities, which may include obtaining significant planning and entitlement approvals and completing construction of off-site and on-site utilities and infrastructure. In some communities we operate solely as merchant builders, in which case, we acquire fully planned and entitled lots and may construct on-site improvements but normally do not construct significant off-site utility or infrastructure improvements. 

We develop a wide range of communities, which may include golf courses as well as amenity rich community centers. We also have investments in, and are participants in, a number of joint ventures to develop land and master-planned communities. 

We develop a number of home designs with features such as single-story, ranch style living, split bedroom plans and first floor master bedroom suites to appeal to varied design needs. We have integrated these designs and features in many of our homes and communities. We engage unaffiliated architectural firms and internal architectural resources to develop new designs and 

augment existing plans in order to ensure that our homes reflect current and local consumer tastes. We possess a strong library of single-family detached and attached floor plans that can be utilized throughout our markets. 

The life cycle of a community generally ranges from two to five years, commencing with the acquisition of land, continuing through the land development phase, and concluding with the sale, construction, and delivery of homes. Actual community lives will vary based on the size of the community, the sales absorption rate, and whether we purchased the property as raw land or as developed lots.

Land Acquisition Policies and Development 

Locating and acquiring suitable land positions is a core part of our strategy as a developer and homebuilder. In order to maximize our expected risk-adjusted return, the allocation of capital for land investment is performed at the corporate level with a disciplined approach to overall portfolio management. Our investment committee meets on a regular basis and currently consists of five senior executives. Annually, our operating divisions prepare a strategic plan for their respective geographies. Macro and micro indices, including but not limited to employment, housing starts, new home sales, re-sales and foreclosures, along with market related shifts in competition, land availability and consumer preferences, are carefully analyzed to determine our land and homebuilding strategy. Supply and demand are analyzed on a consumer segment and submarket basis to ensure land investment is targeted appropriately. Our long-term plan is compared on an ongoing basis to current conditions in the marketplace as they evolve and is adjusted to the extent necessary. Major development strategy decisions regarding community positioning are included in the decision making and underwriting process and are made in consultation with senior executives of our management team. Our existing land portfolio as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 is detailed below:

In the land purchasing and joint venture configuration process, specific projects of interest are typically identified by the local divisional team, including proposed ownership structure, environmental concerns, anticipated product segmentation, competitive environment and financial returns, and they are presented to our investment committee. Other larger company or portfolio opportunities will often be sourced centrally and managed at the corporate level. We also determine whether further spending on currently owned and controlled land is a well-timed and appropriate use of capital. Our investment strategy emphasizes expected profitability to reflect the risk and timing of returns, and the level of sales volume in new and existing markets.

Raw land represents property that has not been developed and remains in its natural state. Partially developed represents land where the grading and horizontal development process has begun. Finished lots represent those lots where the horizontal development is complete and are ready for the vertical development. Long-term strategic assets are those lots where we are currently not performing any development. 

At December 31, 2015, the allocation of lots held in our land portfolio, by year acquired, is as follows:

We expect that during 2016 we will deliver substantially all homes in backlog at December 31, 2015. 

Community Development 

We create a complete concept for each community, beginning with an overall community layout and then determine the size, style and price range of the homes, the layout of the streets and positioning of the individual home sites. After necessary governmental and other approvals have been obtained, we improve the land by clearing and grading, installing roads, underground utility lines, staking out individual home sites and, in certain communities, erecting distinctive entrance structures and recreational amenities. 

Each community has employees that perform superintendent, sales and customer service functions, in conjunction with a local management team to manage the general project. 

The construction time for our homes varies from project to project depending on geographic region, the time of year, the size and complexity of the homes, the governmental approval processes, local labor availability, availability of materials and supplies, and other factors. We typically complete the construction of a typical home in approximately six months. 

Procurement and Construction 

We have a comprehensive procurement program that leverages our size and national presence to achieve efficiencies and cost savings. Our procurement objective is to maximize efficiencies on local, regional and national levels and to ensure consistent utilization of established contractual arrangements. 

The regional and national programs currently involve over 40 vendors and includes highly reputable and well-established companies who supply us with lumber, appliances, HVAC systems, insulation, roofing, paint and lighting, among other materials. Through these relationships, we are able to realize savings on the costs of essential materials. Contracts are typically structured to include a blend of attractive upfront pricing and rebates and, in some cases, advantageous retroactive pricing in instances of contract renewals. The program arrangements are typically not designed to be completely exclusive in nature; for example, in many instances, divisions may choose to use local or alternate suppliers if they find cost savings or superior products by doing so. However, our divisions have historically made use of our national procurement contracts, largely as a result of the advantageous pricing available under such contracts. In addition to cost advantages, these arrangements also help minimize the risk of construction delays during supply shortages, as we are often able to leverage our size to obtain our full allocation of required materials. 

Trades and Labor 

Our construction, land and purchasing managers coordinate subcontracting services and supervise all aspects of construction work and quality control. We are a general contractor for all of our homebuilding projects. Subcontractors perform all home construction and land development, generally under fixed-price contracts. The availability of labor, specifically as it relates to qualified tradespeople, at reasonable prices is a challenge in some markets as the supply chain responds to uneven industry growth and other economic factors that affect the number of people in the workforce. 

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 

Based on local market practices, we either directly, or indirectly through our subcontractors, purchase drywall, cement, steel, lumber, insulation and the other building materials necessary to construct a home. While these materials are generally widely available from a variety of sources, from time to time we experience material shortages on a localized basis which can substantially increase the price for such materials and our construction process can be slowed. We generally have multiple sources for the materials we purchase and have not experienced significant delays due to unavailability of necessary materials. 

Sales and Marketing 

Our marketing program calls for a balanced approach of corporate support and local expertise to attract potential homebuyers in a focused, efficient and cost-effective manner. Our sales and marketing team provides a generalized marketing framework across our regional operations as well as sales training to our local teams. Our divisional sales and marketing teams utilize local media and marketing streams to deliver a unique message that is relevant to our consumer groups in each market. 

Our goal is to identify the preferences of our customer and demographic groups and offer them innovative, high-quality products that are efficient and profitable to build. To achieve this goal, we conduct extensive market research to determine preferences of our customer groups and are able to focus on particular lifestyle preferences in determining the product to build. 

We have gathered data regarding specific consumer preferences for various customer groups. Our approach to customer group identification guides all of our operations from the initial land acquisition through to our design, building, marketing and delivery of homes and our ongoing after-sales customer service. Among our peers, we believe we are at the forefront of directed marketing strategies, as evidenced by our highly-trafficked Internet site and strategic partnerships with nationally recognized retailers. 

The central element of our marketing platform is our web presence at www.taylormorrison.com and www.darlinghomes.com (none of the information on or accessible through these websites is a part of this Annual Report). The main purpose of these websites is to direct potential customers to one of our sales teams. The websites also offer the ability of customers to evaluate floor plans, elevations, square footage, community amenities and geographic location. Customers are also able to use the websites to make inquiries and to receive a prompt response from one of our &#8220;Internet Home Consultants.&#8221; The websites are fully integrated with our customer relationship management (&#8220;CRM&#8221;) system. By analyzing the content of the CRM, we are able to focus our lead generation programs to deliver high-quality sales leads. With these leads we are better able to increase sale conversion rates and lower marketing costs. We have significant web search optimization on our sites, including specific key words, meta data and tags on the site to help crawlers from search engines to find content. 

In addition to our website, we selectively utilize print, radio and television for advertising purposes, including directional marketing, newspapers and billboards. We also directly notify local real estate agents and firms of any new community openings in order to use the existing real estate agent/broker channels in each market. Pricing for our homes is evaluated weekly based on an analysis of market conditions, competitive environment and supply and demand characteristics. 

We use furnished model homes as a marketing tool to demonstrate the advantages of the designs, features and functionality of our homes. We generally employ or contract with interior and landscape designers who create attractive model homes that highlight the features and options available for the product line within a project. Depending upon the number of homes to be built in the project and the product lines to be offered, we generally build between one and three model homes for each active selling community. 

Generally, our homes are sold by our commissioned employees who work from sales offices located within our model homes. We also employ a team of Internet sales associates who offer assistance to potential buyers viewing our homes over the Internet. Our goal is to ensure our sales force has extensive knowledge of our homes, including our energy efficient features, sales strategies, mortgage options and community dynamics. To achieve this goal, we have on-going training for our sales associates and conduct regular meetings to keep them abreast of the latest promotions, options and sales techniques and discuss geographic competition. Our sales associates are licensed real estate agents where required by law and assist our customers in adding design features to their homes, which we believe appeal to local consumer preferences. Third-party brokers who sell our homes are generally paid a sales commission based on the price of the home. In some of our businesses, we contract with third-party design studios that specialize in assisting our homebuyers with options and upgrades to personalize their homes. Utilizing these third-party design studios allows us to manage our overhead and costs more efficiently. We may also offer various sales 

incentives, including price concessions, assistance with closing costs, and landscaping or interior upgrades. The use, types and amount of incentives depends largely on existing economic and local competitive market conditions. 

Warranty Program 

We offer warranties on homes that generally provide for limited one-year warranty to cover various defects in workmanship or materials or to cover structural construction defects. We may also facilitate a ten year warranty in certain markets or to comply with regulatory requirements. The structural warranty is carried by Beneva Indemnity Company (&#8220;Beneva&#8221;), one of our wholly owned subsidiaries. We also provide third-party warranty coverage on homes where required by Federal Housing Administration or Veterans Administration lenders. 

Competition 

The homebuilding business is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with numerous homebuilders of varying sizes, ranging from local to national in scope, some of which have greater sales and financial resources than us. Sales of existing homes, whether by a homeowner or by a financial institution that has acquired a home through a foreclosure, also provide competition. We compete primarily on the basis of location, design, quality, service, price and reputation. 

In order to maximize our sales volumes, profitability and product strategy, we strive to understand our competition and their pricing, product and sales volume strategies and results. Competition among residential homebuilders of all sizes is based on a number of interrelated factors, including location, reputation, amenities, floor plans, design, quality and price. We believe that we compare favorably to other homebuilders in the markets in which we operate. 

Mortgage Operations 

TMHF provides a number of mortgage-related services to our customers through our mortgage lending operations. The strategic purpose of TMHF is: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

to utilize mortgage finance as a sales tool in the purchase process to ensure a consistent customer experience and assist in maintaining production efficiency; and 

&#8226; 

to control and analyze our backlog quality and to better manage projected closing and delivery dates for our customers. 

TMHF operates as an independent mortgage banker and conducts its business as a Federal Housing Authority (&#8220;FHA&#8221;) Full Eagle lender. TMHF funds mortgage loans utilizing warehouse credit line facilities. Revenue is earned through origination and processing fees combined with service release premiums earned in the secondary market once the loans are sold to investors. Typically, loans are sold and servicing is released within 20-30 business days. 

TMHF competes with other mortgage lenders, including national, regional and local mortgage bankers and other financial institutions. TMHF utilizes a multi-investor correspondent platform which gives us increased flexibility when placing loans to meet our customers&#8217; needs. TMHF has continued to expand and strengthen our corespondent relationships. This has created stability and consistency in our origination process and delivery. 

Inspired Title serves as a title insurance agent and currently provides title insurance and closing settlement services to our homebuyers in our Texas and Florida markets. Inspired Title competes against other title insurers and escrow agents that provide similar services. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

Our business is seasonal. We have historically experienced, and expect to continue to experience, variability in our results on a quarterly basis. We generally have more homes under construction, close more homes and have greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of the year. Our results therefore may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and we must maintain sufficient liquidity to meet short-term operating requirements. Factors expected to contribute to these fluctuations include: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

the timing of the introduction and start of construction of new projects; 

&#8226; 

the timing of community sales; 

&#8226; 

the timing of closings of homes, lots and parcels; 

&#8226; 

the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals for development and construction; 

&#8226; 

the condition of the real estate market and general economic conditions in the areas in which we operate; 

&#8226; 

mix of homes closed; 

&#8226; 

construction timetables; 

&#8226; 

the prevailing interest rates and the availability of financing, both for us and for the purchasers of our homes; 

&#8226; 

the cost and availability of materials and labor; and 

&#8226; 

weather conditions in the markets in which we build. 

As a result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position are not necessarily representative of a full fiscal year. To illustrate the seasonality in net homes sold, homes closed and home closings revenue, a summary of the quarterly financial data follows:

(1) Net income from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and June 30, 2015 was impacted by factors other than seasonality. The gain on the foreign currency forward related to the sale of our Canadian operations during the first quarter of 2015 benefited earnings, while the loss on extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of 2015 reduced earnings. 

IPO and Summary of Reorganization Transactions 

Our Structure 

On April 12, 2013 we completed our initial public offering (&#8220;IPO&#8221;) of 32,857,800 shares of our Class A Common Stock, par value $0.00001 &#32;per share (the &#8220;Class A Common Stock&#8221;), on the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;). With an initial price to the public of $22.00 per share, it was the largest homebuilding IPO in the history of the NYSE. As a result of the completion of the IPO and a series of transactions pursuant to a Reorganization Agreement dated as of April 9, 2013, TMHC became the indirect parent of TMM Holdings Limited Partnership (&#8220;TMM Holdings&#8221;) through the formation of TMM Holdings II Limited Partnership, a Cayman Islands limited partnership (&#8220;New TMM&#8221;). TMM Holdings is a British Columbia limited partnership that acquired our operations in July 2011 and is currently the holding company for all of our operations. It was formed in 2011 by a consortium comprised of affiliates of TPG Global, LLC (the &#8220;TPG Entities&#8221; or &#8220;TPG&#8221;), investment funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (&#8220;Oaktree&#8221;) or their respective subsidiaries (the &#8220;Oaktree Entities&#8221;), and affiliates of JH Investments, Inc. (&#8220;JH&#8221; and together with the TPG Entities and Oaktree Entities, the &#8220;Principal Equityholders&#8221;). 

In addition to our Class A Common Stock, we have outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, par value $0.00001 &#32;per share (the &#8220;Class B Common Stock&#8221;). Holders of the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters submitted to stockholders for their vote or approval. The holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to stockholders for their vote or approval, except with respect to the amendment of certain provisions of the amended and restated Certificate of Incorporation that would alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Class B Common Stock so as to affect them adversely. Such amendments must be approved by a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the shares affected by the amendment, voting as a separate class, or as otherwise required by applicable law. 

For each share of TMHC Class A Common Stock outstanding, TMHC holds one limited partnership interest in New TMM (each, a &#8220;New TMM Unit&#8221;). The Principal Equityholders (through holding vehicles) hold New TMM Units and 

one corresponding share of Class B Common Stock for each New TMM Unit they hold. As a result, the Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock percentages at December 31, 2015 &#32;are as follows: 

&#160;

The Class A Common Stock is held by the public. The Class B Common Stock is substantially beneficially owned by the Principal Equityholders, so together, they have voting power over more than a majority of our outstanding voting stock. See &#32;Item 1A - Risk Factors &#8212; "The Principal Equityholders have substantial influence over our business, and their interests may differ from our interests or those of our other stockholders." 

Regulation, Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 

Regulatory 

We are subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building design, construction and similar matters, including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular property or locality. In a number of our markets, there has been an increase in state and local legislation requiring the dedication of land as open space. In addition, we are subject to various licensing, registration and filing requirements in connection with the construction, advertisement and sale of homes in our communities. The impact of these laws has been to increase our overall costs, and may delay the opening of communities or cause us to conclude that development of particular communities would not be economically feasible, even if any or all necessary governmental approvals are obtained. We also may be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing communities due to building moratoriums in one or more of the areas in which we operate. Generally, such moratoriums relate to insufficient water, power, drainage or sewage facilities or inadequate road capacity. 

In order to secure certain approvals in some areas, we may be required to provide affordable housing at below market sales prices. The impact on us depends on how the various state and local governments in the areas in which we engage, or intend to engage, in development implement their programs for affordable housing. To date, these restrictions have not had a material impact on us. 

TMHF is subject to various state and federal statutes, rules and regulations, including those that relate to licensing, lending operations and other areas of mortgage origination and financing. The impact of those statutes, rules and regulations can increase our homebuyers&#8217; cost of financing, increase our cost of doing business, as well as restrict our homebuyers&#8217; access to some types of loans. Certain requirements provided for by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank Act") have not yet been finalized or fully implemented. The effect of such provisions on our financial services business will depend on the rules that are ultimately enacted. The title and settlement services provided by Inspired Title are subject to various regulations, including regulation by state banking and insurance regulators. 

In order for our homebuyers to finance their home purchases with FHA-insured, Veterans Administration-guaranteed or U.S. Department of Agriculture-guaranteed mortgages, we are required to build such homes in accordance with the regulatory requirements of those agencies. 

Some states have statutory disclosure requirements or other pre-approval requirements or limitations governing the marketing and sale of new homes. These requirements vary widely from state to state. 

Some states require us to be registered as a licensed contractor, a licensed real estate broker and in some markets our sales agents are additionally required to be registered as licensed real estate agents. 

Environmental 

We also are subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning protection of public health and the environment (collectively, &#8220;environmental laws&#8221;). The particular environmental laws that apply to any given community vary greatly according to the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site. Complying with these environmental laws may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and/or may prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas. 

As part of the land acquisition due diligence process, we utilize environmental assessments to identify environmental conditions that may exist on potential acquisition properties. To date, environmental site assessments conducted at our properties have not revealed any environmental liability or compliance concerns that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity or results of operations, nor are we aware of any material environmental liability or concerns. 

We manage compliance with federal, state and local environmental requirements at the division level with assistance from the corporate and regional legal departments, including environmental regulations related to U.S. Storm Water 

Pollution Prevention, U.S. Endangered Species Act, U.S. Wetlands Permitting, NPDES Permitting, Cultural Resources, dust control measures and state and local preservation ordinances. 

Health and Safety 

We are committed to maintaining high standards in health and safety at all of our sites, to ensure the safety of our team members, our trade partners, our customers and prospects and the general public. That commitment is tested through our health and safety audit system that includes comprehensive twice-yearly independent third-party inspections of selected sites covering all aspects of health and safety. A key area of focus is ensuring that site conditions meet exacting health and safety standards and that subcontractor performance throughout our operating areas meets or exceeds expectations. All of our team members must complete an assigned curriculum of online safety courses each year. These courses vary according to job responsibility. In addition, groups such as construction and field personnel are required to attend additional training programs such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 10-hour course, First-Aid and CPR. 

Information Technology 

We have a centralized information technology organization with its core team located at our corporate headquarters in Scottsdale, augmented with field support technicians in key locations across the U.S. Our approach to information technology is to continuously simplify our information technology platform and consolidate and standardize applications. We believe a common application platform enables the sharing of ideas and rapid implementation of process improvements and best practices across the entire company. Our back-office operations use a fully integrated, industry recognized enterprise resource planning package. Marketing and field sales utilize a leading CRM solution that tracks leads and prospects from all sources and manages the customer communication process from lead creation through the buying process and beyond the post-warranty period. Field operations teams collaborate with our supply chain managment to schedule and manage development and construction projects with a set of standard and widely used homebuilding industry solutions. 

Intellectual Property 

We own certain logos and trademarks that are important to our overall branding and sales strategy. Our consumer logos are designed to draw on our recognized homebuilding heritage while emphasizing a customer-centric focus. 

Employees, Subcontractors and Consultants 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately1,600 full-time equivalent persons. Of these, approximately1,400 were engaged in corporate and homebuilding operations, and the remaining approximately 200 were engaged in mortgage and title services. As of December 31, 2015, we were not subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good. 

We act solely as a general contractor, and all construction operations are supervised by our project managers and field superintendents who manage third party subcontractors. We use independent consultants and contractors for some architectural, 

engineering, advertising and legal services, and we strive to maintain good relationships with our subcontractors and independent consultants and contractors.
