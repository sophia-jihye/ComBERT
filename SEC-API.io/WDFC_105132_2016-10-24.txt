Overview 

&#65279; 

WD-40 Company is a global marketing organization dedicated to creating positive lasting memories by developing and selling products which solve problems in workshops, factories and homes around the world. The Company was founded in 1953 and is headquartered in San Diego, California. 

&#65279; 

For more than four decades, the Company sold only one product, WD-40 &#174; multi-use product, a maintenance product which acts as a lubricant, rust preventative, penetrant, cleaner and moisture displacer. Over the last two decades, the Company has evolved and expanded its product offerings through both research and development activities and through the acquisition of several brands worldwide. As a result, the Company has built a family of brands and product lines that deliver high quality performance at an extremely good value to their end users. &#160; &#160; 

&#65279; 

The Company currently markets and sells its products in more than 176 countries and territories worldwide primarily through mass retail and home center stores, warehouse club stores, grocery stores, hardware stores, automotive parts outlets, sport retailers, independent bike dealers, online retailers and industrial distributors and suppliers. 

&#65279; 

The Company&#8217;s sales come from its two product groups &#8211; &#160; maintenance products and homecare and cleaning products. Maintenance products are sold worldwide in markets throughout North, Central and South America, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Homecare and cleaning products are sold primarily in North America, the United Kingdom (&#8220;U.K.&#8221;) and Australia. 

&#65279; 

The Company&#8217;s strategic initiatives and the areas where it will continue to focus its time, talent and resources in future periods include: (i) maximizing WD-40 multi-use product sales through geographic expansion and increased market penetration; (ii) leveraging the WD-40 brand by growing the WD-40 Specialist product line; (iii) leveraging the strengths of the Company through broadened product and revenue base; (iv) attracting, developing and retaining talented people; and (v) operating with excellence. 

&#65279; 

The Company is focused on and committed to innovation and renovation of its products. The Company sees innovation and renovation as important factors to the long-term growth of its brands and product lines, and it intends to continue to work on future products, product lines, product packaging, product delivery systems and promotional innovations and renovations. The Company is also focused on expanding its current brands in existing markets with new product development. The Company&#8217;s product development teams support new product development and current product improvement for the Company&#8217;s brands. Over the years, the Company&#8217;s research and development team has made an innovation impact on most of the Company&#8217;s brands. Key innovations for the Company&#8217;s products include, but are not limited to, WD-40 Smart Straw &#174; , WD-40 Trigger Pro &#174; , WD-40 Specialist &#174; , WD-40 Bike&#8482;, 3-IN-ONE Professional Garage Door Lube&#8482;, and Spot Shot Pet Clean&#8482;, which is a non-aerosol Spot Shot trigger product. In late fiscal year 2015, the Company launched a new innovative product called WD-40 EZ Reach Flexible Straw &#8482; in the United States. WD-40 EZ Reach Flexible Straw features a unique delivery system in the form of an 

&#160;

attached 8&#8221; flexible straw that bends and keeps its shape to allow for easier use of the WD-40 multi-use product in hard to reach places. 

&#65279;

The financial information required by this item is included in Note 15 &#8211; Business Segments and Foreign Operations of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements, included in Item 15 of this report, and in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221;, included in Item 7 of this report. 

&#65279; 

Products &#160; 

&#65279; 

Maintenance Products 

&#65279; 

Included in the Company&#8217;s maintenance products are both multi-purpose maintenance products and specialty maintenance products. These maintenance products are sold worldwide and they provide end users with a variety of product and delivery system options. 

&#65279; 

The Company&#8217;s signature brand in the blue and yellow can with the red top, the WD-40 brand, is included within the maintenance product category and it accounts for a significant majority of the Company&#8217;s sales. The Company has various products and product lines which it currently sells under the WD-40 brand and they are as follows: 

&#65279; 

WD-40 Multi-Use Product - The WD-40 multi-use product is a market leader among multi-purpose maintenance products and is sold as an aerosol spray, a non-aerosol trigger spray and in liquid form through mass retail stores, hardware stores, warehouse club stores, automotive parts outlets, online retailers and industrial distributors and suppliers. The WD-40 multi-use product is sold worldwide in North, Central and South America, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The WD-40 multi-use product has a wide variety of consumer uses in, for example, household, marine, automotive, construction, repair, sporting goods and gardening applications, in addition to numerous industrial applications. WD-40 EZ Reach Flexible Straw is the Company&#8217;s latest innovation to its multi-use product. It features a unique delivery system which includes an attached flexible straw that bends and keeps its shape to allow for easy use of the WD-40 multi-use product in hard to reach places. This new product was launched at the end of fiscal year 2015 and is currently being marketed in the U.S. and Latin America. WD-40 EZ Reach Flexible Straw has started to contribute to the overall growth of the WD-40 brand and it is expected to continue to do so in the future. The launch of the WD-40 EZ Reach &#160; Flexible Straw product line has used the same established distribution channels through which the Company current ly sells its existing products. 

&#65279; 

WD-40 Specialist product line &#8211; WD-40 Specialist consists of a line of best-in-class specialty maintenance products that include penetrants, degreasers, corrosion inhibitors, lubricants and rust removers that are aimed at end users that currently use the WD-40 multi-use product.

WD-40 Bike product line - The WD-40 Bike product line consists of a comprehensive line of bicycle maintenance products that include wet and dry chain lubricants, heavy-duty degreasers and foaming wash that are designed for avid and recreational cyclists, bike enthusiasts and mechanics. The Company launched this product line in the U.S. in fiscal year 2013 in Australia and Europe in fiscal year 2014, and in Latin America and select countries in Asia in early fiscal year 2016. Although the initial focus for such sales was on smaller independent bike dealers, distribution of WD-40 Bike products has been expanded to include certain distributors and retailers &#160; in select countries where the Company sells this product . Early in fiscal year 2016, the Company transitioned the WD-40 Bike business in the U.S. from one with distribution limited primarily to independent bike dealers to one which also includes a limited group of customers which are currently in place for other maintenance products in the Americas segment. 

&#160;

In addition to the drip oil line of products, the 3-IN-ONE brand also includes a professional line of products known as 3-IN-ONE Professional, which is a line of high quality, maintenance products. The high quality of the 3-IN-ONE brand and its established distribution network have enabled these products to gain international acceptance. 3-IN-ONE products are sold primarily in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Latin America, Australia and Asia. 

&#65279; 

GT85 &#174; &#160; - The GT85 brand is a multi-purpose bike maintenance product that consists of professional spray maintenance products and lubricants which are sold primarily in the bike market through the automotive and industrial channels in the U.K., with additional sales in foreign markets including those in Spain and other European countries.

This brand was acquired by the Company&#8217;s U.K. subsidiary in September 2014 and it has helped build upon the Company&#8217;s strategy to develop new product categories for WD-40 Specialist and WD-40 BIKE. 

&#65279; 

Homecare and Cleaning Products 

&#65279; 

The Company sells its homecare and cleaning products in certain locations worldwide and they include a portfolio of well-known brands as follows: 

&#65279; 

X-14 &#160; - The X-14 brand is a line of quality products designed for unique cleaning needs. X-14 is sold as a liquid mildew stain remover and as an automatic toilet bowl cleaner. X-14 is sold primarily in the U.S. through grocery and mass retail channels as well as through online retailers.

&#65279; 

The Company&#8217;s homecare and cleaning products, particularly those in the U.S., are considered harvest brands which continue to provide positive returns to the Company but are becoming a smaller part of the business as sales of the maintenance products grow with the execution of the Company&#8217;s strategic initiatives. Although the Company has evaluated strategic alternatives for certain of its homecare and cleaning products in prior fiscal years, particularly those in the U.S., it has continued to sell these brands but has done so with a reduced level of investment. 

&#65279; 

Financial information about operating segments and product lines is included in Note 15 &#8211; Business Segments and Foreign Operations of the consolidated financial statements, included in Item 15 of this report. 

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#65279; 

The Company&#8217;s sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality. However, it is common for the Company&#8217;s sales to fluctuate from period to period or year to year due to various factors including, but not limited to, new or lost distribution, the number of product offerings carried by a customer and the level of promotional activities and programs being run at customer locations. New or lost distribution occurs when the Company gains or loses customers, when it gains or loses store count for a customer or when its products are added to new locations within a store or removed from existing locations. From time to time, as part of new product offering launches, the Company may gain access to entirely new distribution channels. The number of product offerings refers to the number of brands and/or the number of products within each of those brands that the Company&#8217;s customers offer for sale to end user customers. The level of promotional activities and programs relates to the number of events or volumes of purchases by customers in support of off-shelf or promotional display activities. Changes in any one of these three factors or a combination of them can cause the Company&#8217;s sales levels to increase or decrease from period to period. It is also common and/or possible that the Company could lose distribution or product offerings and experience a decrease in promotional activities and programs in one period and subsequently regain this business in a future period. The Company is accustomed to such fluctuations and manages this as part of its normal business activities. 

&#65279; 

Sources and Availability of Components and Raw Materials 

&#65279; 

The Company relies on a limited number of suppliers, including single or sole suppliers, for certain of its raw materials, packaging, product components and other necessary supplies. The Company&#8217;s primary components and raw materials include petroleum-based specialty chemicals and aerosol cans, which are manufactured from commodities that are subject to volatile price changes. The availability of these components and raw materials is affected by a variety of supply and demand factors, including global market trends, plant capacity decisions and natural disasters. The Company expects these components and raw materials to continue to be readily available in the future, although the Company will continue to be exposed to volatile price changes. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#65279; 

The Company recognizes the importance of innovation and renovation to its long-term success and is focused on and committed to research and new product development activities, primarily in its maintenance product group. The Company&#8217;s product development team engages in consumer research, product development, current product improvement and testing activities. The product development team also leverages its development capabilities by partnering with a network of outside resources including the Company&#8217;s current and prospective outsource suppliers. In addition, the research and development team engages in activities and product development efforts which are necessary to ensure that the Company meets all regulatory requirements for the formulation of its products. The Company incurred research and development expenses of $ 7.7 million, $ 9.0 million, and $6.9 million in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. None of this research and development activity was customer-sponsored. 

&#65279; 

Manufacturing &#160; 

&#65279; 

The Company outsources directly or through its marketing distributors the manufacturing of its finished products to various third-party contract manufacturers. The Company or its marketing distributors use contract manufacturers in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Columbia, the U.K., Italy, Australia, Japan, China, South Korea and India. Although the Company does not typically have definitive minimum purchase obligations included in the contract terms with its contract manufacturers, when such obligations have been included, they have been immaterial to date. Supply needs are communicated by the Company to its contract manufacturers, and the Company is committed to purchase the products manufactured based on orders and short-term projections, ranging from two to five months, provided to the contract manufacturers. The Company also formulates and manufactures concentrate used in its WD-40 products at its own facilities and at third-party contract manufacturers. 

&#65279; 

In addition to the commitments to purchase products from contract manufacturers described above, the Company may also enter into commitments with other manufacturers from time to time to purchase finished goods and components to support innovation and renovation initiatives and/or supply chain initiatives. 

&#65279; 

Order Backlog 

&#65279; 

Order backlog is not a significant factor in the Company&#8217;s business. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#65279; 

The markets for the Company&#8217;s products, particularly those related to its homecare and cleaning products, are highly competitive. The Company&#8217;s products compete both within their own product classes as well as within product distribution channels, competing with many other products for store placement and shelf space. Competition in international markets varies by country. The Company is aware of many competing products, some of which sell for lower prices or are produced and marketed by companies with greater financial resources than those of the Company. The Company relies on the awareness of its brands among consumers, the value offered by those brands as perceived by consumers, product innovation and renovation and its multiple channel distributions as its primary strategies. New products typically encounter intense competition, which may require advertising and promotional support and activities. When or if a new product achieves consumer acceptance, ongoing advertising and promotional support may be required in order to maintain its relative market position. 

&#65279; 

Trademarks and Patents 

&#65279; 

The Company owns a number of patents, but relies primarily upon its established trademarks, brand names and marketing efforts, including advertising and sales promotions, to compete effectively. The WD-40 brand, 3-IN-ONE, Lava, Solvol, X-14, 2000 Flushes, Carpet Fresh and No Vac, Spot Shot, GT85, and 1001 trademarks are registered or have pending registrations in various countries throughout the world. 

&#65279;
