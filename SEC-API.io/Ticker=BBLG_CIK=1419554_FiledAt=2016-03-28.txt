OVERVIEW 

&#160;

We are a biotechnology company that is currently focused on bone regeneration in spinal fusion using the recombinant human protein, known as NELL-1/DBX&#174;. The NELL-1/DBX&#174; combination product is an osteoinductive recombinant protein that provides target specific control over bone regeneration. The protein, as part of the UCB-1 technology platform has been licensed exclusively for worldwide applications to us through a technology transfer from UCLA. UCLA and the Company received guidance from the FDA that NELL-1/DBX&#174; will be classified as a combination product with a device lead. 

&#160;

The Company was founded by University of California professors in collaboration with an Osaka University professor and a University of Southern California surgeon in 2004 as a privately-held company with proprietary, patented technology that has been validated in sheep and non-human primate models to facilitate bone growth. Our platform technology has application in delivering improved outcomes in the surgical specialties of spinal, orthopedic, general orthopedic, plastic reconstruction, neurosurgery, interventional radiology, and sports medicine. Lead product development and clinical studies are targeted on spinal fusion surgery, one of the larger segments in the orthopedic market. 

&#160;

PRODUCTS 

&#160;

We have developed a stand-alone platform technology through significant lab, small animal and large animal research over more than ten years to generate the current applications across broad fields of use. The platform technology is UCB-1, a proprietary skeletal specific growth factor used in combination with DBX&#174;, a proprietary demineralized bone matrix from Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation (MTF). Together, with DBX&#174;, or alone, NELL-1 provides regulation over skeletal tissue formation and stem cell differentiation during bone regeneration. The platform technology was obtained by the Company pursuant to an exclusive license agreement with the Regents of the University of California, as described below under &#8220;UCLA Exclusive License Agreement.&#8221; 

&#160;

We are currently focused on bone regeneration in lumbar spinal fusion using our recombinant human protein, known as NELL-1 which is a bone void filler. NELL-1/DBX&#174; is an osteoinductive orthobiologic combination product that provides control over bone regeneration. Leveraging the resources of investors and strategic partners, we have successfully surpassed two critical milestones: 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; Demonstrating a successful small laboratory scale pilot run for the manufacturing of the recombinant NELL-1 protein in Chinese hamster ovary cells; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Validation of protein dosing and efficacy in established large animal sheep models and non-human primate models. &#160; 

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We are targeting spinal fusion as the first clinical indication of our platform technology and are currently in the development phase with this proposed medical device. The lead product, purified NELL-1, is expected to be mixed with 510(k) cleared DBX&#174; Demineralized Bone Putty recommended for use in conjunction with a cleared intervertebral body fusion device. The NELL-1/DBX&#174; Fusion Device will be comprised of a single dose vial of NELL-1 recombinant protein freeze dried onto DBX&#174;. A vial of NELL-1/DBX&#174; will be sold in a convenience kit with a diluent and a syringe of 510(k) cleared demineralized bone (&#8220;DBX&#174; Putty&#8221;), produced by MTF. A delivery device will allow the surgeon to mix the reconstituted NELL-1 with the appropriate quantity of DBX&#174; Putty just prior to implantation. 

&#160;

The NELL-1/DBX&#174; Fusion Device is intended for use in lumbar spinal fusion and may have a variety of other applications such as cervical spinal fusion. 

&#160;

While the product is initially targeted at the lumbar spine fusion market, we believe NELL-1&#8217;s unique set of characteristics, target specific mechanism of action, efficacy, safety, and affordability, position the product well for application in a variety of procedures, including: 

&#160;

Spine Implants . This is the largest market for bone substitute product, representing &#62;70% of the total U.S. market according to Transparency Market Research. While use of the patient&#8217;s own bone, also referred to as autograft, to enhance fusion of vertebral segments remains the gold standard for this type of treatment, complications associated with use of autograft bone including pain, increased surgical time and infection limit its use. 

&#160;

Non-Union Trauma Cases . While the majority of fractures heal without the need for osteosynthetic products, bone substitutes are used in complicated breaks where the bone does not mend naturally. NELL-1 is expected to perform as well as high-priced growth factors in this market. 

&#160;

Hip &#38; Knee Revisions . The use of bone substitutes in reconstruction surgery is generally limited to revision cases where the products are used to account for the significant bone loss that accompanies these cases. The treatment of osteoporotic patients also represents a substantial opportunity for NELL-1&#8217;s use in hip and knee reconstruction. 

&#160;

Implant Coating . The use of NELL-1 as a direct coating on hip and knee implants could have a very significant impact on the market. A NELL-1 coating may prolong the life of primary implants and allow for differentiation in a commodity market. 

&#160;

Osteoporosis . The medical need to find a solution to counter a decrease in bone mass and density seen in women most frequently after menopause or a similar effect on astronauts in microgravity environments for an extend period of time is a major medical challenge. The systemic use of NELL-1 to stimulate bone regeneration throughout the body thereby increasing bone density could have a very significant impact on the treatment of osteoporosis. 

&#160;

UCLA&#8217;s initial research was funded with approximately $18 million in resources from UCLA and government grants. After licensing the exclusive worldwide intellectual property rights from UCLA, development was funded with additional grant funding and $6.5 million in strategic investment from MTF. We anticipate that it will require an additional $18 million to complete protein synthesis, animal studies, and commence first in man studies. An estimated additional $155 million will be required to achieve product launch. 

&#160;

NELL-1&#8217;s powerful specific bone and cartilage forming properties are derived from the ability of NELL-1 to only target cells that exhibit an activated &#8220;master switch&#8221; to develop into bone or cartilage. NELL-1 is a function specific recombinant human protein that has been proven in lab bench models to recapitulate normal human growth and development to provide control over bone and cartilage regeneration. 

&#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

NELL-1 was isolated in 1996, and the first NELL-1 patent on bone regeneration was filed in 1999. Subsequent patents and continuations in part describing NELL-1 manufacturing, delivery, and cartilage regeneration were filed in 2002, 2003, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 to further strengthen the patent portfolio. 

&#160;

RESEARCH &#38; PUBLICATIONS 

&#160;

Our leading scientists have been published in notable scientific journals and publications in our field. There are more than 80 publications that serve to highlight the work and achievements of the researchers and the Company. 

&#160;

PROPOSED INITIAL CLINICAL APPLICATION 

&#160;

The NELL-1/DBX&#174; Fusion Device will be indicated for spinal fusion procedures in skeletally mature patients with degenerative disc disease (&#8220;DDD&#8221;) at one level from L4-S1. These DDD patients may also have up to Grade I spondylolisthesis at the involved level. The NELL-1/DBX&#174; Fusion Device is to be implanted via an anterior open or an anterior laparoscopic approach in conjunction with a cleared intervertebral body fusion device. Patients receiving the device should have had at least six months of non-operative treatment prior to treatment with the device. A cervical indication is currently under consideration. This indication for use would fill a current clinical gap, created by potentially dangerous inflammatory responses caused by commercially available catalytic bone growth agents, the subject of a Public Health Notification from the United States Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;FDA&#8221;) on July 1, 2008 about life threatening complications associated with a recombinant human protein in cervical spine fusion. We do not expect our product to see the same adverse events with NELL-1/DBX&#174; as have been observed with other commercially available protein. We have performed a rat femoral onlay model to compare proinflammatory response of rhBMP-2 and NELL-1 within Helistate collagen sponges. While NELL-1 induced normal healing, rhBMP-2 induced significant amounts of swelling and histological evidence of intense inflammatory response. 

&#160;

DESCRIPTION OF THE DBX&#174; PUTTY TO BE USED WITH NELL-1 

&#160;

The DBX&#174; Demineralized Bone Putty provided in the convenience kit with NELL-1/DBX&#174; is a Class III device with a pre-market approval (PMA). The common name is &#8220;Bone Void Filler Containing Human Demineralized Bone Matrix.&#8221; The product is regulated under 21 C.F.R. &#167;888.3045 Resorbable calcium salt bone void filler device, Product Codes MQV, GXP, and MBP. MTF is the manufacturer of the DBX&#174; Putty. This product was cleared by the FDA under 510(k) number K053218 for spine indication in December 2006. 

&#160;

DBX&#174; Putty is a matrix composed of processed human cortical bone. Demineralized bone granules are mixed with sodium hyaluronate to form the DBX&#174; Putty. Every lot of final DBX&#174; Putty product is tested in an athymic mouse model or in an alkaline phosphatase assay, which has been shown to have a positive correlation with the athymic mouse model, to ensure the osteoinductive potential of the final product. 

&#160;

Our instructions for use will recommend use of the NELL-1/DBX&#174; Fusion Device with a lumbar indication. The surgeon can therefore choose to use the intervertebral fusion device that he or she is most experienced with and, in their judgment, is the best option for successful treatment. We have three precedent products, which are also osteoinductive, with intended uses similar or the same as NELL-1, that have been cleared by the FDA as medical devices. These are as follow: 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; Infuse Bone Graft/LT-Cage Lumbar Tapered Fusion Device (PMA)-rhBMP-2 dissolved in water and applied to a collagen (bovine type I) sponge and placed in a cage; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; GEM 21S (PMA)-rhPDGF-BB and -tricalcium phosphate (growth factor enhanced matrix); and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; DBX&#174; (510k)-human cortical bone (ground and demineralized) and mixed with sodium hyaluronate to form a putty. &#160; 

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Based upon extensive discussions with regulatory experts and a specific communication from the FDA in response to a submission of our plan under the Exclusive License between UCLA and the Company we believe the NELL-1/DBX&#174; Fusion Device will be regulated as a Class III medical device and will therefore require submission and approval of a pre-market approval, (&#8220;PMA&#8221;). The FDA response to the submission of our plan is: &#8220;We have determined that the product is a combination product that will be regulated under Device authorities, with CDRH (Center for Devices and Radiological Health) as the lead center.&#8221; 

&#160;

OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY 

&#160;

Our business strategy is to develop our target specific platform technology to meet a current established market with improvement in patient outcomes and reduction in costs to the healthcare delivery system. This narrowing of our focus from the research to the development stage is to allow for the approval for use of our target specific protein exhibiting efficacy and safety by matching or exceeding current market approved products. Identifying the best future strategic partners to facilitate the development through pre Investigational Device Exemption (&#8220;IDE&#8221;), clinical, and ultimate commercialization is critical as we fund the pre-IDE work and continue achieving milestones. We believe that the licensing of the distribution of the NELL-1 product in the fields of use focused upon will generate sufficient funding to provide for the ongoing development of the Platform Technology across other surgical and therapeutic fields. 

&#160;

DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANY 

&#160;

The Company was incorporated in Delaware on October 18, 2007 as AFH Acquisition X, Inc. The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Bone Biologics Acquisition Corp., (&#8220;Merger Sub&#8221;), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 19, 2014 (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;), with Bone Biologics, Inc. (&#8220;Bone&#8221;). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Bone merged with Merger Sub on September 19, 2014 (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;), with Bone as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. After the Merger, the Company ceased to be a shell company, as defined in the rules of the SEC, and the Company officially changed its name to Bone Biologics Corporation. The 5,000,000 outstanding shares of common stock of the Company prior to the Merger were consolidated into 3,853,600 shares of common stock and the remaining shares were cancelled. At the effective time of the Merger, all of the issued and outstanding shares of Bone common stock converted into a combined total of 19,897,587 shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock (including 2,151,926 shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and 5,658,658 shares issuable upon conversion of debt). Unless the context indicates otherwise, as used in this Annual Report, the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; also refer to and include Bone, its wholly owned subsidiary. 

&#160;

UCLA Exclusive License Agreement 

&#160;

On March 15, 2006, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement (the &#8220;Initial Agreement&#8221;) with the Regents of the University of California Los Angeles (&#8220;UCLA&#8221;). The Initial Agreement has been amended through nine sets of amendments (as so amended, the &#8220;The UCLA License Agreement&#8221;). 

&#160;

The UCLA License Agreement provides us with an exclusive license to several of UCLA patents covering, among other things, enhanced NELL-1 bone mineralization. The grant of the UCLA License Agreement is subject to any license obligations to the U.S. government, and the term of the license lasts until the last-to-expire UCLA patent licensed under the UCLA License Agreement expires. Under the UCLA License Agreement, we are permitted to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import any products covered by the UCLA License Agreement patents in a certain Field of Use which is currently defined as special function by local administration and expressly excludes osteoporosis and cartilage indications or systemic administration in all indications. Currently the parties are negotiating in good faith the terms pursuant to which UCLA will grant an option to exclusively license UCLA Patent Rights in the osteoporosis indication. After December 22, 2016, we may notify UCLA of our interest in requesting an expansion of the Field of Use to include additional available indications, including cartilage indications or systemic administration in the Field of Use. The parties will engage in good faith discussions of such requests. 

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We have agreed to pay an annual maintenance fee to UCLA of $10,000 as well as to pay certain royalties to UCLA under the UCLA License Agreement at the rate of 3.0% of net sales of licensed products. We must pay the royalties to UCLA on a quarterly basis. Upon a first commercial sale, we also must pay between $50,000 and $250,000, depending on the calendar year which is after the first commercial sale. If we are required to pay any third party any royalties as a result of us making use of UCLA patents, then we may reduce the royalty owed to UCLA by 0.333% for every percentage point paid to a third party. If we grant sublicense rights to a third party to use the UCLA patent, then we will pay to UCLA 10% to 20% of the sublicensing income we receive from such sublicense. 

&#160;

We are obligated to make the following milestone payments to UCLA for each Licensed Product or Licensed Method: 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; $100,000 upon enrollment of the first subject in a Feasibility Study; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; $250,000 upon enrollment of the first subject in a Pivotal Study: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; $500,000 upon Pre-Market Approval of a Licensed Product or Licensed Method; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; $1,000,000 upon the First Commercial Sale of a Licensed Product or Licensed Method. &#160; 

We are also obligated to pay UCLA a cash milestone payment within thirty (30) days of a Liquidity Event (including a Change of Control Transaction and a payment election by UCLA exercisable after December 22, 2016, such payment to equal the greater of: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; $500,000; or &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; 2% of all proceeds in connection with a Change of Control Transaction. &#160; 

We are obligated to diligently proceed with developing and commercializing licensed products under UCLA patents set forth in the UCLA License Agreement. UCLA has the right to either terminate the license or reduce the license to a non-exclusive license if we do not meet certain diligence milestone deadlines set forth in the UCLA License Agreement. 

&#160;

We must reimburse or pre-pay UCLA for patent prosecution and maintenance costs incurred during the term of the UCLA License Agreement. We have the right to bring infringement actions against third party infringers of the UCLA License Agreement, UCLA may join voluntarily, at its own expense, or, at our expense, be joined involuntarily to the action. We are required to indemnify UCLA against any third party claims arising out of our exercise of the rights under the UCLA License Agreement or any sublicense. 

&#160;

AFH Holding &#38; Advisory LLC 

&#160;

In connection with the Merger, the Company and MTF entered into a letter agreement with AFH Holdings &#38; Advisory, LLC (&#8220;AFH&#8221;) dated May 7, 2014 (the &#8220;AFH/MTF Agreement&#8221;). Amir Heshmatpour is the controlling party of AFH and an affiliate and board observer of the Company. The AFH Agreement contemplated among other things (a) the sale of Notes in the principal amount of $50,000 and warrants to purchase common stock, and (b) certain assistance to be provided by AFH in connection with the Merger, the subsequent quotation of the Company&#8217;s common stock, procuring private funding and a possible initial public offering. In consideration of AFH&#8217;s advisory services, the Company granted to AFH certain anti-dilution protection arising from future issuances of the Company&#8217;s common stock. The Company granted to each of AFH and MTF the right to appoint three members of the Board and to the original founding scientists and then minority shareholders the right to appoint one member with each of MTF and AFH having the right to appoint one individual with observer status with respect to the Board. The Company also granted to AFH the right to act as advisor to the Company on all financings for a period of two years. The AFH/MTF Agreement also granted to AFH and MTF restricted shares equal to 2.5% of the fully diluted shares of the Company (the &#8220;Milestone Shares&#8221;) at the time of completion of certain milestone targets. The milestone targets were not met and pursuant to separate side letter agreements dated August 11, 2015, the Company agreed to issue to each of AFH and MTF 867,163 shares in exchange for forfeiture of any claims to receive any Milestone Shares. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

On October 28, 2015, the Company agreed (i) to issue to AFH 915,614 shares of common stock of the Company and warrants to purchase 158,229 shares of common stock and (ii) to make a payment of $275,000. The warrants have an exercise price of $1.58. The shares and warrants were issued and the payment was made to AFH as payment for advisory services rendered to the Company. 

&#160;

In addition to the shares and warrants issued for services, AFH received cash totaling $408,750 for services during the year ended December 31, 2015. 

&#160;

Pursuant to a letter agreement dated February 10, 2016, the Company agreed to issue a total of 1,260,255 shares of common stock of the Company to AFH. The Letter Agreement was entered into in connection with the AFH/MTF Agreement under which AFH and its affiliated entities, individuals or assignees (&#8220;AFH Group&#8221;) were entitled to 10% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company on a fully diluted basis (the &#8220;Share Adjustment&#8221;) after giving effect to an anticipated private placement of between $8,000,000 and $10,000,000 (the &#8220;PIPE&#8221;). In the Letter Agreement, the Company recognized that, at the time the AFH/MTF Agreement was entered into, it was not anticipated that certain events in addition to the PIPE would dilute directly or indirectly the interest of AFH Group as stockholders of the Company, including the Ninth Amendment to the UCLA License Agreement and the issuance of the Company&#8217;s Common Shares pursuant to the Professional Services Agreement with each of Dr. Chia Soo, Dr. Ben Wu, and Dr. Eric Ting discussed below. Accordingly, the Company agreed to issue the 1,260,255 shares in connection with the Share Adjustment. 

&#160;

Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation (MTF) 

&#160;

We have formed a formal strategic alliance with Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation (MTF) on the collaborative development of osteoinductive products that incorporate MTF&#8217;s current product line of natural bone graft substitutes with NELL-1. MTF is the exclusive allograft supplier for BIOBONE-X&#8482;. MTF has become one of the major investors of the Company. MTF is the world&#8217;s largest allograft bone supplier. It is also the country&#8217;s largest full service tissue organization dedicated to providing quality tissue through a commitment to excellence in education, research, recovery and care for recipients, donors and their families. A not-for-profit organization, MTF is a consortium of academic medical institutions and organ and tissue recovery organizations across the country. We anticipate that MTF, with its proven ISO 9001 manufacturing and packaging of FDA approved osteogenic carriers, will significantly accelerate the clinical development cycle of NELL-1 related products. 

&#160;

The Company and MTF entered into a loan agreement in 2008 and a credit agreement in 2009 (collectively, the &#8220;MTF Credit Agreements&#8221;), and accompanying promissory and convertible promissory notes in January 2008, November 2008, March 2009 and August 2009 to fund the development of Bone. As of September 19, 2014, $5,192,684 in principal and interest was outstanding under the MTF Credit Agreements. On September 19, 2014, $1,533,356 of the amounts due under the MTF Credit Agreements were converted to shares of the Company. The remaining amounts due under the MTF Credit Agreements were cancelled and a new Convertible Note in the principal amount of $3,659,328 was issued by the Company. 

&#160;

In 2013, the Company and MTF also entered into a bridge note in the principal amount of $100,000. Prior to consummation of the Merger, the 2013 bridge note and accrued interest were converted into Common Stock at a conversion price of $1.00 per share. 

&#160;

Pursuant to the AFH/MTF Agreement, MTF has the right to appoint three members to the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors together with one non-voting observer. 

&#160;

Hankey Capital LLC 

&#160;

First Secured Convertible Note and Warrant 

&#160;

On October 24, 2014, the Company issued a convertible promissory note in the amount of $5,000,000 to Hankey Capital, LLC (&#8220;Hankey Capital&#8221;). The Convertible Note matures on October 24, 2017 and bears interest at an annual rate of interest of the &#8220;prime rate&#8221; plus 4.0%, with a minimum rate of 8.5% per annum until maturity, with interest payable monthly in arrears. Prior to the Maturity Date, Hankey Capital has a right, in its sole discretion, to convert the Convertible Note into shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock, at a conversion rate equal to the greater of (i) $1.58 per share or (ii) 70% of the average daily price for the Common Stock as measured over the course of the 60 day period prior to the conversion. 

&#160;

The Convertible Note is secured by certain collateral shares of Common Stock issued by the Company in the name of Hankey Capital, in such amount so as to maintain a loan to value ratio of no greater than 50% (the &#8220;Collateral&#8221;). 6,329,114 shares were issued upon closing the lending. The number of shares in the Collateral shall be adjusted on a yearly basis. The shares representing the Collateral contain a restrictive legend. The Company shall seek to register the Collateral shares initially delivered on the date of the Convertible Note pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement described below. Upon the effectiveness of such Registration Statement, the Company will remove the restrictive legends from the Collateral shares so long as Hankey Capital agrees in any event not to sell any Collateral shares if Hankey Capital is notified that the Registration Statement is no longer effective. Hankey Capital may hold the Collateral in any brokerage account of its choosing, but shall not transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral, except during the existence of an Event of Default, as defined in the Convertible Note. The Convertible Note is further secured by collateral assignments of all the Company&#8217;s license agreements. The principal amount of the loan is pre-payable in whole or in part at any time, without premium or penalty. Upon any voluntary partial prepayment of outstanding principal, Hankey Capital will return Collateral shares to the Company in the amount necessary, if any, to maintain the loan to value ratio at no less than 50%. Upon a full payment of the outstanding principal, all Collateral shares shall be returned return and cancelled. Hankey Capital will also return Collateral shares under the same terms in case of partial or full conversion of the Convertible Note. The Company paid a commitment fee in the amount of 3.0% of the original principal amount of the loan ($150,000) to Hankey Capital. On October 24, 2014, the Company also issued a warrant to Hankey Capital for 3,955,697 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price per share of $1.58. The Warrant was amended as of February 10, 2016 to extend the expiration date to October 24, 2019. The Note and Warrant contain provisions limiting the exercise/conversion thereof.

&#160;

&#160; 

Second Secured Convertible Note and Warrant 

&#160; 

On May 4, 2015, the Company issued a convertible promissory note in the amount of $2,000,000 to Hankey Capital. The 2nd Convertible Note matures on May 4, 2018 and bears interest at an annual rate of interest of the &#8220;prime rate&#8221; plus 4.0%, with a minimum rate of 8.5% per annum until maturity, with interest payable monthly in arrears. Prior to the Maturity Date, Hankey Capital has a right, in its sole discretion, to convert the Convertible Note into shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock, at a conversion rate equal to the greater of (i) $1.58 per share or (ii) 70% of the average daily price for the Common Stock as measured over the course of the 60 day period prior to the conversion. The Convertible Note is secured by certain collateral shares of Common Stock issued by the Company in the name of Hankey Capital, in such amount so as to maintain a loan to value ratio of no greater than 50%. The number of shares in the Collateral shall be adjusted on a yearly basis. The Convertible Note is further secured by collateral assignments of all the Company&#8217;s license agreements. The principal amount of the loan is pre-payable in whole or in part at any time, without premium or penalty. Upon any voluntary partial prepayment of outstanding principal, Hankey Capital shall return Collateral shares to the Company in the amount necessary, if any, to maintain the loan to value ratio at no less than 50%. Upon a full payment of the outstanding principal, all the collateral shares shall be returned return and cancelled. Hankey Capital shall also return the collateral shares under the same terms in case of partial or full conversion of the Convertible Note. In connection with the Convertible Note, on May 4, 2015 the Company issued 2,531,646 common shares as collateral. The Company paid a commitment fee in the amount of $60,000 (3% of the original principal amount of the loan) to Hankey Capital. On May 4, 2015, the Company also issued a warrant to Hankey Capital for 1,898,734 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price per share of $1.58. The Warrant was amended as of February 10, 2016 to extend the expiration date to May 4, 2020. The Note and Warrant contain provisions limiting the exercise/conversion thereof. 

&#160; 

Third Convertible Secured Term Note and Warrant 

&#160;

On February 24, 2016, the Company issued a convertible promissory note in the amount of $2,000,000 to Hankey Capital. The Convertible Note matures on February 23, 2019 (the &#8220;Maturity Date&#8221;) and bears interest at an annual rate of interest at the &#8220;prime rate&#8221; (as quoted in the &#8220;Money Rates&#8221; section of The Wall Street Journal) plus 4.0%, with a minimum rate of 8.5% per annum until maturity, with interest payable monthly in arrears. Prior to the Maturity Date, Hankey Capital has a right, in its sole discretion, to convert the Convertible Note into shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock (the &#8220;Conversion Shares&#8221;), at a conversion rate equal to $1.58 per share. The Convertible Note is secured by certain collateral shares of Common Stock issued by the Company in the name of Hankey Capital, in such amount so as to maintain a loan to value ratio of no greater than 50%. The number of Collateral Shares will be adjusted on a yearly basis. The Convertible Note is further secured by all of the Company&#8217;s personal property, including collateral assignments of all the Company&#8217;s license agreements and the Option Agreement. The principal amount of the loan is prepayable in whole or in part at any time, without premium or penalty. Upon any voluntary partial prepayment of outstanding principal, Hankey Capital will return Collateral Shares to the Company in the amount necessary, if any, to maintain the loan to value ratio at no less than 50%. Upon a full payment of the outstanding principal, all Collateral Shares will be returned and cancelled. Hankey Capital will also return Collateral Shares under the same terms in case of partial or full conversion of the Convertible Note. In connection with the Convertible Note, on February 24, 2016 the Company issued 2,531,646 common shares as collateral, paid a commitment fee in the amount of $40,000 (2% of the original principal amount of the Loan) and a warrant to Hankey Capital for 1,463,415 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price per share of $2.05. The Warrant will expire on February 23, 2021. The Note and Warrant contain provisions limiting the exercise/conversion thereof. 

&#160; 

In connection with the financing with Hankey Capital, Hankey Capital exercised warrants to purchase an aggregate of 791,139 shares resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $1,250,000, and the parties agreed to extend the maturity date of the first two convertible secured notes to December 31, 2019 and fix the conversion rate to $1.58. The Company also agreed to extend the term of all outstanding warrants to five years from issuance.

Founders 

&#160;

The Company entered into a Letter Agreement effective October 2, 2015, with each of Dr. Chia Soo (who currently serves as a director of the Company), Dr. Eric Kang Ting and Dr. Ben Wu (who currently serves as a director of the Company) (collectively, the &#8220;Founders&#8221;). The Founders were three of the original shareholders of the Company. Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, the Founders agrees to deliver to the Company all past work product and past data related to NELL-1 (the &#8220;Data&#8221;) for use by the Company in its sole discretion, within the applicable licensing rights granted under the UCLA license and in exchange the Company agreed to the future issuance of an aggregate of 1,153,846 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. The Shares are to be equally distributed between the Founders upon the earlier of (i) the third anniversary of the Agreement and (ii) the occurrence of a Liquidity Event (as defined in the Letter Agreement). The Letter Agreement also provides the Shares with certain piggyback registration rights upon the occurrence of an equity financing by the Company. The Letter Agreement related to past work product and past data and therefore will be expensed as research and development costs upon the effective date and recorded a liability to issue shares. 

&#160;

Founders Professional Services Agreement 

&#160;

Effective January 8, 2016, the Company entered into separate Professional Services Agreements with each of the Founders. Pursuant to each of the Agreements, each Founder has agreed to provide certain services to the Company, including providing strategic advice and strategic introductions to the Company&#8217;s management team as well as specific services set forth on an Exhibit to each Agreement. The Agreements are substantially identical. In consideration for the services to be rendered under the applicable Agreement, each Founder is granted 10-year stock options (the &#8220;Options&#8221;) to purchase 1,800,364 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock corresponding to 4% of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock, on a fully diluted basis, at an exercise price of $1.59 per share. The shares subject to the Options will vest 25% on each of the first, second and third anniversary of the effective date and 12.5% on each of the fourth and fifth anniversary of the effective date. The options fully vest on a change of control of the Company, if the Company terminates the Agreement without cause or the Founder terminates the Agreement with cause. Additionally, beginning January 1, 2017, the Company will pay each Founder an annual consulting fee of $200,000 in cash or, at the option of the Company, in shares of its common stock valued as provided in the Agreement. 

&#160;

Dr. Soo and Dr. Wu are directors of the Company, and Dr. Ting is on the Company&#8217;s Scientific Advisory Board. Each of the Advisors were involved in the founding of the Company.

COMPETITION 

&#160;

The orthobiologic and orthopedic industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We face substantial competition from many different sources, including large and specialty orthopedic companies, biotechnology companies, academic research institutions and governmental agencies along with public and private research institutions. 

&#160;

Our business is in a very competitive and evolving field, that faces competition from large established orthopedic companies such as (but not limited to) Medtronic, Stryker, Zimmer-Biomet, and DePuy-Synthes that possess considerably more resources than Bone Biologics. 

&#160;

Our commercial opportunity could be reduced if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. 

&#160;

The NELL-1 growth factor is mechanistically distinct from BMPs and can minimize complications associated with BMP therapies. The early proof of concept animal studies has shown the efficacy of NELL-1 combined with demineralized bone matrix (DBM) as a novel bone graft material for interbody spine fusion. 

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

CUSTOMERS 

&#160;

The populations of interest include spine surgeons, and patients with a skeletal bone defect or bone-related condition in their spine, for which intervention is undertaken to correct such a defect. Spine surgeons and patients can choose to eliminate the need to perform a second painful surgery to obtain autograft harvest of hip bone for fusion procedures by utilizing various other types of biologics. 

&#160;

Most cases of lower back pain can be linked to a general cause such as muscle strain, injury, overuse, or can be attributed to a specific condition like herniated disc, degenerative disc disease, spondylolisthesis, spinal stenosis, or osteoarthritis. 

&#160;

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

&#160;

We have an intellectual property portfolio that includes exclusive, worldwide licenses from UCLA which we believe constitute a formidable barrier to entry. 

&#160;

Additional patent applications are currently in preparation. The intellectual property is unique and comprehensively covers NELL-1 manufacture, NELL-1 compositions and NELL-1 use in wide ranging clinical and diagnostic applications. We protect our proprietary technology through all mechanisms including U.S. and foreign patent filings, trade secret protections, and collaboration agreements with domestic and international corporations, universities and research institutions. We are the exclusive licensee for the following twelve (12) UCLA issued patents:

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

&#160;

The manufacturing and marketing of any product which we may formulate with our technologies as well as our related research and development activities are subject to regulation for safety, efficacy and quality by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries. We anticipate that these regulations will apply separately to each biotechnology product. The Company believes that complying with these regulations will involve a considerable level of time, expense and uncertainty. 

&#160;

In the U.S., drugs are subject to rigorous federal regulation and, to a lesser extent, state regulation. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. Drug development and approval within this regulatory framework is difficult to predict, requires a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources. Moreover, ongoing legislation by U.S. Congress and rule making by the United States Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) presents an ever-changing landscape where we could be required to undertake additional activities before any governmental approval is granted allowing us to market our products. The steps required before a pharmaceutical agent may be marketed in the U.S. include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; Laboratory and non-clinical tests for safety and small scale manufacturing of the agent; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The submission to the FDA of an IDE which must become effective before human clinical trials can commence; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Clinical trials to characterize the efficacy and safety of the product in the intended patient population; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The submission of a New Drug Application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;) or PMA to the FDA; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; FDA approval of the NDA or PMA prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the product. &#160; 

In addition to obtaining FDA approval for each product, each manufacturing establishment must be registered with, and approved by, the FDA. Moreover, manufacturing establishments are subject to biennial inspections by the FDA and must comply with the FDA&#8217;s current Good Manufacturing Practices &#8220;cGMP&#8221; for products, drugs and devices. 

&#160;

Non-clinical Trials 

&#160;

Non-clinical testing includes laboratory evaluation of chemistry and formulation as well as tissue culture and animal studies to assess the safety and potential efficacy of the product. Non-clinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with FDA regulations regarding good laboratory practices. Non-clinical testing is inherently risky and the results can be unpredictable or difficult to interpret. The results of non-clinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IDE and are reviewed by the FDA prior to the commencement of clinical trials. Unless the FDA objects to an IDE, clinical studies may begin 30 days after the IDE is submitted. We have relied and intend to continue to rely on third-party contractors to perform non-clinical trials. 

&#160;

Clinical Trials 

&#160;

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practices under protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA prior to its conduct. Further, each clinical study must be conducted under the auspices of an independent institutional review board. The institutional review board will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution. The drug product used in clinical trials must be manufactured according to the FDA&#8217;s current Good Manufacturing Practices. 

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Clinical trials under IDE regulations are typically conducted in two sequential trials. In the Pilot trial, the initial introduction of the product into healthy human subjects, the drug is tested for safety (adverse side effects), absorption, metabolism, bio-distribution, excretion, food and drug interactions, abuse as well as limited measures of pharmacologic effect and proof of principle that involves studies in a limited patient population in order to: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; assess the potential efficacy of the product for specific, targeted indications; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; demonstrate efficacy in a limited patient population; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; identify the range of doses likely to be effective for the indication; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; identify possible adverse events and safety risks. &#160; 

When there is evidence that the product may be effective and has an acceptable safety profile in Pilot evaluations, Pivotal trials are undertaken to establish and confirm the clinical efficacy and establish the safety profile of the product within a larger population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. Pivotal trials frequently involve randomized controlled trials and, whenever possible, studies are conducted in a manner so that neither the patient nor the investigator knows what treatment is being administered. The Company, or the FDA, may suspend clinical trials at any time if it is believed that the individuals participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks. We intend to rely upon third-party contractors to advise and assist us in the preparation of our IDEs and the conduct of clinical trials that will be conducted under the IDEs. 

&#160;

Premarket Approval and FDA Approval Process 

&#160;

The results of the manufacturing process, development work, non-clinical studies and clinical studies are submitted to the FDA in the form of a PMA prior to marketing and selling the product. The testing and approval process is likely to require substantial time and effort. In addition to the results of non-clinical and clinical testing, the PMA applicant must submit detailed information about chemistry, manufacturing and controls that will describe how the product is made and tested through the manufacturing process. 

&#160;

The PMA review process involves FDA investigation into the details of the manufacturing process, as well as the design and analysis of each of the non-clinical and clinical studies. This review includes inspection of the manufacturing facility, the data recording process for the clinical studies, the record keeping at a sample of clinical trial sites and a thorough review of the data collected and analyzed for each non-clinical and clinical study. Through this investigation, the FDA reaches a decision about the risk-benefit profile of a product candidate. If the benefit is worth the risk, the FDA begins negotiating with the company about the content of an acceptable package insert and associated Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (&#8220;REMS&#8221;), if required. 

&#160;

The approval process is affected by a number of factors, including the severity of the disease, the availability of alternative treatments and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials. Consequently, there is a risk that approval may not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may deny a PMA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information or require post-marketing testing (Phase 4) and surveillance to monitor the safety of a company&#8217;s product if it does not believe the PMA contains adequate evidence of the safety and efficacy of the product. Moreover, if regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed. Finally, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or health problems are identified that would alter the risk-benefit analysis for the product. Post-approval studies may be conducted to explore the use of the product for new indications or populations such as pediatrics. 

&#160;

Among the conditions for PMA approval is the requirement that any prospective manufacturer&#8217;s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to the FDA&#8217;s Good Manufacturing Practices and the specifications approved in the PMA. In complying with standards set forth in these regulations, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of product and quality control to ensure full technical compliance. Manufacturing establishments, both foreign and domestic, also are subject to inspections by or under the authority of the FDA and by other federal, state or local agencies. Additionally, in the event of non-compliance, FDA may issue warning letters and/or seek criminal and civil penalties, enjoin manufacture, seize product or revoke approval. 

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

International Approval 

&#160;

Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by regulatory authorities in foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of commercial sales of the drug in such countries. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and drug approvals vary widely from country to country, and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Although there are some procedures for unified filings for certain European countries, in general, each country at this time has its own procedures and requirements. 

&#160;

Other Regulation 

&#160;

In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA, we are also subject to U.S. regulation under the Controlled Substances Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential future federal, state, local or similar foreign regulations. Our research and development may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and radioactive compounds. Although we believe that its safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of any accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources. 

&#160;
