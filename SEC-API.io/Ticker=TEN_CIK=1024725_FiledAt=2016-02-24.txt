DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESS 

We design, manufacture and sell clean air and ride performance systems and products for light vehicle, commercial truck, off-highway and other applications, and generated revenues of $8.2 billion in 2015. We serve both original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and replacement markets worldwide through leading brands, including Monroe &#174; , Rancho &#174; , Clevite &#174; &#32;Elastomers, Axios &#8482; , Kinetic &#174; , and Fric-Rot &#8482; &#32;ride performance products and Walker &#174; , XNOx &#174; , Fonos &#8482; , DynoMax &#174; &#32;and Thrush &#174; clean air products. 

As a parts supplier, we produce individual component parts for vehicles as well as groups of components that are combined as modules or systems within vehicles. These parts, modules and systems are sold globally to most leading OEMs, commercial truck and off-highway engine manufacturers, and aftermarket distribution channels. 

Overview of Parts Industry for Vehicles and Engines 

The parts industry for vehicles and engines is generally separated into two categories: (1) &#8220;original equipment&#8221; or &#8220;OE&#8221; parts that are sold in large quantities directly for use by manufacturers of light vehicles, commercial trucks and off-highway engines; and (2) &#8220;aftermarket&#8221; or replacement parts that are sold in varying quantities to wholesalers, retailers and installers. In the OE category, parts suppliers are generally divided into tiers &#8212; &#8220;Tier 1&#8221; suppliers that provide their products directly to OEMs, and &#8220;Tier 2&#8221; or &#8220;Tier 3&#8221; suppliers that sell their products principally to other suppliers for combination into those other suppliers&#8217; own product offerings. 

&#8220;Light vehicles&#8221; are comprised of: (1) passenger cars and (2) light trucks which include sport-utility vehicles (SUVs), crossover vehicles (CUVs), pick-up trucks, vans and multi-purpose passenger vehicles. Demand for OE light vehicle automotive parts is generally a function of the number of new vehicles produced, which in turn depends on prevailing economic conditions and consumer preferences. Although OE demand is tied to planned vehicle production, parts suppliers also have the opportunity to grow revenues by increasing their product content per vehicle, by further expanding business with existing customers and by serving new customers in existing or new markets. Companies with a global presence and advanced technology, engineering, manufacturing and support capabilities, such as our company, are better positioned to take advantage of these opportunities. 

Increasing vehicle emissions regulations are driving opportunities for increasing clean air content of vehicles and engines. Additionally, the increase and expansion in mandated diesel emission control and noise regulations or standards in North America, Europe, China, Japan, Brazil, Russia, India and South Korea have enabled suppliers such as us to serve customers beyond light vehicles. Certain parts suppliers that have traditionally supplied the automotive industry also develop and produce components and integrated systems for commercial truck, off-highway and other applications, such as medium- and heavy-duty trucks, buses, stationary engines, agricultural and construction equipment, locomotive and marine engines and recreational two-wheelers and all-terrain vehicles. We foresee this diversification of content and applications as a source of future growth. 

Demand for aftermarket products is driven by general economic conditions, the number of vehicles in operation, the age and distance driven of the vehicle fleet, and the average useful life and quality of vehicle parts. Although more vehicles are on the road than ever before, the aftermarket has experienced longer replacement cycles due to the improved quality and increased average useful life of vehicle parts that has come to pass as a result of technological innovation. Parts suppliers are increasingly being required to deliver innovative aftermarket products to drive increased aftermarket demand. Global economic downturns generally impact aftermarket sales less adversely than OE sales, as customers forego new vehicle purchases and keep their vehicles longer, thereby increasing demand for repair and maintenance parts and services. 

Industry Trends 

As the dynamics of the customers we serve change, so do the roles, responsibilities and relationships of the participants. Key trends that we believe are affecting parts suppliers include: 

General Economic Factors and Production Levels 

Global light vehicle production has increased at a moderate but slowing pace over the past three years, increasing 4% in 2013, 3% in 2014 and 1% in 2015. The overall rate of growth in 2015 was largely impacted by the South America and Japan production declines of 21% and 5%, respectively. Of these regions, South America has the biggest impact on Tenneco and continues to struggle with political and economic turmoil. IHS Automotive projects global light vehicle production will grow 3% in 2016. Production of commercial trucks globally and off-highway equipment in regulated regions has weakened over the past three years with production increasing 4% in 2013, about flat in 2014 and declining 7% in 2015. IHS and Power Systems Research forecast these markets to decline 1% in 2016. 

Increasing Environmental Standards 

OE manufacturers and their parts suppliers are designing and developing products to respond to increasingly stringent environmental requirements, growth in engines using diesel and alternative fuels and increased demand for better fuel economy. Government regulations adopted over the past decade require substantial reductions in vehicle tailpipe criteria pollutant 

emissions, longer warranty periods for a vehicle&#8217;s pollution control equipment and additional equipment to control fuel vapor emissions. The products that our clean air division provides reduce the tailpipe emissions of criteria pollutants. In addition, new regulations have been adopted to regulate greenhouse gas emissions of carbon dioxide. Reducing CO 2 &#32;emissions requires improving fuel economy; as a result improved combustion efficiency and reduction of vehicle mass have become priorities. Manufacturers are responding to all of these regulations with new technologies for gasoline- and diesel-fueled vehicles that minimize pollution and improve fuel economy. 

As a leading supplier of clean air systems with strong technical capabilities, we are well positioned to benefit from the more rigorous environmental standards being adopted around the world. We continue to expand our investment in all regions such as China, India, Thailand and Japan to capitalize on the growing demand for environmentally friendly solutions for light vehicle, commercial truck and off-highway applications driven by environmental regulations in these regions. 

To meet stricter air quality regulations, we have developed and sold diesel particulate filters (DPFs) in Europe, for example, for the Audi A4, BMW 1 series passenger cars and Scania trucks and in North America for GM Duramax engine applications, the Ford Super Duty, the Chrysler Ram Heavy Duty, and off-highway applications for Caterpillar and John Deere in North America and Europe, and Kubota in Japan. These particulate filters, coupled with converters, reduce emissions of particulate matter by up to 90 percent. In addition, we have development and production contracts for our selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems with light and commercial vehicle manufacturers. These SCR systems reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides by up to 95 percent. In China, South America, Europe, and Japan, we have development and production contracts for complete turnkey SCR systems that include the urea dosing technology acquired in 2007 and now sold globally under the name XNOx &#174; . New regulations in the U.S. and European markets, which require reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and improvements in fuel economy, are creating increased demand for our fabricated manifolds, maniverters, integrated turbocharger/manifold modules, electronic exhaust valves, and lightweight components. Lastly, for various off-highway customers, we offer emission aftertreatment systems designed to meet environmental regulations or their equivalent outside of the U.S. Both commercial truck and off-highway customers are embracing the concept of turnkey aftertreatment systems which require aftertreatment electronic control units (ECUs) as well as related control software which we have developed and sold to several customers. 

Increasing Technologically Sophisticated Content 

As end users and consumers continue to demand vehicles with improved performance, safety and functionality at competitive prices, the components and systems in these vehicles are becoming technologically more advanced and sophisticated. Mechanical functions are being replaced with electronics; and mechanical and electronic devices are being integrated into single systems. More stringent emission and other regulatory standards are increasing the complexity of the systems as well. 

To remain competitive as a parts and systems supplier, we invest in engineering, research and development, spending $146 million in 2015, $169 million in 2014, and $144 million in 2013, net of customer reimbursements. Such expenses reimbursed by our customers totaled $145 million in 2015, $159 million in 2014, and $169 million in 2013, including building prototypes and incurring other costs on behalf of our customers. We also fund and sponsor university and other independent research to advance our clean air and ride performance development efforts. 

By investing in technology, we have been able to expand our product offerings and penetrate new markets. For example, we developed DPFs which were first sold in Europe and then offered in North America. Since these original innovations, we have developed T.R.U.E-Clean &#174; &#32;systems with our partners, a product used to regenerate DPFs. We have also built prototypes of urea SCR systems for locomotive and marine engines. We expanded our suite of NOx-reduction technologies, developing prototypes of SCR systems using gaseous ammonia, absorbed on a solid salt, as the reductant or a hydrocarbon lean NOx catalyst (HC-LNC for NOx reduction) that relies on hydrocarbons, ethanol, or other reductants instead of urea. We successfully developed and sold fabricated manifolds, previously used only on gasoline engines, into the passenger car diesel segment. We developed our prototype aftertreatment system for large engines, up to 4500 horsepower, used in line haul locomotives. Tenneco, through an exclusive partnership with Jiangsu Lvyuan in China, has become the first company to obtain China Classification Society (CCS) approval to sell marine selective catalytic reduction systems for China flagged vessels, as required by the International Maritime Organization. On the ride performance side of our business, we co-developed with &#214;hlins Racing AB a continuously controlled electronic suspension system offered by OEMs such as Volvo, Audi, Ford, VW, Mercedes Benz and BMW. 

Enhanced Vehicle Safety and Handling 

To serve the needs of their customers and meet government mandates, OEMs are seeking parts suppliers that invest in new technologies, capabilities and products that advance vehicle safety, such as roll-over protection systems, computerized electronic suspension, and safer, more durable materials. Those suppliers able to offer such innovative products and technologies have a distinct competitive advantage. 

Tenneco offers adjustable and adaptive damping as well as semi-active suspension systems designed to improve vehicle stability, handling, safety and control. Our systems are based on various technologies including DRiV &#8482; &#32;digital valve, Continuously Variable Semi-Active (CVSA) suspension and Kinetic &#174; &#32;ride control, and Actively Controlled Car (ACOCAR &#8482; ).

the aftermarket, we supply premium Monroe &#174; &#32;branded brakes that complement our ride performance offerings. In addition, we continue to promote the Safety Triangle &#8482; &#32;of Steering-Stopping-Stability to educate consumers about the detrimental effect of worn shock absorbers on vehicle steering and stopping distances. 

Outsourcing and Demand for Systems and Modules 

OEMs have steadily outsourced more of the design and manufacturing of vehicle parts and systems to simplify the assembly process, lower costs and reduce development times. Furthermore, they have demanded from their parts suppliers fully integrated, functional modules and systems made possible with the development of advanced electronics in addition to innovative, individual vehicle components and parts that may not readily interface together. 

Modules and systems being produced by parts suppliers are described as follows: 

&#8226; 

&#8220;Modules&#8221; are groups of component parts arranged in close physical proximity to each other within a vehicle. Modules are often assembled by the supplier and shipped to the OEM for installation in a vehicle as a unit. Integrated shock and spring units, seats, instrument panels, axles and door panels are examples. 

&#8226; 

&#8220;Systems&#8221; are groups of component parts located throughout a vehicle which operate together to provide a specific vehicle functionality. Emission control systems, anti-lock braking systems, safety restraint systems, roll control systems and powertrain systems are examples. 

This shift towards fully integrated modules and systems created the role of the Tier 1 systems integrator, a supplier responsible for executing a broad array of activities, including design, development, engineering, and testing of component parts, modules and systems. As an established Tier 1 supplier, we have produced modules and systems for various vehicle platforms produced worldwide, supplying ride performance modules for the Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Sierra, Chevrolet Malibu, Chevrolet Impala and Chevrolet Cruze and emission control systems for the Chevrolet Colorado, GMC Canyon, Ford Super Duty, Ford Focus, Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Sierra, Chevrolet Malibu, Opel Astra, and VW Golf. In addition, we continue to design other modules and systems for platforms yet to be introduced to the global marketplace. 

Global Reach of OE Customers 

Changing market dynamics are driving OEMs and their parts suppliers to expand their global reach: 

&#8226; 

Growing Importance of Growth Markets: Because the North American and Western European automotive regions are mature, OEMs are increasingly focusing on other markets for growth opportunities, such as India, China and Thailand. As OEMs have penetrated new regions, growth opportunities for suppliers have emerged. 

&#8226; 

Governmental Tariffs and Local Parts Requirements: Many governments around the world require vehicles sold within their country to contain specified percentages of locally produced parts. Additionally, some governments place high tariffs on imported parts. 

&#8226; 

Location of Production Closer to End Markets: As OEMs and parts suppliers have shifted production globally to be closer to their end markets, suppliers have expanded their reach, capturing sales in other markets and taking advantage where possible of relatively low labor costs. 

&#8226; 

Global Rationalization of OE Vehicle Platforms &#32;(described below). 

Because of these trends, OEMs are increasingly seeking suppliers capable of supporting vehicle platforms on a global basis. They want suppliers like Tenneco with design, production, engineering and logistics capabilities that can be accessed not just in North America and Europe but also in many other regions of the world. 

Global Rationalization of OE Vehicle Platforms 

OEMs have standardized on global platforms designing basic mechanical structures that are suitable for a number of similar vehicle models and able to accommodate different features for more than one region. This standardization will drive production of light vehicles designed on global platforms to grow. Accordingly light vehicle platforms whose annual production exceed one million units will grow from 53 percent of global OE production in 2015 to 57 percent in 2020 based on data provided by IHS Automotive. 

With such global platforms, OEMs realize significant economies of scale by limiting variations in items such as steering columns, brake systems, transmissions, axles, exhaust systems, support structures and power window and door lock mechanisms. The shift towards standardization can also benefit parts suppliers. They can experience greater economies of scale, lower material costs, and reduced development costs. 

Extended Product Life of Automotive Parts 

The average useful life of automotive parts, both OE and replacement, has steadily increased in recent years due to technological innovations including longer-lasting materials. As a result, although there are more vehicles on the road than ever before, the global aftermarket has not kept pace with that growth. Accordingly, aftermarket suppliers have focused on reducing 

costs and providing product differentiation through advanced technology and recognized brand names. With our long history of technological innovation, strong brands and operational effectiveness, we believe we are well positioned to leverage our products and technology. 

Changing Aftermarket Distribution Channels and Increased Competition from Lower cost, Private-Label Products 

From 2003 to 2015, the number of traditional jobber stores declined in the U.S. Major aftermarket retailers, such as AutoZone and Advance Auto Parts, have continued their work to expand their retail outlets and commercial distribution strategies to sell directly and more effectively to parts installers, which historically had purchased the majority of their needs from local warehouse distributors and jobbers. The size and number of consolidations as well as key customer distribution center footprint expansions have increased in the last a few years, including Advance Auto Parts' purchase of Carquest (which included WorldPac), Auto Zone's purchase of Interamerican Motor Company, O'Reilly Auto Parts' purchase of V.I.P. to expand their entrance into the Northeast U.S. market, and Icahn Enterprises L.P.'s agreement to acquire Pep Boys. We are well positioned to respond to these trends and feel our strategy and portfolio of customers are in line with the market changes and opportunities. We make and sell high-quality products marketed under premium brands that appeal to aftermarket retailers and the customers they serve. In addition, our breadth of suspension and emissions control products and a reputation for customer service provide benefits to both wholesalers and retailers. 

More recently, our aftermarket business is facing increasing competition from these lower cost, private-label products and there is growing pressure to expand our entry-level product lines so that retailers may offer a greater range of price points to their consumer customers.

During 2015, our aftermarket customers were comprised of full-line and specialty warehouse distributors, retailers, jobbers, installer chains and car dealers. These customers included National Auto Parts Association (NAPA), Advance Auto Parts, Uni-Select, O&#8217;Reilly Auto Parts, Aftermarket Auto Parts Alliance, and AutoZone in North America, Temot Autoteile GmbH, Autodistribution International, Group Auto Union, Auto Teile Ring and AP United in Europe and Rede Presidente in South America. We believe our aftermarket revenue mix is balanced, with our top 10 aftermarket customers accounting for 63 percent of our net aftermarket sales and our aftermarket sales representing 15 percent of our total net sales in 2015. 

Competition 

We operate in highly competitive markets. Customer loyalty is a key element of competition in these markets and is developed through long-standing relationships, customer service, high quality value-added products and timely delivery. Product pricing and services provided are other important competitive factors. 

As a supplier of OE and aftermarket parts, we compete with the vehicle manufacturers, some of which are also customers of ours, and numerous independent suppliers. For OE sales, we believe that we rank among the top two suppliers for certain key clean air and ride performance products and systems in many regions of the world. In the aftermarket, we believe that we are a leader in supplying clean air and ride performance products for light vehicles for the key applications we serve throughout the world. 

Seasonality 

Our OE and aftermarket businesses are somewhat seasonal. OE production is historically higher in the first half of the year compared to the second half. It typically decreases in the third quarter due to OE plant shutdowns for model changeovers and European holidays, and softens further in the fourth quarter due to reduced production during the end-of-year holiday season in North America and Europe generally. Our aftermarket operations, also affected by seasonality, experience relatively higher demand during the Spring as vehicle owners prepare for the Summer driving season. 

While seasonality does impact our business, actual results may vary from the above trends due to global and local economic dynamics as well as industry-specific platform launches and other production-related events. During periods of economic recession, OE sales traditionally decline due to reduced consumer demand for automobiles and other capital goods. Aftermarket sales tend not to be as adversely affected during periods of economic downturn, as consumers forego new vehicle purchases and keep their vehicles longer, thereby increasing demand for repair and maintenance services. By participating in both the OE and aftermarket segments, we generally see a smaller revenue decline during economic downturns than the overall change in OE production. 

Clean Air Systems 

Vehicle emission control products and systems play a critical role in safely conveying noxious exhaust gases away from the passenger compartment and reducing the level of pollutants and engine exhaust noise emitted to acceptable levels. Precise engineering of the exhaust system &#8212; which extends from the manifold that connects an engine&#8217;s exhaust ports to an exhaust pipe, to the catalytic converter that eliminates pollutants from the exhaust, and to the muffler that modulates noise emissions &#8212; leads to a pleasantly tuned engine sound, reduced pollutants and optimized engine performance. 

We design, manufacture and distribute a variety of products and systems designed to reduce pollution and optimize engine performance, acoustic tuning and weight, including the following: 

&#8226; 

Catalytic converters and diesel oxidation catalysts &#8212; Devices consisting of a substrate coated with precious metals enclosed in a steel casing used to reduce harmful gaseous emissions such as carbon monoxide; 

&#8226; 

Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs) &#8212; Devices to capture and regenerate particulate matter emitted from diesel engines; 

&#8226; 

Burner systems &#8212; Devices which actively combust fuel and air inside the exhaust system to create extra heat for DPF regeneration, or to improve the efficiency of SCR systems; 

&#8226; 

Lean NOx traps &#8212; Devices which reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from diesel powertrains using capture and store technology; 

&#8226; 

Hydrocarbon vaporizers and injectors &#8212; Devices to add fuel to a diesel exhaust system in order to regenerate particulate filters or Lean NOx traps; 

&#8226; 

Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems &#8212; Devices which reduce NOx emissions from diesel powertrains using urea mixers and injected reductants such as Verband der Automobil industrie e.V.'s AdBlue &#174; or Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF); 

&#8226; 

SCR-coated diesel particulate filters (SDPF) systems - Lightweight and compact devices combining the SCR catalyst and the particulate filter onto the same substrate for reducing NOx and particulate matter emissions; 

&#8226; 

Urea dosing systems - Systems comprised of a urea injector, pump, and control unit, among other parts, that dose liquid urea onto SCR catalysts; 

&#8226; 

Four-way catalysts - Devices that combine a three-way catalyst and a particulate filter onto a single device by having the catalyst coating of a converter directly applied onto a particulate filter; 

&#8226; 

Alternative NOx reduction technologies &#8212; Devices which reduce NOx emissions from diesel powertrains, by using, for example, alternative reductants such as diesel fuel, E85 (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline), or solid forms of ammonia; 

&#8226; 

Mufflers and resonators &#8212; Devices to provide noise elimination and acoustic tuning; 

&#8226; 

Fabricated exhaust manifolds &#8212; Components that collect gases from individual cylinders of a vehicle&#8217;s engine and direct them into a single exhaust pipe. Fabricated manifolds can form the core of an emissions module that includes an integrated catalytic converter (maniverter) and/or turbocharger; 

&#8226; 

Pipes &#8212; Utilized to connect various parts of both the hot and cold ends of an exhaust system; 

&#8226; 

Hydroformed assemblies &#8212; Forms in various geometric shapes, such as Y-pipes or T-pipes, which provide optimization in both design and installation as compared to conventional pipes; 

&#8226; 

Elastomeric hangers and isolators &#8212; Used for system installation and elimination of noise and vibration, and for the improvement of useful life; and 

&#8226; 

Aftertreatment control units &#8212; Computerized electronic devices that utilize embedded software to regulate the performance of active aftertreatment systems, including the control of sensors, injectors, vaporizers, pumps, heaters, valves, actuators, wiring harnesses, relays and other mechatronic components. 

For the catalytic converters, SCR system and other substrate-based devices we sell, we need to procure substrates coated with precious metals or in the case of catalytic converter systems only, purchase the complete systems. We obtain these components and systems from third parties, often at the OEM's direction, or directly from OE vehicle and engine manufacturers. See Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; for more information on our sales of these products. 

We supply our clean air offerings to approximately 30 light vehicle manufacturers for use on over 225 light vehicle models, including six of the top 10 passenger car models produced in Europe and seven of the top 10 light truck models produced in North America for 2015. We also supply clean air products to approximately 30 manufacturers of commercial trucks, off-highway equipment and engines, and other vehicles including BMW Motorcycle, Caterpillar, CNHTC, Daimler Trucks, Deutz, FAW Truck, Harley-Davidson, John Deere, Kubota, Scania and Weichai Power. 

We acquired our original clean air product line in 1967 with the acquisition of Walker Manufacturing Company, which was founded in 1888, and became one of Europe&#8217;s leading OE clean air systems suppliers with the acquisition of Heinrich Gillet GmbH &#38; Co. in 1994. Throughout this document, the term &#8220;Walker&#8221; refers to our subsidiaries and affiliates that produce clean air products and systems. 

In the aftermarket, we manufacture, market and distribute replacement mufflers for virtually all North American, European, and Asian light vehicle models under brand names including Quiet-Flow &#174; &#32;and Tru-Fit &#174; &#32;in addition to offering a variety of other related products such as pipes and catalytic converters (Walker &#174; &#32;Perfection). We also serve the specialty exhaust aftermarket with offerings that include Mega-Flow &#174; &#32;exhaust products for heavy-duty vehicle applications and DynoMax &#174; &#32;high performance exhaust products. We continue to emphasize product-value differentiation with other aftermarket brands such as Walker &#174; , Thrush &#174; &#32;and Fonos &#8482; . 

Ride Performance Systems 

Superior ride control is governed by a vehicle&#8217;s suspension system, including shock absorbers and struts. Shock absorbers and struts maintain the vertical loads placed on vehicle tires, helping keep the tires in contact with the road. Vehicle steering, braking, acceleration and safety depend on maintaining contact between the tires and the road. Worn shocks and struts can allow excessive transfer of the vehicle&#8217;s weight &#8212; from side to side, known as &#8220;roll;&#8221; from front to rear, called &#8220;pitch;&#8221; or up and down, &#8220;bounce.&#8221; Because shock absorbers and struts are designed to control the vertical loads placed on tires, they provide resistance to excessive roll, pitch and bounce. 

We design, manufacture and distribute a variety of ride performance products and systems including: 

&#8226; 

Shock absorbers &#8212; A broad range of mechanical shock absorbers and related components for light- and heavy-duty vehicles, including twin-tube and monotube shock absorbers; 

&#8226; 

Struts &#8212; A complete line of struts and strut assemblies for light vehicles; 

&#8226; 

Vibration control components (Clevite &#174; &#32;Elastomers, Axios &#8482; ) &#8212; Generally, rubber-to-metal bushings and mountings to reduce vibration between metal parts of a vehicle. Offerings include a broad range of suspension arms, rods and links for light- and heavy-duty vehicles; 

&#8226; 

Monroe &#174; &#32;Intelligent Suspension Portfolio:

&#9702; 

Kinetic H2/CVSA Continuously Variable Semi Active suspension system (Formerly known as CES) &#8212; In 2011, we won the Supplier of the Year award from Vehicle Dynamics International &#32;magazine, which recognizes outstanding achievement in global automotive suspension and chassis engineering, for the Kinetic H2/CVSA Continuously Variable Semi Active suspension system installed on the McLaren MP4-12C; and 

&#8226; 

Other &#8212; We also offer other ride performance products such as load assist products, springs, steering stabilizers, adjustable suspension systems, suspension kits and modular assemblies. 

We supply our ride performance offerings to approximately 25 light vehicle manufacturers for use on over 195 light vehicle models, including eight of the top 10 passenger car models produced in Europe and eight of the top 10 light truck models produced in North America for 2015. We also supply ride performance products and systems to over 40 manufacturers of commercial truck, off-highway and other vehicles including Volvo Truck, Scania, Navistar, Daimler Trucks and Paccar. 

In the ride performance aftermarket, we manufacture, market and distribute replacement shock absorbers for virtually all North American, European and Asian light vehicle models under several brand names including Gas-Matic &#174; , Sensa-Trac &#174; , Monroe &#174; &#32;Reflex &#174; &#32;and Monroe &#174; &#32;Adventure &#8482; , Quick-Strut &#174; , as well as Clevite &#174; &#32;Elastomers and Axios &#8482; &#32;for elastomeric vibration control components. We also sell ride performance offerings for commercial truck and other aftermarket segments, such as our Gas-Magnum &#174; &#32;shock absorbers for the North American commercial category. 

We entered the ride performance product line in 1977 with the acquisition of Monroe Auto Equipment Company, which was founded in 1916, and introduced the world&#8217;s first modern tubular shock absorber in 1930. When the term &#8220;Monroe&#8221; is used in this document it refers to our subsidiaries and affiliates that produce ride performance products and systems. 

Financial Information About Geographic Areas 

Refer to Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements of Tenneco Inc. included in Item 8 of this report for financial information about geographic areas. 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 

We have separate and distinct sales and marketing efforts for our OE and aftermarket businesses. 

For OE sales, our sales and marketing team is an integrated group of professionals, including skilled engineers and program managers, who are organized by customer and product type (e.g., ride performance and clean air). Our sales and marketing team provides the appropriate mix of operational and technical expertise needed to interface successfully with the OEMs. Our new business &#8220;capture process&#8221; involves working closely with the OEM platform engineering and purchasing teams. Bidding on OE automotive platforms typically encompasses many months of engineering and business development activity. Throughout the process, our sales team, program managers and product engineers assist the OE customer in defining the project&#8217;s technical and business requirements. A normal part of the process includes our engineering and sales personnel working on customers&#8217; integrated product teams, and assisting with developing component/system specifications and test procedures. Given that the OE business involves long-term production contracts awarded on a platform-by-platform basis, our strategy is to leverage our engineering expertise and strong customer relationships to target and win new business and increase operating margins. 

For aftermarket sales and marketing, our sales force is generally organized by customer and region and covers multiple product lines. We sell aftermarket products through four primary channels of distribution: (1) the traditional three-step distribution system of full-line warehouse distributors, jobbers and installers; (2) the specialty two-step distribution system of specialty warehouse distributors that carry only specified automotive product groups and installers; (3) direct sales to retailers; and (4) direct sales to installer chains. Our aftermarket sales and marketing representatives cover all levels of the distribution channel, stimulating interest in our products and helping our products move through the distribution system. Also, to generate demand for our products from end-users, we run print, online and outdoor advertisements and offer pricing promotions. We offer business-to-business services to customers with TA-Direct, an on-line order entry and customer service tool. In addition, we maintain detailed web sites for each of Walker &#174; , Monroe &#174; , Rancho &#174; , DynoMax &#174; , Monroe &#174; &#32;brake brands and our heavy-duty products. 

Manufacturing and Engineering 

We focus on achieving superior product quality at the lowest operating costs possible using productive, reliable and safe manufacturing processes to achieve that goal. Our manufacturing strategy centers on a lean production system called the Tenneco Manufacturing System (TMS), that is designed to eliminate waste, develop skills, share best practices and lead our manufacturing enterprise to reduce overall costs, while maintaining quality standards and reducing manufacturing cycle time. As part of TMS, we use Six Sigma techniques both in manufacturing and design to minimize product defects and improve operational efficiencies. We deploy new technology to differentiate our products from our competitors&#8217; and to achieve higher quality and productivity. We continue to adapt our capacity to customer demand, both expanding capabilities in growth areas as well as reallocating capacity away from segments in decline. 

Clean Air 

We operate 63 clean air manufacturing facilities worldwide, of which 14 facilities are located in North America, 25 in Europe, South America and India, and 24 in Asia Pacific. We operate 18 of the manufacturing facilities in Asia Pacific through joint ventures in which we hold a controlling interest. We operate five clean air engineering and technical facilities worldwide and share three other such facilities with our ride performance operations. Of the five clean air engineering and technical facilities, one is located in North America, two in Europe, and two in Asia Pacific. In addition, two joint ventures in which we hold a noncontrolling interest operate a total of two manufacturing facilities in Europe. 

Within each of our clean air manufacturing facilities, operations are organized by component (e.g., muffler, catalytic converter, pipe, resonator and manifold). Our manufacturing systems incorporate cell-based designs, allowing work-in-process to move through the operation with greater speed and flexibility. We continue to invest in plant and equipment to stay competitive in the industry. For instance, in our Smithville, Tennessee, OE manufacturing facility, we have developed a muffler assembly cell that utilizes laser welding. This allows for quicker change-over times in the process as well as less material used and less weight for the product. There is also a reduced cycle time compared to traditional joining and increased manufacturing precision for superior durability and performance. In 2007, we introduced the Measured and Matched Converter technique in North America. This allows us to maintain the optimum GBD (Gap Bulk Density) in our converter manufacturing operations with Tenneco proprietary processing. This process, coupled with cold spinning of the converter body, versus traditional cone to can welding, allows for more effective use of material through reduced welding, lower cost, and better performance of the product. In 2009, we introduced low-cost fabricated diesel manifolds in Europe which utilize advanced manufacturing processes such as deep drawing, laser welding, and furnace brazing. 

To strengthen our position as a Tier 1 OE systems supplier, we have developed some of our clean air manufacturing operations into &#8220;just-in-time&#8221; or &#8220;JIT&#8221; systems. In this system, a JIT facility located close to our OE customer&#8217;s manufacturing plant receives product components from both our manufacturing operations and independent suppliers, and then assembles and ships products to the OEMs on an as-needed basis. To manage the JIT functions and material flow, we have advanced computerized material requirements planning systems linked with our customers&#8217; and supplier partners&#8217; resource management systems. We have 25 clean air JIT assembly facilities worldwide, of which two facilities are located in North America, ten in Europe and India, and 13 in Asia Pacific. 

Our engineering capabilities include advanced predictive design tools, advanced prototyping processes and state-of-the-art testing equipment. These technological capabilities make us a &#8220;full system&#8221; integrator to the OEMs, supplying complete emission control systems from the manifold to the tailpipe, to provide full emission and noise control. We expanded our engineering capabilities with acquisitions in 2007 and 2012 of Combustion Component Associates&#8217; technology for use in mobile emission and stationary engine applications, respectively. That technology, with its urea and hydrocarbon injectors, electronic controls and software, is marketed and sold globally under the XNOx &#174; &#32;name for use in selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and other exhaust aftertreatment systems. We also offer a complete suite of alternative full system NOx aftertreatment technologies, including the Hydrocarbon Lean NOx Catalyst (HC-LNC) technology under joint development with General Electric, and Solid SCR &#8482; &#32;technology licensed from Amminex, an engineering and manufacturing company located in Denmark. We also developed advanced predictive engineering tools, including KBM&#38;E (Knowledge Based Manufacturing &#38; Engineering). The innovation of our KBM&#38;E (which we call TEN-KBM&#38;E) is a modular toolbox set of CAD embedded applications for manufacturing and engineering compliant design. The encapsulated TEN-KBM&#38;E content is driven by an analytical method which continuously captures and updates the knowledge of our main manufacturing and engineering processes. Our global engineering capabilities are standardized through the use of the ATLAS Global PDM (Product Data Management) system, enabling a more efficient transfer of knowledge around the world. 

Ride Performance 

We operate 30 ride performance manufacturing facilities worldwide, of which nine facilities are located in North America, 15 in Europe, South America and India, and six in Asia Pacific. We operate two of the facilities through joint ventures in which we hold a controlling interest, one in Europe and another one in Asia. We operate seven engineering and technical facilities worldwide and share three other such facilities with our clean air operations. Of the seven ride performance engineering and technical facilities, two are located in North America, four in Europe, South America and India, and one in Asia Pacific. 

Within each of our ride performance manufacturing facilities, operations are organized by product (e.g., shocks, struts and vibration control products) and include computer numerically controlled and conventional machine centers; tube milling and drawn-over-mandrel manufacturing equipment; metal inert gas and resistance welding; powdered metal pressing and sintering; chrome plating; stamping; and assembly/test capabilities. Our manufacturing systems incorporate cell-based designs, allowing work-in-process to move through the operation with greater speed and flexibility. 

To strengthen our position as a Tier 1 OE module supplier, we have developed four of our ride performance manufacturing facilities into JIT assembly facilities located in Europe and India. 

In designing our shock absorbers and struts, we use advanced engineering and test capabilities to provide product reliability, endurance and performance. Our engineering capabilities feature advanced computer-aided design equipment and testing facilities. Our dedication to innovative solutions has led to such technological advances as: 

&#8226; 

Adaptive damping systems &#8212; adapt to the vehicle&#8217;s motion to better control undesirable vehicle motions; 

&#8226; 

Electronically adjustable suspensions &#8212; change suspension performance based on a variety of inputs such as steering, braking, vehicle height, and velocity; and 

&#8226; 

Air leveling systems &#8212; manually or automatically adjust the height of the vehicle. 

Conventional shock absorbers and struts generally develop an appropriate compromise between ride comfort and handling. Our innovative gas-charged shock absorbers and struts provide both ride comfort and vehicle control, resulting in improved handling, reduced vibration and a wider range of vehicle control. This technology can be found in our premium quality OESpectrum &#174; &#32;shock absorbers. We further enhanced this technology by adding the SafeTech &#8482; &#32;fluon banded piston, which improves shock absorber performance and durability. We introduced the Monroe &#174; &#32;Reflex &#174; &#32;shock absorber, which incorporates our Impact Sensor &#8482; &#32;device. This technology permits the shock absorber to automatically switch in a matter of milliseconds between firm and soft compression damping when the vehicle encounters rough road conditions, and thus maintaining better tire-to-road contact and improving handling and safety. We developed the Quick-Strut &#174; &#32;which simplifies and shortens the installation of aftermarket struts. This technology combines the spring and upper mount into a single, complete module, eliminating the need for special tools and skills required previously. We have also developed an innovative computerized electronic suspension system, which features dampers developed by Tenneco and electronic valves designed by &#214;hlins Racing AB. The Continuously Variable Semi Active ("CVSA") electronic suspension ride performance system is featured on Audi, Volvo, Ford, Volkswagen, BMW, and 

Mercedes Benz vehicles. To help make electronic suspension more affordable to a wider range of vehicles, we are designing an innovative, electronically-controlled DRiV&#8482; suspension system that features hydraulic valve technology we purchased in 2014 from Sturman Industries. 

Quality Management 

Tenneco's Quality Management System is an important part of product and process development and validation. Design engineers establish performance and reliability standards in the product's design stage, and use prototypes to confirm that the component/system can be manufactured to specifications. Quality Management is also integrated into the launch and manufacturing process, with team members at every stage of the work-in-process, ensuring finished goods are being fabricated to meet customers' requirements. 

The Quality Management System is detailed in Tenneco's Global Business Policy Manual. The Global Business Policy Manual complies with the ISO/TS 16949:2009, ISO 9001:2008 specifications, and customers' specific requirements. All of Tenneco's manufacturing facilities, where it has been determined that certification is necessary to serve the customer, or would provide an advantage in securing additional business, have successfully achieved the applicable standard's requirements. Each employee is expected to follow the relevant standards, policies, and procedures contained in the Global Business Policy Manual. 

Global Procurement Management 

Our direct and indirect material costs represent a significant component of our cost structure. To ensure that our material acquisition process provides both a local and global competitive advantage, in addition to meeting regional legislative requirements, we have designed globally integrated standard processes which are managed by global teams of commodity specialists. Each global commodity strategy is tailored to regional requirements while leveraging our global scale to deliver the most cost effective solutions at a local level. 

Business Strategy 

We strive to strengthen our global market position by designing, manufacturing, delivering and marketing technologically innovative clean air and ride performance products and systems for OEMs and the aftermarket. We work toward achieving a balanced mix of products, markets and customers by capitalizing on emerging trends, specific regional preferences and changing customer requirements. We target both mature and developing markets for light vehicles, commercial trucks, off-highway engines and other vehicle or engine applications. We further enhance our operations by focusing on operational excellence in all functional areas. 

The key components of our business strategy are described below: 

Develop and Commercialize Advanced Technologies 

We develop and commercialize technologies that allow us to expand into new, fast-growing market segments and serve our existing customers. By anticipating customer needs and preferences, we design advanced technologies that meet global market needs. For example, to meet the increasingly stringent emissions regulations being introduced around the world, we offer several technologies designed to reduce NOx emissions from passenger, commercial truck and off-highway vehicles. These technologies include an integrated Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system that incorporates our XNOx &#174; &#32;technology, electrical valves for diesel-powered vehicles with low-pressure exhaust gas recirculation systems, and diesel and gasoline particulate filters. We also offer a NOx absorber and a hydrocarbon lean NOx catalyst system, thermal management solutions, such as our T.R.U.E.-Clean &#174; &#32;active diesel particulate filter system and, through a consortium, thermoelectric generators that convert waste exhaust heat into electrical energy. 

We expect demand for our products to continue to rise over the next several years. Advanced aftertreatment exhaust systems are required to comply with emissions regulations that affect light, commercial truck and off-highway vehicles as well as locomotive, marine and stationary engines. In addition, vehicle manufacturers are offering greater comfort, handling and safety features with products such as electronic suspension and adjustable dampers. Our Continuously Variable Semi Active ("CVSA") electronic suspension shock absorbers, which we co-developed with &#214;hlins Racing AB, are now sold to Volvo, Audi, Mercedes, VW, BMW, and Ford, among others, and our engineered elastomers to manufacturers with unique requirements. Our newest electronic suspension product DRiV &#8482; &#32;is the first industry example of multiple digital valves coupled with smart switching for use in ride performance products that results in faster response, lighter weight, and reduced power consumption compared to existing analog products. 

We continue to focus on introducing highly engineered systems and complex assemblies and modules that provide value-added solutions to our customers and increase our content on vehicles. Having many of our engineering and manufacturing facilities integrated electronically, we believe, has helped our products continue to be selected for inclusion in top-selling vehicles. In addition, our just-in-time and in-line sequencing manufacturing processes and distribution capabilities have enabled us to be more responsive to our customers&#8217; needs. 

Penetrate Adjacent Market Segments 

We seek to penetrate a variety of adjacent sales opportunities and achieve growth in higher-margin businesses by applying our design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities. For example, we aggressively leverage our technology and engineering leadership in clean air and ride performance into adjacent sales opportunities for heavy-duty trucks, buses, agricultural equipment, construction machinery and other vehicles in other regions around the world. 

We design and launch clean air products for commercial truck and off-highway customers such as Caterpillar, for whom we are their global diesel clean air system integrator, John Deere, Navistar, Deutz, Daimler Trucks, Scania, Weichai Power, FAW Group and Kubota. 

We engineer and build modular NOx-reduction systems for large engines that meet standards of the International Maritime Organization, among others. In 2015, we received three Product Design Assessment (PDA) certificates from the American Bureau of Shipping, one of the world's leading ship-classification societies, and two Approved-In-Principle (AIP) certificates from DNV GL, another leading global classification society and recognized advisor of the maritime industry. 

Our revenues generated by our commercial truck, off-highway and other business sectors were 15 percent of our total annual OE revenues in both 2015 and 2014. 

Expand and Adjust Manufacturing Footprint and Engineering Capabilities 

We continue to expand and adjust our global footprint to serve OE and aftermarket customers, building our capabilities to engineer and produce cost competitively cutting-edge products around the world. After adding to our footprint in China, Japan and Thailand from 2011 to 2012, we opened our clean air manufacturing facility in Chakan, India located close to key customers in the Pune region in 2013. In 2014, we opened our clean air research and development facility in Kunshan, China to enhance our engineering capabilities and develop China-specific solutions. In 2015, we opened new facilities in Jeffersonville, Indiana, Sanand, India, Stanowice, Poland and Suzhou, China. We also expanded our manufacturing operations in Celaya, Mexico that produce shock absorbers and other ride performance products for light vehicles and commercial trucks and in Tredegar, U.K. to support growth on significant incremental new business. In addition, we built out our engineering capabilities in Poland, as well as the expansion of our testing capabilities in Germany. 

Besides expanding our manufacturing footprint and engineering capabilities to serve new customers or markets, we are re-aligning our production, supply chain and other operational functions to ensure standardization, remove redundancies, reduce transit costs, leverage economies of scale, and optimize manufacturing productivity. 

Maintain Our Aftermarket Leadership 

We manufacture, market and sell leading, brand-name products to a diversified and global aftermarket customer base. Two of the most recognized brand-name products in the automotive parts industry are our Monroe &#174; &#32;ride performance products and Walker &#174; &#32;clean air products, which have been offered to consumers since the 1930s. We believe our brand equity in the aftermarket is a key asset especially as customers consolidate and distribution channels converge. 

We provide value differentiation by creating product extensions bearing our various brands. For example, we offer Monroe &#174; &#32;Reflex &#174; &#32;and Monroe &#174; &#32;OESpectrum &#174; &#32;shock absorbers, Walker &#174; &#32;Quiet-Flow &#174; &#32;mufflers, Rancho &#174; &#32;ride performance products, DynoMax &#174; &#32;exhaust products and Walker Ultra &#174; &#32;catalytic converters, and in Europe, Walker and Aluminox Pro &#8482; &#32;mufflers. Further, we market Monroe &#174; &#32;Springs and Monro-Magnum &#174; &#32;(bus and truck shock line) in Europe and continue to grow our Monroe &#174; &#32;Brake pads in North America. We continue to explore other opportunities for developing new product lines that will be marketed under our existing, well-known brands. 

We strive to gain additional market share in the aftermarket business by adding new product offerings and increasing our market coverage of existing brands and products. For one, we offer an innovative ride performance product, the Quick-Strut &#174; , that combines the spring and the upper mount into a single, complete module and simplifies and shortens the installation process, eliminating the need for the special tools and skills required previously. Additionally, we find ways to benefit from the consolidation of, and the regional expansion by, our customers and gain business from our competitors given our strength and understanding in the markets and channels we do business in. 

Our success in the aftermarket strengthens our competitive position with OEMs, and vice versa. We gain timely market and product knowledge that can be used to modify and enhance our offerings for greater customer acceptance. We also can readily introduce aftermarket products by leveraging our experience in the OE market. An example of such is our suite of manifold converters and diesel particulate filters which were first sold in the OE market and then tailored for the aftermarket. 

Execute Focused Transactions 

We have successfully identified and capitalized on acquisitions, alliances and divestitures to achieve strategic growth and alignment. Through these transactions, we have (1) expanded our product portfolio with complementary technologies; (2) realized 

incremental business from existing customers; (3) gained access to new customers; (4) achieved leadership positions in geographic regions outside North America; and (5) re-focused on areas that will contribute to our profitable growth. 

We positioned ourselves as a leading exhaust supplier in the rapidly growing Asian region through our operations in China, India and Thailand. We increased our investment from 80 percent to 100 percent in Tenneco Tongtai Exhaust Company Limited (TTEC) located in Dalian in the fourth quarter of 2013. 

We have a licensing agreement for T.R.U.E.-Clean &#174; , an exhaust aftertreatment technology used for automatic and active regeneration of Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs), with Woodward Governor Company. This is an example of a technology which complements our array of existing clean air products, allowing us to provide integrated exhaust aftertreatment systems to commercial truck, off-highway and other vehicle manufacturers. 

In 2012, we signed an exclusive joint development agreement with Cormetech Inc., a joint equity company of Corning Inc. and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd, to design ultra-large diameter SCR catalysts for marine, locomotive and certain stationary applications. Also in 2012, we signed a nonexclusive Joint Development and Licensing Agreement with Amminex for the design and development of Solid SCR &#8482; systems. 

In February 2014, we secured the exclusive rights to the digital valve technology used in our DRiV &#8482; suspension systems from Sturman Industries, Inc. DRiV &#8482; systems feature electronically controlled dampers with hydraulic valves that can be used in a variety of vehicle damping applications. 

In July 2015, we announced our intention to discontinue our Marzocchi motorcycle fork suspension product line and our mountain bike suspension product line, and liquidate our Marzocchi operations. In November 2015, we closed on the sale of certain assets related to our Marzocchi mountain bike suspension product line to the affiliates of Fox Factory Holding Corp.; and in December 2015, we closed on the sale of the Marzocchi motorcycle fork product line to an Italian company, VRM S.p.A. 

We intend to continue to pursue strategic alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions and other transactions that complement or enhance our existing products, technology, systems development efforts, customer base and/or global presence. We will align with companies that have proven products, proprietary technology, advanced research capabilities, broad geographic reach, and/or strong market positions to further strengthen our product leadership, technology position, global reach and customer relationships. 

Adapt Cost Structure to Economic Realities 

We aggressively respond to difficult economic environments, aligning our operations to any resulting reductions in production levels and replacement demand and executing comprehensive restructuring and cost-reduction initiatives. For example, on January 31, 2013, we announced our intent to reduce structural costs in Europe by approximately $60 million &#32; annually. We still expect to reach our target annual savings rate in 2016, however the recent dramatic changes in exchange rates will likely have an impact on the actual savings achieved when translated from Euros to U.S. dollars. We incurred $78 million in restructuring and related costs in 2013, of which $69 million was related to this initiative including $3 million for non-cash asset write downs. In 2014, we incurred $49 million in restructuring and related costs, of which $31 million was related to this initiative including $3 million for non-cash asset write downs. In 2015, we incurred $63 million in restructuring and related costs, of which $22 million was related to this initiative. While we are nearing the completion of this initiative, we expect to incur additional restructuring and related costs in 2016 due to certain ongoing matters. For example, we closed a plant in Gijon Spain in 2013, but subsequently re-opened it in July 2014 with about half of its prior workforce after the employees' works council successfully filed suit challenging the closure decision. Pursuant to an agreement we entered into with employee representatives, we are currently engaged in a sale process to identify potential purchasers for the facility and intend to continue operating it until a complete transfer of ownership takes place. In November 2015, we closed on the sale of certain assets related to our Marzocchi mountain bike suspension product line to the affiliates of Fox Factory Holding Corp.; and in December 2015, we closed on the sale of the Marzocchi motorcycle fork product line to an Italian company, VRM S.p.A. We recorded charges of $29 million in 2015 related to severance and other employee related costs, asset write-downs and other expenses related to the closure. 

Strengthen Operational Excellence 

We will continue to focus on operational excellence by optimizing our manufacturing footprint, enhancing our Six Sigma processes and Lean productivity tools, developing further our engineering capabilities, managing the complexities of our global supply chain to realize purchasing economies of scale while satisfying diverse and global requirements, and supporting our businesses with robust information technology systems. We will make investments in our operations and infrastructure as required to achieve our strategic goals. We will be mindful of the changing market conditions that might necessitate adjustments to our resources and manufacturing capacity around the world. We will remain committed to protecting the environment as well as the health and safety of our employees. 

Environmental Matters 

We estimate that we and our subsidiaries will make expenditures for plant, property and equipment for environmental matters of approximately $6 million in 2016 and $2 million in 2017. 

For additional information regarding environmental matters, see Item 3, &#8220;Legal Proceedings,&#8221; Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; and Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements of Tenneco Inc. included in Item 8. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 30,000 employees of whom approximately 45 percent were covered by collective bargaining agreements. European works councils cover 16 percent of our total employees, a majority of whom are also included under collective bargaining agreements. Several of our existing labor agreements in Mexico and the United States are scheduled for renegotiation in 2016. In addition, agreements covering plants in Argentina, Brazil and Thailand are expiring in 2016. We regard our employee relations as satisfactory. 

Other 

The principal raw material that we use is steel. We obtain steel from a number of sources pursuant to various contractual and other arrangements. We believe that an adequate supply of steel can presently be obtained from a number of different domestic and foreign suppliers. We address price increases by evaluating alternative materials and processes, reviewing material substitution opportunities, increasing component and assembly to best cost countries, as well as strategically pursuing regional and global purchasing strategies for specific commodities, and aggressively negotiating with our customers to allow us to recover these higher costs from them. 

We hold a number of domestic and foreign patents and trademarks relating to our products and businesses. We manufacture and distribute our aftermarket products primarily under the Walker &#174; &#32;and Monroe &#174; &#32;brand names, which are well-recognized in the marketplace and are registered trademarks. We also market certain of our clean air products to OE manufacturers under the names Solid SCR &#8482; &#32;and XNOx &#174; &#32;. The patents, trademarks and other intellectual property owned by or licensed to us are important in the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of our products.
