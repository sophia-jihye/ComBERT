Corporate History and Overview 

&#160; 

SmartMetric, Inc. (&#8220;SmartMetric&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated pursuant to the laws of Nevada on December 18, 2002. SmartMetric is a development stage company engaged in the technology industry. SmartMetric has an issued patent covering technology that involves connection to networks using data cards (smart cards and EMV cards). SmartMetric&#8217;s main products are a fingerprint sensor activated payments card and security card with a finger sensor and fully functional fingerprint reader embedded inside the card. The cards with have a rechargeable battery allowing for portable biometric identification and card activation. This card is referred to as a biometric card or the SmartMetric Biometric Card.

&#160;

On September 14, 2004, C. Hendrick received a United States patent, U.S. Patent No. 6,792,464 (the &#8220;&#8217;464 Patent&#8221;) with regard to the use of the biometric card. C Hendrick transferred the &#8216;464 Patent, to Applied Cryptography, Inc., a Nevada corporation, owned by C. Hendrick, in June 2004 (&#8220;ACI&#8221;). On December 11, 2009, the Company entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement (&#8220;Assignment Agreement&#8221;) with ACI pursuant to which ACI assigned all or its rights, title and interest to the &#8216;464 Patent to the Company in exchange for 200,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s series B preferred stock. In connection with the Assignment Agreement, on December 11, 2009, the Company and ACI entered into an option agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to grant ACI an option to purchase the &#8216;464 Patent from the Company for 100,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s series B preferred stock, only in the event that Company fails to generate at least $1,000,000 in gross revenues attributable to the Patent at the conclusion of 24 months from the date of Assignment Agreement. As the option has expired the Company owns the &#8216;464 Patent outright.

&#160;

SmartMetric has no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on SmartMetric's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

&#160;

The SmartMetric Biometric Technology And Products 

&#160; 

SmartMetric's founder, C. Hendrick is the originator and inventor of various miniature biometric activated devices including the SmartMetric biometric fingerprint activated payments card with an embedded fully functional fingerprint reader in side the card the size and thickness of a standard credit card. The SmartMetric biometric payments card provides for high level security for credit and debit cards by adding biometric authentication and activation to the new EMV chip cards now in use around the World. More than 4.8 Billion EMV chip debit and credit cards are now in use globally. The SmartMetric biometric payments card has been manufactured to be totally interoperable with the EMV chip card readers and banking infrastructure. Using the advanced electronic miniaturization by SmartMetric to make it&#8217;s biometric credit/debit cards the company has also turned its attention to creating a multi-functional biometric building access control and logical network access card. SmartMetric has also turned its attention to creating a biometric health insurance card with memory for storing a persons medical files as well as assisting in fighting medical fraud by using the card to provide in-card biometric identity validation.

&#160;

SmartMetric has developed its rechargeable battery powered fingerprint reader that is of a scale that fits &#34;inside&#34; a standard credit or debit card. The cardholder has stored inside the card his or her fingerprint. To activate the card the person swipes the fingerprint sensor, the sensor is connected to an internal microprocessor that manages the fingerprint sensor fingerprint image capture and comparison matching with the pre-stored fingerprint of the cardholder held in the internal electronic memory of the card. The card has a surface mounted EMV chip as found on EMV banking chip cards that is activated or turned on only after a card holders fingerprint has been scanned and verified using the SmartMetric miniature &#34;in-card&#34; biometric scanner.

&#160;

There are over 4.8 billion EMV chip cards used by banks around the world for credit cards, ATM cards and debit cards. SmartMetric sees this existing user base as a natural market for its advanced security biometric activated card technology. SmartMetric plans to market its in-card biometric solution as a replacement to the less secure password or PIN used in current cards to card issuing banks and financial institutions.

&#160;

SmartMetric has completed development of its biometric card. The company is now presenting its card to major card issuing banks throughout the world. Following feedback from potential Bank customers, SmartMetric has incorporated new changes into its card including an indicator light as well as an extended battery life. On April 4 th 2016, SmartMetric officially launched its card in Orlando, Florida, at the Smart Card Alliance Payments Forum exhibition and conference. Much interest was shown by card issuing banks generating sales and marketing leads that the company is following through with.

&#160;

4&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

SmartMetric is currently engaging sales representatives who are now actively promoting the SmartMetric biometric chip card to banks and card issuers throughout Europe, the United Kingdom, Asia and North America. After the completion of payments network testing and internal marketing trials by Banks and Financial Institutions (card issuers) SmartMetric will then expect sales revenue to begin. 

&#160;

Card issuers may take from 3 months up to 12 months of internal trials and test marketing prior to placing orders of consequence with SmartMetric. While SmartMetric had created a working card prior to this year, refinements to the cards hardware and embedded software were undertaken prior to the official product launch in April, 2016. Further enhancements have been made following the input of some significant card issuing Banks..

&#160;

The SmartMetric biometric payments card, with a built-in rechargeable battery and EMV banking industry contact interface chip (which activates following a fingerprint match on the card), is the first of its kind in the world.

&#160;

THE SMARTMETRIC BIOMETRIC IN-CARD FINGERPRINT READER PAYMENTS CARD 

&#160; 

&#160;

The SmartMetric biometric fingerprint activated card has several functions:

&#160;

&#9679; The card holders fingerprint is stored inside the card and NOT on a central computer; &#160;

&#9679; Interoperable with existing smart card, EMV ATM and Retail Point Of Sale Machines; &#160;

&#9679; The fingerprint sensor facilitates instant authorization and card user verification; &#160;

&#9679; Self-powered with its own internal rechargeable battery to allow for fingerprint activation prior to insertion into a card reading device such as an ATM or retail card reading machine; &#160;

&#9679; In card biometric measurement storage safeguards personal information; &#160;

&#9679; In card biometric storage permits access, identity and transaction control verification; &#160;

&#9679; Instant identity verification will be more secure than central online or electronic wallet systems since such information on the SmartMetric Card is contained in the card and not in a centralized database or an always connected phone device. The SmartMetric Biometric fingerprint activated payments card is a credit card size plastic card. On the card&#8217;s surface are two components. The first is a standard Smartcard chip that is a standard interface that connects to universal serial bus (USB) computer smartcard readers, teller machine (ATM) machines and smartcard (POS) point-of-sale machines in retail outlets. The second component is a sensor that protrudes through the card&#8217;s surface. This sensor is connected to a sophisticated miniature circuit board that allows the sensor to read a person&#8217;s fingerprint and match it with the user&#8217;s pre-stored fingerprint encrypted and resident inside the circuit board. After a match between the users fingerprint and the pre-stored users fingerprint stored inside the card, the internal card processor unlocks and activates the surface mounted SmartCard Chip. Forms of the SmartMetric fingerprint activated biometric card involve insertion within proximity to a wireless proximity physical reader or to a physical data card reader requiring physical insertion into the card reader. The challenge SmartMetric had to overcome was having a truly portable identification credential that incorporated biometrics and yet was the standard size of an employee ID card, Credit Card or driver&#8217;s license. As it stood, standard biometric fingerprint scanners were too large to fit inside a credit card sized card and none were portable having the to be attached to a computer that powered the scanning process thereby not allowing for portability. In order to achieve the goal of biometric authentication with portability in the form factor to fit inside a user&#8217;s wallet or purse and work across both computer and banking platforms, SmartMetric had to achieve incredible reductions in the size of electronics and develop specialized mass manufacturing techniques. &#160;

5&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The SmartMetric Biometric Card contains active and passive components mounted onto a paper-thin circuit board. Reducing a powerful processor to a very thin component along with many other complex computer components including memory chips. Then mounting them on the super thin board. This has required significant innovations in electronic manufacturing processes.

&#160;

The SmartMetric biometric card is also a leading edge solution in the identity and access control market. Unlike a picture-based identification system, the SmartMetric biometric card has been designed to operate exclusively with the registered user. And unlike biometric security systems where the biometric information is stored at a central location, the Company believes that security is significantly increased during the verification process since the biometric information is embedded in the card itself, in a memory chip protected by encryption and no data is travelling over a network. The built-in fingerprint scanner is designed to activate the card. Without a match with the encrypted fingerprint already stored in the card, the SmartMetric Biometric Datacard will not operate.

&#160;

SmartMetric, Inc. sees a substantial market for its biometric fingerprint activated credit cards to replace the use of PIN numbers used in current Bank issued EMV (Smartcards) around the World. There are more than 4.8 billion bank issued EMV Credit and ATM Cards in the world. These cards have a chip that stores credit card information but still rely on a user entered PIN or signature at the ATM or Point Of Sale machine to verify the Card user. The reliance on a PIN for these new kinds of Credit &#38; ATM Cards still leaves them vulnerable to hackers because of the use of PIN&#8217;s and signatures. Replacing the PIN and/or signature for these cards with a person&#8217;s fingerprint to activate the card provides the next level of security for the 4.8 Billion issued chip cards around the World.

&#160; &#160;

In addition to the Financial Services Sector, the Company believes its SmartMetric Biometric Card may be used for a variety of security applications such as employee identity, building access and security control, computer network access, driver&#8217;s licenses, passports, welfare payments, health insurance, portable electronic medical records and check cashing identity verification, etc. Additionally, the Biometric Datacard contains a powerful on-card processor and varying degrees of encrypted memory, enabling the Biometric Card to not only store the a card holders fingerprint but also maintain a database capable of storing information such as medical records, financial or banking records or human resource data.

&#160;

As an online purchasing/credit card, the biometric payments card can help protect against identity theft and related fraudulent crimes that consumers can be exposed to when making purchases over the Internet. Unlike conventional credit cards, which require a consumer to type and deliver sensitive information over the Internet in order to make a purchase, the biometric card is designed to be inserted into a reader that is connected to the USB port of a computer. Using a USB port adapter any customer purchasing information can then only be released from the card when the owner&#8217;s finger print unlocks the card. The consumer&#8217;s information then travels across the Internet encrypted, minimizing exposure to interception by hackers and identity thieves.

&#160;

SmartMetric believes that its biometric card, by way of containing information unique to the individual user, protected by the card user&#8217;s biometrics, will be useless in the hands of others. Unlike a picture-based identification system, the SmartMetric biometric card has been designed to operate exclusively with the registered user. The fingerprint sensor built into the card has been designed to activate the card. Without a match with the encrypted fingerprint already stored on the card, the biometric Card will not operate.

&#160;

The SmartMetric access control and identity biometric card is a card that authorized persons will carry with them and activate to obtain access. Such activation will take place by placing a finger on a fingerprint sensor on the surface of the card. The SmartMetric biometric cards are designed to be read by both contact and contactless card acceptor devices. For contact card acceptor devices, the device must touch a chip mounted on the surface of the biometric card. This contact allows the card to transmit data to the reading device. For contactless acceptor devices, a radio frequency signal will be sent from the card to a radio frequency signal receiver in the acceptor device. In both types of card reading devices, the activation signal is sent only when there has been a positive match of the persons fingerprint by the cards fingerprint sensor. The card reader devices are standard smartcard readers available from a variety of third parties.

&#160;

The memory and computational capacities of the biometric card are used to store a user's fingerprint(s). The computational capacity is used to process a digitized image from the fingerprint sensor to confirm a match (or no match) with the fingerprint template. Additional computational processes such as increased cryptography will depend on the requirements of specific customers.

&#160;

6&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

IN CARD FINGERPRINT MATCHING AND VERIFICATION

&#160;

&#160;

The SmartMetric Biometric card incorporates a rechargeable, lithium polymer battery. This battery is rechargeable, very thin and has been designed by SmartMetric to fit inside the SmartMetric fingerprint Credit Card sized card. This battery is manufactured by a third party to SmartMetric&#8217;s specifications and is unaffiliated with the Company. This battery is embedded inside the card.

&#160;

Other components needed for manufacture of the SmartMetric Biometric Card include, but are not limited to, sensors, microchips, memory chips and processor chips. The sources and availability of these materials are numerous and readily available, and should not affect the ability of SmartMetric to meet future demand. However, SmartMetric does re-engineer a number of important components at silicon level to achieve the component size required to fit inside a Credit Card. Both the supply of memory and processors in silicon wafers may be interrupted at any time based on global silicon supply/demand issues and the re-engineering of silicon by SmartMetric may also cause end component supply problems from time to time which may affect production and sale of the Cards.

&#160;

The biometric card has been designed to offer the option of a built-in radio frequency transmitter for contactless long range access and identity verification. Another version of the card incorporates a short range RFID contactless chip that is also turned off and on using the card users fingerprint verification on the Card.

&#160;

The thinness form factor of many of the components including the processor itself being an unpackaged wafer of silicon has also resulted in the Company having to develop its own process for mass electronic assembly. The Company was also challenged in the process of encapsulating the electronics in plastic creating the credit card sized biometric fingerprint activated card.

&#160;

Standard credit card manufacturing utilizes machines that require high pressure and high temperature in fusing top and bottom sheets of plastic together thereby encasing any electronics inside the card. Given the complexity of the card&#8217;s electronics and vulnerability to an assembly process involving high heat and high pressure, damage to the electronic circuitry was a major challenge for the Company to overcome. Research and development activities of the Company allowed the Company to achieve this ability through a combination of adjusting the pressure and heat required using special polymers together with a trade secret process that protects the silicon that is mounted directly onto the internal electronics circuit board.

&#160;

T he Security Technology Industry 

&#160; 

SmartMetric Biometric Multi-Function Security Card 

&#160; 

SmartMetric has developed a multi-function logical and physical access security card this size and thickness of a standard credit card. Utalizing the small size breaktrhoughs by the company in its biometric payments card development SmartMetric has successfully developed a biometric security card that can easily fit inside a person&#8217;s wallet.

&#160;

As with the biometric payments card, the SmartMetric security card has an internal rechargeable battery that is used to power the cards internal processor used in the biometric fingerprint scan. All functions and operations of the card are subject to a valid fingerprint scan and match of the card user.

&#160;

The main features of the SmartMetric biometric security card are:

&#160;

1. Logical access smartcard card chip for insertion into a card reader attached to a computer or network 2. RFID transceiver for physical access i.e. doorways, elevators, etc. 3. Validation indicator light that glows green immediately following a fingerprint validation 4. Rechargeable battery to power the card 5. Size and thickness of a credit card 6. Changeable security code on reverse of card for additional log on security &#160; 

7&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Biometrics 

&#160; 

Biometric technologies identify users by electronically capturing a specific biological or behavioral characteristic of that individual, such as a fingerprint or voice or facial feature, and creating a unique digital identifier from that characteristic. Because this process relies on largely unalterable human characteristics, positive identification can be achieved independent of any information possessed by the individual seeking authorization.

&#160;

The process of identity authentication typically requires that a person present for comparison with one or more of the following factors:

&#160;

&#8226; Something known such as a password, PIN or mother's maiden name; &#8226; Something carried such as a token, card, or key; or &#8226; something physical such as fingerprint, voice pattern, signature motion, facial shape or other biological or behavioral characteristic.

&#160;

Comparison of biological and behavioral characteristics has historically been the most reliable and accurate of the three factors, but has also been the most difficult and costly to implement into a single product that can automatically verify the identity of a user accessing a computer network or the Internet. However, recent advances in biometric collection technologies (both biometric hardware products and their associated processing software) have increased the speed and accuracy and reduced the cost of implementing biometrics in commercial environments. Management believes that individuals, website operators, government organizations, and businesses will increasingly use this method of identity authentication.

&#160;

Biometrics refers to the automatic identification of a person based on his/her physiological or behavioral characteristics. This method of identification is preferred over traditional methods involving passwords and personal identification numbers (&#34;PINs&#34;) for various reasons: (i) the person to be identified is required to be physically present at the point of identification to be identification; (ii) identification based on biometric techniques obviates the need to remember a password or carry a token. By replacing PINs, biometric techniques can potentially prevent unauthorized access to or fraudulent use of cellular phones, Biometric cards, desktop PCs, workstations and computer networks. It can be used during transactions conducted via telephone and Internet (e-commerce and e- banking). In automobiles, biometrics could replace keys-less entry devices. The SmartMetric fingerprint activated Credit Card that has the fingerprint encased inside the Credit Card has been developed to replace the less secure PIN&#8217;s for Credit and Debit Cards.

&#160;

PINs and passwords may be forgotten, may be hacked and token-based methods of identification, e.g., passports and driver's licenses may be forged, stolen or lost. Various types of biometric systems are being used for real-time identification, with the most popular based on facial recognition and fingerprint matching. Other biometric systems utilize iris and retinal scanning, speech, facial thermograms and hand geometry. Of the biometric options available to work with a Credit or Debit Card, fingerprint scanning is the only biometric methodology that has been successfully reduced in size to fit inside such cards.

&#160;

A biometric system is essentially a pattern recognition system, which makes a personal identification by determining the authenticity of a specific physiological or behavioral characteristic possessed by the user. An important issue in designing a practical system is to determine how an individual is identified.

&#160;

There are two different ways to resolve a person's identity; verification and identification. Verification (Am I whom I claim I am?) involves confirming or denying a person's claimed identity. In identification, one has to establish a person's identity (Who am I?).

&#160;

As stated above, the SmartMetric fingerprint biometric card has been designed as a credit-card sized card embedded with an integrated circuit, contact chip and biometric fingerprint sensor. The SmartMetric card has been designed to provide not only memory capacity, but also computational capability along with secure non-refutable identification of the user. We believe that the self-containment of SmartMetric's card makes it substantially resistant to attack, as it will not need to depend upon vulnerable external resources. Because of this characteristic, we expect that the SmartMetric biometric card may be used in different applications, which require strong security protection and authentication.

&#160;

The physical structure of a card is specified by the International Standards Organization (&#34;ISO&#34;). Generally, it is made up of three elements. The plastic card is the most basic one and has the dimensions of 85.60mm x 53.98 x 0.80mm, with an electronic circuit board inlay and an contact chip that are embedded in the card.

&#160;

8&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The SmartMetric card has been designed so that it conforms to ISO standards. The electronic circuit inlay is a part of, and not distinct from, the biometric card.

&#160;

The communication line between the card and ATM&#8217;s and other standard Smart Card reading devices is bi-directional serial transmission, which conforms to ISO standards. Card commands and input data are sent to the chip that responds with status words and output data upon the receipt of these commands and data. Information is sent in half duplex mode (transmission of data is in one direction at a time). This protocol, together with the restriction of the bit rate, is designed to prevent data attack on the card. Other data protection systems are utilized inside the card including advanced encryption.

&#160;

In general, the size, the thickness and bend requirements for the biometric card were designed to protect the card from being spoiled physically.

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

We plan to market and sell our product to commercial and banking interests in the private sector and governmental agencies.

&#160;

The company is now actively marketing its biometric EMV chip card to Banks and Financial Institutions within the United States and Europe. The company also has sales representation in Australia and sales and marketing discussions under way with Financial Institutions in the Far East and Asia.

&#160;

On April 4 th 2016 SmartMetric officially launched its biometric EMV chip card product at the Smart Card Alliance Payments Forum in Orlando, Florida. The company had exhibition space in the main exhibition hall displaying and showing its biometric card. Discussions and contacts were made with some major card issuers at this conference leading to ongoing sales and marketing discussions.

&#160;

The company will be attending further industry conferences and exhibitions as part of its ongoing sales and marketing efforts

&#160;

There are more than 4.8 Billion EMV chip cards in use by Banks and Financial Institutions around the world according the standards body EMVco. EMV chip cards are now being rolled out by major Banks within the United States. Because the SmartMetric, Biometric EMV chip card uses the banking industry EMV chip it is designed to be fully operable with all ATM and Point Of Sale chip card readers in the United States and throughout the World.

&#160;

Manufacturing 

&#160;

The Company contracts outside silicon and component fabrication plants to manufacture specific components to SmartMetric&#8217;s specifications. Creation of the sub-micro circuit boards are outsourced, assembly of components on the board are also outsourced. The company may also establish other card manufacturing centers at different locations as and when required. Separate manufacturing centers have been engaged in order to make, assemble and complete the finished SmartMetric biometric EMV chip card. Current production capacity is approximately 250,000 cards per week and this can be substantially increased in co-ordination with our engaged manufacturing centers.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

There are currently no governmental regulations, which have any bearing on the raw materials or the manufacturing of our payments card products. United States Federal Departments such as the Department Of Defense have rules and regulations concerning security features of smart cards used as identity or access cards. These regulations stipulate a specific licensing and testing protocol for such crds. 

&#160;

In some instances Smartcard's are subject to Government export controls under the category of munitions. 

&#160;

Banking Industry Self Regulation 

&#160;

The EMV chip used in chip cards are subject to licensing and testing by the banking controlled body called EMVco. EMVco is an acronym standing for Europay, MasterCard and Visa. These international payments card networks where the founding parties of EMVco. 

&#160;

Individual payments networks such as Visa, Mastercard, Europay, American Express, Union Pay Dinners and JCB all have their own individual licensing and testing standards and processes. SmartMetric is dealing with one of these significant global payments networks for both licensing, testing and approval.

&#160;

10&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

EMV Standards 

&#160;

SmartMetric&#8217;s biometric Cards used for credit and debit cards, conform to International EMV and credit card ISO standards, ensuring market acceptance and growth worldwide. EMV format chip cards have become the standard for worldwide financial transactions for Credit Cards, ATM Cards and Debit Cards with more than 4.8 billion cards already in circulation. As a more secure weapon in the multi-billion dollar war against credit card fraud, EMV Smartcards are significantly more secure than cards that rely only on magnetic stripe data, which is easily spoofed or counterfeited. A transaction-unique digital seal or signature in the EMV card&#8217;s chip proves its authenticity, even in an offline environment, and prevents criminals from assigning fraudulent payment cards purchases to unsuspecting legitimate cardholders. However even the higher level of security that the EMV SmartCard &#8211; ATM or Credit Card, is still subject to hackers attacking system weaknesses. 

&#160;

SmartMetric will target the adoption of its biometric technology to card issuing banks. There are now more than 4.8 Billion Cards issued by Banks around the World. The SmartMetric biometric EMC chip card can be used to secure online payment transactions and protect cardholders, merchants and issuers against fraud through a fingerprint activated CVV number that is only displayed following an on card biometric fingerprint match.

&#160;

&#168; Supports enhanced cardholder verification methods &#160;

&#168; Stores considerably more information than magnetic stripe cards &#160;

&#168; EMV Cryptographic Standard &#160;

The EMV standards are a series of specifications and testing procedures for EMV chip payment cards and card accepting devices, such as point of sale (POS) terminals and ATMs. A primary goal of the EMV standards, and EMVCo as an organization, is to help facilitate the global interoperability and compatibility of chip-based payment cards and payment terminals.

&#160;

Thanks to the EMV standards, SmartMetric and other chip card issuers have a uniform standard to help them ensure that the payment cards they give their cardholders will work in EMV compliant acceptance infrastructures anywhere in the world. Merchants and banks can invest in chip card acceptance infrastructures knowing EMV compliant cards have been developed based on uniform standards. Cardholders can feel more confident knowing the security advantages of EMV will help protect them against the risk of fraud anywhere EMV is implemented. 

&#160; 

Payments Network Licensing, Testing and Approvals 

&#160;

SmartMetric has received licensing from a global payments network. It is proceeding with product testing and final approvals for its card to work on its global networks thereby assuring interoperability and function of the SmartMetic card with Point Of Sale readers and ATM&#8217;s around the world.

&#160;

No assurances can be given regarding the timing and ultimate approvals as these are given by the global payments network. Having stated that the EMV chip used by SmartMetric is now licensed and approved along with the EMV software. Card type testing is outstanding and yet to be completed

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Our research and development program is focused on ongoing development of new products built on our existing biometric card. We continue to refine our technology and develop further improvements to our biometric card products. We have finalized our first biometric EMV payments card product. We have also concluded the design and electronic engineering for our soon-to-be released multi-function security and access control biometric cards. This card is scheduled for production commencement, October 2016. Research and development will continue as the Company continues to innovate and develop new biometric card based products. Future biometric card based products the company is now working on include but are not limited to; (a) health insurance card with stored in card medical records (b) national identity card (c) drivers licenses. 

&#160;

The company has developed and is continuing to develop its own embedded systems and application software that works with the SmartMetric Biometric Card. This development software and systems and ongoing electronic design and development requires the company to continue to expend time and financial resources on significant software development. Contractors engaged by and working for SmartMetric in Tel Aviv, Israel and Buenos Aires, Argentina are undertaking this development. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

SmartMetric is a company involved in portable smart card built-in-card biometric identity verification. The company knows of no other company that has created the same kind of biometric card having an inbuilt fingerprint scanner, an inbuilt rechargeable battery, inbuilt reader for fingerprint matching and identity verification along with fingerprint match activated EMV banking chip inside.

&#160;

While these companies are the leading suppliers of the estimated more than 3.4 billion EMV SmartCard&#8217;s issued by banks around the world, they all issue cards that rely upon PIN or signature user verification. None supply cards that have inbuilt fingerprint scanners that use the cards internal biometric reader to activate the cards EMV chip.
