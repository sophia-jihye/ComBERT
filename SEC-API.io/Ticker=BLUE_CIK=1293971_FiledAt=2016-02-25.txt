 Item 1. Business 

Overview 

We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company committed to developing potentially transformative gene therapies for severe genetic and rare diseases and in the field of T cell-based immunotherapy. With our lentiviral-based gene therapies, T cell immunotherapy expertise and gene editing capabilities, we have built an integrated product platform with broad potential application in severe genetic and rare diseases and in oncology. We believe that gene therapy has the potential to change the way these patients are treated by correcting the underlying genetic defect that is the cause of their disease, rather than offering treatments that only address their symptoms. Our gene therapy clinical programs include our LentiGlobin &#174; product candidate to treat transfusion-dependent &#946;-thalassemia, or TDT, which we previously referred to as &#946;-thalassemia major, and severe sickle cell disease, or severe SCD, and our Lenti-D &#8482; product candidate to treat cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, or CALD, a rare hereditary neurological disorder that we previously referred to as childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, as patients affected with this disorder are often young boys. Our oncology programs are built upon our leadership in lentiviral gene delivery and T cell engineering, with a focus on developing novel T cell-based immunotherapies, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and T cell receptor (TCR) T cell therapies. Our lead oncology program, bb2121, is a CAR T cell product candidate targeting B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, in multiple myeloma. We also have discovery research programs utilizing megaTALs/homing endonuclease gene editing technologies with the potential for use across our pipeline.

We are conducting three clinical studies of our LentiGlobin product candidate in a variety of rare, hereditary blood disorders that often lead to severe anemia and shortened lifespans: a global Phase I/II study, called the Northstar Study, for the treatment of TDT; a single-center Phase I/II study in France (HGB-205) for the treatment of TDT and severe SCD; and a Phase I study in the United States (HGB-206) for the treatment of severe SCD. Our LentiGlobin product candidate has been granted Orphan Drug status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for the treatment of both &#946;-thalassemia and SCD. Our LentiGlobin product candidate was granted Fast-Track designation by the FDA for the treatment of &#946;-thalassemia major in January 2013 and for the treatment of certain patients with severe SCD in May 2014. In January 2015, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to our LentiGlobin product candidate for the treatment of transfusion-dependent patients with &#946;-thalassemia major.

We are conducting a Phase II/III clinical study, called the Starbeam Study, of our Lenti-D product candidate, to evaluate its safety and efficacy in pediatric and adolescent subjects with CALD. We are also conducting an observational study of subjects with CALD treated by allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplant (ALD-103). Our Lenti-D product candidate has been granted Orphan Drug status by the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of adrenoleukodystrophy. 

In February 2016, we initiated a Phase I clinical study in the United States (CRB-401) of our bb2121 product candidate for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. bb2121 is the lead CAR T cell-based immunotherapy product candidate from our collaboration with Celgene Corporation, or Celgene. The collaboration has focused on applying gene therapy technology to genetically modify a patient&#8217;s own T cells to target and destroy cancer cells. T cells modified to express a CAR have been shown by academic and corporate researchers to have beneficial effects in human clinical trials for patients with a variety of lymphomas. We have licensed to Celgene the right to develop and commercialize our bb2121 product candidate following the completion of the ongoing Phase I clinical study, and we may exercise our option to co-develop and co-promote this product candidate. 

In June 2014, we acquired Precision Genome Engineering, Inc., or Pregenen, a privately-held biotechnology company headquartered in Seattle, Washington. Through the acquisition, we obtained rights to Pregenen&#8217;s gene editing technology platform and cell signaling technology, and have integrated these technologies and research team and expanded our related discovery research efforts. We are focused on utilizing homing endonuclease and megaTAL gene editing technologies in a variety of potential applications and disease areas, including for oncology and hematology. Homing endonucleases and MegaTALs are novel enzymes that provide a highly specific and efficient way to modify DNA sequences to silence, edit or insert genetic components to potentially treat a variety of diseases.

Our gene therapy platform is based on viral vectors that utilize a modified, non-replicating version of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1, or HIV-1, that has been stripped of all of the components required for it to self-replicate and infect additional cells. HIV-1 is part of the lentivirus family of viruses, and we refer to our vectors as lentiviral vectors. Our lentiviral vectors are used to introduce a functional copy of a gene to the patient&#8217;s own isolated blood stem cells, called hematopoietic stem cells, or HSCs, which reside in a patient&#8217;s bone marrow and are capable of differentiating into a wide range of cell types. HSCs are dividing cells, thus our approach allows for sustained expression of the modified gene as we are able to take advantage of a lifetime of replication of the gene-modified HSCs. Additionally, we have developed a proprietary cell-based vector manufacturing process that is both reproducible and scalable. We believe our innovations in viral vector design and related manufacturing processes are important steps towards advancing the field of gene therapy and in realizing its full potential on a commercial scale. 

Utilizing our gene therapy platform, we are developing product candidates comprising the patient&#8217;s own gene-modified HSCs. Clinical proof-of-concept already exists for all ogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, or HSCT, an approach of treating a patient with HSCs contributed by a donor other than the patient that contain the properly functioning copy of the gene whose mutation has caused the underlying disease. However , this approach has significant limitations, including difficulties in finding appropriate genetically-matched donors and the risk of transplant-related rejection, graft-versus-host disease , or GVHD, and mortality, and is therefore typically only available on a limited basis. Our approach is intended to address the significant limitations of allogeneic HSCT while utilizing existing stem cell transplant infrastructure and processes. Also, because our approach has the potential to drive sustained expression o f the functional protein encoded by the gene insert after potentially a single-administration, we believe the value proposition offered by our product candidates for patients, families, health care providers and payors would be significant. 

Although our initial focus for HSCs is in TDT, severe SCD and CALD, and for T cells is in oncology, we believe our gene therapy platform has broad therapeutic potential in a variety of indications. We believe that our vectors can be used to introduce virtually any gene into a cell and have the potential to be manufactured on a commercial scale reproducibly and reliably, as each new vector is produced using substantially the same process. We also take advantage of lentivirus&#8217; ability to transduce HSCs more efficiently than other vectors, such as those derived from another virus used in gene therapy approaches, called adeno-associated virus, or AAV, which gives us the potential to address diseases in a variety of cell lineages beyond those that are derived from HSCs, such as microglia (useful for CALD), red blood cells (useful for &#223;-thalassemia and SCD), T cells (useful for cancer and immunology) and others. 

Our gene therapy platform and proprietary lentiviral vectors 

Our gene therapy product candidates for severe genetic and rare diseases and in oncology are being developed based on a simple notion: to genetically modify a patient&#8217;s own cells to fundamentally correct or address the genetic basis underlying a disease . Although the notion of gene transfer to a patient&#8217;s own cells is simple, the processes of developing viral vectors capable of delivering the genetic material and inserting gene sequences safely into a patient&#8217;s target cells is highly technical and demands significant expertise, experience and know-how. Leveraging our extensive expertise in viral vector design and manufacturing and transduction, we have developed a gene therapy platform that we believe is broadly applicable in a variety of indications with significant unmet medical need. 

The success of a gene therapy platform is highly dependent on the type of delivery system used. Our platform is based upon an ex vivo viral delivery system whereby a certain type of virus delivers the DNA that it is carrying into a cell and inserts this DNA into the cell&#8217;s genome. We have developed significant expertise in designing a particular type of vector delivery system employing a lentivirus for use in gene therapy and have also developed and in-licensed relevant intellectual property, including know-how, related to lentiviral vectors. Our lentiviral construct design includes only the minimal viral components of HIV-1 required to enable the vector to undergo one round of replication within the cell during manufacturing and subsequently to enter the target cells and deliver the gene that it is carrying. 

We believe that our lentiviral vectors are particularly well-suited for treating a number of diseases and have certain advantages over other viral vectors used in developing gene therapy products, including: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Sustained expression &#8212;Unlike other vectors based on viruses such as AAV, lentiviral vectors are capable of integrating the functional gene they carry into the DNA of the target cell&#8217;s genome. As such, they are well-suited to introduce a sustained therapeutic effect in dividing cells because the gene sequence introduced by the lentiviral vector will be replicated with the rest of the cell&#8217;s chromosomal DNA and subsequent dividing cells will also carry the newly inserted gene sequence. Other vector platforms that take advantage of different viruses introduce genes into cells but they don&#8217;t actively integrate into a cell&#8217;s DNA and require many viral events to transform a cell. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Potentially Improved Safety &#8212;In clinical studies of gene therapy product candidates conducted by other entities, earlier generations of integrating viral vectors based on a mouse gamma-retrovirus were shown to preferentially integrate into certain regulatory regions of genes (such as the promoter regions) and in some instances inappropriately activate the cell to divide uncontrollably, leading to cancer through a process called insertional oncogenesis. These genetic alterations have led to several well-publicized adverse events, including several reported cases of leukemia, and highlighted the need to develop new gene therapy vectors with potentially improved safety profiles. Next generation lentiviral vectors, unlike gamma retroviruses, have a distinct pattern of integrating into regions that provide instructions for making proteins rather than preferentially integrating into regions that can lead to cell proliferation and cancer. We believe this difference in integration patterns is a critical factor in potentially improving the safety profile of the vector, and distinguishes them from earlier generations of integrating viral vectors. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Carrying capacity &#8212;Unlike AAV, the lentivirus is able to carry large therapeutic gene sequences (up to 8,000 base pairs) into a host cell. This may limit the utility of AAV in some diseases where the required gene sequences will be too large to fit into an AAV construct. In this regard, lentiviral vectors offer more flexibility. 

Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) 

Our gene therapy platform takes advantage of lentiviral vectors&#8217; ability to stably integrate into the target cell&#8217;s genome by focusing on diseases we can treat through genetic modification of HSCs, which when reintroduced back into the patient, differentiate into numerous other cell lineages, as depicted below. We believe our initial clinical indications&#8212;CALD, TDT and severe SCD&#8212;can all be treated by introducing a specific functional gene into HSCs taken from the patient to correct the gene defect responsible for the disease. 

HSCs are dividing stem cells that are permanently found in a patient&#8217;s bone marrow and are an ongoing replacement source of mature cell types as they die off. HSCs produce progeny cells, called progenitors, that differentiate into all of the cellular elements that compose the blood, including red blood cells (useful for &#223;-thalassemia and SCD), microglia (useful for CALD), T cells (useful for cancer and immunology) and others. As such, all progenitors derived from a single gene therapy-modified HSC will carry the same corrective genetic modification, which we believe gives our approach the potential to deliver life-long clinical benefits based on a single therapeutic administration. 

Our therapeutic approach in HSCs 

The delivery of a gene therapy product in HSCs requires several steps. Importantly, our approach seeks to leverage cell transplant procedures and infrastructure already widely used in the clinic for allogeneic HSCT. 

&#160;

1. 

We produce our lentiviral vector by co-transfecting a packaging cell line with multiple plasmids that separately encode the various components of the virus as well as the functional gene sequence the viral vector will carry. The use of multiple plasmids is an important safety step designed to further prevent the resulting lentiviral vectors from being able to replicate and cause infection on their own. 

&#160;

2. 

For the treatment of severe genetic and rare diseases, a sample of the patient&#8217;s own HSCs is extracted and isolated through a standard process known as apheresis, where HSCs are first mobilized into the blood stream from the bone marrow using a routinely-used pharmaceutical agent and then collected from the patient&#8217;s blood. In some cases, such as for the treatment of severe SCD, HSCs are extracted directly from the patient&#8217;s bone marrow. 

&#160;

3. 

The lentiviral vector is mixed with the patient&#8217;s isolated HSCs ex vivo . This leads to the insertion of the functional gene into the HSCs&#8217; existing DNA, thus creating a pool of the patient&#8217;s own, or autologous, gene-modified cells. The cells are then washed to remove any remnants of the viral vector or culture media. These gene-modified cells are the therapeutic drug product that is delivered back into the patient. 

&#160;

4. 

Prior to administering our drug product, the patient undergoes a standard myeloablation procedure (also used in allogeneic HSCT) to remove endogenous bone marrow cells. The modified HSCs are then re-infused back into the patient (approximately one to two months after initial extraction of the patient&#8217;s HSCs) and begin re-populating a portion of the bone marrow as permanently modified HSCs in a process known as engraftment. The engrafted HSCs will go on to give rise to progenitor cell types with the functional gene. 

&#160;

Our therapeutic approach in T cell-based immunotherapy 

Similarly to our therapeutic approach in HSCs, the delivery of modified T cell products requires several steps. Importantly, our approach seeks to leverage cell transplant procedures and infrastructure already widely used in the clinic for allogeneic bone marrow transplant.

&#160;

1. 

We produce our lentiviral vector by co-transfecting a packaging cell line with multiple plasmids that separately encode the various components of the virus as well as the tumor-targeting protein the viral vector will carry. 

&#160;

2. 

For the treatment of cancer, a sample of the patient&#8217;s own white blood cells is extracted and isolated through a standard process known as leukapheresis, in which white blood cells are separated from the remaining fractions of the patient&#8217;s blood.

&#160;

3. 

The lentiviral vector is mixed with the patient&#8217;s white blood cells, which include T cells, ex vivo . This leads to the insertion of the gene encoding a CAR into the T cells&#8217; existing DNA, thus creating a population of modified T cells expressing a CAR or TCR. The cells are then washed to remove any remnants of the viral vector or culture media and expanded to increase the number of modified T cells to the required dosage. These modified T cells are the therapeutic drug product that is delivered back into the patient. 

&#160;

4. 

Prior to administering our drug product, the patient undergoes a standard lymphodepletion procedure to reduce the number of T cells that may compete with the modified T cells. The modified T cells are then re-infused back into the patient.

Our product candidate pipeline 

We are developing our LentiGlobin product candidate to treat patients with TDT and severe SCD. We are conducting two Phase I/II clinical studies in the United States, Australia, and Thailand and in France, called the Northstar and HGB-205 studies, respectively, of our LentiGlobin product candidate to evaluate its safety and efficacy in subjects with TDT and severe SCD. We have initiated a Phase I clinical study in the United States, called the HGB-206 study, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our LentiGlobin product candidate in subjects with severe SCD. We are developing our Lenti-D product candidate to treat patients with CALD, the most severe form of ALD. We are also currently conducting a Phase II/III clinical study of our Lenti-D product candidate in the United States, which we refer to as the Starbeam Study, to examine the safety and efficacy of our Lenti-D product candidate in preserving neurological function and stabilizing cerebral demyelination in subjects with CALD. 

We are also pursuing opportunities to apply our gene therapy platform technologies in the field of immunotherapy in oncology by genetically modifying a patient&#8217;s own T cells to target and destroy cancer cells. Our collaboration with Celgene focuses on CAR T cell therapy, which has been shown by academic and corporate researchers to have beneficial effects in clinical trials for patients with a variety of lymphomas. Our collaboration with Celgene is focused on product candidates directed against BCMA, a protein expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma cells and plasma cells. In February 2016, we initiated a Phase I clinical study (CRB-401) to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our bb2121 product candidate, the lead product candidate from this collaboration, in the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Celgene has exercised its option to exclusively license our bb2121 product candidate, while we have retained an option to co-develop and co-promote this product candidate. We are also collaborating with Kite Pharma, Inc. in the development of a second-generation T cell receptor, or TCR, T cell therapy against HPV-16 E6 antigen, which is related to certain cancers associated with the human papilloma virus. 

Our LentiGlobin product candidate opportunity

&#223;-thalassemia 

Overview 

&#223;-thalassemia is a rare hereditary blood disorder caused by a genetic abnormality of the &#223;-globin gene resulting in defective red blood cells, or RBCs. Genetic mutations cause the absence or reduced production of the beta chains of hemoglobin, or &#223;-globin, thereby preventing the proper formation of hemoglobin A, which normally accounts for greater than 95% of the hemoglobin in the blood of adults. Hemoglobin is an iron-containing protein in the blood that carries oxygen from the respiratory organs to the rest of the body. Hemoglobin A consists of four chains&#8212;two chains each of &#97; -globin and &#223;-globin. Normally existing at an approximate 1:1 ratio, genetic mutations that impair the production of &#223;-globin can lead to a relative excess of &#97; -globin, leading to premature death of red blood cells. The clinical implications of the &#97; -globin/&#223;-globin imbalance are two-fold: first, patients lack sufficient RBCs and hemoglobin to effectively transport oxygen throughout the body and can become severely anemic; and second, the shortened life span and ineffective production of RBCs can lead to other complications such as splenomegaly, marrow expansion, bone deformities, and iron overload in major organs. 

The clinical course of &#223;-thalassemia correlates with the degree of globin chain imbalance. Nearly 200 different mutations have been described in patients with &#223;-thalassemia. The clinical presentation varies widely, dependent largely upon the type of inherited mutation. Mutations can be categorized as those which result in no functional &#223;-globin production (&#223;&#176;) and those which result in decreased functional &#223;-globin production (&#223; + ). TDT refers to any mutation pairing that results in the need for chronic transfusions due 

to severe anemia, and is the clinical finding in most patients with &#223;&#176;/&#223;&#176; genotype as well as many patients with other genotypes resulting in abnormal &#223;-globin production, such as the &#223;&#176;/&#223; + and &#223; +/ &#223; + genotypes. Affected patients produce as little as one to seven g/dL of hemoglobin (while a normal adult produces 12-18 g/dL of hemoglobin). Hemoglobin E (&#223; E ), which is another &#223;-globin mutation and is usually asymptomatic, can also result in TDT when paired with the &#223;&#176; or &#223; + mutations. 

&#223;-thalassemia is concentrated in populations of Mediterranean, South and Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern descent. It has been estimated that about 1.5% (80 to 90 million people) of the global population are carriers of &#223;-thalassemia, with about 60,000 symptomatic individuals born annually, the great majority in the developing world, while the condition is considered rare in the United States and Europe. According to Thalassemia International Federation, about 288,000 patients with TDT are alive and registered as receiving regular treatment around the world, of which it is estimated that about 15,000 live in the United States and Europe. Due to the rarity of this disease in the United States, published research on the prevalence of &#223;-thalassemia in the United States is limited.

Limitations of current treatment options 

In geographies where treatment is available, patients with TDT receive chronic blood transfusion regimens. These regimens consist of infusions with units of packed RBC, or pRBC, every three to five weeks, the timing of which is aimed at maintaining hemoglobin levels and controlling symptoms of the disease. While chronic blood transfusions can be effective at minimizing the symptoms of TDT, they often lead to iron overload, which over time leads to mortality through iron-associated heart and liver toxicity. To prevent iron overload-associated risks, patients must adhere to therapeutic iron chelation regimens to reduce the iron overload. Poor compliance with chelation regimens remains a key challenge; it is estimated that with typical compliance, the overall life expectancy for a patient with TDT is significantly reduced compared to the general population. Even patients who are compliant with transfusion and iron chelation regimens can experience a reduced quality of life due to the burden and side effects of therapy and the fluctuating levels of hemoglobin on a month-to-month basis. 

The only potentially curative therapy for &#223;-thalassemia today is allogeneic HSCT. However, complications of allogeneic HSCT include a 10-30% risk of engraftment failure in Human-Leukocyte-Antigen, or HLA, matched patients, a 12-16% incidence of life-threatening infection, and an approximately 30% risk of GVHD, a common complication in which donor immune cells (white blood cells in the graft) recognize the cells of the recipient (the host) as &#8220;foreign&#8221; and attack them. As a result of these safety challenges, allogeneic HSCT can lead to significant mortality rates, particularly for patients treated with cells from a donor who is not a matched sibling, and in older patients. Consequently, transplants are offered primarily to pediatric patients with a matched sibling donor, which occurs in less than 25% of all cases. In addition, because of the need for immunosuppression following allogeneic HSCT, there is a risk of opportunistic infections and other serious side effects associated with immunosuppressive drugs. Overall, TDT remains a devastating disease with an unmet medical need. 

In many developing countries where &#223;-thalassemia is more prevalent, such as Thailand, the lack of readily available chronic blood transfusions and optimal iron chelation regimens represents a significant societal challenge. In these countries, children with TDT have a poor prognosis and experience growth retardation, hepatosplenomegaly, or enlargement of the spleen, and skeletal deformities resulting from extra-medullary hematopoiesis. Ultimately, premature death is not uncommon. We believe that alternative therapies, such as those represented by our gene therapy approach, could offer a potential solution to the challenges of treating &#223;-thalassemia patients across the world. 

Sickle cell disease 

Overview 

Sickle cell disease, or SCD, is a hereditary blood disorder resulting from a mutation in the &#223;-globin gene that causes polymerization of hemoglobin proteins and abnormal red blood cell function. The disease is characterized by anemia, vaso-occlusive pain crisis (a common complication of SCD in which there is severe pain due to obstructed blood flow in the bones, joints, lungs, liver, spleen, kidney, eye, or central nervous system), infections, stroke, overall poor quality of life and early death in a large subset of patients. Under low-oxygen conditions, which are exacerbated by the RBC abnormalities, the mutant hemoglobin aggregates causing the RBCs to take on a sickle shape (sickle cells), which causes them to aggregate and obstruct small blood vessels, thereby restricting blood flow to organs resulting in pain, cell death and organ damage. If oxygen levels are restored, the hemoglobin can disaggregate and the RBCs will return to their normal shape, but over time, the sickling damages the cell membrane and the cells fail to return to the normal shape even in high-oxygen conditions. Additionally, the sickle-shaped RBCs tend to rupture more easily, often resulting in damage to the blood vessels and iron overload that can ultimately lead to organ failure and death. 

SCD is concentrated in populations of African, Middle Eastern and South Asian descent. The global incidence of SCD is estimated to be 250,000-300,000 births annually, and the global prevalence of the disease is estimated to be about 20-25 million. In the United States, where SCD is a standard part of many states&#8217; newborn screening procedures, the incidence is more than 1,600 births annually with an estimated prevalence of 100,000 individuals. 

Limitations of current treatment options 

Where adequate medical care is available, common treatments for patients with SCD largely revolve around management and prevention of acute sickling episodes. Chronic management may include hydroxyurea and, in certain cases, chronic transfusions. Hydroxyurea is currently the only medication approved for the treatment of severe SCD and is recommended for patients with recurrent episodes of acute pain or specific frequencies of painful crises or life-threatening complications. Not all severe SCD patients respond to hydroxyurea however, or are able to tolerate the cytotoxic effect of reduced white blood cell and platelet counts. Thus, a significant number of patients with SCD find it difficult to adhere to hydroxyurea treatment, and for most patients there is no effective long-term treatment. 

RBC transfusion therapy can be utilized to maintain the level of sickling hemoglobin below 30%, which decreases sickling of RBCs, increases their oxygen-carrying capacity, reduces the risk of recurrent stroke, and decreases the incidence of associated co-morbidities. While standard blood transfusions are often used to achieve this goal, especially during acute episodes, exchange transfusions offer better control of blood volume and viscosity while decreasing the risk of transfusion-related haemochromatosis and iron overload in the chronic setting. While transfusion therapy can be critical in the management of acute disease, and can be vital in preventing some of the chronic manifestations of severe SCD, it does not provide equal benefit to all patients.

Similar to TDT, the only potentially curative therapy currently available for SCD is allogeneic HSCT, however because of the significant risk of transplant-related morbidity and mortality, this option is usually offered primarily to pediatric patients with available sibling-matched donors. It is particularly difficult to find suitable donors for individuals of African descent, and it is estimated that approximately 10% of eligible patients do so. In light of these factors, we believe SCD is a devastating disease with a significant unmet medical need. 

Our LentiGlobin product candidate 

We are developing our LentiGlobin product candidate as a potential one-time treatment for both TDT and severe SCD. Our approach involves the ex vivo insertion of a single codon variant of the normal &#223;-globin gene using a lentiviral vector into the patient&#8217;s own HSCs to enable formation of normally functioning hemoglobin A and normal RBCs in patients. Importantly, this codon variant, referred to as T87Q, also serves as a distinct biomarker used to quantify expression levels of the functional &#223;-globin protein in patients with TDT and severe SCD, while also providing anti-sickling properties in the context of SCD. We refer to the HSCs that have undergone gene modification ex vivo as the final LentiGlobin drug product, or our LentiGlobin product candidate. 

We are conducting two Phase I/II clinical studies of our LentiGlobin product candidate, to evaluate its safety and efficacy in subjects with TDT. In December 2013, we announced that the first subject with TDT had been treated in our French study of our LentiGlobin product candidate, called the HGB-205 study, which also permits the enrollment of subjects with severe SCD. In October 2014, we announced that the first subject with severe SCD had been treated in the HGB-205 study. In March 2014, we announced that the first subject with TDT had been treated in our other study of our LentiGlobin product candidate being conducted in the United States, Australia and Thailand, called the Northstar Study. We presented interim results from both the HGB-205 study and the Northstar Study at the American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting in December 2015.

We have initiated a Phase I clinical study in the United States, called the HGB-206 Study, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our LentiGlobin product candidate in subjects with severe SCD. Additionally, we are in discussions with the FDA regarding our planned Phase III clinical studies for the treatment of TDT in subjects who do not have the &#223;&#176;/&#223;&#176; genotype. We believe that data from these studies, together with data from the ongoing Northstar and HGB-205 studies could form the basis for a biologics licensing application, or BLA, submission for our LentiGlobin product candidate in the United States. These planned clinical studies could support an accelerated approval, with post-approval confirmatory evidence to be provided with longer-term follow-up of these studies.

Our LentiGlobin product candidate has been granted Orphan Drug status by the FDA and EMA for both &#946;-thalassemia and SCD. Our LentiGlobin product candidate was granted Fast-Track designation by the FDA for the treatment of &#946;-thalassemia major in January 2013 and for the treatment of certain patients with severe SCD in May 2014. In January 2015, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to our LentiGlobin product candidate for the treatment of transfusion-dependent patients with &#946;-thalassemia major. We are participating in the EMA&#8217;s Adaptive Pathways pilot program (formerly referred to as Adaptive Licensing), which is part of the EMA&#8217;s effort to improve timely access for patients to new medicines. Based on our discussions involving the EMA, European Health Technology Assessment agencies and patient advocacy organizations as part of this program, we believe it is possible to seek conditional approval for the treatment of adults and adolescents with TDT on the basis of the totality of the clinical data, in particular reduction in transfusion need, from the ongoing Northstar study and supportive HGB-205 study, assuming these studies demonstrate acceptable efficacy and safety. We believe that conversion to full approval would be subject to the successful completion of our planned Phase III clinical studies, supportive long-term follow-up data and &#8220;real-life&#8221; post-approval monitoring data. Whether or not our clinical data are sufficient to support conditional, and ultimately full, approval will be a review decision by the EMA.

Clinical development of our LentiG lobin product candidate 

The HGB-205 Phase I/II clinical study for TDT and severe SCD 

The HGB-205 study is a Phase I/II clinical study to examine the safety and efficacy of our LentiGlobin product candidate in up to seven subjects with a diagnosis of TDT or severe SCD. Study subjects must be between five and 35 years of age with a diagnosis of TDT or severe SCD. In December 2013, we announced that the first subject with TDT had been treated in the HGB-205 study and in October 2014 we announced that the first subject with severe SCD had been treated in the European HGB-205 study. To be enrolled, subjects with TDT must have received at least 100 mL/kg/year of pRBCs per year for the past two years. Those with severe SCD must have failed to achieve clinical benefit from treatment with hydroxyurea and have an additional poor prognostic risk factor (e.g., recurrent vaso-occlusive crises or acute chest syndromes). All subjects must be eligible for allogeneic HSCT, but without a matched sibling allogeneic HSCT donor. 

For all subjects, efficacy will be measured by RBC transfusion requirements per month and per year, post-transplant and the number of total in-patient hospitalization days (post-transplant discharge) at six, 12 and 24 months. For severe SCD patients only, efficacy will be measured by the number of vaso-occlusive crises or acute chest syndrome events at six, 12 and 24 months and evaluation of changes in the nature or frequency of the subject-specific main inclusion criteria. 

Safety evaluations to be performed during the study include success and kinetics of HSC engraftment, incidence of transplant-related mortality post-treatment, overall survival, detection of vector-derived replication-competent lentivirus in any subject and characterization of events of insertional mutagenesis leading to clonal dominance or leukemia. 

Interim Clinical Data from the HGB-205 Study

&#160;

In December 2015, we presented interim clinical data from the HGB-205 study at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology, or ASH. As of the data cut-off date of November 10, 2015, four subjects with TDT and one subject with severe SCD had undergone infusion with LentiGlobin drug product in the HGB-205 study. The two subjects with TDT for which we have at least 12 months of follow up data achieved rapid transfusion independence with near-normal hemoglobin levels and are producing steadily increasing amounts of &#223; A - T87Q -globin, similar to what may be expected from a successful allogeneic transplant. As of November 10, 2015, these two subjects had been free from the need for transfusions for 23.4 months and 20.1 months, respectively. An additional two patients with TDT had been infused, although it was too early to draw any meaningful efficacy conclusions. At their most recent follow ups, three months and one month, respectively, these patients were producing measurable levels of &#223;- T87Q -globin. At the twelve-month post-infusion follow up for the subject with severe SCD, the proportion of anti-sickling hemoglobin accounted for 49 percent of all hemoglobin production, which is above the 30 percent threshold expected to potentially achieve a disease-modifying clinical effect. Prior to infusion, this subject required chronic blood transfusions. Since infusion with LentiGlobin drug product, this subject was successfully weaned off of transfusions and has remained transfusion free for more than nine months. Since infusion, this subject has had no hospitalizations or acute SCD-related events. In this study, treatment with our LentiGlobin product candidate has been well tolerated, with no drug product-related adverse events observed as of November 10, 2015.

It should be noted that these data presented above are current as of the dates presented, are preliminary in nature and the HGB-205 study is not complete. There is limited data concerning long-term safety and efficacy following treatment with our LentiGlobin 

product candidate. These data may not continue for these subjects or be repeated or observed in ongoing or future studies involving our LentiGlobin product candidate, including the HGB-205 study, the Northstar Study or the HGB-206 study. It is possible that subjects for whom transfusion support has been reduced or eliminated may receive transfusion support in the future. 

The Northstar Phase I/II clinical study for TDT

The Northstar Study is a single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, multi-site Phase I/II clinical study in the United States, Australia and Thailand to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the LentiGlobin product candidate in increasing hemoglobin production and eliminating or reducing transfusion dependence following treatment. In March 2014, we announced that the first subject with TDT had been treated in our Northstar Study.

Up to 18 adults and adolescents will be enrolled in the study. Study subjects must be between 12 and 35 years of age with a diagnosis of TDT and receive at least 100 mL/kg/year of pRBCs or greater than or equal to eight transfusions of pRBCs per year in each of the two years preceding enrollment. The subjects must also be eligible for allogeneic HSCT.

Efficacy will be evaluated primarily by the production of &#179; 2.0 g/dL of hemoglobin A containing &#223; A-T87Q -globin for the six-month period between 18 and 24 months post-transplant. In order to allow for endogenous hemoglobin production following transplant, subjects will be transfused with RBCs only when total hemoglobin decreases below 7.0 g/dL. The rationale for this endpoint is that production of &#179; 2.0 g/dL of hemoglobin A containing &#223; A-T87Q -globin represents a clinically meaningful increase in endogenous hemoglobin production that would be expected to diminish transfusion requirements, and could result in transfusion independence in TDT subjects. 

Exploratory efficacy endpoints include RBC transfusion requirements (measured in milliliters per kilogram) per month and per year, post-transplant. Safety evaluations to be performed during the study include success and kinetics of HSC engraftment, incidence of transplant-related mortality post-treatment, overall survival, detection of vector-derived replication-competent lentivirus in any subject and characterization of events of insertional mutagenesis leading to clonal dominance or leukemia. Subjects will be monitored by regular screening. Each subject will remain on study for approximately 26 months from time of consent and then will be enrolled in a long-term follow-up protocol that will assess safety and efficacy beyond 24 months. 

Interim Clinical Data from the Northstar Study

In December 2015, we presented interim clinical data from the Northstar Study at the ASH Annual Meeting. As of the data cut-off date of October 28, 2015, 13 subjects with TDT had undergone infusion with LentiGlobin drug product in the Northstar Study. As of October 28, 2015, nine of these subjects had at least six months follow up following infusion. The median &#223; A- T87Q production range for these nine subjects was 4.9 g/dL, and was 4.9 g/dL among the five subjects with the non-&#946; 0 /&#946; 0 genotypes, and was 5.0 g/dL among the four subjects with the &#946; 0 /&#946; 0 genotype. The five subjects with non-&#946; 0 /&#946; 0 genotypes with at least six months follow up have been free from the need for transfusions, ranging from 7.1 to 16.4 months of ongoing transfusion independence. The four subjects with the &#946; 0 /&#946; 0 genotype experienced a reduction in transfusion volume from 33 percent to 100 percent. In the Northstar Study, treatment with our LentiGlobin product candidate has been consistent with autologous transplantation, with no drug product-related Grade 3 or greater adverse events observed as of October 28, 2015.

It should be noted that these data presented above are current as of the dates presented, are preliminary in nature and the Northstar Study is not complete. There is limited data concerning long-term safety and efficacy following treatment with our LentiGlobin product candidate. These data may not continue for these subjects or be repeated or observed in ongoing or future studies involving our LentiGlobin product candidate, including the HGB-205 study, the Northstar Study or the HGB-206 study. It is possible that subjects for whom transfusion support has been reduced or eliminated may receive transfusion support in the future.

The HGB-206 clinical study for severe sickle cell disease

The HGB-206 Study is a single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, multi-site Phase I clinical study in the United States to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the LentiGlobin product candidate to treat severe SCD. 

Up to 20 adults will be enrolled in the study. Study subjects must be &#8805;18 years of age with a diagnosis of sickle cell disease, with either &#946; S /&#946; S or &#946; S /&#946; 0 genotype. The sickle cell disease must be severe, as defined by recurrent severe vaso-occlusive events, acute chest syndrome, history of an overt stroke, or echocardiographic evidence of an elevated tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity, an indicator of pulmonary hypertension, and subjects must have failed to achieve clinical benefit from treatment with hydroxyurea. The subjects must also be eligible for HSCT. 

Efficacy endpoints include changes in the frequency of severe vaso-occlusive crises, acute chest syndrome, and strokes or ischemic attacks. Pharmacodynamic endpoints include measurements of transgene persistence and transgene expression.

Safety endpoints include monitoring for laboratory parameters and fr equency and severity of adverse events; the success and kinetics of HSC engraftment; the incidence of treatment related mortality and overall survival; the detection of vector-derived replication-competent lentivirus in any subject; and the characterizatio n of events of insertional mutagenesis leading to clonal dominance or leukemia. 

Each subject will remain on study for approximately 26 months from time of consent and then will be enrolled in a long-term follow-up protocol that will assess safety and efficacy beyond 24 months.

Preliminary Clinical Data from the HGB-206 Study

In December 2015, we presented preliminary clinical data from the HGB-206 study at the ASH Annual Meeting. As of the data cut-off date of November 17, 2015, LentiGlobin drug product had been manufactured for four patients with severe SCD, and three of the patients had been infused. The two subjects with at least three months of follow-up data show a gradual increase in hemoglobin A containing &#223; A-T87Q level post-infusion. The safety profile in the infused patients in the HGB-206 study is consistent with autologous transplantation and no drug product-related adverse events were observed as of November 17, 2015. Below is a table summarizing the preliminary clinical data from the HGB-206 study presented at the ASH annual meeting in December 2015.

Our planned Phase III clinical studies for TDT

We have discussed the designs of two planned Phase III clinical studies of our LentiGlobin product candidate with the FDA and EMA. Our planned HGB-207 study will be a single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, global, multi-site Phase III clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the LentiGlobin product candidate to treat TDT. Our HGB-207 study is currently planned to enroll up to 15 adult and adolescent subjects. Participants in this study must have a diagnosis of TDT and have non-&#946; 0 / &#946; 0 genotypes. They must also be eligible for HSCT. Efficacy in this study will be evaluated primarily by 12 consecutive months of transfusion independence. Subjects will be monitored by regular screening. Each subject will remain in the study for approximately 24 months of follow-up and will then be enrolled in a long-term follow-up protocol that will assess safety and efficacy beyond 24 months. As required of all gene therapy clinical trials, we filed the clinical study protocol for our HGB-207 study with the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC, convened by the National Institutes of Health, or NIH. The RAC notified us that our HGB-207 study does not require an in-depth review or public RAC discussion. We intend to begin initiating our HGB-207 study in late 2016.

We are also considering initiating an additional Phase III clinical study in pediatric subjects who have a diagnosis of TDT, which we have referred to as the HGB-208 study. Based upon the proposed protocol for the HGB-208 study filed with the RAC, the RAC notified us in 2015 that it recommends delay of the initiation of a Phase III pediatric clinical study for one to two years. We intend to continue to work closely with regulatory authorities and our clinical study sites to evaluate our plans for both the HGB-207 study and for studying our LentiGlobin product candidate in pediatric subjects. 

Our Lenti-D product candidate opportunity 

Adrenoleukodystrophy 

Adrenoleukodystrophy is a rare X-linked, inherited, neurological disorder that is often fatal. ALD is caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene which encodes for a protein called the ALD protein, or ALDP, which plays a critical role in the breakdown and metabolism of very long-chain fatty acids, or VLCFA. Without functional ALDP, VLCFA accumulate in cells throughout the body, including in the brain, spinal cord and adrenal glands. The build-up of VLCFAs causes damage to the myelin sheath, a protective and insulating membrane that surrounds nerve cells, in the brain. This damage can result in decreased motor coordination and function, visual and hearing disturbances, the loss of cognitive function, dementia, seizures, and other complications, including death. The worldwide incidence rate for ALD is approximately one in 17,000 newborns. 

ALD is divided into various sub-segments with two main phenotypes that impact brain function: 

&#160;

&#183; 

CALD (Cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy) : The most severe form of ALD is CALD. CALD is characterized by progressive destruction of myelin, leading to severe loss of neurological function and eventual death. About 30-40% of patients with ALD are young boys affected by CALD. In boys affected by CALD, learning and behavioral problems are often observed in mid-childhood between the ages of 3 and 15 years (median age 7). In the absence of intervention, boys affected by CALD typically experience rapid degeneration into vegetative state, and ultimately death within a decade of diagnosis. 

&#160;

&#183; 

AMN (Adrenomyeloneuropathy) : AMN, which typically develops in adults aged 21 years and older, is the most common neurological form of ALD. All patients with AMN present with more slowly progressive symptoms resulting from (non-inflammatory) disruption of the axons (which are a fundamental component of the central nervous system that allows nerve signals to be transmitted in the spinal cord). Approximately 45-60% of patients diagnosed with AMN converts to CALD during their lifetime after age 18. 

Limitations of current treatment options 

There is a clear unmet medical need for patients with the cerebral phenotype of ALD. Currently, the only effective treatment option for patients with CALD is allogeneic HSCT. In this procedure, the patient is treated with HSCs containing a functioning copy of the gene contributed by a donor other than the patient. Allogeneic HSCT has also been shown to have potential clinical benefit in CALD affecting both children and adults. 

Allogeneic HSCT is preferably performed early in the course of the disease, ideally using an unaffected matched sibling HSC donor to minimize complications. However, the majority of allogeneic HSCT procedures for CALD are carried out with non-sibling matched donor cells, partially matched related or unrelated donor cells including umbilical cord blood cells because a matched sibling donor is not available in most cases. The difficulty of finding a suitable sibling-matched donor is one of the primary drawbacks of this approach. Complications of allogeneic HSCT include a significant risk of morbidity and mortality related to immunosuppressive medications, graft failure, GVHD and opportunistic infections, particularly in patients who undergo non-sibling-matched allogeneic HSCT. 

Moreover, of the approximately 80 boys who are born with CALD each year in the United States and European Union, we estimate that approximately 50% may have disease so advanced at the time of diagnosis that a beneficial outcome from treatment would be unlikely. This is attributed to rapid disease progression and difficulty with early diagnosis, as the initial presentation of the signs and symptoms of CALD are frequently misdiagnosed. Newborn screening through a simple and inexpensive blood test can enable earlier detection of CALD and is available in several states. Based in part on the fact that several states have approved or are currently considering universal newborn screening for ALD, it is our expectation that newborn screening will be broadly adopted in the United States within the next five years, and potentially elsewhere, providing for the opportunity to identify more boys for proactive monitoring of disease symptoms and early disease intervention. 

Our Lenti-D product candidate 

We are developing our Lenti-D product candidate as a potential one-time treatment to halt the progression of CALD. Our approach involves the ex vivo insertion of a functional copy of the ABCD1 gene via an HIV-1 based lentiviral vector into the patient&#8217;s own HSCs to correct the aberrant expression of ALDP in patients with CALD. Upon successful engraftment of our Lenti-D product candidate, we expect that microglia in the brain derived from the transduced HSCs will correct the metabolic abnormalities resulting from excess VLCFA and stabilize the demyelination and cerebral inflammation characteristic of CALD. 

We treated the first subject in the Starbeam Study in the United States in 2013. If successful, and pending further discussion with the regulatory authorities, the results from the Starbeam Study could potentially form the basis of a BLA submission to the FDA and an MAA to the EMA for this product candidate. However, there can be no assurance that the FDA and the EMA will not require additional studies before the approval of a BLA or MAA, respectively. The FDA has advised us that the Starbeam Study may not be deemed to be a pivotal study or may not provide sufficient support for a BLA submission. The FDA normally requires two pivotal 

cl inical studies to approve a drug or biologic product, and thus the FDA may require that we conduct additional clinical studies of Lenti-D prior to a BLA submission. Lenti-D has been granted Orphan Drug status by the FDA and EMA for adrenoleukodystrophy . 

Clinical development of our Lenti-D product candidate 

Completed non-interventional retrospective study (the ALD-101 Study) 

Due to the rarity of CALD, allogeneic HSCT has historically not been subject to extensive analysis in controlled clinical studies, so progression of the disease and the efficacy and safety profile of allogeneic HSCT is largely absent from the current scientific literature. In order to properly design future clinical studies of Lenti-D and interpret the efficacy and safety results thereof, at the recommendation of the FDA, we performed a non-interventional retrospective data collection study to assess the natural course of disease in CALD patients that were left untreated, which we refer to as the untreated group or cohort, in comparison to the efficacy and safety data obtained from patients that received allogeneic HSCT, which we refer to as the treated cohort. A non-interventional retrospective data collection study involves an examination of historical clinical records from patients in order to assess the typical course of the condition and the efficacy and safety of treatment options. In the study, we collected survival, functional and neuropsychological assessments and neuroimaging data for both treated and untreated patients, as available; however, given the retrospective nature of the study, we were not able to collect comprehensive data for all subjects. 

For this study, we collected data from four U.S. sites and one French site on a total of 137 subjects, 72 of whom were untreated and 65 of whom were treated with allogeneic HSCT. To our knowledge, the ALD-101 Study is the most comprehensive study ever conducted to characterize clinical outcomes in untreated and allogeneic HSCT-treated CALD patient populations.

Three primary clinical measurements of CALD disease progression 

The findings from the ALD-101 Study suggest that, although there are a wide number of cognitive, behavioral, functional and radiological modalities utilized to assess patients with CALD, three are utilized most widely and consistently: 

&#160;

&#183; 

The Neurological Function Score (NFS) . The NFS is a 25-point neurological function score that assesses fifteen neurological abnormalities typically caused by ALD. These neurological abnormalities are summarized below: 

&#160;

Major Functional Disabilities (MFDs) 

Among the 15 functional domains in the NFS scale, we consider six to be of particular clinical importance because when these neurological abnormalities occur, a patient&#8217;s ability to function independently is severely compromised. These particular deficiencies, which we define as Major Functional Disabilities, or MFDs, are loss of communication, complete loss of voluntary movement, cortical blindness, requirement for tube feeding, wheelchair dependence and total incontinence. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The Loes score . The Loes score is a 34-point scale specifically designed to objectively measure the extent of central nervous system disease burden based on brain magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, studies. The Loes score measures the extent and location of brain abnormalities such as the presence of white matter changes, degree of demyelination and the presence of focal or global atrophy. A Loes score of one-half or more (i.e., the presence of any such abnormalities) indicates the cerebral form of the disease, and patients with a Loes score of 10 or more generally are not considered to be good candidates for allogeneic HSCT due to the advanced stage of the disease. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Gadolinium enhancement . On e of the hallmarks of inflammatory disease in ALD patients is the presence of a compromised blood-brain barrier behind the leading edge of demyelinating lesions in the brain. This can be assessed using a contrast agent called gadolinium in brain MRI studie s. Evidence of gadolinium enhancement in the brain in a MRI study, referred to by clinicians as a gadolinium positive result, suggests that neuroinflammation is present and the blood-brain barrier has been compromised, which in published studies has been s hown to be a predictive biomarker of ALD disease progression. 

Summary of findings 

Key findings from the ALD-101 Study are summarized below: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Untreated, patients with CALD progress to dismal outcomes . In the untreated cohort, the median overall survival was 92 months (7.7 years) and the estimated probability of survival at five years was 55%. Although informative, survival data must be considered in light of the fact that supportive measures may be used to sustain life after progression to a vegetative state. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Baseline disease severity, as assessed by NFS and Loes scores, were good predictors of survival . In both the untreated and treated cohorts, significantly lower mortality rates were seen in patients with lower baseline NFS and Loes scores than in those with higher scores.

Mortality rate determined by the number of deaths that occurred at any time through the observation period post-CALD diagnosis. 

As a consequence of this observation, and consistent with entry criteria that have been used in studies of allogeneic HSCT, the entry criteria for the Starbeam Study excludes subjects with evidence of advanced disease on NFS and Loes score to prevent enrollment of subjects whose disease would be expected to progress to a poor outcome despite treatment. 

&#160;

&#183; 

MFDs occurred in the majority of the untreated cohort who showed evidence of gadolinium enhancement in brain MRI . The majority of untreated subjects (67%) had progressive disease resulting in premature MFD or death during the study period, with 91% (19/21) of gadolinium positive subjects dying or having an MFD during the study period. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Allogeneic HSCT was associated with disease stabilization . Despite the significant risk of morbidity and mortality associated with allogeneic HSCT, successful transplantation was shown to provide clinically meaningful benefit to patients with CALD, particularly those with early-stage disease. Of the subjects who were evaluable at 24 months post-allogeneic-HSCT, 49% (N=51) of the allogeneic-HSCT cohort remained MFD-free. Allogeneic HSCT was also associated with resolution of gadolinium enhancement. Of those patients who would meet eligibility criteria for the Starbeam study (baseline NFS of zero or one, gadolinium-positive prior to allogeneic HSCT, baseline Loes between 0.5 and nine, inclusive and did not have a matched sibling), four of 17 (24%) patients developed an MFD within 24 months post-allogeneic HSCT. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Consistent with published literature, allogeneic HSCT, particularly with unmatched/unrelated donors, was associated with clinically significant morbidity and mortality. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Morbidity : Post-allogeneic HSCT, engraftment failure occurred in 12 of 65 (19%) patients, 10 of whom (83%) were transplanted with unrelated donor cells. Despite prophylaxis, the GVHD rate was reported in 34 of 58 evaluable subjects (59%), including acute GVHD in 26 (45%) patients and chronic GVHD in 12 (19%) patients. Due to the requirement for myeloablation prior to HSCT, the occurrence of GVHD and the requirement for immunosuppressive therapy post-allogeneic HSCT, allogeneic HSCT is associated with a substantial risk of life-threatening infection. Infections were the most commonly reported serious adverse event, with at least one serious infection reported in 19 (29%) patients post-allogeneic HSCT. The substantial morbidity associated with allogeneic HSCT for CALD supports evaluating Lenti-D in the Starbeam Study as an alternative therapeutic option that is expected to avoid the issues of immune incompatibility seen with allogeneic HSCT. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Mortality : Post-allogeneic HSCT, the 100-day mortality rate was 8% and the overall one-year mortality rate was 19%. The estimated probability of two and five year survival rates post-allogeneic HSCT were 82% and 74%, respectively. As anticipated from the published literature, analysis of survival by type of donor (matched sibling versus other) showed that the proportion of deaths through the observation period post- allogeneic HSCT was lower in matched-sibling donor cases than in other allogeneic HSCT cases. The majority of allogeneic HSCT patients (46 patients; 71%) were transplanted with unrelated donor cells given the limited availability of HLA-matched sibling donors. As a result of this analysis, we determined to exclude patients with a sibling-matched donor from the Starbeam Study. 

We believe the results from the ALD-101 Study support the proposition that, while the approach of treating a patient with ge netically corrected HSCs can stabilize the progression of disease in patients with CALD , there remains a significant unmet medical need for safer therapies, particularly for patients without the option of a sibling-matched donor. We believe that many of th e issues that contribute to the mortality and morbidity associated with allogeneic HSCT could be avoided using a patient&#8217;s own gene-modified HSCs. Importantly, the results from this study were also used to inform the criteria for patient and endpoint selec tion for our Starbeam Study. 

Previous clinical experience with lentiviral gene therapy for CALD (the TG04.06.01 Study) 

Between September 2006 and September 2010, four boys with a confirmed diagnosis of CALD were treated in Paris, France, in a Phase I/II study with autologous HSCs transduced ex vivo with a lentiviral vector carrying a functional ABCD1 gene before reinfusion. Short-term clinical data and biological experience with the first two treated boys was first reported in Science (2009). 

The TG04.06.01 Study is sponsored by the institut national de la sant&#233; et de la recherche m&#233;dicale (French Institute of Health and Medical Research), or Inserm, in Paris, and the lentiviral vector was supplied by a third party company not affiliated with bluebird bio. We are party to a strategic collaboration agreement with Inserm for the development of HSC gene therapies in this patient population, pursuant to which we are collaborating with Patrick Aubourg, the Principal Investigator of the TG04.06.01 Study. 

In the TG04.06.01 Study, all four subjects had cerebral demyelinating lesions with Loes scores ranging from two to seven prior to treatment. Gadolinium contrast enhancement indicated that the lesions were active and inflammatory in all four subjects. At the time of enrollment, each subject had a normal neurologic examination with NFS equal to zero. 

Below is a summary of the efficacy results for each of the four subjects in the TG04.06.01 Study as of March 2013: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Subject One : Loes score stabilized at month 30 and remained stable through month 75. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Subject Two : Loes score stabilized at month 30 and remained stable through month 64. Gadolinium enhancement was initially positive, resolved, reappeared in the parietal area and then resolved and has remained negative. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Subject Three : Loes score stabilized at month 33 but gadolinium enhancement has persisted. Subject Three had active, progressive disease post-transplant resulting in the development of significant cognitive deficits with the loss of ability for new learning consistent with a frontal lobe syndrome, including the loss of spontaneous speech by month 33 and urinary incontinence. As of 54 months post-transplant, he had no further decline in NFS or Loes scores since his month 33 evaluation.

&#183; 

Subject Four : Loes score stabilized at month 16 and remained stable at 24 months. Gadolinium enhancement disappeared 45 days post-transplant and was still not detectable at month 12. 

We believe these efficacy results are consistent with outcomes that would be expected following successful allogeneic HSCT. All four boys were alive two years or more after treatment, while the ALD-101 Study would suggest an expected mortality rate of approximately 20% in the same two-year window post-allogeneic HSCT. As assessed by NFS and brain MRI, Subjects One, Two and Four showed encouraging evidence of disease stabilization. Additionally, gadolinium enhancement resolved in Subjects One, Two and Four, suggesting a reduction of neuroinflammation. These results also contrast with the natural history of disease in untreated patients, which is characterized by continuous and rapid progression of cerebral demyelination in the majority of cases, particularly those with gadolinium enhancement on brain MRI. All four subjects demonstrated some deterioration of neurologic function within the second year after transplant, which is expected as it is also seen following allogeneic HSCT. Although neurologic deficits have occurred in these subjects post-treatment, we are encouraged by the fact that neurologic disease stabilized in all four subjects. 

Importantly, as of March 2013, there were no reported incidents of gene therapy-related safety concerns in the TG04.06.01 Study. In addition, none of these subjects experienced adverse events due to immune incompatibility issues typically associated with allogeneic HSCT, such as graft rejection or GVHD. 

We believe the efficacy and safety results of the TG04.06.01 Study provided clinical proof-of-concept, as the lentiviral vector used in the study shares many features with our Lenti-D vector. In addition, the results of the TG04.06.01 Study were helpful in informing the design of our Starbeam Study. The design of the Starbeam Study is built upon the observations made in the TG04.06.01 Study, but will enroll a larger number of subjects, is a multi-site trial with a different primary endpoint and in consultation with experts in the field, and has a predefined criterion for clinical success. Additionally, with improvements we have introduced into the vector manufacturing and transduction processes, we expect to obtain a higher frequency of gene-modified HSCs in subjects treated in the Starbeam Study compared to what was achieved in the TG04.06.01 Study, which we believe should translate into improved clinical benefit by virtue of the increased expression of normally-functioning ALDP. 

Phase II/III Starbeam clinical study 

In October 2013, we treated the first subject in a Phase II/III clinical study, called the Starbeam Study, of our Lenti-D product candidate, to evaluate its safety and efficacy in subjects with CALD. In May 2015, we announced that we had achieved our initial enrollment target for the Starbeam Study with 18 subjects enrolled. The study is designed as a single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, international, multi-site Phase II/III study to test the safety and efficacy of our Lenti-D product candidate in preserving neurological function and stabilizing cerebral demyelination in subjects with CALD. Subjects will be followed for 24 months post-infusion under this protocol. In accordance with applicable guidance from the FDA and EMA, we will be monitoring study subjects in a separate long-term follow up protocol to evaluate safety for up to 15 years, and will also monitor efficacy endpoints to demonstrate a sustained treatment effect. In the study, subjects must be age seventeen years or younger with a confirmed diagnosis of active CALD, including elevated levels of plasma VLCFA, a brain MRI Loes score of 0.5 to nine, inclusive, evidence of gadolinium enhancement and an NFS &#163; one. Subjects with a willing, unaffected 10/10 HLA matched sibling HSCT donor will be excluded from the study. 

We have defined the primary efficacy endpoint in the Starbeam Study as the proportion of subjects who have no MFDs, as measured by NFS, at 24 months (&#177;two months) post-infusion. Secondary efficacy evaluations, in each case measured at 24 months (&#177;two months) post-infusion, capture the key assessments of CALD disease status, including the change from baseline in NFS and Loes score, resolution of gadolinium enhancement on MRI and determination of MFD-free survival and overall survival. The sample size for this study was not determined by formal statistical methods, but we believe it may be sufficient to demonstrate a robust effect on the binary response endpoint, where a responder is defined as a subject with no MFD at 24 months (&#177;two months) following treatment with Lenti-D drug product. Thus, we expect the FDA and EMA will make a qualitative assessment of the efficacy and safety data from this study to evaluate whether the results are sufficient to support a BLA or MAA filing. 

Safety evaluations will be performed during the study and will include evaluation of the following: success and kinetics of HSC engraftment; incidence of transplant-related mortality; detection of vector-derived replication of the lentivirus; and characterization and quantification of events related to the location of insertion of the functional gene in target cells. 

If successful, we believe that the results from the Starbeam Study could form the basis of a BLA and an MAA. However, given the current number of subjects and design of the study and the qualitative/subjective assessment of the data, there can be no assurance the FDA or EMA will not require one or more additional clinical studies as a precursor to a BLA application or an MAA, respectively. The FDA has advised us that the Starbeam Study may not be deemed to be a pivotal study or may not provide sufficient support for a BLA submission. The FDA normally requires two pivotal clinical studies to approve a drug or biologic product, and thus the FDA may require that we conduct additional clinical studies of our Lenti-D product candidate prior to a BLA submission. 

The ALD-103 observational study

We are also conducting an observational study of subjects with CALD treated by allogeneic HSCT referred to as the ALD-103 study. This study will collect efficacy and safety outcomes data in patients who are undergoing allogeneic HSCT in a period that is contemporaneous with ALD-102. We anticipate that our Lenti-D product candidate safety and efficacy will be evaluated by the FDA and EMA in light of the data collected in the Starbeam Study as well as our retrospective ALD-101 study and our observational ALD-103 study.

Our Preclinical Research Opportunities in HSCs

We believe our current gene therapy platform will enable us to develop and test new vectors based on similar viral vector backbones that carry different gene sequences for other severe genetic diseases. In this way, we believe that we can advance products efficiently through preclinical into clinical development. We may consider research and development programs targeting other monogenic, genetic diseases that involve cells derived from HSCs for use in the ex vivo setting. These programs may involve severe genetic and rare diseases that could be developed and potentially commercialized on our own.

In addition, we believe our expertise in lentiviral vector production and cell transduction also provides an opportunity to develop new lentiviral products for use in the in vivo setting. In this case, lentiviral vectors carrying certain gene sequences would be delivered directly to the disease site (e.g., to the brain, liver or eye) or into the bloodstream of the patient and, in each case, the vector would need to find the target cell in vivo and deliver the genetic material into those target cells. Although this represents a less controlled environment in which to transduce cells and deliver genetic material, we believe it opens up additional rare disease and large market indications where this approach is more appropriate for the disease and targeted cells. 

&#160;

Our T Cell-Based Immunotherapy Opportunity

We are engaging in the discovery and development of novel, disease-altering gene therapies in oncology. We believe that our gene therapy platform can be applied to genetically modify a patient&#8217;s own T cells to target and destroy cancer cells by recognizing specific cell surface proteins, in the case of chimeric antigen receptors, or CARs, or by recognizing specific protein fragments derived from 

either intracellular or extracellular protein, in the case of T cell receptor s, or TCR s . Since our collaboration arrangement with Celgene was announced in March 2013, we have worked collaboratively to discover, develop and commercialize CAR T cell product candidates in oncology. Our collaboration arrangement with Celgene was amended in June 2015 to focus on CAR T cell product candidates targeting BCMA, a cell surface protein that is expressed on normal plasma cells and on most multiple myeloma cells, but is absent from other normal tissues. In February 2016, we infused the first subject in our Phase I clinical study of our bb2121 product candidate, the first product candidate from this collaboration. Celgene has exercise d its option to exclusively license our bb2121 product candidate, while we have retained an option to co-develop and co-promote this product candidate. In June 2015, we announced a strategic collaboration with Kite Pharma, Inc. to jointly develop and comme rcialize second-generation TCR product candidates against the human papillomavirus type 16 E6 (HPV-16 E6) oncoprotein using our lentiviral and gene editing technologies. We are also independently researching and developing other CAR T product candidates a gainst a variety of targets relevant to both hematologic and solid tumors. 

Immune System and T Cells 

The immune system recognizes danger signals and responds to threats at a cellular level. It is often described as having two arms. The first arm is known as the innate immune system, which recognizes non-specific signals of infection or abnormalities as a first line of defense. The innate immune system is the initial response to an infection, and the response is the same every time regardless of prior exposure to the infectious agent. The second arm is known as the adaptive immune system, which is composed of highly specific, targeted cells and provides long-term recognition and protection from infectious agents and abnormal processes such as cancer. The adaptive immune response is further subdivided into humoral, or antibody based, and cellular, which includes T cell-based immune responses. 

The most significant components of the cellular aspect of the adaptive immune response are T cells, so called because they generally mature in the thymus. T cells are involved in both sensing and killing infected or abnormal cells, as well as coordinating the activation of other cells in an immune response. These cells can be classified into two major subsets, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells, based on cell surface expression of the CD4 or CD8 glycoproteins. Both subsets of T cells have specific functions in mounting an immune response capable of clearing an infection or eliminating cancerous cells. CD4+ T cells, or helper T cells, are generally involved in coordinating the immune response by enhancing the activation, expansion, migration, and effector functions of other types of immune cells. CD8+ T cells, or cytotoxic T cells, can directly attack and kill cells they recognize as infected or otherwise abnormal, and are aided by CD4+ T cells. Both types of T cells are activated when their T cell receptor recognizes and binds to a specific protein structure expressed on the surface of another cell. This protein structure is composed of the major histocompatibility complex, or MHC, and a small protein fragment, or peptide, derived from either proteins inside the cell or on the cell surface. Circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells survey the body differentiating between MHC/peptide structures containing &#8220;foreign&#8221; peptides and those containing &#8220;self&#8221; peptides. A foreign peptide may signal the presence of an immune threat, such as an infection or cancer, causing the T cell to activate, recruit other immune cells, and eliminate the targeted cell. 

Although the immune system is designed to identify foreign or abnormal proteins expressed on tumor cells, this process is either ineffective or defective in cancer patients. The defective process sometimes occurs when cancer cells closely resemble healthy cells and go unnoticed or if tumors lose their MHC protein expression. Additionally, cancer cells employ a number of mechanisms to escape immune detection to suppress the effect of the immune response. Some tumors also encourage the production of cells that suppress the immune response, such as regulatory T cells that block cytotoxic T cells that would normally attack the cancer. 

&#160;

History of Cancer Immunotherapy 

Cancer has historically been treated with surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and hormone therapy. More recently, advances in understanding of the immune system&#8217;s role in cancer have led to immunotherapy becoming an important treatment approach. Cancer immunotherapy began with treatments that nonspecifically activated the immune system and had limited efficacy and/or significant toxicity. In contrast, new immunotherapy treatments can activate specific, important immune cells, leading to improved targeting of cancer cells, efficacy, and safety. Within the immunotherapy category, treatments have included cytokine therapies, antibody therapies, and adoptive cell transfer therapies. 

In 1986, interferon- &#97; became the first cytokine approved for cancer patients. In 1992, interleukin-2, or IL-2, was the second approved cytokine in cancer treatment, showing efficacy in melanoma and renal cell cancer. IL-2 does not kill cancer cells directly, but instead nonspecifically activates and stimulates the growth of the body&#8217;s own T cells which then combat the tumor. Although interferon- &#97; , IL-2, and subsequent cytokine therapies represent important advances in cancer treatment, they are generally limited by toxicity and can only be used in a limited number of cancers and patients. 

Cytokine-based therapies set the stage for immunotherapy, and antibody therapies represented the next significant advance, with targeted specificity and a generally better-tolerated side effect profile. Monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, are designed to attach to proteins on cancer cells, and once attached, the mAbs can make cancer cells more visible to the immune system, block growth signals of cancer cells, stop new blood vessels from forming, or deliver radiation or chemotherapy to cancer cells. The first FDA-approved 

mAb specifically for cancer was rituximab in 1997, and since then, many other antibodies have received approval, including trastuzumab, bevacizumab, alemtuzumab, cetuximab, and panitumumab. More recently, antibodies have been conjugated with cytotoxic drugs to increase activity. The first approved antibody drug conjugate was gemtuzumab ozogamicin in 2000, followed by brentuximab vedotin in 2011 and trastuzumab emtansine in 20 13 . 

The next important advance has been the development of antibodies that target T cell checkpoint pathways, which are means by which cancer cells are able to inhibit or turn down the body&#8217;s immune response to cancer. These treatments have shown an ability to activate T cells, shrink tumors, and improve patient survival. In 2011, ipilimumab became the first checkpoint inhibitor approved by the FDA. Recent clinical data from checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab have confirmed both the approach and the importance of T cells as promising tools for the treatment of cancer. 

Despite these many advances, a significant unmet need in cancer still persists. We believe that the use of human cells as therapeutic entities to re-energize the immune system will be the next significant advancement in the treatment of cancer. These cellular therapies may avoid the long-term side effects associated with current treatments and have the potential to be effective regardless of the type of previous treatments patients have experienced. We are developing CAR and TCR-based approaches using our lentiviral vector gene transfer technology and experience in order to specifically and directly deliver a payload of potent anti-cancer agents to T cells, which may give them the ability to kill the cancer cells. 

&#160;

Our CAR and TCR T Cell Technologies

Like our programs for HSCs, our T cell-based immunotherapies use a customized lentiviral vector to alter T cells ex vivo , or outside the body, so that the T cells can recognize specific proteins or protein fragments on the surface of cancer cells in order to kill these diseased cells. T cells that have been genetically-engineered to make CAR or TCRs are designed to help a patient&#8217;s immune system overcome survival mechanisms employed by cancer cells. CAR T cell technology directs T cells to recognize cancer cells based on expression of specific cell surface antigens, whereas TCR T cell technology provides the T cells with a specific T cell receptor that recognizes protein fragments derived from either intracellular or extracellular proteins. 

With both our CAR and TCR T cell technologies, we harvest a patient&#8217;s white blood cells in a process called leukapheresis, activate certain T cells to grow and then the gene sequences for the CAR or TCR construct are transferred into the T cell DNA using a lentiviral vector. The number of cells is expanded until it reaches the desired dose. These genetically engineered cells, which will express the receptors that can recognize the specific proteins that are characteristic of specific cancers, are then infused back into the patient. Our entire T cell engineering process is rapid (complete in around ten days) and manufactures modified T cells in a sterile closed system. When the engineered T cell is returned to the cancer patient, it engages the target protein on the cancer cell, triggers a series of signals that result in tumor cell killing through the production of anti-cancer cytokines, and undergoes multiple rounds of cell division to greatly expand the number of these anti-cancer T cells. These engineered T cells have the natural &#8220;auto-regulatory&#8221; capability of normal T cells and once the tumor cells containing the target antigen are destroyed, the engineered T cells decrease in number, but with the potential to leave a smaller number of T cells in the body as a form of immune surveillance against potential tumor regrowth. The genetically-engineered T cells are designed to supplement a patient&#8217;s immune system and can be further engineered to overcome immune evasion mechanisms employed by cancer cells.

&#160;

Our CAR and TCR T cell technologies also bring genomic engineering tools to the immunotherapy field. Using our gene editing technology, we have a number of additional options to manipulate the genome of the cancer patient&#8217;s T cells to further increase the specificity of the anti-tumor activity and to potentially make these cells even more potent. Specificity and potency are essential to the development of T cell therapies that can effectively treat solid tumor cancers such as breast, lung and colon cancer. Our cancer immunotherapy research group is staffed by scientists drawn from both industry and academic research centers that have pioneered the field of T cell therapy. This team is focused on the next generation of T cell engineering to discover and develop T cell product candidates to treat a variety of liquid and solid tumor malignancies. &#160; 

&#160;

Our CAR T cell product candidate - bb2121 

We are developing bb2121, our first CAR T cell product candidate, as a potential treatment for multiple myeloma by binding to BCMA, a cell surface protein expressed on cancer cells. Multiple myeloma is a hematologic malignancy that develops in the bone marrow in which normal antibody-producing cells transform into myeloma. The growth of the cancer cells in the bone marrow blocks production of normal blood cells and antibodies, and also causes lesions that weaken the bone. According to the National Cancer Institute, more than 26,000 cases of multiple myeloma are expected in the United States in 2015. BCMA is expressed on normal plasma cells and on most multiple myeloma cells, but is absent from other normal tissues. We believe BCMA presents an attractive immunotherapeutic target for our technology for a number of reasons. In a preclinical BCMA multiple myeloma xenograft model, a single intravenous administration of bb2121 anti-BCMA CAR T cells resulted in rapid and sustained elimination of the tumors with 100 percent survival, while a month-long course of anti-myeloma therapy bortezomib only delayed tumor growth. In December 2015, researchers from the NIH announced promising clinical data in multiple myeloma with an anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy that established clinical proof-of-concept for the BCMA target using a gamma-retroviral vector.

Our product candidate bb2121 is the result of our multi-year c ollaboration with Celgene and in February 2016, Celgene has exercised its option to exclusively develop and commercialize our bb2121 product candidate following the completion of the ongoing CRB-401 Phase I study. We retain an option to co-develop and co-c ommercialize this product candidate, as described more fully below under &#8220;Strategic collaborations&#8212;Our strategic alliance with Celgene.&#8221; 

The CRB-401 clinical study for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma

In February 2016, we treated the first subject in our Phase I clinical study (CRB-401) to examine the safety and efficacy of our bb2121 product candidate in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. The study is a single-dose, open-label, non-randomized, multi-site Phase I clinical study in the United States to determine the maximally tolerated dose and recommended Phase II dose. We expect that up to 40 patients will be enrolled in the CRB-401 study. In order to be eligible for this study, patients must have received 3 prior regimens, including a proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib or carfilzomib) and immunomodulatory agent (lenalidomide or pomalidomide). Following screening, enrolled subjects will undergo a leukapheresis procedure to collect autologous T cells for manufacturing our bb2121 drug product. Following manufacture of our bb2121 drug product, subjects will receive one cycle of lymphodepletion prior to bb2121 infusion. 

&#160;

Our TCR product candidate

In collaboration with Kite Pharma, Inc., we are co-developing and, if approved, co-commercializing, second generation TCR T cell-based therapies directed against an HPV-16 E6 antigen relating to certain cancers associated with the human papillomavirus, or HPV. HPV is the most common viral infection of the reproductive tract, with two viral strains, HPV type 16 and HPV type 18, believed to cause 70% of cervical cancers and precancerous cervical lesions, as well as other urogenital cancers. There were over 500,000 new cases and about 270,000 deaths attributable to cervical cancer worldwide in 2012. Additionally, HPV infection has become established as an etiologic risk factor for oropharyngeal head and neck cancers. The incidence of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancers has been increasing for at least the past decade, and recent studies show that about 70 percent of oropharyngeal cancers may be linked to HPV. According to the Centers for Disease Control, there are over 12,000 new cases of oropharyngeal cancers in the United States a year, of which an estimated 7,500 new cases are attributable to HPV-16. Kite is currently conducting a Phase I/II study of a gamma-retroviral vector-based first generation TCR gene therapy directed against an HPV-16 E6 antigen that is not the subject of this collaboration. Our collaboration with Kite will leverage our lentiviral vector gene transfer platform in combination with gene editing technology. Kite will lead the program in the United States and we will have the option to lead the program in the European Union. Both companies will share overall costs, including research and development and sales and marketing expenses, and profits will be equally split between the companies. Additionally, Kite will have a co-promotion option in the European Union, and we will have a co-promotion option in the United States.

&#160;

Our other preclinical research opportunities in T cell-based immunotherapy

We are pursuing multiple programs that leverage the unique properties of lentiviral vectors to target T cells as a therapy for various cancers. This represents a direct application of our expertise in gene therapy and our capabilities, know-how and patents associated with lentiviral gene therapy and gene editing for ex vivo applications. We are also independently researching and developing other CAR-T product candidates against a variety of targets relevant to both hematologic and solid tumors. 

Our Gene Editing Opportunity 

In June 2014, we acquired Pregenen, a privately-held biotechnology company headquartered in Seattle, Washington. Through the acquisition, we obtained rights to Pregenen&#8217;s gene editing technology platform and cell signaling technology, and have integrated these technologies and research team and expanded its research efforts. We are focused on utilizing homing endonuclease and megaTAL gene editing technologies in a variety of potential applications and disease areas, including for oncology and hematology. Homing endonucleases and MegaTALs are novel enzymes that provide a highly specific and efficient way to modify the genome of a target cell to potentially treat a variety of diseases.

All of the gene-editing technologies currently being explored by the pharmaceutical industry, including zinc finger nucleases, CRISPR/Cas9, and TALENs, share common features of a DNA binding domain and a DNA cleavage domain. They all differ in specificity, size, ease of delivery and as naturally occurring versus engineered nucleases. Homing endonucleases and megaTALs are based on a naturally-occurring class of DNA cleaving enzymes that function as monomeric proteins able to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner and cleave their target site. We believe there are multiple advantages of homing endonucleases and MegaTALs compared to other gene editing technologies, most notably: they are highly specific and efficient in cutting DNA and their compact size simplifies delivery to therapeutically relevant cell types. We are using our gene editing platform, along with collaborations with multiple academic institutions, to potentially discover and develop next generation versions of our current ex vivo gene therapy product candidates, and to potentially expand into new disease indications.

Manufacturing 

Our gene therapy platform has two main components: lentiviral vector production and the target cell transduction process, which results in drug product. 

Our lentiviral manufacturing process 

Our lentiviral vectors are assembled using a human cell line called HEK293T. The HEK293T cells are maintained in disposable flasks until sufficient cell mass has been generated to fill approximately 40 ten tray cell factories, or TTCFs, then transferred and allowed to adhere to the bottom of the trays. Adherent cells are transfected with multiple plasmids encoding all the genetic material required to assemble the lentiviral vector carrying the functional gene of interest. The transfected HEK293T cells then assemble our lentiviral vectors packaged with the functional gene of interest, which bud off into the cell culture media. The media containing the assembled vectors is harvested, purified, concentrated and formulated prior to freezing for storage. These finished lentiviral vectors are what is ultimately used to transduce the targeted cells isolated from the patient. 

We believe that our lentiviral vectors have broad applicability, since the majority of the viral production system can remain the same, while we change only the therapeutic gene &#8220;cassette&#8221; depending on the disease. In other words, the vector &#8220;backbone&#8221; stays the same, while only the therapeutic gene and related sequences are changed. If we were to undertake drug development in an additional indication, we believe we could rapidly move forward using this lentiviral vector backbone and associated assays, simply by switching the therapeutic gene insert and associated control elements. 

Although we intend to continue manufacturing our Lenti-D vectors in TTCFs, we are adapting our LentiGlobin and bb2121 vector production technology to scalable production systems with the potential to satisfy an increased number of subjects per run. So far, we have demonstrated successful production of LentiGlobin and bb2121 vectors on a small scale and are transferring the new process to a contract manufacturer to accommodate future demand for our drug candidates, if approved, in their current indications as well as those beyond our initial focus. 

Our HSC transduction process&#8212;creating the gene-modified HSCs (our drug product) 

The ultimate product of our manufacturing processes is the patient&#8217;s own gene-modified HSC cells, which we refer to as our drug product. The process for producing drug product for our HSC-based product candidates is as follows: 

&#160;

1. 

Selection : We extract HSCs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from the patient&#8217;s blood by apheresis (or alternatively, by bone marrow harvest) following mobilization via a colony stimulating factor. The process is carried out using existing hospital infrastructure and standard protocols currently in place for stem cell transplant procedures, with enhanced controls for extracting the cells to be used for making our drug product. 

&#160;

2. 

Pre-stimulation : The isolated HSCs are treated with a mixture of growth factors that help enable an efficient transduction process. 

&#160;

3. 

Transduction : The isolated, purified and pre-treated HSCs are exposed to our lentiviral vectors containing the appropriate functional gene and additional proprietary elements for a period of time to facilitate transduction and insertion of the therapeutic DNA into the genome of the target cells. 

&#160;

4. 

Final harvest : Once transduction is complete, the gene-modified HSCs are washed and re-suspended into cell culture media to remove any residual impurities. A portion of the harvested cells is removed for quality control release testing, which includes ensuring that transduction was successful and the functional gene delivered by the vector is adequately expressed by the target cells. 

&#160;

5. 

Formulation and freeze : The remaining cells are appropriately formulated and cryopreserved. 

The final step is to return the gene-modified HSCs to the patient. 

Our T cell transduction process&#8212;creating the gene-modified T cells (our drug product) 

The ultimate product of our manufacturing processes is the patient&#8217;s own gene-modified T cells, which we refer to as our drug product. The process for producing drug product for our T cell-based product candidates is as follows: 

&#160;

1. 

Leukapheresis : We collect white blood cells from the patient&#8217;s blood through a process called leukapheresis. The process is carried out using existing hospital infrastructure and standard protocols currently in place for blood donation procedures, with enhanced controls for extracting the cells to be used for making our drug product. 

&#160;

2. 

Activation : The white blood cell mixture, which includes T cells, are treated with proprietary processes to enable an efficient transduction process. 

&#160;

3. 

Transduction : The isolated, purified and pre-treated T cells are exposed to our lentiviral vectors containing the appropriate functional gene for a period of time to facilitate transduction and insertion of the therapeutic DNA into the genome of the target cells. 

&#160;

4. 

Expansion: The transduced T cells are then expanded for a period of approximately one week to increase the number of gene-modified T cells.

&#160;

5. 

Final harvest : The gene-modified T cells are washed and re-suspended into cell culture media to remove any residual impurities. A portion of the harvested cells is removed for quality control release testing, which includes ensuring that transduction was successful and the functional gene delivered by the vector is adequately expressed by the target cells. 

&#160;

6. 

Formulation and freeze : The remaining cells are appropriately formulated and cryopreserved. 

The final step is to return the gene-modified T cells to the patient. 

We rely exclusively on the use of third party manufacturing organizations to manufacture our LentiGlobin, Lenti-D and bb2121 vectors and drug product candidates, and do not own or operate any of our own facilities for these purposes. However, we believe our team of technical personnel has extensive manufacturing, analytical and quality experience as well as strong project management discipline to effectively oversee these contract manufacturing and testing activities, and to compile manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions. 

Strategic collaborations 

Our objective is to develop and commercialize products based on the transformative potential of gene therapy to treat patients with severe genetic and rare diseases and cancer. To access the substantial funding and other resources required to develop and commercialize gene therapy products in these diseases, we have formed, and intend to seek other opportunities to form, strategic collaborations with third parties who can augment our industry leading gene therapy, T cell immunotherapy, lentiviral vector and gene-editing expertise. To date, we have focused on forging a limited number of significant strategic collaborations with leading pharmaceutical companies and academic research centers where both parties contribute expertise to enable the discovery and development of potential product candidates. 

Our collaboration with Celgene 

In March 2013, we announced a strategic collaboration with Celgene to discover, develop and commercialize novel disease-altering gene therapies in oncology, which was amended and restated in June 2015, and amended again in February 2016. The multi-year research and development collaboration focused on applying our expertise in gene therapy technology to CAR T cell-based therapies, to target and destroy cancer cells. Our collaboration now focuses exclusively on anti-BCMA CAR T product candidates. We advanced our development of our bb2121 product candidate, the first CAR product candidate from our collaboration with Celgene, into clinical trials in February 2016. We will also work collaboratively with Celgene on potential next-generation anti-BCMA product candidates under this collaboration. 

Under the terms of the collaboration, for up to two produ ct candidates selected for development under the collaboration, we are and will be responsible for conducting and funding all research and development activities performed up through completion of the initial Phase I clinical study, if any, of such product candidate s, provided that Celgene has agreed to reimburse us a specified amount per patient in the event we and Celgene mutually agree to expand any Phase I clinical trial for any product candidate under the collaboration beyond a specified number of pati ents per clinical trial . This collaboration is governed by a joint steering committee, or JSC, formed by representatives from us and Celgene. The JSC, among other activities, reviews the collaboration program, reviews and evaluates product candidates and a pproves regulatory plans. 

On a product candidate-by-product candidate basis, up through a specified period following enrollment for the first patient in an initial Phase I clinical study for such product candidate, we have granted Celgene an option to obtain an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize such product candidate pursuant to a written agreement, the form of which we have already agreed upon. Effective as of February 2016, Celgene has exercised its option with respect to the bb2121 product candidate, and we have licensed to Celgene the exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize the bb2121 product candidate. We may elect to co-develop and co-promote the product candidate bb2121 and any other product candidates in the United States, provided that, if we do not exercise our option to co-develop and co-promote the product candidate bb2121 in-licensed by Celgene under the collaboration, then we will not be permitted to exercise our option to co-develop and co-promote any future product candidates under the collaboration.

In connection with its exercise of the option to exclusively in-license the bb2121 product candidate, Celgene will pay to us an option fee in the amount of $10.0 million. If Celgene elects to exercise its option to exclusively in-license any additional product candidates, it must pay us an additional $15.0 million per product candidate. In addition to the applicable option fees, Celgene must pay to us an additional fee in the amount of $10.0 million in the event we do not exercise our option to co-develop and co-promote that product candidate in the United States. In addition, for each product candidate that is in-licensed by Celgene, and for which we do not exercise our option to co-develop and co-promote in the United States, we will be eligible to receive up to $10.0 million in clinical milestone payments, up to $117.0 million in regulatory milestone payments and up to $78.0 million in commercial milestone payments. We will also be eligible to receive a percentage of net sales as a royalty in a range from the mid-single digits to low-teens. The royalties payable to us are subject to certain reductions, including for any royalty payments required to be made by Celgene to acquire patent rights, with an aggregate minimum floor. Celgene will assume certain development obligations and must report on their progress in achieving these milestones on a quarterly basis. 

If we do elect to co-develop and co-promote the product candidate within the United States, we would share equally in all costs relating to developing, commercializing and manufacturing the product candidate within the United States and we would share equally in the United States profits. Additionally, if we elect to co-develop and co-promote a product candidate, then the milestones and royalties would decrease compared to those described above. Under this scenario, we would receive per product candidate up to $10.0 million in clinical milestone payments and outside of the United States, up to $54.0 million in regulatory milestone payments and up to $36.0 million in commercial milestone payments. In addition, to the extent any of the product candidates licensed by Celgene and co-developed and co-promoted by us are commercialized, we would be entitled to receive tiered royalty payments ranging from the mid-single digits to low-teens based on a percentage of net sales generated outside of the United States. The royalties payable to us are subject to certain reductions, including any royalty payments required to be made by Celgene to acquire patent rights, with an aggregate minimum floor.

If Celgene does not exercise its option with respect to any product candidate prior to expiration of the applicable option period, then we have the right to develop that product candidate outside the scope of the collaboration. 

Celgene will be solely responsible for all costs and expenses of manufacturing and supplying any optioned product candidates. Subject to customary &#8220;back-up&#8221; supply rights granted to Celgene, we have the sole right to manufacture or have manufactured supplies of vectors and associated payloads manufactured for incorporation into the optioned product candidate. Celgene would reimburse us for our costs to manufacture and supply such vectors and associated payloads, plus a modest mark-up. 

We received an initial up-front payment of $75.0 million from Celgene in connection with the collaboration, plus an additional $25.0 million in connection with the amendment in June 2015. The collaboration term ends in June 2018. Either party may terminate the agreement upon written notice to the other party in the event of the other party&#8217;s uncured material breach. Celgene may terminate the agreement for any reason upon prior written notice to us. If the agreement is terminated, rights to product candidates in development at the time of such termination will be allocated to the parties through a mechanism included in the agreement. In addition, if Celgene terminates the agreement for our breach, any then- existing co-development and co-promotion agreement will be automatically terminated and replaced with a license agreement for such product candidate and any amounts payable by Celgene under any then-existing product license agreements will be reduced. 

Baylor College of Medi cine 

Simultaneous with entering into the collaboration agreement with us, Celgene entered into a strategic collaboration with the Baylor College of Medicine, or Baylor, to discover, develop and commercialize CAR T cell products. We are not a party to this collaboration agreement, although, by virtue of our agreements with Celgene, the joint steering committee under the Baylor-Celgene collaboration agreement will include representatives selected by us, together with representatives selected by each of Celgene and Baylor. Under our collaboration agreement with Celgene, we may develop product candidates covered by the intellectual property rights of Baylor in this field, which intellectual property rights would be in-licensed by Celgene pursuant to its collaboration agreement with Baylor. 

Our collaboration with Kite Pharma

In June 2015, we announced a strategic collaboration with Kite Pharma, Inc. to jointly develop and commercialize second generation TCR product candidates against the human papillomavirus type 16 E6, or HPV-16 E6, oncoprotein. The collaboration will apply our gene editing technology and expertise to modify certain genes to enhance T cell function. In addition, we will explore using lentiviral vectors to optimize delivery of HPV-16 E6 TCRs in patient T cells. Kite will lead the program in the United States, and we will have the option to lead the program in the European Union. Both companies will share overall costs, including research and development, and sales and marketing expenses and profits will be equally split between the companies. Additionally, Kite will have a co-promotion option in the European Union, and we will have a co-promotion option in the United States. 

Intellectual property 

We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology platform and on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of gene therapy that may be important for the development of our business. We additionally rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations, data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and patent term extensions where available. 

Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same. 

We have developed or in-licensed numerous patents and patent applications and possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of gene therapy products. Our proprietary intellectual property, including patent and non-patent intellectual property, is generally directed to, for example, certain genes, transgenes, methods of transferring genetic material into cells, genetically modified cells, processes to manufacture our lentivirus-based product candidates and other proprietary technologies and processes related to our lead product development candidates.

&#160;

&#183; 

bluebird bio. One aspect of the bluebird bio patent portfolio contains patent applications that are potentially applicable to certain aspects of our gene editing platform to produce genome modifying enzymes and genetically modified cells that are potentially applicable to our oncology and other programs. As of January 31, 2016, we co-owned (with Cellectis) two pending U.S. applications and ten corresponding pending foreign patent applications related to our gene editing platform. We expect composition of matter or method patents, if issued from the pending patent applications and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, to expire from 2034 (excluding possible patent term extensions). We expect the other patents and patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid, to expire in 2034 (worldwide, excluding possible patent term extensions). 

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the United States, a patent&#8217;s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. 

The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Moreover, a patent can only be extended once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a BLA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use. 

We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and third parties. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 

License agreements 

Inserm-Transfert 

In May 2009, we entered into an exclusive license with Inserm-Transfert, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Institut national de la sant&#233; et de la recherche m&#233;dicale, for use of certain patents and know-how related to the ABCD1 gene and corresponding protein, for use in the field of human ALD therapy. Inserm-Transfert is referred to herein as Inserm. The Inserm licensed patent portfolio includes one U.S. patent in force. This portfolio has no pending applications. Inserm retains the right to practice the intellectual property licensed under the agreement for educational, clinical and preclinical studies purposes. 

Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, which we expect would include our Lenti-D product candidate, we will be obligated to pay Inserm a percentage of net sales as a royalty for the longer of the life of any patents covering the product or 10 years from first commercial sale. This royalty is in the low single digits. The royalties payable to Inserm are subject to reduction for any third party payment s required to be made, with a minimum floor in the low single digits. 

We are required to use all commercially reasonable efforts to develop licensed products and introduce them into the commercial market as soon as practical, consistent with our reasonable business practices and judgment in compliance with an agreed upon development plan. We have assumed certain development, regulatory and commercial milestone obligations and must report on our progress in achieving these milestones on an annual basis. 

We may unilaterally terminate the license agreement at any time. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the other party&#8217;s material breach which remains uncured after 60 days of receiving written notice of such breach or in the event the other party become subject of a voluntary or involuntary petition in bankruptcy and such petition is not dismissed with prejudice within 120 days after filing. In addition, Inserm may terminate the license agreement in the event that we cannot prove within 60 days of written notice from Inserm that we have been diligent in developing the licensed products and introducing them into the commercial market. 

Absent early termination, the agreement will automatically terminate upon the expiration of all issued patents and filed patent applications within the patent rights covered by the agreement or 10 years from the date of first commercial sale of a licensed product, whichever is later. The license grant ceases in connection with any such termination. The longest lived patent rights licensed to us under the agreement are currently expected to expire in 2016. 

Institut Pasteur 

We have entered into a license with Institut Pasteur for certain patents relating to the use of DNA sequences, lentiviral vectors and recombinant cells in the field of ex vivo gene therapy and CAR T cell-based therapy in a range of indications, excluding vaccinations. This agreement was amended twice in 2012, again in 2013 and most recently in 2015. The Institut Pasteur licensed patent portfolio includes at least 83 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications. Any patents within this portfolio that have issued or may yet issue would have a statutory expiration dates between 2019 and 2023. The license is exclusive for products containing human and non-human lentiviral vectors. Institut Pasteur retains the right, on behalf of itself, its licensees and research partners, to conduct research using the licensed intellectual property. 

We have the right to grant sublicenses outright to third parties under the agreement. For the first sublicense including a product targeting &#946;-hemoglobinopathies (including TDT and severe SCD) or ALD (including CALD and AMN), we must pay Institut Pasteur an additional payment of &#8364;3.0 million. If we receive any income (cash or non-cash) in connection with sublicenses for products targeting indications other than &#946;-hemoglobinopathies (including TDT and severe SCD) or ALD (including CALD and AMN), we must pay Institut Pasteur a percentage of such income varying from low single digits if the sublicense also includes licenses to intellectual property controlled by us, and a percentage of sublicense income in the mid-range double digits if the sublicense does not include licenses to intellectual property controlled by us. 

Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, which we expect would include our LentiGlobin and Lenti-D product candidates, we will be obligated to pay Institut Pasteur a percentage of net sales as a royalty. This royalty varies depending on the indication of the product but in any event is in the low single digits. In addition, starting in 2016 we must make under this agreement an annual maintenance payment which is creditable against royalty payments on a year-by-year basis. If the combined royalties we would be required to pay to Institut Pasteur and third parties is higher than a pre-specified percentage, we may ask Institut Pasteur to re-negotiate our royalty rates under this relationship. 

We are required to use all reasonable commercial efforts (as compared to a company of similar size and scope) to develop and commercialize one or more products in the license field and to obtain any necessary governmental approvals in respect of, and market the products in license field, if any. Additionally, we have assumed certain development and regulatory milestone obligations. We must report on our progress towards achieving these milestones on an annual basis. We may unilaterally terminate the license agreement at any time by sending Institut Pasteur 90 days prior written notice. Either party may terminate the license in the event of the other party&#8217;s substantial breach which remains uncured after 60 days of receiving written notice of such breach. Institut Pasteur may also terminate the agreement in the event bankruptcy proceedings are opened against us and not dismissed within 60 days. 

Absent early termination, the agreement will automatically terminate upon the expiration of the last licensed patents or five years after first market authorization of the first product, whichever occurs later. In the event the agreement is terminated, while the license grant would cease, we would retain the right to manufacture, import, use and sell licensed products for a certain period of time post-termination. In addition, our ownership stake in certain jointly made improvements covered by the licensed patents would survive termination of the agreement. The longest lived patent rights licensed to us under the agreement are currently expected to expire in 2023. 

Stanford University 

In July 2002, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, referred to herein as Stanford, which we amended and restated in April 2012. Under this agreement, we are granted a license to use the HEK293T cell line for any commercial or non-commercial use for research, nonclinical and clinical development purpose and human and animal gene therapy products. 

We have the right to grant sublicenses outright to third parties under the agreement. For each such sublicense we grant, we must pay Stanford a fee (unless the sublicense is to a collaborating partner, contract manufacturer or contract research organization). 

Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, which we expect would include our Lenti-D product candidate, we will be obligated to pay Stanford a percentage of net sales as a royalty. This royalty varies with net sales but in any event is in the low single digits and is reduced for each third-party license that requires payments by us with respect to a licensed product, provided that the royalty to Stanford is not less than a specified percentage which is less than one percent. Since April 2013, we have been paying Stanford an annual maintenance fee, which will be creditable against our royalty payments. 

We may unilaterally terminate the agreement by giving Stanford 30 days&#8217; written notice. Stanford may also terminate the license agreement if after 30 days of providing notice we are delinquent on any report or payment, are not using commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture and/or commercialize one or more licensed products, are in material breach of any provision or provide any false report. Termination of this agreement may require us to utilize different cell types for vector manufacturing, which could lead to delays. 

Absent early termination, the license will expire in April 2037. We may elect to extend the term for an additional 25 years so long as we have a commercial product on the market at that time and we are in material compliance with the license agreement. 

Massachusetts Institute of Technology 

In December 1996, we entered into an exclusive license with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, referred to herein as MIT, for use of certain patents in any field. This license agreement was amended in December 2003, May 2004 and June 2011. The licensed patent portfolio includes at least 20 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications. Any patents within this portfolio that have issued or may yet issue would have a statutory expiration date in 2023. This license also has been amended to include a case jointly owned by MIT and us wherein we received the exclusive license to MIT&#8217;s rights in this case. MIT retains the right to practice the intellectual property licensed under the agreement for noncommercial research purposes. 

We have the right to grant sublicenses outright to third parties under the agreement. In the event we sublicense the patent rights, we must pay MIT a percentage of all payments we receive from by the sublicensee. This percentage varies from mid-single digits to low double digits. 

Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, which we expect would include our LentiGlobin product candidate, we will be obligated to pay MIT a percentage of net sales by us or our sublicensees as a royalty. This royalty is in the low single digits and is reduced for royalties payable to third parties, provided that the royalty to MIT is not less than a specified percentage that is less than one-percent. In addition, we make under this agreement an annual maintenance payment which may be credited against the royalty payments. 

We are required to use diligent efforts to market licensed products and to continue active, diligent development and marketing efforts for licensed products during the term of the agreement. We have assumed certain milestones with respect to raising capital investment and regulatory progress. We must report on our progress on achieving these milestones on an annual basis. 

We may unilaterally terminate the license agreement upon six months&#8217; notice to MIT. MIT may terminate the agreement if we cease to carry on our business, or in the event of our material breach which remains uncured after 90 days of receiving written notice of such breach (30 days in the case of nonpayment). In the event the agreement is terminated, while the license grant would cease, we would retain a right to complete manufacture of any licensed products in process and sell then-existing inventory. In addition, MIT would grant our sublicensees a direct license following such termination. With respect to jointly owned intellectual property, any termination would allow MIT to grant licenses to any third party to such intellectual property, without our approval, unless a sublicensee was already in place, in which case, MIT would grant our sublicensees a direct license. 

Research Development Foundation 

In December 2011, we entered into an exclusive license with RDF to use certain patents that involve lentiviral vectors. The RDF licensed patent portfolio includes at least 25 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications. Any patents within this portfolio that have issued or may yet issue would have an expected statutory expiration date between 2021 and 2027. RDF retains the right, on 

behalf of itself and other nonprofit academic research institutions, to practice and use the license d patents for any academic, non clinical research and educational purposes. We have the right to grant sublicenses outright to third parties under the agreement. 

Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, which we expect would include both our Lenti-D and LentiGlobin product candidates, we are obligated to pay RDF a percentage of net sales as a royalty. This royalty is in the low single digits and is reduced by half if during the following ten years from the first marketing approval the last valid claim within the licensed patent that covers the licensed product expires or ends. 

We are required to use commercially reasonable and diligent efforts for a company of our size and resources to develop or commercialize one or more licensed products, including our first licensed product by 2016 and a second licensed product by 2018. These diligence efforts include minimum annual royalty payments to RDF, which are creditable against earned royalties otherwise due to RDF, and payments upon regulatory milestones. 

RDF may terminate the agreement in the event of our material breach which remains uncured after 90 days of receiving written notice of such breach (30 days in the case of nonpayment) or in the event we become bankrupt, our business or assets or property are placed in the hands of a receiver, assignee or trustee, we institute or suffer to be instituted any procedure in bankruptcy court for reorganization or rearrangement of our financial affairs, make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or if we or an affiliate or a sublicensee institutes any procedure challenging the validity or patentability of any patent or patent application within the licensed patents, the agreement will immediately terminate. 

Absent early termination, the agreement will continue until its expiration upon the later of there being no more valid claims within the licensed patents or the expiration of our royalty obligations on licensed products that are subject to an earned royalty, if such earned royalty is based on the minimum 10-year royalty period described above. In the event the agreement is terminated, while the license grant would cease, RDF will grant our sublicensees a direct license. The longest lived patent rights licensed to us under the agreement are in one U.S. patent currently expected to expire in 2027. 

Competition 

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by intense and rapidly changing competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Not only must we compete with other companies that are focused on gene therapy products but any products that we may commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 

There are other organizations working to improve existing therapies or to develop new therapies for our initially selected indications. Depending on how successful these efforts are, it is possible they may increase the barriers to adoption and success for our LentiGlobin, Lenti-D and bb2121 product candidates, if approved and our preclinical T cell-based immunotherapy product candidates. These efforts include the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

&#223;-thalassemia: The current standard of care for the treatment of &#223;-thalassemia in the developed world is chronic blood transfusions to address the patient&#8217;s anemia. In addition, such patients often receive iron chelation therapy to help manage the iron overload associated with their chronic blood transfusions. We understand that established biopharmaceutical companies, such as Novartis AG and ApoPharma Inc., who provide the leading iron chelation therapy, are seeking to develop improvements to their product profile and accessibility. In addition, some patients with &#223;-thalassemia receive HSCT treatment, particularly if a sufficiently well-matched source of donor cells is identified. Approaches to reduce the risk of complications from allogeneic HSCTs are under investigation, including BPX-501, a modified donor T cell therapy in an ongoing Phase I/II study being supported by Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. A number of different approaches are under investigation to improve treatment options, including iron modulating agents and fetal hemoglobin regulators. There are also several different groups developing gene therapy approaches for &#223;-thalassemia. Some of these groups use a similar ex vivo autologous approach, but make use of different vectors and different cell processing techniques. These include: GlaxoSmithKline Plc, which has entered into an agreement with the San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy to advance several gene therapy programs, including one for &#223;-thalassemia; Memorial Sloan Kettering, which received clearance for its IND from the FDA in 2012 for a Phase I/II gene therapy study; and Sangamo BioSciences Inc. (through its partnership with Biogen Idec), which has announced plans to initiate a Phase I clinical study using zinc finger nuclease-mediated gene-editing techniques in hemoglobinopathies including &#223;-thalassemia, Acceleron Pharma, Inc., which is investigating Luspatercept (ACE-536), a subcutaneously-delivered protein therapeutic that targets molecules in the TGF-&#946; superfamily, in a Phase III clinical trial in subjects with &#223;-thalassemia. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Sickle cell disease: The current standard of care for the treatment of SCD in the developed world is chronic blood transfusions or hydroxyurea (a generic drug). In addition, such patients often receive iron chelation therapy to help manage the iron overload associated with chronic blood transfusions. We are aware of ongoing studies that continue to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydroxyurea in various populations. In addition, some patients with SCD receive allogeneic HSCT treatment, particularly if a sufficiently well-matched source of donor cells is identified. We understand that various biopharmaceutical companies and 

&#160;

academic centers around the world are seek ing to develop improvements to allogeneic HSCT, including BPX-501 , a modified donor T cell therapy in an ongoing Phase I/II study being supported by Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc . A number of different therapeutic approaches are under investigation targeti ng the various aspects of SCD pathophysiology, including: pan-selectin inhibitors, including GMI-1070 in Phase II studies supported by GlycoMimetics Inc. (in 2011, Pfizer Inc. and GlycoMimetics Inc. entered a global collaboration to advance this compound); hemoglobin modifiers to prevent the sickling of RBC, including GBT440 in a Phase I/II study supported by Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc. ; and also gene editing approaches being supported by Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (in collaboration with Novartis AG), Editas Medicine, Inc. and CRISPR Therapeutics, Inc. (in collaboration with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated) . There are also several different groups developing gene therapy approaches for SCD. Some of these groups use a similar ex vivo autologous approach, but make use of different vectors and different cell processing techniques. These include: UCLA, which has received funding from the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine to pursue a Phase I gene therapy study for SCD; and Cin cinnati Children&#8217;s Hospital Medical Center, which is conducting a Phase I/II gene therapy study for SCD and Sangamo BioSciences Inc. ( through i ts partnership with Biogen Idec) which has announced plans to investigate the use of zinc finger nuclease-mediate d gene-editing techniques in hemoglobinopathies including SCD, although to our knowledge no clinical studies have been initiated. 

&#160;

&#183; 

CALD: The current standard of care for the treatment of CALD is allogeneic HSCT. We understand that various academic centers around the world are seeking to develop improvements to allogeneic HSCT. In addition, some physicians recommend glyceryl trierucate&#8212;better known as Lorenzo&#8217;s Oil&#8212;to patients diagnosed with ALD or AMN. However, Lorenzo&#8217;s Oil has not been clinically proven to address the cerebral symptoms of ALD, and has not been approved by any major regulatory agency as a prescription drug. There are efforts underway to obtain FDA approval for Lorenzo&#8217;s Oil as a prescription drug. 

&#160;

&#183; 

T cell-based immunotherapies for oncology: A number of pharmaceutical companies and academic collaborators are researching and developing T cell-based immunotherapies for oncology, including Novartis AG (in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania), Adaptimmune Inc., Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (in collaboration with Celgene, Memorial Sloan Kettering and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center), Kite Pharma, Inc. (in collaboration with Amgen, Inc. and the National Institutes of Health), Pfizer Inc. (through their collaboration with Cellectis SA and Servier), among others. Many of the T cell-based immunotherapy programs being developed by these companies are already in Phase I/II clinical trials for multiple indications. 

Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and the commercialization of those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors&#8217; treatments may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any treatment we may commercialize and may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our treatments. 

These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 

We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any treatments that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 

Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. If our therapeutic product candidates are approved, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products. 

Government regulation 

In the United States, biological products, including gene therapy products, are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&#38;C Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&#38;C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products. FDA approval must be obtained before clinical testing of biological products, and each clinical study protocol for a gene therapy product is reviewed by the FDA and, in some instances, the NIH, through its RAC. FDA 

approval also must be obtained before mar keting of biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and w e may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals. 

Within the FDA, the CBER regulates gene therapy products. The CBER works closely with the NIH and its RAC, which makes recommendations to the NIH on gene therapy issues and engages in a public discussion of scientific, safety, ethical and societal issues related to proposed and ongoing gene therapy protocols. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. The FDA also has published guidance documents related to, among other things, gene therapy products in general, their preclinical assessment, observing subjects involved in gene therapy studies for delayed adverse events, potency testing, and chemistry, manufacturing and control information in gene therapy INDs. 

Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 

U.S. biological products development process 

The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an application for an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin; 

&#160;

&#183; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to the FDA&#8217;s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical studies; 

&#160;

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with GMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA&#8217;s current good tissue practices, or GTPs, for the use of human cellular and tissue products; 

&#160;

&#183; 

potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA. 

Before testing any biological product candidate, including a gene therapy product, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. 

Where a gene therapy study is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documentation is submitted to and the study is registered with the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA, however many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH is responsible for convening the RAC, a federal advisory committee that discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety or ethical considerations, at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC&#8217;s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA web site and may be accessed by the public. 

The clinical study sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve 

any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. With gene therapy protocols , if the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC de cides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies. 

Clinical studies involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor&#8217;s control. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical study will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical studies must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed. Clinical studies also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment. 

Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase I . The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase II . The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase III . Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 

Post-approval clinical studies, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. The FDA recommends that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by ten years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire, of study subjects. 

During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor&#8217;s initial receipt of the information. Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical studies may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 

Human gene therapy products are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the study period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the studies in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of human gene therapy products, or that the data generated in these studies will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval. The NIH has a publicly accessible database, the Genetic Modification Clinical Research Information System which includes information on gene transfer studies and serves as an electronic tool to facilitate the reporting and analysis of adverse events on these studies.

Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the i ntroduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producin g quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and t ested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

U.S. review and approval processes 

After the completion of clinical studies of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA, must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 

Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with GMP to assure and preserve the product&#8217;s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required. 

Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For a gene therapy product, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with the GTPs. These are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical studies were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure GMP, GTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control. 

Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distr ibution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical studies, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical studies, designed to furth er assess a biological product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 

One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA is to review 90% of standard BLAs in 10 months and 90% of priority BLAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. 

Orphan drug designation 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 

If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor&#8217;s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, benefits. 

Expedited development and review programs 

The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. 

Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Under the Breakthrough Therapy program, products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may be eligible for the benefits of the Fast Track program when preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates that such product may have substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. Additionally, FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product receives timely advice and interactive communications to help the sponsor design and conduct a development program as efficiently as possible. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint 

other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biol ogical product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 

Post-approval requirements 

Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to GMP. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the GMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products, include reporting of GMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer&#8217;s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. 

We also must comply with the FDA&#8217;s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product&#8217;s approved labeling (known as &#8220;off-label use&#8221;), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 

Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain GMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 

U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity 

Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#8217;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA. 

A biological product can obta in pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, m ay be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued &#8220;Written Request&#8221; for such a study. 

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Affordable Care Act, signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the PHS Act attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA. 

A reference biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18 months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the applicant&#8217;s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics&#8217; patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period. 

Additional regulation 

In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations. 

U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. 

Government regulation outside of the United States 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. 

Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. In the European Union, for example, a CTA must be submitted for each clinical trial to each country&#8217;s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country&#8217;s requirements, the corresponding clinical study may proceed. 

The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 

To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, region-specific document requirements. The European Union also provides opportunities 

for market exclusivity. For example, in the European Union, upon receiving marketing authorization, innovative medicinal products generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivi ty. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator&#8217;s data to assess a generic or biosimilar application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator&#8217;s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union&#8217;s regulatory authorities to be an innovative medicinal product , and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Products receiving orphan designation in the European Union can receive ten years of market exclusivity, during which time no similar medicinal product for the same indication may be placed on the market. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the European Union for pediatric studies. No extension to any supplementary protection cer tificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications. 

The criteria for designating an &#8220;orphan medicinal product&#8221; in the European Union are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 

The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if: 

&#160;

&#183; 

The second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; 

&#160;

&#183; 

The applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or 

&#160;

&#183; 

The applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. 

For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 

The EMA has established the Adaptive Pathways program intended to expedite or facilitate either an initial approval of a drug in a well-defined patient subgroup with a high medical need and subsequent widening of the indication to a larger patient population, or an early regulatory approval (e.g., conditional approval), which is prospectively planned, and where uncertainty is reduced through the collection of post-approval data on a drug&#8217;s use in patients. The approach builds in regulatory processes already in place within the existing EU legal framework.

If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
