 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

GENERAL 

&#160; 

As described below Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State in January 2016 whereby it amended its Articles of Incorporation by decreasing all of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of one (1) share for every one hundred (100) shares held. The share amounts herein are adjusted to reflect such decrease. 

America Resources Exploration Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated on January 24, 2014, under the laws of the State of Nevada to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, with the specific intended business activity of operating photo booth rentals. The Company was incorporated under the name &#8220;Alazzio Entertainment Corp.&#8221; and changed its name to America Resources Exploration Inc. on April 29, 2015. 

On April 3, 2015, a change in control of Alazzio Entertainment Corp. (the "Company") occurred by virtue of the Company's largest shareholder, Dmitri Kapsumun selling 900,000 shares (split adjusted) of the Company's common stock to Rise Fast Limited, a Hong Kong corporation. Such shares represent 71.77% of the Company's total issued and outstanding shares of common stock. As part of the sale of the shares, Rise Fast Limited arranged with the resigning member of the Company's Board of Directors, to appoint Mr. Huang Yu as the sole officer and director of the Company. 

On April 16, 2015, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State (the "Nevada SOS") whereby it amended its Articles of Incorporation by increasing the Company's authorized number of shares of common stock from 75 million to 300 million (not adjusted for the one (1) for one hundred (100) stock split) and increasing all of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of fifteen (15) shares for every one (1) share held. The Company's Board of Directors approved this amendment on April 15, 2015 and shareholders holding 71.77% of the Company's issued and outstanding shares approved this amendment via a written consent executed on April 16, 2015. 

On April 17, 2015, the Company filed Articles of Merger with the Nevada SOS whereby it entered into a statutory merger with its wholly-owned subsidiary, America Resources Exploration Inc. pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes 92A.200 et. seq. The effect of such merger is that the Company was the surviving entity and changed its name to "America Resources Exploration Inc." 

On June 10, 2015, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Asset Purchase Agreement&#8221;) with Zheng Xiangwu, a resident of Guang Dong Province, China, whereby the Company issued 40,000 million shares of its common stock in exchange for rights to certain oil and gas leases located in Frio and Atascosa Counties, Texas, consisting of a total of 714 total acres of land, two (2) working wells and a total of seven (7) wells (the &#8220;Leases&#8221;). 

On June 12, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of the Leases pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement. As a result of the completion of this acquisition, 40,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock were issued to Mr. Zheng Xiangwu, who owns the Company&#8217;s largest shareholder, Rise Fast Limited. The number of shares issued to Mr. Zheng was determined by valuing the Leases at $160,000 and valuing the Company&#8217;s stock at $0.04 per share. 

&#160; 

Mr. Zheng is the owner of Rise Fast Limited, a Hong Kong corporation (&#8220;Rise Fast&#8221;), which is the majority shareholder of the Company. Rise Fast owns 900,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. As a result of the transaction consummated pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, Mr. Zheng controlled a total of 940,000 shares, which represented 72.64% of the Company&#8217;s issued and outstanding shares at that time. 

In addition to a change in control of its management and shareholders and entering into the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company's operations prior to entering into the Asset Purchase Agreement were limited to attempting to implement its business plan, issuing shares and filing a registration statement on Form S-1 pursuant to the Securities Act of 1934. 

In connection with the completion of the acquisition of the Leases pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company has elected to enter into the oil and gas industry. Our primary objective is to enter the oil and gas industry by acquiring active oil and gas fields. This first step will allow us to enter the market in the U.S. and create immediate cash flow from producing wells. The Company intends to take advantage of currently depressed energy prices by taking over fields from companies that are unable to service their excessive debt due to falling oil prices. 

On June 11, 2015 the Company entered into various assignment agreements with Mr. Zheng for the acquisition of multiple oil and gas leases and overriding royalty interests (&#8220;ORR&#8217;s&#8221;) as set out in the table below. From July 6, 2015 through July 9, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of such oil and gas leases and ORR&#8217;s, whereby the Company issued a total of 6,500 shares of its common stock to Mr. Zheng. The Company valued the transaction at the market price of the shares as at the date of issue, or $0.15 per share for a total value of $97,500. The Company capitalized the historical cost of the acquired assets totaling $51,263 and recorded a loss on acquisition of $46,237.

&#160; 

On August 13, 2015 the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Inceptus Resources, LLC whereunder the Company acquired a 78% net revenue interest in 200 acres located in Callahan County, Texas, and a 78% net revenue interest in 522 acres also located in Callahan County, Texas. In respect of the acquired leases the Company issued a total of 5,000 shares of common stock on the closing date, August 19, 2015, which shares were valued at market price on the date of the transaction, totaling $448,500, which amount was capitalized. As at September 30, 2015 the Company evaluated the capitalized value of the leases and determined to impair the amount in full due to the fact that the Company had no historical cost basis for the leases, and no immediate development plans for the lease land. A total of $448,500 has been expensed as Impairment loss on oil and gas lease in the third quarter. 

In order to assist the Company&#8217;s entry into the oil and gas industry, the Company added Joe M. Seabourn and Robert Wiener to its Board of Directors in June 2015. Mr. Weiner resigned from the Board of Directors in November 2015 and Mr. Seabourn resigned from the Board of Directors in December 2015. The resignations of Messrs. Weiner and Seabourn were not due to any disagreements of any nature with the Company. 

On January 20, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State (the "Nevada SOS") whereby it amended its Articles of Incorporation by decreasing all of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of one (1) share for every one hundred (100) shares held. The Company's Board of Directors approved this amendment on January 13, 2016 and shareholders holding 68.65% of the Company's issued and outstanding shares approved the amendment via a written consent executed on January 14, 2016. 

On January 20, 2016, the Company filed Articles of Merger with the Nevada SOS whereby it entered into a statutory merger with its wholly-owned subsidiary, PetroGas Company pursuant to Nevada Revised Statutes 92A.200 et. seq. The effect of such merger is that the Company was the surviving entity and changed its name from America Resources Exploration Inc. to "PetroGas Company". 

Both the reverse stock split and name change described above were effected in the market by FINRA effective March 7, 2016, which also resulted in changing the Company&#8217;s ticker symbol to &#8220;PTCO&#8221;. 

CURRENT INVESTMENTS 

On June 12, 2015, t he Company acquired three (3) producing leases covering 714 acres situated in Atascosa and Frio Counties, Texas, located in the Eagle Ford Shale formation - the Jane Burns &#8220;C&#8221; (&#8220;Burns&#8221;), the Theo Rogers &#8220;C&#8221;, and the Theo Rogers &#8220;A&#8221; &#38; &#8220;D&#8221; (&#8220;Rogers&#8221;) Leases. The Company acquired a 99.5% working interest (74.625% net revenue interest) in each lease. 

The Burns and Rogers Leases provide exploration and production opportunities in the Kyote Field pay zone, very near the Eagle Ford Shale play with access to available rig crews and other vendor-servicers, due to their close proximity to San Antonio, Texas. 

The Burns and Rogers Leases hold collectively seven (7) oil wells, but none of which are operating wells. Although Company&#8217;s management and industry professionals believed at the time that they were acquired that the Company could double or triple previous production on these wells, depressed oil prices indicate that the cost to bring these wells online an uneconomical venture. 

&#160; 

Future Operations 

&#160;

Management continues to consider plans to reactive the inactive wells through a rework program on the Leases. Additional rights may be leased out from mineral owner to deeper zones near 5,000 feet and below. However, such plans are subject to raising financing of $500,000 to pay for such rework plans and an analysis of potential income based on projected oil prices in the future.

&#160; 

Future Expansion 

&#160; 

The Company is actively seeking to acquire producing and non-producing leases that will allow us to explore and drill in high-profile pay zones. 

&#160; 

We intend to raise capital at a low cost from private placements so that we may acquire numerous additional leases, and to commence drilling, and taking advantage of the inevitable uptick in oil prices to come. 

&#160; 

In the current climate, the Company believes that there are a very large number of oil &#38; gas leases under distress due to the depressed gas prices and that we can strategically position the Company to acquire as many of these leases as possible at a discount to market value, hence creating shareholder value. 

&#160; 

We are planning an exploration strategy to drill new wells on the current Leases, as well as acquire deeper rights in order to drill some of the wells at great depths. We expect that reservoirs at those depths could yield a very high daily output of oil.
