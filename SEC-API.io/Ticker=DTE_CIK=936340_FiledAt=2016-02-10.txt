ELECTRIC 

Description 

DTE Energy's Electric segment consists principally of DTE Electric, an electric utility engaged in the generation, purchase, distribution, and sale of electricity to approximately 2.2 million &#32;customers in southeastern Michigan. DTE Electric is regulated by numerous federal and state governmental agencies, including, but not limited to, the MPSC, the FERC, the NRC, the EPA, and the MDEQ. Electricity is generated from fossil-fuel plants, a hydroelectric pumped storage plant, a nuclear plant, wind and other renewable assets and is supplemented with purchased power. The electricity is sold, or distributed through the retail access program, to three major classes of customers: residential, commercial, and industrial, throughout southeastern Michigan.

&#32;6 

Weather, economic factors, competition, energy efficiency initiatives, and electricity prices affect sales levels to customers. DTE Electric's peak load and highest total system sales generally occur during the third quarter of the year, driven by air conditioning and other cooling-related demands. DTE Electric's operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers, and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on the results of DTE Electric. 

Fuel Supply and Purchased Power 

DTE Electric's power is generated from a variety of fuels and is supplemented with purchased power. DTE Electric expects to have an adequate supply of fuel and purchased power to meet its obligation to serve customers. DTE Electric's generating capability is heavily dependent upon the availability of coal. Coal is purchased from various sources in different geographic areas under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms. DTE Electric expects to obtain the majority of its coal requirements through long-term contracts, with the balance to be obtained through short-term agreements and spot purchases. DTE Electric has long-term and short-term contracts for the purchase of approximately 37.9 million tons of low-sulfur western coal and approximately 3.0 million tons of Appalachian coal to be delivered from 2016 to 2021. All of these contracts have pricing schedules. DTE Electric has approximately 98% of the expected coal requirements for 2016 under contract. Given the geographic diversity of supply, DTE Electric believes it can meet its expected generation requirements. DTE Electric leases a fleet of rail cars and has the expected western coal rail requirements under contract through 2018. All of the expected eastern coal rail requirements are under contract through 2016. Contracts covering expected vessel transportation requirements for delivery of purchased coal to electric generating facilities are under contract through 2019. 

DTE Electric participates in the energy market through MISO. DTE Electric offers its generation in the market on a day-ahead and real-time basis and bids for power in the market to serve its load. DTE Electric is a net purchaser of power that supplements its generation capability to meet customer demand during peak cycles or during major plant outages. 

Properties 

DTE Electric owns generating facilities that are located in the State of Michigan. Substantially all of DTE Electric's property is subject to the lien of a mortgage.

(e) 

In addition to the owned renewable facilities described above, DTE Electric has long-term contracts for 487 MW of renewable power generated from wind, solar, and biomass facilities. 

DTE Electric expects to retire Trenton Channel Unit 7 (110 MW) in April 2016. Over the next fifteen years, DTE Electric expects to retire additional coal-fired generation and to increase the proportion of its generation mix attributable to natural gas-fired generation and renewables. DTE Electric acquired two simple-cycle natural gas facilities in 2015. In January 2015, DTE Electric acquired a 732 MW simple-cycle natural gas facility in Carson City, Michigan (Montcalm County) that was placed in service in 2002 and 2003. In October 2015, DTE Electric acquired a 350 MW simple-cycle natural gas facility in East China Township, Michigan (St. Clair County) that was placed in service in 2002. These acquisitions are included in Natural gas and Oil-fueled Peaking Units in the table above. See Note 4 &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, " Acquisitions and Exit Activities ". 

DTE Electric owns and operates 676 distribution substations with a capacity of approximately 33,729,000 kilovolt-amperes (kVA) and approximately 432,500 line transformers with a capacity of approximately 23,472,000 kVA.

There are numerous interconnections that allow the interchange of electricity between DTE Electric and electricity providers external to the DTE Electric service area. These interconnections are generally owned and operated by ITC Transmission, an unrelated company, and connect to neighboring energy companies. 

Regulation 

DTE Electric is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of various agencies, including, but not limited to, the MPSC, the FERC, and the NRC. The MPSC issues orders pertaining to rates, recovery of certain costs, including the costs of generating facilities and regulatory assets, conditions of service, accounting, and operating-related matters. DTE Electric's MPSC-approved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs, plus an authorized rate of return on investments. The FERC regulates DTE Electric with respect to financing authorization and wholesale electric activities. The NRC has regulatory jurisdiction over all phases of the operation, construction, licensing, and decommissioning of DTE Electric's nuclear plant operations. DTE Electric is subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety, the environment, and health. 

See Notes 7, 8, 11, and 17 &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, " Asset Retirement Obligations ", " Regulatory Matters ", " Fair Value ", and " Commitments and Contingencies ". 

Energy Assistance Programs 

Energy assistance programs, funded by the federal government and the State of Michigan, remain critical to DTE Electric&#8217;s ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses. DTE Electric&#8217;s uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of government-funded assistance that qualifying customers receive. DTE Electric works continuously with the State of Michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to customers is representative of the number of low-income individuals in the service territory. DTE Electric also partners with federal, state, and local officials to attempt to increase the share of low-income funding allocated to customers. 

Strategy and Competition 

DTE Electric's electrical generation operations seek to provide the energy needs of customers in a cost effective manner. With potential capacity constraints in the MISO region, there will be increased dependency on DTE Electric's generation to provide reliable service and price stability for customers. This generation will require a large investment due to DTE Electric's aging coal fleet along with increased environmental regulations. 

DTE Electric's distribution operations focus is on distributing energy in a safe, cost effective, and reliable manner to customers. DTE Electric seeks to increase operational efficiencies to increase customer satisfaction at an affordable rate. 

The electric retail access program in Michigan gives electric customers the option of retail access to alternative electric suppliers, subject to limits. Customers with retail access to alternative electric suppliers represented approximately 10% of retail sales in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 &#32;and consisted primarily of industrial and commercial customers. MPSC rate orders and 2008 energy legislation enacted by the State of Michigan have placed a 10% cap on the total retail access related migration, mitigating some of the unfavorable effects of electric retail access on DTE Electric's financial performance and full service customer rates. DTE Electric expects that customers with retail access to alternative electric suppliers will represent approximately 10% of retail sales in 2016 . 

&#32;9 

Competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the on-site generation of industrial customers and from distributed generation applications by industrial and commercial customers. DTE Electric does not expect significant competition for distribution to any group of customers in the near term. 

Revenues from year to year will vary due to weather conditions, economic factors, regulatory events, and other risk factors as discussed in the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A. of this Report. 

GAS 

Description 

DTE Energy's Gas segment consists principally of DTE Gas, a natural gas utility engaged in the purchase, storage, transportation, distribution, and sale of natural gas to approximately 1.2 million &#32;residential, commercial, and industrial customers throughout Michigan, and the sale of storage and transportation capacity.

&#8226; 

End-user transportation &#8212; &#32;Gas delivery service provided primarily to large-volume commercial and industrial customers. Additionally, the service is provided to residential customers and small-volume commercial and industrial customers who have elected to participate in the gas retail access program. End-user transportation customers purchase natural gas directly from marketers, producers, or brokers and utilize DTE Gas' pipeline network to transport the gas to their facilities or homes. 

&#8226; 

Intermediate transportation &#8212; &#32;Gas delivery service is provided to producers, brokers, and other gas companies that own the natural gas, but are not the ultimate consumers. Intermediate transportation customers use DTE Gas' high-pressure transportation system to transport the natural gas to storage fields, pipeline interconnections, or other locations. 

&#8226; 

Storage and other &#8212; &#32;Includes revenues from natural gas storage, appliance maintenance, facility development, and other energy-related services. 

DTE Gas' gas sales, end-user transportation, and intermediate transportation volumes, revenues, and Net Income, are impacted by weather. Given the seasonal nature of the business, revenues and Net Income are concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year. By the end of the first quarter, the heating season is largely over, and DTE Gas typically realizes substantially reduced revenues and earnings in the second quarter and losses in the third quarter. The impacts of changes in average customer usage are minimized by the RDM. 

DTE Gas operations are not dependent upon a limited number of customers, and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on the results of DTE Gas. 

Natural Gas Supply 

DTE Gas' gas distribution system has a planned maximum daily send-out capacity of 2.4 Bcf, with approximately 66% of the volume coming from underground storage for 2015 . Peak-use requirements are met through utilization of storage facilities, pipeline transportation capacity, and purchased gas supplies. Because of the geographic diversity of supply and its pipeline transportation and storage capacity, DTE Gas is able to reliably meet supply requirements. DTE Gas believes natural gas supply and pipeline capacity will be sufficiently available to meet market demands in the foreseeable future. 

&#32;10 

DTE Gas purchases natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers, and maintains a diversified portfolio of natural gas supply contracts. Supplier, producing region, quantity, and available transportation diversify DTE Gas' natural gas supply base. Natural gas supply is obtained from various sources in different geographic areas (Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, Canada, and Michigan) under agreements that vary in both pricing and terms. Gas supply pricing is generally tied to the New York Mercantile Exchange and published price indices to approximate current market prices combined with MPSC-approved fixed price supplies with varying terms and volumes through 2018. 

DTE Gas is directly connected to interstate pipelines, providing access to most of the major natural gas supply producing regions in the Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, and Canadian regions. The primary long-term transportation supply contracts at December 31, 2015 are as follows:

Properties 

DTE Gas owns distribution, storage, and transportation properties that are located in the State of Michigan. The distribution system includes approximately 19,000 miles of distribution mains, approximately 1,165,000 service pipelines, and approximately 1,314,000 active meters, and DTE Gas owns approximately 2,000 miles of transmission pipelines that deliver natural gas to the distribution districts and interconnect DTE Gas storage fields with the sources of supply and the market areas. 

DTE Gas owns storage properties relating to four underground natural gas storage fields with an aggregate working gas storage capacity of approximately 141 Bcf. These facilities are important in providing reliable and cost-effective service to DTE Gas customers. In addition, DTE Gas sells storage services to third parties. 

Most of DTE Gas' distribution and transportation property is located on property owned by others and used by DTE Gas through easements, permits, or licenses. Substantially all of DTE Gas' property is subject to the lien of a mortgage. 

DTE Gas leases a portion of its pipeline system to the Vector Pipeline Partnership (an affiliate) through a capital lease arrangement. See Note 16 &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of the Report, " Capital and Operating Leases ". 

Regulation 

DTE Gas is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the MPSC, which issues orders pertaining to rates, recovery of certain costs, including the costs of regulatory assets, conditions of service, accounting, and operating-related matters. DTE Gas' MPSC-approved rates charged to customers have historically been designed to allow for the recovery of costs, plus an authorized rate of return on investments. DTE Gas operates natural gas storage and transportation facilities in Michigan as intrastate facilities regulated by the MPSC and provides intrastate storage and transportation services pursuant to an MPSC-approved tariff. 

DTE Gas also provides interstate storage and transportation services in accordance with an Operating Statement on file with the FERC. The FERC's jurisdiction is limited and extends to the rates, non-discriminatory requirements, and the terms and conditions applicable to storage and transportation provided by DTE Gas in interstate markets. FERC granted DTE Gas authority to provide storage and related services in interstate commerce at market-based rates. DTE Gas provides transportation services in interstate commerce at cost-based rates approved by the MPSC and filed with the FERC. 

DTE Gas is subject to the requirements of other regulatory agencies with respect to safety, the environment, and health. 

See Notes 8 and 17 &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, " Regulatory Matters " and " Commitments and Contingencies ". 

&#32;11 

Energy Assistance Program 

Energy assistance programs, funded by the federal government and the State of Michigan, remain critical to DTE Gas' ability to control its uncollectible accounts receivable and collections expenses. DTE Gas' uncollectible accounts receivable expense is directly affected by the level of government-funded assistance its qualifying customers receive. DTE Gas works continuously with the State of Michigan and others to determine whether the share of funding allocated to customers is representative of the number of low-income individuals in the gas service territory. DTE Gas also partners with federal, state, and local officials to attempt to increase the share of low-income funding allocated to DTE Gas customers. 

Strategy and Competition 

DTE Gas' strategy is to ensure the safe, reliable, and cost effective delivery of natural gas service within its franchised markets in Michigan. In addition, DTE Gas is promoting the extension of its distribution system to under served markets and the increased use of natural gas furnaces, water heaters, and appliances within its current customer base. DTE Gas continues to focus on the reduction of operating costs and the delivery of energy efficiency products and services to its customers, making natural gas service the preferred fuel and even more affordable for its customers. 

Competition in the gas business primarily involves other natural gas transportation providers, as well as providers of alternative fuels and energy sources. The primary focus of competition for end-user transportation is cost and reliability. Some large commercial and industrial customers have the ability to switch to alternative fuel sources such as coal, electricity, oil, and steam. If these customers were to choose an alternative fuel source, they would not have a need for DTE Gas' end-user transportation service. DTE Gas competes against alternative fuel sources by providing competitive pricing and reliable service, supported by its storage capacity. 

Having an extensive transportation pipeline system has enabled marketing of DTE Gas' storage and transportation services to gas producers, marketers, distribution companies, end-user customers, and other pipeline companies. The business operates in a central geographic location with connections to major Midwestern interstate pipelines that extend throughout the Midwest, eastern United States, and eastern Canada. 

DTE Gas' storage capacity is used to store natural gas for delivery to its customers, and is also sold to third parties under a variety of arrangements. Prices for storage arrangements for shorter periods are generally higher, but more volatile, than for longer periods. Prices are influenced primarily by market conditions, weather, and natural gas pricing.

Gas Storage and Pipelines also provides interstate services in accordance with an Operating Statement on file with the FERC. Vector and Millennium Pipelines provide interstate transportation services in accordance with their FERC-approved tariffs. In addition, Vector is subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations in Canada. NEXUS Pipeline, when operational, will also provide interstate transportation services in accordance with their FERC-approved tariffs. In Pennsylvania, Gas Storage and Pipelines' gathering and pipeline assets are subject to the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. Bluestone Pipeline is regulated in the state of New York by the New York Public Service Commission. 

Strategy and Competition 

Gas Storage and Pipelines expects to continue its steady growth plan by expanding existing assets, acquiring and/or developing new assets that are typically supported with long-term customer commitments. Gas Storage and Pipelines has competition from other pipelines and storage providers. The focus will be on opportunities in the Midwest to Northeast region to supply natural gas to meet growing demand. Much of the growth in demand for natural gas is expected to occur in the Eastern Canada and the Northeast U.S. regions. Gas Storage and Pipelines believes that the Vector and Millennium Pipelines are well positioned to provide access routes and low-cost expansion options to these markets. In addition, Gas Storage and Pipelines believes that Millennium Pipeline is well positioned for growth in production from the Marcellus Shale, especially with respect to Marcellus production in Northern Pennsylvania. Gas Storage and Pipelines has an agreement with Southwestern Energy Production Company to support its Bluestone Pipeline and Susquehanna gathering system. DTE Energy expects to continue steady growth in the Gas Storage and Pipelines business and is evaluating new pipeline and storage investment opportunities that could include additional Millennium and Vector expansions and laterals, Bluestone compression and laterals, Susquehanna gathering expansions, and other Marcellus/Utica shale midstream development or partnering opportunities, such as the NEXUS Pipeline. Gas Storage and Pipelines' operations are dependent upon a limited number of customers, and the loss of any one or a few customers could have a material adverse effect on the results of Gas Storage and Pipelines.

ENERGY TRADING 

Description 

Energy Trading focuses on physical and financial power and gas marketing and trading, structured transactions, enhancement of returns from its asset portfolio and optimization of contracted natural gas pipeline transportation, and storage positions. Energy Trading also provides natural gas, power, and related services which may include the management of associated storage and transportation contracts on the customers&#8217; behalf and the supply or purchase of renewable energy credits to various customers. Energy Trading's customer base is predominantly utilities, local distribution companies, pipelines, producers and generators, and other marketing and trading companies. Energy Trading enters into derivative financial instruments as part of their marketing and hedging activities. These financial instruments are generally accounted for under the MTM method, which results in the recognition in earnings of unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of the derivatives. Energy Trading utilizes forwards, futures, swaps, and option contracts to mitigate risk associated with marketing and trading activity, as well as for proprietary trading within defined risk guidelines. Energy Trading also provides commodity risk management services to the other businesses within DTE Energy. 

Significant portions of the Energy Trading portfolio are economically hedged. Most financial instruments and physical power and natural gas contracts are deemed derivatives; whereas, natural gas inventory, contracts for pipeline transportation, renewable energy credits, and storage assets are not derivatives. As a result, this segment will experience earnings volatility as derivatives are marked-to-market without revaluing the underlying non-derivative contracts and assets. The business&#8217; strategy is to economically manage the price risk of these underlying non-derivative contracts and assets with futures, forwards, swaps, and options. This results in gains and losses that are recognized in different interim and annual accounting periods. 

&#32;15 

Regulation 

Energy Trading has market-based rate authority from the FERC to sell power and blanket authority from the FERC to sell natural gas at market prices. Energy Trading is subject to FERC reporting requirements and market behavior rules. Energy Trading is also subject to the applicable laws, rules, and regulations related to the CFTC, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and DOE. In addition, Energy Trading is subject to applicable laws, rules, and regulations in Canada. 

Strategy and Competition 

DTE Energy's strategy for the Energy Trading business is to deliver value-added services to DTE Energy customers. DTE Energy seeks to manage this business in a manner complementary to the growth of DTE Energy's other business segments. Energy Trading focuses on physical marketing and the optimization of its portfolio of energy assets. The segment competes with electric and gas marketers, financial institutions, traders, utilities, and other energy providers. The Energy Trading business is dependent upon the availability of capital and an investment grade credit rating. DTE Energy believes it has ample available capital capacity to support Energy Trading activities. DTE Energy monitors its use of capital closely to ensure that its commitments do not exceed capacity. A material credit restriction would negatively impact Energy Trading's financial performance. Competitors with greater access to capital, or at a lower cost, may have a competitive advantage. DTE Energy has risk management and credit processes to monitor and mitigate risk. 

CORPORATE AND OTHER

Air &#32;&#8212; DTE Electric is subject to the EPA ozone and fine particulate transport and acid rain regulations that limit power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. The EPA and the State of Michigan have issued emission reduction regulations relating to ozone, fine particulate, regional haze, mercury, and other air pollution. These rules have led to additional emission controls on fossil-fueled power plants to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide, with further emission controls planned for reductions of mercury and other emissions. These rulemakings could require additional controls for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and other hazardous air pollutants over the next few years. 

&#32;16 

The EPA is implementing regulatory actions under the Clean Air Act to address emissions of GHGs from the utility sector and other sectors of the economy. Among these actions, the EPA has finalized performance standards for emissions of carbon dioxide from new and existing electric generating units (EGUs). The carbon standards for new sources are not expected to have a material impact on DTE Electric, since DTE Electric has no plans to build new coal-fired generation and any potential new gas generation will be able to comply with the standards. It is not possible to determine the potential impact of the final carbon standards (also known as the EPA Clean Power Plan) on existing sources at this time. Pending or future legislation or other regulatory actions could have a material impact on DTE Electric's operations and financial position and the rates charged to its customers. Impacts include expenditures for environmental equipment beyond what is currently planned, financing costs related to additional capital expenditures, the purchase of emission credits from market sources, higher costs of purchased power, and the retirement of facilities where control equipment is not economical. DTE Electric would seek to recover these incremental costs through increased rates charged to its utility customers, as authorized by the MPSC. 

Water &#32;&#8212; The EPA finalized regulations on cooling water intake in August 2014. DTE Electric is conducting studies to determine the best technology for reducing the environmental impacts of the cooling water intake structures at each of its facilities. DTE Electric may be required to install technologies to reduce the impacts of the cooling water intakes. 

Contaminated and Other Sites &#8212; Prior to the construction of major interstate natural gas pipelines, gas for heating and other uses was manufactured locally from processes involving coal, coke, or oil. The facilities, which produced gas, have been designated as MGP sites. DTE Gas owns, or previously owned, fourteen such former MGP sites. DTE Electric owns, or previously owned, three former MGP sites. DTE Energy anticipates the cost amortization methodology approved by the MPSC for DTE Gas, which allows DTE Gas to amortize the MGP costs over a ten-year period beginning with the year subsequent to the year the MGP costs were incurred, will prevent environmental costs from having a material adverse effect on DTE Energy's operations. DTE Electric believes the likelihood of a material change to the accrued amount is remote based on current knowledge of the conditions at each of its sites. 

The Registrants are also in the process of cleaning up other sites where contamination is present as a result of historical and ongoing utility operations. These other sites include an engineered ash storage facility, electric distribution substations, gas pipelines, electric generating power plants, and underground and aboveground storage tank locations. Cleanup activities associated with these sites will be conducted over the next several years. Any significant change in assumptions, such as remediation techniques, nature and extent of contamination, and regulatory requirements, could impact the estimate of remedial action costs for these sites and affect the Registrants' financial position and cash flows and the rates charged to their customers. 

Coal Combustion Residuals and Effluent Limitations Guidelines &#8212; In April 2015, the EPA published a final rule for the disposal of coal combustion residuals, commonly known as coal ash. The rule became effective in October 2015. The rule is based on the continued listing of coal ash as a non-hazardous waste and relies on various self-implementation design and performance standards. DTE Electric owns and operates 3 &#32;permitted engineered coal ash storage facilities to dispose of coal ash from coal-fired power plants and operates a number of smaller impoundments at its power plants. At certain facilities, the rule requires the installation of monitoring wells, compliance with groundwater standards, and the closure of basins at the end of the useful life of the associated power plant. At other facilities, the rule requires ash laden waters be moved from earthen basins to steel and concrete tanks. 

In November 2015, the EPA finalized effluent limitations guidelines for the steam electric power generating industry which may require additional controls to be installed between 2018 and 2023. The initial costs to comply with this rule have been developed and included in the Coal Combustion Residual and Effluent Limitations Guidelines amount in the above table. 

See Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis in Item 7 of this Report and Notes 7, 8, and 17 &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report, " Regulatory Matters ", " Asset Retirement Obligations ", and " Commitments and Contingencies ". 

EMPLOYEES 

DTE Energy had approximately 10,000 employees as of December 31, 2015 , of which approximately 4,900 &#32;were represented by unions. DTE Electric had approximately 4,500 &#32;employees as of December 31, 2015 , of which approximately 2,600 &#32;were represented by unions. There are several bargaining units for DTE Energy&#8217;s represented employees. The majority of represented employees for both DTE Energy and DTE Electric are under contracts that expire in 2016 and 2017.
