(a) General &#160;

The terms, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221;, &#8220;Presidential&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221; refer to the present Presidential Realty Corporation or its predecessor company of the same name and to any subsidiaries. Since 1982, we have elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;) for Federal and State income tax purposes. See (e) Qualification as a REIT . We own, directly or indirectly, interests in real estate and interests in entities which own real estate.

&#160;

(b) Recent Developments &#160;

During 2015, we continued to explore ways to grow the Company through various forms of transactions with owners of significant apartment portfolios in furtherance of management&#8217;s strategy to grow the Company. During the year management has broadened its focus to all types of real estate assets and capital raising activities and intends to continue to do so going forward.

&#160;

No transactions were consummated during 2015.

&#160;

Mapletree Financing 

On July 28, 2015, Palmer-Mapletree LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into a Loan Agreement (the &#8220;Loan Agreement&#8221;) with Natixis Real Estate Capital LLC providing for a mortgage loan in the principal amount of $1,750,000 (the &#8220;Loan&#8221;) at an interest rate of 6.031%. $934,794 of the loan proceeds were used to repay the prior mortgage loan and line of credit with Country Bank for Savings. The Loan replaces the prior loan agreement and mortgage on the Mapletree Property which was entered into on June 8, 2012 with Country Bank for Savings. $123,757 of the Loan proceeds were set aside for capital improvements and reserves for the property. We received net proceeds of $585,125. The Loan matures on August 5, 2025 and requires monthly payments of $11,308. The outstanding balance of the loan at December 31, 2015 was $1,740,462. The Company is required to maintain certain Financial Covenants. The Company was in compliance with the covenants at December 31, 2015.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

(c) Business Generally &#160;

At December 31, 2015, the Company had a loss from continuing operations. This combined with a history of operating losses and working capital deficiency, has been detrimental to our operations and could potentially affect our ability to meet our obligations and continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the successful execution of strategies to achieve profitability and to increase working capital by raising debt and/or equity. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from this uncertainty.

&#160;

We have only one business segment: our real estate interests. Our principal assets fall into the following categories:

&#160;

(i) Ownership of Rental Properties at December 31, 2015: $516,125 ($1,118,345 net of accumulated depreciation) which is approximately 37% of our assets is in rental properties wholly owned by us. At December 31, 2015, this consisted of our ownership of the Mapletree Industrial Center located in Palmer, Massachusetts. This is a multi-tenant rental facility which was originally the Wickwire-Spencer Wire Mill until 1970 at which time it became rental space. The property consists of 31 buildings located on approximately 48 acres. Major tenants include National Fiber, Creative Material Technologies office and lab, New England Promotional Marketing and Fulfillment Plus, Consolidated Lumber Transport office, Eastern States Associates office, ESSROC Materials (a Portland cement distributor) and American Cable Assembly. The property offers traditional office space and industrial/warehouse space along with vacant land with rail access ready for development. As of December 31, 2015, the property had 96% occupancy. The buildings comprise a total of 418,679 square feet, of which 393,488 is rentable. The property has a carrying value of $1,118,345, less accumulated depreciation of $602,220, resulting in a net carrying value of $516,125 at December 31, 2015. See Properties below. &#160;

(ii) Cash: At December 31, 2015, we had $442,922 in cash, which is approximately 32% of our assets. (See Investment Strategies below.) &#160;

Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), a REIT that meets certain requirements is not subject to Federal income tax on that portion of its taxable income that is distributed to its shareholders, if at least 90% of its &#8220;real estate investment trust taxable income&#8221; (exclusive of capital gains) is so distributed. Since January 1, 1982, the Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT. We sustained losses in 2015 and 2014 and, accordingly, did not pay any dividends in 2015 and 2014.

&#160;

While we intend to operate in such a manner as to be taxed as a REIT, and to pay dividends in an amount sufficient to maintain REIT status, we cannot promise that we will, in fact, continue to be taxed as a REIT or that the Company will have cash available to pay any dividends that may be required to maintain REIT status. We were not required to pay any dividends in 2015, and believe that we will not be required to pay dividends in 2016 to maintain our REIT status. See ( e) Qualification as a REIT and Item 5. - Market for Registrant&#8217;s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. 

&#160;

We currently maintain a website at www.presrealty.com. We file annual, quarterly and periodic reports, proxy statements and other information electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;), which filings are available at the SEC&#8217;s website (http://www.sec.gov.) free of charge, or at its public reference room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Please call the SEC 1-800-SEC-0330 for further information about the public reference room.

&#160;

(d) Investment Strategies &#160;

Our general investment strategy is to continue our REIT status, make investments in real estate assets that offer attractive current yields and, in some cases, potential for capital appreciation. Management plans to utilize its experience in real estate investing to grow our asset base.

&#160;

Our investment policy is not contained in or subject to restrictions included in the Company&#8217;s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws and there are no limits in the Company&#8217;s Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws on the percentage of assets that it may invest in any one type of asset or the percentage of securities of any one issuer that it may acquire. The investment policy may, therefore, be changed by our Board of Directors of the Company without the concurrence of the holders of its outstanding stock. However, to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must restrict our activities to those permitted under the Code. See (e) Qualification as a REIT .

&#160;

(e) Qualification as a REIT &#160;

Since 1982, we have operated in a manner intended to permit us to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 to 860 of the Code. We intend to continue to operate in a manner to continue to qualify as a REIT. However, we cannot promise that we will be able to continue to operate in such a manner or to remain qualified.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In any year that we qualify as a REIT and meet other conditions, including the distribution to stockholders of at least 90% of our &#8220;real estate investment trust taxable income&#8221; (excluding long-term capital gains but before a deduction for dividends paid), we will be entitled to deduct the distributions that we pay to our stockholders in determining our ordinary income and capital gains that are subject to Federal income taxation (see Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ). Income not distributed is subject to tax at rates applicable to a domestic corporation. In addition, we are subject to an excise tax (at a rate of 4%) if the amounts actually or deemed distributed during the year do not meet certain distribution requirements. In order to receive this favorable tax treatment, the Company must restrict our operations to those activities that are permitted under the Code and to the holding of assets that a REIT is permitted to hold.

&#160;

We cannot promise that we will continue to be taxed as a REIT, that we will have sufficient cash to pay dividends in order to maintain REIT status or that we will make cash distributions in the future. In addition, even if we continue to qualify as a REIT, the Board of Directors has the discretion to determine whether or not to distribute long-term capital gains and other types of income not required to be distributed in order to maintain REIT tax treatment.

&#160;

(f) Competition &#160;

The real estate business is highly competitive in all respects. In all phases of our business we face competition from companies with greater financial and other resources. To the extent that we seek to acquire additional properties or originate new loans, we face competition from other potential purchasers or lenders with greater financial resources. 

&#160;

Obtaining tenants for our rental property is also highly competitive. We face competition from newer buildings and from property owners who have more financial resources available to them for capital improvements to their properties.

&#160;

(g) Employees &#160;

At December 31, 2015, we employed 4 people, two of whom are employed at our executive office and two of whom are employed at an individual property site.
