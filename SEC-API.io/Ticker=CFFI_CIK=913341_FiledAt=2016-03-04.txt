 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

C&#38;F Financial Corporation (the Corporation) is a bank holding company that was incorporated in March 1994 under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Corporation owns all of the stock of Citizens and Farmers Bank (the Bank or C&#38;F Bank), which is an independent commercial bank chartered under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. C&#38;F Bank originally opened for business under the name Farmers and Mechanics Bank on January 22, 1927. C&#38;F Bank has the following five wholly-owned subsidiaries, all incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

C&#38;F Mortgage Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Certified Appraisals LLC and Lender Solutions LLC 

&#160; 

&#183; 

C&#38;F Finance Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary C&#38;F Remarketing LLC 

&#160; 

&#183; 

C&#38;F Wealth Management Corporation (formerly C&#38;F Investment Services, Inc.) 

&#160; 

&#183; 

C&#38;F Insurance Services, Inc. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

CVB Title Services, Inc. 

&#160; 

On October 1, 2013, the Corporation acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Central Virginia Bankshares, Inc. (CVBK) in an all-cash transaction in which CVBK shareholders received $0.32 for each share of CVBK common stock they owned, or approximately $846,000 in the aggregate. In addition, the Corporation purchased from the U.S. Treasury for $3.4 million all of CVBK's preferred stock and warrants issued to the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program (CPP). CVBK was a one-bank holding company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. CVBK owned all of the stock of Central Virginia Bank (CVB), which was an independent commercial bank chartered under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. On March 22, 2014, CVBK was merged with and into C&#38;F Financial Corporation and CVB was merged with and into C&#38;F Bank. 

&#160; 

The Corporation operates in a decentralized manner in three principal business activities: (1) retail banking through C&#38;F Bank, (2) mortgage banking through C&#38;F Mortgage Corporation (C&#38;F Mortgage) and (3) consumer finance through C&#38;F Finance Company (C&#38;F Finance). For detailed information about the financial condition and results of operations of these segments, see &#8220;Note 18. Business Segments&#8221; in Item 8. &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; in this report. The following general business discussion focuses on the activities within each of these segments. 

&#160; 

In addition, the Corporation conducts brokerage activities through C&#38;F Wealth Management Corporation, insurance activities through C&#38;F Insurance Services, Inc. and title insurance services through CVB Title Services, Inc. The financial position and operating results of any one of these subsidiaries are not significant to the Corporation as a whole and are not considered principal activities of the Corporation at this time. 

&#160; 

The Corporation also owns three non-operating subsidiaries, C&#38;F Financial Statutory Trust II (Trust II) formed in December 2007, C&#38;F Financial Statutory Trust I (Trust I) formed in July 2005, and Central Virginia Bankshares Statutory Trust I (CVBK Trust I) formed in December 2003. These trusts were formed for the purpose of issuing $10.0 million each for Trust II and Trust I of the Corporation&#8217;s junior subordinated debt securities and $5.0 million for CVBK Trust I of junior subordinated debt securities originally issued by CVBK, and assumed by the Corporation when CVBK was merged into the Corporation on March 22, 2014, with all such issuances occurring in private placements to institutional investors. All three trusts are unconsolidated subsidiaries of the Corporation. The principal assets of these trusts are $10.3 million each for Trust II and Trust I and $5.2 million for CVBK Trust I of the Corporation&#8217;s junior subordinated debt securities (such securities of the Corporation referred to herein as &#8220;trust preferred capital notes&#8221;) that are reported as liabilities of the consolidated Corporation. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Retail Banking 

&#160; 

We provide retail banking services through C&#38;F Bank. C&#38;F Bank provides retail banking services at its main office in West Point, Virginia, and 24 Virginia branches located one each in Cartersville, Chester, Cumberland, Hampton, Mechanicsville, Newport News, Norge, Powhatan, Providence Forge, Quinton, Saluda, Sandston, West Point and Yorktown, two in Williamsburg, four in Richmond and four in Midlothian. These branches provide a wide range of banking services to individuals and businesses. These services include various types of checking and savings deposit accounts, as well as business, real estate, development, mortgage, home equity and installment loans. The Bank also offers ATMs, internet and mobile banking and debit and credit cards, as well as safe deposit box rentals, notary public, electronic transfer and other customary bank services to its customers. Revenues from retail banking operations consist primarily of interest earned on loans and investment securities and fees related to deposit services. At December 31, 2015, assets of the Retail Banking segment totaled $1.23 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2015, net income for this segment totaled $5.6 million. 

&#160; 

Mortgage Banking 

&#160; 

We conduct mortgage banking activities through C&#38;F Mortgage, which was organized in September 1995. C&#38;F Mortgage provides mortgage loan origination services through 1 0 locations in Virginia, two in Maryland and one in North Carolina. The Virginia offices are located one each in Charlottesville, Fishersville, Fredericksburg, Glen Allen, Harrisonburg, Lynchburg, Newport News and Williamsburg, and two in Midlothian. The Maryland offices are located in Annapolis and Waldorf. The North Carolina office is located in Gastonia. C&#38;F Mortgage offers a wide variety of residential mortgage loans, which are originated for sale generally to the following investors: Wells Fargo Home Mortgage; Franklin American Mortgage Company; Penny Mac Corporation; and the Virginia Housing Development Authority (VHDA). C&#38;F Mortgage does not securitize loans. C&#38;F Bank may also purchase mortgage loans from C&#38;F Mortgage. C&#38;F Mortgage originates conventional mortgage loans, mortgage loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (the FHA), and mortgage loans guaranteed by the United States Department of Agriculture (the USDA) and the Veterans Administration (the VA). A majority of the conventional loans are conforming loans that qualify for purchase by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). The remainder of the conventional loans are non-conforming in that they do not meet Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac guidelines, but are eligible for sale to various other investors. Through its subsidiary, Certified Appraisals LLC, C&#38;F Mortgage provides ancillary mortgage loan origination services for residential appraisals and through its subsidiary, Lender Solutions LLC, provides certain mortgage origination functions to third parties . Revenues from mortgage banking operations consist principally of gains on sales of loans to investors in the secondary mortgage market, loan origination fee income and interest earned on mortgage loans held for sale. At December 31, 2015, assets of the Mortgage Banking segment totaled $58.2 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, net income for this segment totaled $677,000. 

&#160; 

Consumer Finance 

&#160; 

We conduct consumer finance activities through C&#38;F Finance. C&#38;F Finance is a regional finance company providing automobile loans throughout Virginia and in portions of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia through its offices in Richmond and Hampton, Virginia, in Nashville, Tennessee and in Hunt Valley, Maryland. C&#38;F Finance is an indirect lender that provides automobile financing through lending programs that are designed to serve customers in the &#8220;non-prime&#8221; market who have limited access to traditional automobile financing. C&#38;F Finance generally purchases automobile retail installment sales contracts from manufacturer-franchised dealerships with used-car operations and through selected independent dealerships. C&#38;F Finance selects these dealers based on the types of vehicles sold. Specifically, C&#38;F Finance prefers to finance later model, low mileage used vehicles because the initial depreciation on new vehicles is extremely high. The typical borrowers on the retail installment sales contracts purchased have experienced prior credit difficulties. Because C&#38;F Finance serves customers who are unable to meet the credit standards imposed by most traditional automobile financing sources, C&#38;F Finance typically charges interest at higher rates than those charged by traditional financing sources. As C&#38;F Finance provides financing in a relatively high-risk market, it expects to experience a higher level of credit losses than traditional automobile financing sources. Revenues from consumer finance operations consist principally of interest earned on automobile loans. At December 31, 2015, assets of the Consumer 

&#160;

Finance segment totaled $295.4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, net income for this segment totaled $7.2 million. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, we employed 598 full-time equivalent employees. We consider relations with our employees to be excellent. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Retail Banking 

&#160; 

In the Bank&#8217;s market area, we compete with large national and regional financial institutions, savings associations and other independent community banks, as well as credit unions, mutual funds, brokerage firms and insurance companies. Increased competition has come from out-of-state banks through their acquisition of Virginia-based banks and interstate branching, and expansion of community and regional banks into our service areas. 

&#160; 

The banking business in Virginia, and in the Bank&#8217;s primary service area in the Hampton to Richmond corridor, is highly competitive for both loans and deposits, and is dominated by a relatively small number of large banks with many offices operating over a wide geographic area. Among the advantages such large banks have are their ability to finance wide-ranging advertising campaigns, to maximize efficiencies through economies of scale and, by virtue of their greater total capitalization, to have substantially higher lending limits than the Bank. 

&#160; 

Factors such as interest rates offered, the number and location of branches and the types of products offered, as well as the reputation of the institution, affect competition for deposits and loans. We compete by emphasizing customer service and technology, establishing long-term customer relationships, building customer loyalty, and providing products and services to address the specific needs of our customers. We target individual and small-to-medium size business customers. 

&#160; 

No material part of the Bank&#8217;s business is dependent upon a single or a few customers, and the loss of any single customer would not have a materially adverse effect upon the Bank&#8217;s business. 

&#160; 

Mortgage Banking 

&#160; 

C&#38;F Mortgage competes with large national and regional banks, credit unions, smaller regional mortgage lenders and small local broker operations. Due to the increased regulatory and compliance burden, the industry has seen a consolidation in the number of competitors in the marketplace. The agency guidelines for sales of mortgages in the secondary market business continue to be stringent. 

&#160; 

The competitive factors faced by C&#38;F Mortgage have changed and will likely continue to change due to regulatory reforms and initiatives, including but not limited to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act). The Dodd-Frank Act affects many aspects of mortgage finance regulation, which has changed and may continue to result in changes to the competitive landscape in the future. The many modifications introduced have required or will require extensive rulemaking, and the full effect of the regulatory reforms and initiatives, the Dodd-Frank Act and the full effect of the related compliance burden will not be known for some time to come. The reforms to mortgage lending encompass broad new restrictions on lending practices and loan terms, amend price thresholds for certain lending segments, require new disclosure forms and procedures for all mortgages, and mandate stronger legal liabilities in connection with real estate finance. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB) to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages, including a determination of the borrower's ability to repay (for which the finalized rules became effective in January 2014), and allows borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; as defined by the Dodd-Frank Act and CFPB regulations. While C&#38;F Mortgage is continuing to evaluate all aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations issued pursuant thereto and by the CFPB, such legislation and regulations could materially and adversely affect the manner in which it conducts its mortgage business, result in heightened federal regulation and oversight of its business activities, and result in increased costs and potential litigation associated with its business activities. Given the far-reaching 

&#160;

effect of the Dodd-Frank Act and CFPB regulations on mortgage finance, compliance with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and CFPB regulations may require substantial changes to mortgage lending systems and processes and other implementation efforts. As an example of one such change, during 2015, C&#38;F Mortgage implemented drastically new processes and systems in order to comply with the CFPB&#8217;s Integrated Mortgage Disclosure Rules Under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Truth in Lending Act (TRID), which became effective October 2015. TRID applies to most closed-end mortgage loans, which is the emphasis of C&#38;F Mortgage&#8217;s activities. 

&#160; 

To operate profitably in this competitive and regulatory environment, lenders must have a high level of operational and risk management skills and be able to attract and retain top mortgage origination talent. C&#38;F Mortgage competes by attracting the top people in sales and operations in the industry, providing an infrastructure that manages regulatory changes efficiently and effectively, offering a product menu that is both competitive in loan parameters as well as price, and providing consistently high quality customer service. 

&#160; 

No material part of C&#38;F Mortgage&#8217;s business is dependent upon a single customer and the loss of any single customer would not have a materially adverse effect upon C&#38;F Mortgage&#8217;s business. Further, C&#38;F Mortgage has implemented strategies to mitigate potential disruption in C&#38;F Mortgage's direct or indirect access to the secondary market for residential mortgage loans. C&#38;F Mortgage, like all residential mortgage lenders, would be affected by the inability of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the FHA or the VA to purchase or guarantee loans. Although C&#38;F Mortgage sells loans to various intermediaries, the ability of these aggregators to purchase or guarantee loans would be limited if these government-sponsored entities cease to exist or materially limit their purchases or guarantees of mortgage loans or suffer deteriorations in their financial condition. 

&#160; 

Consumer Finance 

&#160; 

The non-prime automobile finance business is highly competitive. The automobile finance market is highly fragmented and is served by a variety of financial entities, including the captive finance affiliates of major automotive manufacturers, banks, savings associations, credit unions and independent finance companies. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial resources and lower costs of funds than our finance subsidiary. In addition, competitors often provide financing on terms that are more favorable to automobile purchasers or dealers than the terms C&#38;F Finance offers. Many of these competitors also have long-standing relationships with automobile dealerships and may offer dealerships or their customers other forms of financing, including dealer floor plan financing and leasing, which we do not. 

&#160; 

During 2014 and 2015, a number of financial institutions and other lenders have increased focus on operations in the non-prime automobile finance markets resulting in intensified competition for loans and qualified personnel and credit easing. To continue to operate profitably, lenders must have a high level of operational and risk management skills and access to competitive costs of funds. 

&#160; 

Providers of automobile financing traditionally have competed on the basis of interest rates charged, the quality of credit accepted, the flexibility of loan terms offered and the quality of service provided to dealers and customers. To establish C&#38;F Finance as one of the principal financing sources for the dealers it serves, we compete predominately by providing a high level of dealer service, building strong dealer relationships, offering flexible loan terms, and quickly funding loans purchased from dealers. 

&#160; 

No material part of C&#38;F Finance&#8217;s business is dependent upon any single dealer relationship, and the loss of any single dealer relationship would not have a materially adverse effect upon C&#38;F Finance&#8217;s business. 

&#160; 

Regulation and Supervision 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Bank holding companies, banks and their affiliates are extensively regulated under both federal and state law. The following summary briefly describes significant provisions of currently applicable federal and state laws and certain regulations and the potential impact of such provisions. This summary is not complete, and we refer you to the particular 

&#160;

statutory or regulatory provisions or proposals for more information. Because regulation of financial institutions changes regularly and is the subject of constant legislative and regulatory debate, we cannot forecast how federal and state regulation and supervision of financial institutions may change in the future and affect the Corporation&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s operations. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Reform 

&#160; 

The financial crisis of 2008, including the downturn of global economic, financial and money markets and the threat of collapse of numerous financial institutions, and other events led to the adoption of numerous laws and regulations that apply to, and focus on, financial institutions. The most significant of these laws is the Dodd-Frank Act, which was adopted on July 21, 2010 and, in part, is intended to implement significant structural reforms to the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act is discussed in more detail below. 

&#160; 

The Corporation continues to experience a period of rapidly changing regulations and an environment of constant regulatory reform. These regulatory changes could have a significant effect on how the Corporation conducts its business. The specific implications of the Dodd-Frank Act and other potential regulatory reforms cannot yet be fully predicted and will depend to a large extent on the specific regulations that are adopted in the future. 

&#160; 

Regulation of the Corporation 

&#160; 

As a bank holding company, the Corporation is subject to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the BHCA) and regulation and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve Board). Pursuant to the BHCA the Federal Reserve Board has the power to order any bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve Board has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or ownership constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company. The Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) have adopted guidelines and released interpretative materials that establish operational and managerial standards to promote the safe and sound operation of banks and bank holding companies. These standards relate to the institution&#8217;s key operating functions, including but not limited to capital management, internal controls, internal audit system, information systems , data and cybersecurity, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure and risk management, vendor management, executive management and its compensation, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, liquidity and risk management. 

&#160; 

The BHCA generally limits the activities of a bank holding company and its subsidiaries to that of banking, managing or controlling banks, or any other activity that is closely related to banking or to managing or controlling banks, and permits interstate banking acquisitions subject to certain conditions, including national and state concentration limits. The Federal Reserve Board has jurisdiction under the BHCA to approve any bank or non-bank acquisition, merger or consolidation proposed by a bank holding company. A bank holding company must be well capitalized and well managed to engage in an interstate bank acquisition or merger, and banks may branch across state lines provided that the law of the state in which the branch is to be located would permit establishment of the branch if the bank were a state bank chartered by such state. Bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are also subject to restrictions on transactions with insiders and affiliates. 

&#160; 

Each of the Bank&#8217;s depository accounts is insured by the FDIC against loss to the depositor to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and federal law and regulatory policy impose a number of obligations and restrictions on the Corporation and the Bank to reduce potential loss exposure to depositors and to the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). For example, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and Federal Reserve Board policy, a bank holding company must commit resources to support its subsidiary depository institutions, which is referred to as serving as a &#8220;source of strength.&#8221; In addition, insured depository institutions under common control must reimburse the FDIC for any loss suffered or reasonably anticipated by the DIF as a result of the default of a commonly controlled insured depository institution. The FDIC may decline to enforce the provisions if it determines that a waiver is in the best interest of the DIF. An FDIC claim for damages is superior to claims of stockholders of an insured depository institution or its holding company but is subordinate to claims of depositors, secured creditors and holders of subordinated debt, other than affiliates, of the commonly controlled insured depository institution. 

&#160;

&#160; 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the FDIA) provides that amounts received from the liquidation or other resolution of any insured depository institution must be distributed, after payment of secured claims, to pay the deposit liabilities of the institution before payment of any other general creditor or stockholder of that institution &#8211; including that institution&#8217;s parent holding company. This provision would give depositors a preference over general and subordinated creditors and stockholders if a receiver is appointed to distribute the assets of a bank. 

&#160; 

The Corporation also is subject to regulation and supervision by the State Corporation Commission of Virginia. The Corporation also must file annual, quarterly and other periodic reports with, and comply with other regulations of, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). 

&#160; 

Capital Requirements 

&#160; 

The Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have adopted rules to implement the Basel III capital framework as outlined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and standards for calculating risk-weighted assets and risk-based capital measurements (collectively, the Basel III Final Rules) that apply to banking institutions they supervise. For the purposes of these capital rules, (i) common equity tier 1 capital (CET1) consists principally of common stock (including surplus) and retained earnings; (ii) Tier 1 capital consists principally of CET1 plus non-cumulative preferred stock and related surplus, and certain grandfathered cumulative preferred stocks and trust preferred securities; and (iii) Tier 2 capital consists principally of Tier 1 capital plus qualifying subordinated debt and preferred stock, and limited amounts of an institution&#8217;s allowance for loan losses. Each regulatory capital classification is subject to certain adjustments and limitations, as implemented by the Basel III Final Rules. The Basel III Final Rules also establish risk weightings that are applied to many classes of assets held by community banks, importantly including applying higher risk weightings to certain commercial real estate loans. The Basel III Final Rules were effective January 1, 2015, and the Basel III Final Rules capital conservation buffer will be phased in from 2015 to 2019. 

&#160; 

When fully phased in, the Basel III Final Rules require banks to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation), (iii) a minimum ratio of total (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation) and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures (computed as the average for each quarter of the month-end ratios for the quarter). 

&#160; 

Th e B a s el II I &#160; Fi n al Ru l e s prov i d e d e du c t i on s fro m &#160; a n d &#160; a djustment s &#160; to regulatory capital measures, primarily to CET1, including deductions and adjustments that were not applied to reduce CET1 under historical regulatory capital rules . Fo r &#160; e xamp le, mor t gag e s e rv ici n g r i ghts , d e f e rr ed &#160; tax &#160; a ss ets d e p e nd e n t upo n futur e &#160; ta x a b le &#160; i n c om e, &#160; a n d signif ica n t i nvestmen ts &#160; in non- c onso li d ated f i n a nc ial &#160; e n titi e s must b e d e duc ted fro m CET 1 &#160; to &#160; t h e &#160; e x te n t &#160; t h at &#160; a n y on e suc h &#160; cate gor y ex cee d s 10 % o f CET 1 o r &#160; all su ch &#160; cat egor ies &#160; in th e &#160; a ggreg ate &#160; e x ceed 15 % o f CET1 . These deductions from and adjustments to regulatory capital will generally be phased in beginning in 2015 through 2018. 

&#160; 

The Basel III Final Rules permanently include in Tier 1 capital trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010 by bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in total assets, subject to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital. The Corporation expects that its trust preferred securities will be included in the Corporation&#8217;s Tier 1 capital until their maturity. 

&#160; 

Limits on Dividends 

&#160; 

The Corporation is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from the Bank. A significant portion of the revenues of the Corporation result from dividends paid to it by the Bank. Both the Corporation and C&#38;F Bank are subject to laws 

&#160;

and regulations that limit the payment of dividends, including limits on the sources of dividends and requirements to maintain capital at or above regulatory minimums. Banking regulators have indicated that Virginia banking organizations should generally pay dividends only (1) from net undivided profits of the bank, after providing for all expenses, losses, interest and taxes accrued or due by the bank and (2) if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization&#8217;s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. In addition, Federal Reserve Board supervisory guidance indicates that the Federal Reserve Board may have safety and soundness concerns if a bank holding company pays dividends that exceed earnings for the period in which the dividend is being paid. Further, the FDIA prohibits insured depository institutions such as C&#38;F Bank from making capital distributions, including paying dividends, if, after making such distribution, the institution would become undercapitalized as defined in the statute. We do not expect that any of these laws, regulations or policies will materially affect the ability of the Corporation or C&#38;F Bank to pay dividends. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act implements far-reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape, including changes that will affect all bank holding companies and banks, including the Corporation and the Bank. Provisions that significantly affect the business of the Corporation and the Bank include the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Dodd-Frank Act changed the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital. The Dodd-Frank Act also made permanent the $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance and increased the cash limit of Securities Investor Protection Corporation protection from $100,000 to $250,000. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Payment of Interest on Demand Deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act repealed the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Dodd-Frank Act centralized significant aspects of consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the CFPB, which is discussed in more detail below. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Debit Card Interchange Fees. The Dodd-Frank Act imposed limits for debit card interchange fees for issuers that have over $10 billion in assets, which could affect the amount of interchange fees collected by financial institutions with less than $10 billion in assets. 

&#160; 

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act implements other changes to financial regulations, including provisions that: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Restrict the preemption of state law by federal law and disallow subsidiaries and affiliates of national banks from availing themselves of such preemption. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Impose comprehensive regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market, subject to significant rulemaking processes, which would include certain provisions that would effectively prohibit insured depository institutions from conducting certain derivatives businesses in the institution itself. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Require depository institutions with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion to conduct regular stress tests and require large, publicly traded bank holding companies to create a risk committee responsible for the oversight of enterprise risk management. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Require loan originators to retain 5 percent of any loan sold or securitized, unless it is a &#8220;qualified residential mortgage,&#8221; subject to certain exceptions. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies (the Volcker Rule). 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Implem ent corporate governance revisions that apply to all public companies not just financial institutions. 

&#160; 

Some of the rules that have been proposed and, in some cases, adopted to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act's mandates are discussed further below. 

&#160; 

Insurance of Accounts, Assessments and Regulation by the FDIC 

&#160; 

The Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured by the DIF of the FDIC up to the standard maximum insurance amount for each deposit insurance ownership category. The basic limit on FDIC deposit insurance coverage is $250,000 per depositor. Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations as an insured institution, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC, subject to administrative and potential judicial hearing and review processes. 

&#160; 

Deposit Insurance Assessments. The DIF is funded by assessments on banks and other depository institutions calculated based on average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity (defined as Tier 1 capital). As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has adopted a large-bank pricing assessment scheme, set a target &#8220;designated reserve ratio&#8221; (described in more detail below) of 2 percent for the DIF and established a lower assessment rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches 1.15 percent and, in lieu of dividends, provides for a lower assessment rate schedule, when the reserve ratio reaches 2 percent and 2.5 percent. An institution's assessment rate depends upon the institution's assigned risk category, which is based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. Initial base assessment rates range from 2.5 to 45 basis points. The FDIC may make the following further adjustments to an institution&#8217;s initial base assessment rate: decreases for long-term unsecured debt including most senior unsecured debt and subordinated debt; increases for holding long-term unsecured debt or subordinated debt issued by other insured depository institutions; and increases for broker deposits in excess of 10 percent of domestic deposits for institutions not well rated and well capitalized. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act transferred to the FDIC increased discretion with regard to managing the required amount of reserves for the DIF, or the &#8220;designated reserve ratio.&#8221; Among other changes, the Dodd-Frank Act (i) raised the minimum designated reserve ratio to 1.35 percent and removed the upper limit on the designated reserve ratio, (ii) requires that the designated reserve ratio reach 1.35 percent by September 2020, and (iii) requires the FDIC to offset the effect on institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion of raising the designated reserve ratio from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent &#8211; which requirement will be met by rules proposed by the FDIC during 2015. The FDIA requires that the FDIC consider the appropriate level for the designated reserve ratio on at least an annual basis. The FDIC has adopted a DIF restoration plan to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches 1.35 percent by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. 

&#160; 

Regulation of the Bank and Other Subsidiaries 

&#160; 

The Bank is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Virginia State Corporation Commission Bureau of Financial Institutions (VBFI) and its primary federal regulator, the FDIC. The various laws and regulations issued and administered by the regulatory agencies (including the CFPB) affect corporate practices, such as the payment of dividends, the incurrence of debt and the acquisition of financial institutions and other companies, and affect business practices and operations, such as the payment of interest on deposits, the charging of interest on loans, the types of business conducted, the products and terms offered to customers and the location of offices. Prior approval of the applicable primary federal regulator and the VBFI is required for a Virginia chartered bank or bank holding company to merge with another bank or bank holding company, or purchase the assets or assume the deposits of another bank or bank holding company, or acquire control of another bank or bank holding company. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the bank regulatory authorities will consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the constituent organizations and the combined organization, the risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system, the applicant's performance record under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and fair housing initiatives, the data security and cybersecurity infrastructure of the constituent organizations and the combined organization, and the applicant&#8217;s compliance with and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities and complying with Bank Secrecy Act requirements. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Community Reinvestment Act. The CRA imposes on financial institutions an affirmative and ongoing obligation to meet the credit needs of their local communities, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions. A financial institution&#8217;s efforts in meeting community credit needs are assessed based on specified factors. These factors also are considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility. In 2014, the Bank received a &#8220;Satisfactory&#8221; CRA rating. 

&#160; 

Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Atlanta, which is one of 12 regional FHLBs that provide funding to their members for making housing loans as well as for affordable housing and community development loans. Each FHLB serves as a reserve, or central bank, for the members within its assigned region. Each FHLB makes loans to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB. As a member, the Bank must purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB. At December 31, 2015, the Bank owned $3.2 million of FHLB stock. 

&#160; 

Consumer Protection. The CFPB is the federal regulatory agency that is responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws for institutions with more than $10 billion of assets and, to a lesser extent, smaller institutions. The CFPB supervises and regulates providers of consumer financial products and services, and has rulemaking authority in connection with numerous federal consumer financial protection laws (for example, but not limited to, the Truth-in-Lending Act (TILA) and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA)). 

&#160; 

Because the Corporation and the Bank are smaller institutions (i.e., with assets of $10 billion or less), most consumer protection aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act will continue to be applied to the Corporation by the Federal Reserve Board and to the Bank by the FDIC. However, the CFPB may include its own examiners in regulatory examinations by a small institution&#8217;s principal regulators and may require smaller institutions to comply with certain CFPB reporting requirements. In addition, regulatory positions taken by the CFPB and administrative and legal precedents established by CFPB enforcement activities, including in connection with supervision of larger bank holding companies and banks, could influence how the Federal Reserve Board and FDIC apply consumer protection laws and regulations to financial institutions that are not directly supervised by the CFPB. The precise effect of the CFPB&#8217;s consumer protection activities on the Corporation and the Bank cannot be determined with certainty. 

&#160; 

Mortgage Banking Regulation. In connection with making mortgage loans, the Bank and C&#38;F Mortgage are subject to rules and regulations that, among other things, establish standards for loan origination, prohibit discrimination, provide for inspections and appraisals of property, require credit reports on prospective borrowers, in some cases restrict certain loan features and fix maximum interest rates and fees, require the disclosure of certain basic information to mortgagors concerning credit and settlement costs, limit payment for settlement services to the reasonable value of the services rendered and require the maintenance and disclosure of information regarding the disposition of mortgage applications based on race, gender, geographical distribution and income level. The Bank&#8217;s mortgage origination activities are subject to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), TILA, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, RESPA, and Home Ownership Equity Protection Act, and the regulations promulgated under these acts, among other additional state and federal laws, regulations and rules. 

&#160; 

The Bank&#8217;s mortgage origination activities are also subject to Regulation Z, which implements TILA. Certain provisions of Regulation Z require mortgage lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination, based on verified and documented information, that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. Alternatively, a mortgage lender can originate &#8220;qualified mortgages&#8221;, which are generally defined as mortgage loans without negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, terms exceeding 30 years, and points and fees paid by a consumer equal to or less than 3% of the total loan amount. Higher-priced qualified mortgages (e.g., subprime loans) receive a rebuttable presumption of compliance with ability-to-repay rules, and other qualified mortgages (e.g., prime loans) are deemed to comply with the ability-to-repay rules. The Corporation&#8217;s Mortgage Banking segment predominately originates mortgage loans that comply with Regulation Z&#8217;s &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; rules. 

&#160; 

In addition to certain regulations applicable to the Bank&#8217;s mortgage origination activities, C&#38;F Mortgage is subject to the rules and regulations of, and examination by, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the FHA, the USDA, the VA and state regulatory authorities with respect to originating, processing and selling mortgage loans. 

&#160;

Those rules and regulations, among other things, establish standards for loan origination, prohibit discrimination, provide for inspections and appraisals of property, require credit reports on prospective borrowers and, in some cases, restrict certain loan features and fix maximum interest rates and fees. 

&#160; 

Consumer Financing Regulation . C&#38;F Finance also is regulated by the VBFI and the states and jurisdictions in which it operates, and its lending operations are subject to numerous federal regulations over which the CFPB has rulemaking authority and regarding which enforcement authority is shared by the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. The VBFI regulates and enforces laws relating to consumer lenders and sales finance agencies such as C&#38;F Finance. Such rules and regulations generally provide for licensing of sales finance agencies; limitations on amounts, duration and charges, including interest rates, for various categories of loans; requirements as to the form and content of finance contracts and other documentation; and restrictions on collection practices and creditors&#8217; rights. 

&#160; 

Certain federal regulatory agencies, and in particular, the CFPB, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Federal Reserve Board, have recently become more active in investigating the products, services and operations of banks and other finance companies engaged in auto finance activities. These investigations have extended to banks that engage in indirect automobile lending, and the CFPB has released regulatory guidance that deems automobile lenders within the CFPB&#8217;s jurisdiction responsible for ECOA noncompliance even if such noncompliance is a result of dealer lending practices. As of January 1, 2016, the Corporation and C&#38;F Finance are not subject to supervision by the CFPB. 

&#160; 

Other Regulations 

&#160; 

Prompt Correction Action. The federal banking agencies have broad powers under current federal law to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems of insured depository institutions. The extent of these powers depends upon whether the institution in question is &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; or &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; These terms are defined under uniform regulations issued by each of the federal banking agencies regulating these institutions. An insured depository institution which is less than adequately capitalized must adopt an acceptable capital restoration plan, is subject to increased regulatory oversight and is increasingly restricted in the scope of its permissible activities. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank was considered &#8220;well capitalized.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Incentive Compensation. The Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the FDIC have issued regulatory guidance (the Incentive Compensation Guidance) intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Corporation, that are not &#8220;large, complex banking organizations.&#8221; The findings will be included in reports of examination, and deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization&#8217;s supervisory ratings. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization&#8217;s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. 

&#160; 

As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, in March 2011 the SEC and the federal bank regulatory agencies proposed regulations that would prohibit financial institutions with assets of at least $1 billion from maintaining executive compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to material financial loss. If the regulations are adopted in the form initially proposed, they will impose limitations on the manner in which the Corporation may structure compensation for its executives and will require the Corporation to submit annual reports to the Federal Reserve Board regarding the Corporation&#8217;s incentive compensation. These proposed regulations incorporate the principles discussed in the Incentive Compensation Guidance. The comment period for these proposed regulations has closed and a final rule has not yet been published. 

&#160; 

Confidentiality and Required Disclosures of Customer Information. The Corporation is subject to various laws and regulations that address the privacy of nonpublic personal financial information of consumers. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and certain regulations issued thereunder protect against the transfer and use by financial institutions of consumer nonpublic personal information. A financial institution must provide to its customers, at the beginning of the customer 

&#160;

relationship and annually thereafter, the institution&#8217;s policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers&#8217; nonpublic personal financial information. These privacy provisions generally prohibit a financial institution from providing a customer&#8217;s personal financial information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses to the customer that the information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. 

&#160; 

The Corporation is also subject to various laws and regulations that attempt to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The Bank Secrecy Act requires all financial institutions to, among other things, create a system of controls designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and imposes recordkeeping and reporting requirements. The USA Patriot Act facilitates information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering, and requires financial institutions to establish anti-money laundering programs. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) sends banking regulatory agencies lists of the names of persons suspected of involvement in terrorist activities, and requests banks to search their records for any relationships or transactions with persons on those lists. If the Bank finds any relationships or transactions, it must file a suspicious activity report with the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury) and contact the FBI. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which is a division of the Treasury, is responsible for helping to ensure that United States entities do not engage in transactions with &#8220;enemies&#8221; of the United States, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. If the Bank finds a name of an &#8220;enemy&#8221; of the United States on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, it must freeze such account or place transferred funds into a blocked account, file a suspicious activity report with the Treasury and notify the FBI. 

&#160; 

Although these laws and programs impose compliance costs and create privacy obligations and, in some cases, reporting obligations, and compliance with all of the laws, programs, and privacy and reporting obligations may require significant resources of the Corporation and the Bank, these laws and programs do not materially affect the Bank&#8217;s products, services or other business activities. 

&#160; 

Stress Testing. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal banking agencies have implemented stress testing requirements for certain financial institutions, including bank holding companies and state chartered banks, with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets. Although these requirements do not apply to institutions with less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, the federal banking agencies emphasize that all banking organizations, regardless of size, should have the capacity to analyze the potential effect of adverse market conditions or outcomes on the organization&#8217;s financial condition. Based on existing regulatory guidance, the Corporation and the Bank will be expected to consider the institution&#8217;s interest rate risk management, commercial real estate loan concentrations and other credit-related information, and funding and liquidity management during this analysis of adverse market conditions or outcomes. 

&#160; 

Volcker Rule. The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks from engaging in proprietary trading except in limited circumstances, and places limits on ownership of equity investments in private equity and hedge funds (the Volcker Rule). On December 10, 2013, the U.S. financial regulatory agencies (including the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the SEC) adopted final rules to implement the Volcker Rule. Among other things, these final rules would have prohibited banking entities from owning collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) backed by trust preferred securities (TruPS), effective July 21, 2015. However, subsequent to these final rules the U.S. financial regulatory agencies issued an interim rule effective April 1, 2014 to exempt CDOs backed by TruPS from the final rule implementing the Volcker Rule, provided that (a) the CDO was established prior to May 19, 2010, (b) the banking entity reasonably believes that the CDO&#8217;s offering proceeds were used to invest primarily in TruPS issued by banks with less than $15 billion in assets, and (c) the banking entity acquired the CDO investment on or before December 10, 2013. Neither the Corporation nor the Bank currently has any CDO investments, and the Corporation believes that its financial condition will not be significantly affected by the Volcker Rule, the final rule or the interim rule. Several portions of the Volcker Rule remain subject to regulatory rulemaking and legislative activity, including to further delay effectiveness of some provisions of the Volcker Rule. The Corporation and the Bank do not expect that any delays in the effectiveness of a portion of the Volcker Rule will significantly affect the Corporation&#8217;s or the Bank&#8217;s financial condition. 

&#160; 

Future Regulation 

&#160; 

From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding 

&#160;

companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Corporation in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. The Corporation cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Corporation. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries could have a material effect on the business of the Corporation.
