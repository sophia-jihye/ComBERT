 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

&#160;

OVERVIEW 

&#160;

COMPANY HISTORY

&#160;

Manhattan Scientifics, Inc. (the "Company" or "Manhattan Scientifics"), a Delaware corporation, was established on July 31, 1992 and has two operating wholly-owned subsidiaries: Metallicum, Inc., ("Metallicum") and Senior Scientific LLC ("Senior Scientific"). On June 12, 2008, the Company acquired Metallicum, Inc. for 15,000,000 shares of Company's common stock. On May 31, 2011, the company acquired Senior Scientific for 21,668,000 shares of Company's common stock.

&#160;

Manhattan Scientifics, Inc. is focused on technology transfer and commercialization of these transformative technologies in the nano medicine space. 

&#160;

TWO BUSINESSES EXIST WITHIN MANHATTAN SCIENTIFICS

&#160;

Two nanotechnology businesses exist within Manhattan Scientifics. Both "units" are wholly-owned subsidiaries, both focused on nanotechnology applications in medicine.

&#160;

The first (Metallicum) &#8211; In 2008, Manhattan Scientifics acquired Metallicum Inc., along with its licensed patented nanostructured metals technology. We also licensed additional related intellectual property from Los Alamos National Laboratory, and filed additional patent applications related to the technology. The technology enables metals with uniform, ultrafine grains. This provides greater strength, lighter weight, and enhanced biocompatibility. It provides significant benefits across a wide range of metal applications &#8211; anywhere strength or weight is a concern. 

&#160;

Manhattan's second business is called Senior Scientific and is at the crossroads of biotechnology and nanotechnology.

&#160;

&#160; 3 

&#160; &#160;

Our novel bioimaging and nanomagnetic detection systems have been developed specifically to detect cancer and other diseases earlier and with higher specificity than we believe is currently possible. We have developed proprietary hardware and software for the highly sensitive detection of nanomagnetic particles that can be linked to antibodies for the detection and treatment of cancer and other human diseases&#8212;all without the use of ionizing radiation or large magnetic fields.

&#160;

Our novel technologies make possible the earlier detection of cancer in vivo, the ability to analyze biopsies with greater sensitivity and accuracy, the ability to monitor the therapeutic effectiveness of anticancer treatments&#8212;both in humans and in animal models&#8212;and allow us to detect cancer recurrence with significantly improved sensitivity. Senior Scientific's website is www.SeniorScientific.com

&#160;

The technology was developed by Edward R. Flynn, PhD, Senior Scientific's founder and chief scientist. 

&#160;

ACQUISITIONS

&#160;

In June 2008, we acquired Metallicum and its licensed patented technology. We entered into a stock purchase agreement with Metallicum to acquire all of the outstanding capital in exchange for 15,000,000 restricted shares of our common stock. An additional 15,000,000 shares of our common stock will be payable to Metallicum in the event of meeting certain milestones. At December 31, 2011, one milestone was met. Metallicum was granted an exclusive license by The Los Alamos National Laboratory on patents related to nanostructured metals. In September 2009, we entered into a technology transfer agreement and sale with Carpenter Technology Corporation, ("Carpenter") wherein Carpenter was responsible to develop, manufacture and market a new class of high strength metals. On February 11, 2015, the Company and Carpenter entered into a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release pursuant to which the parties provided a full release of one another, Carpenter paid the Company $8,000,000, Carpenter transferred to the Company all intellectual and physical property that was part of the original agreement, Carpenter agreed to provide follow-on technical assistance and Carpenter provided a list of all customers and contacts.

&#160;

On May 31, 2011, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization to acquire Senior Scientific and Scientific Nanomedicine, Inc. ("Scientific Nanomedicine" or "SNMI"). We subsequently dissolved Scientific Nanomedicine and transferred all remaining assets to Senior Scientific. The total purchase price was 21,668,000 restricted shares of our common stock (less 7,667,000 shares previously issued pursuant to an option agreement). As a result of this acquisition, we own patented technologies that can use biosafe nanoparticles and sensitive magnetic sensors to detect and measure cancer cells in biopsies or in the human body with the potential to transform how cancer is detected and treated.

&#160;

ADVANCED METALS

&#160;

The goal of our licensed proprietary process will be to enable our commercial partners to build super-strength metals and alloys to make products that weigh far less than in the past and without significant cost premiums. In September 2009, the Company entered into a technology transfer agreement and sale with Carpenter. As described above, the Company and Carpenter terminated their relationship in February 2015.

&#160;

NANOMEDICINE

&#160;

Our acquisition of Senior Scientific gives us the commercial rights to technology and intellectual property with respect to the detection and monitoring of diseases using nanotechnologies. The technology is intended for the early detection of cancers, quantitative in vivo assessments of tumors, and similar applications with other diseases identifiable by cell surface markers. The technology does not require surgery, biopsy, radioactivity, or exotically expensive instruments. Nanoparticles are introduced to the body, for example, by intravenous injection. A sensitive low magnetic field instrument is used to magnetize and measure the nanoparticles that have bound to the specific targets (e.g., cells of a specific type of cancer). Other tissues, bone, scars, etc. are all transparent to the magnetic fields used, so the technology can be used to image detect and measure tumors in places inaccessible to other tests, and including tumors while they are still small enough to be treatable. The nanoparticles are nontoxic, and the low magnetic field instrument is not harmful or expensive, so the tests can be repeated as needed. The following bullet points summarize management's current beliefs with respect to the benefits and commercialization of our nanomedicine technology:

&#160;

&#160; 4 

&#160; &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

The initial proof-of-principle for the MRX&#8482; technology was demonstrated with a research prototype instrument funded by the National Institutes of Health as developed by Senior Scientific;

&#160;

&#183; 

The technology can detect tumors of a mass of ~100,000 cells, and is currently being tested to determine the lower limit of detection;

&#160;

&#183; 

The system uses technologies and methods that are patented or held as trade secrets, which we hope to develop for commercialization along with the nanoparticles that will be used to detect cancer;

&#160;

&#183; 

In Q4 2013, we executed a formal agreement with the MD Anderson Cancer Center for initial testing and validation of the Technology and delivered an MRX system to them in Q2 of 2014; the Agreement was subsequently renewed and extended for a three year period in Q4 2015;

&#160;

&#183; 

In Q1 2016, we executed formal research collaborations with two additional cancer research centers, the University of Michigan Medical School and Weill Cornell Medicine, to assist us with preclinical validation of the technology for various forms of cancer;

&#160;

&#183; 

Our revenue model is focused on lab/animal research as well as human medical applications;

&#160;

&#183; 

Regulatory clearance may not be needed for lab/animal uses; and

&#160;

&#183; 

The FDA has provided us with initial guidance on the expected route for regulatory clearance as a medical device.

&#160;

The largest market that we will pursue is in human clinical applications. Many cancers are fatal because they are asymptomatic until later stages. Our goal is to allow doctors to locate tumor sites while the tumor is still small, and monitor the effectiveness of therapy.

&#160;

Our first human applications are likely to be in the detection of solid tumors, like cancer. Ovarian cancer is the deadliest of gynecological cancers, in part because it stays hidden from current techniques until it has grown to billions of cells and hundreds of sites. We are working with Dr. Robert C. Bast Jr. of M.D. Anderson Cancer Center to bring the MRX&#8482; technology to bear on this disease. We have expanded on the work with MD Anderson by collaborating with two other institutions on breast cancer and prostate cancer.

&#160;

Bringing the MRX&#8482; technology to clinical use requires that we demonstrate the technology in animal experiments, and then in clinical trials. Applying the MRX&#8482; technology to animal experiments reveals an earlier market possibility. Millions of animals are used in medical research each year, and this research will benefit from the marked increase in sensitivity available from our MRX&#8482; technology. We have designed and built instruments for our collaborations which could be used as a basis for developing a commercial design for the pre-clinical animal research market. We will use these instruments to further optimize nanoparticle performances, software tools, and animal model-based in-vivo testing procedures. We may sell or place additional instruments in other academic or clinical cancer research institutes during this year. Results from the collaborations will be used to establish the earliest and mostly likely route to human clinical testing and can be used for marketing to the pharmaceutical preclinical animal research. Additionally, the study results are expected to fuel negotiations with strategic potential partners or prospective acquirers. 

&#160;

Nanoparticles: The nanoparticles are the razor blade or ink cartridge in our business model. The science was originally proven using nanoparticle from sources outside the company. It is very important for the performance of our technology that we have control of the nanoparticles; thus the company has worked to create our own custom made nanoparticles. Our custom made nanoparticles have demonstrated excellent performance characteristics. We are working on improving performance, stability, and yield in collaboration with CINT (Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies) to support commercial sales.

&#160;

&#160; 5 

&#160; &#160;

OUR DEVELOPMENT MODEL

&#160;

Our goal has been to influence the future through the development of potentially life changing technologies. Our business model is to: (i) identify significant technologies, (ii) acquire them or the rights to them, (iii) secure the services of inventors, engineers or other staff who were instrumental in their creation, (iv) provide or contract for suitable work facilities, laboratories, and other aids where appropriate, (v) prototype the technologies to demonstrate "proof of principle" feasibility, (vi) secure patent and or other intellectual property protection, (vii) secure early customers for product trials where feasible and appropriate, and (viii) commercialize through licenses, sales or cooperative efforts with other manufacturing and distribution firms.

&#160;

Since our technologies are still in their development phase, the need for operating and acquisition capital is a continuous concern requiring the ongoing efforts of our management. The Company's success will depend in part on its ability to obtain patents and license rights, maintain trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, both in the United States and other countries. There can be no assurance that patents issued to or licensed by the Company will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or that the rights granted thereunder will provide proprietary protection or competitive advantages to the Company.

&#160;

We utilize the intellectual property sale/licensing model, and not a production model, though management is opportunistic and is open to explore all methods leading to commercializing our technologies. We intend to consider all appropriate avenues for the commercialization of our technologies.

&#160;

DESCRIPTION OF TECHNOLOGIES 

&#160;

ADVANCED METALS

&#160;

Our business model is based on licensing metals technology to metals manufacturers. Although competing commercial products are provided by existing specialty metals companies, the only competing processes for creating nanostructured metals are either limited or cannot be economically scaled. Metallicum does not yet face direct competition, but expects competition will emerge as the metal is commercialized.

&#160;

In January 2009, we entered into a patent license agreement with Los Alamos National Security, LLC for the exclusive licensing use of certain technology relating to the manufacture and application of nanostructuring metals and alloys. Pursuant to such agreement we provided a non-refundable fee and 2,000,000 shares of our common stock with a fair market value of $33,000. Additionally, we are required to pay an annual license fee of $10,000 starting in February 2010 and royalties on future net sales.

&#160;

The technology is expected to trim thousands of pounds from airplanes and hundreds of pounds from cars without sacrificing structural strength or adding significant cost. The nanostructured metals also have wide implications for use in the medical device and prosthetics industries including dental implants, replacements for hips, shoulders, knees and cardio vascular stents. In December 2008, a manufacturing joint venture partner in Albuquerque, NM received U.S. Food and Drug Administration 510(k) clearance to market nanostructured titanium metal dental implants using our technology. This clearance positions us closer to our goal of commercializing our technology for nanostructured metals. We are in talks with many of the key manufacturers of dental implants and have signed material testing agreements with several manufacturers.

&#160;

In September 2009, the Company entered into a contract with Carpenter to sell certain nanostructured metal technologies acquired from Metallicum, its wholly owned subsidiary, to Carpenter and to provide sub-license rights to Carpenter covering license agreements that the Company has from Los Alamos Laboratories.

&#160;

&#160; 6 

&#160; &#160;

In January 2013, the Company entered into a licensing agreement with a party granting certain licensing rights to the Company's nanostructured metal technology. As consideration the Company received $240,000 during 2013 and $30,000 in 2014.As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded $0 and $642,000 as revenue related to the licensing agreement. The Company has received the following amounts from Carpenter:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company received from Carpenter $0.6 million of minimum royalty payment related to the Agreement.

&#160;

&#183; 

During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company received from Carpenter $0.3 million of income and $0.2 million from a licensing agreement.

&#160;

&#183; 

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company received $0.6 million for the sale of certain technology;

&#160;

&#183; 

During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, the Company received from Carpenter $0.6 million of income for assisting with development of the technology and is recognizing the income over the term of the Agreement.

&#160;

&#183; 

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company received a $1,000,000 one-time payment for satisfying a performance obligation under the Technology Transfer Agreement.

&#160;

On February 11, 2015, the Company and Carpenter entered into a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release pursuant to which the parties provided a full release of one another, Carpenter paid the Company $8,000,000, Carpenter transferred to the Company all intellectual and physical property that was part of the original agreement, Carpenter agreed to provide follow-on technical assistance and Carpenter provided a list of all customers and contacts. Following the return of the Company's nanostructured metal technology, the Company has commenced exploring strategic alternatives for its Metallicum division. At this time we are exploring and working with partner companies in the fields of titanium dental implants, titanium and magnesium medical devices, high voltage aluminum conductors as well as oil and gas field applications.

&#160;

NANOMEDICINE

&#160;

Our subsidiary, Senior Scientific, holds patented technologies that can use biosafe nanoparticles and sensitive magnetic sensors to detect and measure cancer cells in biopsies or in the human body. The technology is specific &#8211; i.e. it measures a particular type of cancer and does not generate false positive results from benign growths, calcifications, or other spurious signals that complicate current detection methods. It is also very sensitive &#8211; it can measure tumors that are 1000-times smaller than is possible with currently available techniques. This combination of features has the potential to transform how cancer is detected and treated.

&#160;

We have invested approximately $7.5 million in the Senior Scientific cancer project in the past three years. We continue to progress in advancing the technology toward commercialization. 

&#160;

We have implemented a nanoparticle production facility. Our magnetic relaxometry measurements are now performed with our own nanoparticles, and we have begun commercial sales of our nanoparticles to others.

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Senior Scientific has joined both BIOCOM and NMBio as a corporate member, improving our access to and visibility within the general biopharmaceutical and New Mexico biotechnology communities.

&#160;

&#183; 

In early 2015 we hired a new President with senior managerial expertise in medical product commercialization and direct experience in cancer diagnostics. Additionally, in February 2016 we hired a Vice President of R&#38;D with direct experience in developing nanoparticles for targeted delivery to cancer.

&#160;

&#183; 

We are continuing to fund the development a version of our technology using atomic magnetometer technology, which was originally funded by an NIH grant. We believe the atomic magnetometer-based instrument will improve performance and create larger market opportunities for this technology relative to our current SQUID-based platform.

&#160;

&#160; 7 

&#160; &#160;

We expect to undertake the safety and toxicology studies necessary to show that our nanoparticles are safe for use in humans. Significant effort will be required to document the laboratory and manufacturing processes for nanoparticle production that the FDA are likely to require.

&#160;

We believe that the constituent parts of the targeted nanoparticles have already been approved for injection in humans in other applications. Initial toxicology studies in cell cultures suggest that the combination of the parts into targeted nanoparticles is not toxic. 

&#160;

All of these programs are designed to validate our technology for the market, which will produce value for our shareholders. Our technology makes possible the detection of specific cancer cells. Physicians may then select a broad range for initial diagnosis, or a single type for monitoring therapy or detecting metastases. Small quantities of biosafe nanoparticles with attached targeting agents are introduced into the patient where they "stick" only to the targeted cancer cells. A weak magnetic field is applied to magnetize the particles, and sensitive magnetic detectors count the number of particles that have stuck to cancer cells. Due to the highly specialized nature of both the nanoparticles and our detection device, only those particles stuck to their targeted cells are detected, making the results highly specific, objective (the results depend only on the cells, not a human interpretation of an image), and sensitive (only a few thousand cells are required, instead of hundreds of millions for conventional techniques).

&#160;

Our technology makes possible improvements across a wide range of cancer fighting areas: detection of cancers years earlier; noninvasive, specific diagnosis after conventional screening; earlier, faster discovery of drugs; precise, personalized monitoring of therapy; detection of metastases while still treatable; and accurate monitoring of new therapies. Our technology has been proven in animal models using human cancer cells, in human trials using bone marrow biopsy samples, and is the subject of over 20 patent applications and14 peer-reviewed publications. Our success will depend in part on its ability to obtain regulatory approvals required for human application of its technologies, both in the United States and other countries. There can be no assurance that such approvals will be obtained.

&#160;

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY / RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

&#160;

In 2008, we purchased Metallicum to acquire its licensed rights to patented technology. The technology is comprised of three US Patents (US Patent numbers 7152448, 6197129 and 6399215) for which Metallicum (subsequently, Manhattan) had been assigned an exclusive license rights by Los Alamos National Security LLC (LANL). Under the license rights, Metallicum had all rights, title and interest throughout the world in and to any and all inventions, original works of authorship, developments, concepts, know-how, and improvements on the patents or trade secrets whether or not patentable or registerable under copyright or similar laws. The purchase price paid for these licenses was $305,000, which represents its fair value. The Company obtained an exclusive license on two patents and a non-exclusive license on the third patent. The value attributable to license agreements is being amortized over the period of its estimated benefit period of 10 years.

&#160;

On May 31, 2011, we acquired Senior Scientific and all of its intellectual property. Incident to the acquisition, we assigned certain of the intellectual property to Scientific Nanomedicine, Inc., a subsidiary formed solely for that purpose. The need for that subsidiary has passed, and we have assigned all the intellectual property to Senior Scientific. Senior Scientific's patent estate includes the patents and applications in the following schedule. We continue to prosecute our patent applications and file new applications as the technology progresses.

Analysis and data acquisition software copyrights

&#160;

Our ability to compete depends in part on the protection of and our ability to defend our proprietary technology and on the goodwill associated with our trade names, service marks and other proprietary rights. However, we do not know if current laws will provide us with sufficient enough protection that others will not develop technologies similar or superior to ours, or that third parties will not copy or otherwise obtain or use our technologies without our authorization.

&#160;

The success of our business will depend, in part, to identify technology, obtain patents, protect and enforce patents once issued and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. Our success will also depend on our ability to maintain exclusive rights to trade secrets and proprietary technology we own are currently developing and will develop. We can give no assurance that any issued patents will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by others, or that the patents of others will not restrict our ability to conduct business.

&#160;

In addition, we rely on certain technology licensed with a perpetual term from the Los Alamos National Laboratory and may be required to license additional technologies in the future. We do not know if these third-party licenses will be available or will continue to be available to us on acceptable commercial terms or at all. The inability to enter into and maintain any of these licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of our operations.

&#160;

Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights could entail significant expense. In addition, we do not know if third parties will bring claims of copyright or trademark infringement against us or claim that our use of certain technologies violates a patent or other intellectual property. Any claims of infringement, with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management attention, require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements or prevent us from using important technologies or methods, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of our operations.

&#160;

SALES AND MARKETING 

&#160;

Although our technologies presently are in the development stage, we are engaged in an early commercialization program intended to facilitate the transition from development to licensing, manufacturing and/or sale. This program consists of preliminary dialogues with potential strategic partners, investors, manufacturers, potential licensees and/or purchasers.

&#160;

COMPETITION 

&#160;

As a result of our licensed technology, we do not have any direct competitors in our advanced materials operations. We may, however, face competition from leading researchers and manufacturers worldwide that develop competing technology.

&#160;

With respect to our nanomedicine technology, our cancer detection technology will face competition primarily from companies such as Abbott Laboratories Inc., Cepheid Inc., Philips, GE Healthcare, Siemens, Gen-Probe Incorporated, MDxHealth SA, EpiGenomics AG, Roche Diagnostics and Sequenom, Inc.

&#160;

&#160; 11 

&#160; &#160;

Competitors may successfully challenge our licensed technology, produce similar products that do not infringe our licensed technology or produce products in countries where we have not applied for intellectual property protection. Many of these competitors may have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. Furthermore, competitors may introduce new products that address our potential markets. Competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of our operations.

&#160;

The markets in which we compete are highly competitive and constantly evolving. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our technology markets include without limitation:

&#160;

&#183; 

capitalization;

&#183; 

cost of product;

&#183; 

first to market with product in market segment;

&#183; 

strong intellectual portfolio;

&#183; 

product reliability;

&#183; 

strong customer base; and

&#183; 

strong manufacturing and supplier relationships.

&#160;

CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS 

&#160;

For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, all of our revenue was generated by one customer. We did not have any significant suppliers.

&#160;

EMPLOYEES 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had one full-time employee in general management as well as 10 employees employed by Senior Scientific and Metallicum. We do not expect any significant change in the total number of employees in the near future. Most of our research and development work has been performed by employees of our various research and development independent contractors (see below). We have historically indirectly funded the salaries of these individuals through our contract research and development payments to their employers. Although not technically our employees, we have considered these individuals to be an integral part of our research and development team. None of our employees or contractors is members of any union or collective bargaining organization. We consider our relationships with our employee and our independent contractor employees to be good.

&#160;

As noted above, a significant portion of our research and development has been performed by independent contractors from whom we acquired or licensed certain technologies, and their various employees. Our independent contractors utilize a number of their own various employees to satisfy their research and development obligations to us, and their employees are considered to be part of our research and development team.
