This discussion contains forward-looking statements that relate to future events or our future financial performance. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity or performance to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity or performance. These risks and other factors include, among others, those listed under &#8220;Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information.&#8221; 

Company Overview 

The Company is in its development stage and is focused on being a provider of: (i) cellulosic biomass derived from municipal solid waste, also known as MSW, as a feedstock for producing energy and other chemical products and (ii) recyclables (metals, plastics, glass) from the MSW. We are the exclusive licensee in the United States and Canada of patented technology, which we refer to as our Biomass Recovery Process, that cleans and separates MSW and generates a clean, homogeneous biomass feedstock that we believe can be converted into various energy products. Our license permits us to use the biomass we derive from MSW to produce all energy products. In addition, we own the patent for a pressurized steam classification technology originally developed by the University of Alabama in Huntsville that we refer to as our PSC technology. The PSC technology is the underlying technology upon which the Biomass Recovery Process is based. Prior to March 2011, we had licensed the PSC technology to Bio-Products International, Inc. (&#8220;Bio-Products&#8221;). However, pursuant to a settlement agreement with Bio-Products in March 2009, we had the right to use the Biomass Recovery Process technology worldwide, for any product that we desired and with no royalty due to Bio-Products. We terminated the license to Bio-Products in March 2011 as further described in the section entitled &#8220;Intellectual Property Terms.&#8221; The Company has spent $-0- on research and development activities during 2015 and 2014. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

We are a Delaware corporation. We were originally incorporated in 1996 as Long Road Entertainment, Inc., and were formed to operate as a holding company for businesses in the theater, motion picture and entertainment industries. We ceased conducting that business in 2005 and were dormant until the fall of 2006, at which time our founder and then controlling stockholder decided to pursue the sale of the company. In anticipation of that sale, we changed our name to Alternative Ethanol Technologies, Inc. 

On March 27, 2007, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization in which we agreed to acquire SRS Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation that at that time was seeking to commercialize various technologies for the processing of waste materials into usable products. We consummated the merger on May 31, 2007 resulting in SRS Energy becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary. Effective August 2, 2007, we changed our name to CleanTech Biofuels, Inc. 

We have no operating history as a producer of biomass feedstocks or any energy products and have not constructed any operating plants to date. We have not earned any revenues to date and our current capital and other existing resources are not sufficient to fund the implementation of our business plan or our required working capital. We will require substantial additional capital to implement our business plan and we may be unable to immediately obtain the capital required to continue operating. 

Plan of Operation 

Our focus is to secure sufficient capital to fund our current working capital requirements and the construction of a commercial plant as described further in this section. We have had an ongoing lack of liquidity, and currently do not have sufficient capital to continue to fund our proposed operations, and are relying on the minimal assets on hand to fund our limited operations and corporate existence. All of our on-going and proposed developments/projects require a significant amount of capital that we currently do not have. While we continue to pursue outside sources of funding, we have not had success securing meaningful amounts of outside capital in recent years. As a result, we can provide no assurance that we will secure any source of funding in the immediate time frame required and the failure to do so will likely result in an inability to continue operations. 

Our company was initially conceived as a fully-integrated producer of cellulosic ethanol from MSW. Based on our investigation and acquisition of new technologies and research and development of our existing technologies in 2008, we re-focused our business to the commercialization of our Biomass Recovery Process technology for cleaning and separating MSW into its component parts and initiated a plan to consolidate the ownership and/or rights to use intellectual property around this technology. The technology is currently in commercial use in Coffs Harbor, Australia by an operator not owned by the Company (the &#8220;Third-Party Operator&#8221;). As a result, we believe this technology could be implemented commercially in the United States and elsewhere. In furtherance of our focus, we are continuing our ongoing search for an outside source of financing that will provide the capital for us to design, build, and operate a commercial biomass recovery plant that will allow us to produce biomass feedstock for customer evaluation, trial purchases, and/or be used in equipment selection for power generation and possibly combined heat and power (CHP) production. Initially, the biomass feedstock output is expected to be sold or provided to electric utilities, power and steam producers, power and CHP equipment suppliers, and biofuel research firms for evaluation. In addition to seeking a source of funding for plant development, the Company hopes to license and/or develop potential commercial projects as they present themselves. All of our developments plan to focus on cleaning and separating MSW into its component parts in order to obtain: (i) a homogenous feedstock of cellulosic biomass for producing energy and other chemical products and (ii) recyclable products (metals, plastics). Our plans may also include the possibility of operating a MSW transfer station where we could install our technology. 

Biomass Feedstock Production 

The Company strives to design and build a commercial biomass recovery plant to provide biomass feedstock for customer evaluation, trial purchases, and/or power generation. Initially, the biomass feedstock output is expected to be sold or provided to electric utilities, power and steam producers, power and CHP equipment suppliers, and biofuel and chemical research firms for evaluation. In addition to research and development, the Company also plans to license and/or develop potential commercial projects. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

We hope to develop a plant in a major metropolitan area. We are working to develop one or more locations where waste collected would be processed using our technology and the biomass produced used to create heat and/or power. 

In addition to the developments we are currently contemplating, from time to time other development opportunities are presented to us and we evaluate those potential developments. If we are able to operate a plant, and thereafter refine our know-how with respect to implementation of the technology, we intend to seek to partner with waste haulers, landfill owners and municipalities to implement the technology across the United States and internationally. 

Any development of commercial plants and/or implementation of the licensing of our technology described above will require significant additional capital, which we currently do not have. To date, we have not been successful in raising the amount of capital necessary to implement our business plan and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital. While we anticipate that financing for the commercial biomass recovery plant and these other potential projects could also be provided in part via tax exempt bond financing or through the use of loan guarantees from local, state and federal authorities, we have not secured any such financing and there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure any such financing. 

In October 2014, we entered into a nonbinding Memorandum of Understanding (&#8220;MOU&#8221;) with various parties (combined, the &#8220;Parties&#8221;) which memorializes the Parties&#8217; intent for CleanTech to develop and operate a MSW transfer station and biomass recovery plant on land in Jersey City, NJ not owned by CleanTech. All Parties agree to work towards Definitive Agreements, as soon as reasonably practicable, including but not limited to: an escrow agreement whereby CleanTech would fund engineering and legal expenses incurred during the permitting application process, an option agreement providing CleanTech the right to purchase the permit applicant, a lease agreement for a period of not less than 20 years, including two 5 year options to extend the term of the lease to 30 years, and non-compete agreements from the parties. This MOU will terminate upon the earlier of: (i) execution of the Definitive Agreements, (ii) mutual agreement between the Parties, and (iii) 5 PM (EST) on June 29, 2015. While this MOU has expired, we continue to work towards a Definitive Agreement. 

Bio-Fuel and Bio-Chemical Joint Testing/Research 

If we are able to process MSW into biomass through our potential future biomass recovery plant and/or in future commercial vessels, we hope to enter into joint research agreements with companies looking to process biomass in their system(s) for various types of energy and chemical production. We believe that this testing and research could provide possible revenue streams, projects and additional opportunities for use of our biomass. 

In February 2012, we entered into a Confidentiality Agreement and Material Transfer Agreement with Sweetwater Energy, Inc. (&#8220;Sweetwater&#8221;), a renewable energy company with patent-pending technology to produce sugars from several types of biomass for use in the biofuel, biochemical and bioplastics markets. We agreed and coordinated with the Third-Party Operator in Australia to ship 10 pounds of biomass produced at the Third-Party Operator&#8217;s facility to the Sweetwater lab for testing. The shipment arrived in May 2012 and Sweetwater has completed their initial testing. In June 2011, we entered into a Confidential Disclosure and Sampling Agreement with Novozymes North America, Inc., a developer of industrial enzymes, microorganisms, and biopharmaceutical ingredients for conversion into a variety of energy and chemical products. In July 2011, we supplied a sample of our biomass product for testing in their enzymatic hydrolysis process. Some initial testing was completed during the 3 rd Quarter of 2011. We expect further testing to occur for both of these companies and for possible additional companies upon securing the requisite financing to build a biomass recovery plant to process MSW. 

New Technologies; Commercializing Existing Technologies 

Because of our ability to produce a clean, homogenous biomass feedstock, we may be presented with the opportunity to partner with or acquire new technologies once we become operational. In addition to developing our current technologies, we intend to continue to add technologies to our suite of solutions that complement our core operations. We believe that our current technologies and aspects of technologies in development or contemplation will enable us to eventually expand our business to use organic material from other waste streams such as municipal bio-solids from waste water facilities and animal waste for fuel production. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

To commercialize our technology, we anticipate we will need to: 

&#183; 

construct and operate a commercial plant that: (i) processes MSW into cellulosic biomass for conversion into energy or chemical products and (ii) separates recyclables (metals, plastics, glass) for single-stream recycling; 

&#183; 

identify and partner with landfill owners, waste haulers and municipalities to identify locations suitable for our technology; and 

&#183; 

pursue additional opportunities to implement our technology in commercial settings at transfer stations and landfills in our licensed territories. 

Our ability to implement this strategy is heavily dependent on our ability to raise significant amounts of additional capital and to hire appropriate managers and staff. Our success will also depend on a variety of market forces and other developments beyond our control. 

Industry Overview 

There are two types of MSW Disposal: 

&#183; 

Municipal Solid Waste Landfills (&#8220;MSWLFs&#8221;) - includes municipal solid waste, commercial waste, industrial waste, construction and demolition debris, and bioreactors, and 

&#183; 

Mass Burn/Incineration Plants 

Municipal Solid Waste Landfills 

MSWLFs primarily receive household waste and commercial waste. MSWLFs can also receive non-hazardous sludge, industrial solid waste, and construction and demolition debris. All MSWLFs must comply with various federal, state and local laws and regulations. 

Disposing of waste in a landfill involves burying waste, and this remains a common practice in most countries. Historically, landfills were often established in disused quarries, mining voids or borrow pits. A properly-designed and well-managed landfill can be a hygienic and relatively inexpensive method of disposing of waste materials. Older, poorly-designed or poorly-managed landfills can create a number of adverse environmental impacts such as wind-blown litter, attraction of vermin, and generation of liquid leachate. Another common byproduct of landfills is gas (mostly composed of methane and carbon dioxide), which is produced as organic waste breaks down anaerobically. This gas can create odor problems, kill surface vegetation, and contributes to global warming. 

Waste haulers or municipalities pay tipping fees, or gate rates, on a per ton basis to dispose of garbage at a landfill. Gate rates operate in a manner similar to the published prices for airline tickets or hotels, before discounts or contract prices (which could be higher or lower) are considered. The gate rate is the true daily market value of the tipping fee. The average tipping fee in the United States has risen consistently from $8.20 per ton in 1985 to $45.02 in late 2012 (the latest data available) and continues to increase. 

Mass Burn/Incineration Plants 

Mass Burn &#160; - Mass burn is combusting MSW generally without any pre-processing or separation. The resulting steam is employed for industrial uses or for generating electricity. Mass burn facilities are sized according to the daily amount of solid waste they expect to receive. Most mass burn plants can remove non-combustible steel and iron for recycling before combustion using magnetic separation processes. Other non-ferrous metals can be recovered from the leftover ash. 

Waste-to-Energy (WTE) Plants - Current operating WTE plants burn MSW in a controlled environment to create steam or electricity. Through this process the volume of solid waste is reduced by about 90%. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Modular Incinerators - Modular incinerators are small mass burn plants, with a capacity of 15 to 100 tons per day. The boilers for modular incinerators are built in a factory and shipped to the WTE site, rather than being built on the WTE site itself. The advantage of a modular WTE incinerator is flexibility. If more capacity is needed, modular WTE units can be added. These facilities are used primarily by small communities and industrial sites. Costs limit the use of this technology because the return on investment in terms of energy produced over time is much lower than in mass burn plants. 

Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF) Plants - RDF plants process solid waste before it is burned. A typical plant will remove non-combustible items, such as glass, metals and other recyclable materials. The remaining solid waste is then shredded into smaller pieces for burning. RDF plants require significantly more sorting and handling than mass burn, but can recover recyclables and remove some potentially environmentally harmful materials prior to combustion. RDF can be burned in power boilers at factories or even at large housing complexes. Sometimes RDF materials are "densified" (compacted at high pressure) to make fuel pellets. The "pellet fuel" may also include various sludges, by-products of municipal or industrial sewage treatment plants. 

MSW contains a diverse mix of waste materials, some benign and some very toxic. Effective environmental management of MSW plants aims to exclude toxics from the MSW-fuel and to control air pollution emissions from the WTE plants. Toxic materials include trace metals such as lead, cadmium and mercury, and trace organics, such as dioxins and furans. Such toxins pose an environmental problem if they are released into the air with plant emissions or if they are dispersed in the soil and allowed to migrate into ground water supplies and work their way into the food chain. The control of such toxics and air pollution are key features of environmental regulations governing MSW fueled electric generation. 

U.S. EPA rules are among the most stringent environmental standards for WTE facilities in the world. These rules mandate that all facilities use the most modern air pollution control equipment available to ensure that WTE smokestack emissions are as clean as possible, and are safe for human health and the environment. 

Burning any fuel, including MSW, can produce a number of pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and fine particles containing heavy metals. Other toxic organic compounds, such as dioxins, are also potential emissions from any combustive activity where certain chemical compounds are present, a situation that could take place in the WTE process. Air emission control devices in a WTE facility usually include: 

&#183; 

Dry Scrubbers &#8211; these "wash" the air emissions from the WTE process (called the gas stream) and remove any acidic gases by passing the gas stream through a liquid. 

&#183; 

Electrostatic Precipitators (ESP) &#8211; these use high voltage electricity to remove up to 98% of all particles remaining in the gas stream after passing through the scrubbers, including any heavy metal particles. 

&#183; 

Fabric Filters (baghouses) &#8211; these consist of a series of nearly two thousand fabric bags made of heat-resistant material which filter remaining particles from the gas stream. This includes any large concentrations of condensed toxic organic compounds (such as dioxins) and heavy metal compounds. 

Incinerators and RDF processors are paid tipping fees for the garbage that they accept. Typically, these fees are costlier than the fees paid to landfill operators, largely because of the high capital and operating costs at combustion facilities. 

Competition 

Competition in our industry will primarily come from Mass Burn, RDF, and/or WTE plants if we produce power and steam. All of these types of plants use MSW for their feedstock. Many of these plants are operational and have been operating for years in the United States, and thus have substantially more operating experience than our company. We believe our Biomass Recovery Process may produce a cleaner, more homogenous fuel for boilers and gasifiers. 

Environmental Matters 

We believe our operations will be subject to international, federal, state and local laws and regulations with regard to air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal and other environmental matters upon operation. There is always a risk that the federal agencies may enforce certain rules and regulations differently than state and local environmental administrators. Federal, state and local rules and regulations are subject to change, and any such changes could result in greater regulatory burdens on plant operations. We could also be subject to environmental or nuisance claims from adjacent property owners or residents in the areas arising from possible foul smells, noise or other air or water discharges from the plant. We do not know the potential cost of these requirements or potential claims. Environmental laws and regulations that may affect us in the future may include, but are not limited to: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

The Clean Air Act, as well as state laws and regulations impacting air emissions, including State Implementation Plans related to existing and new National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone and particulate matter. Owners and/or operators of air emission sources are responsible for obtaining permits and for annual compliance and reporting. 

&#183; 

The Clean Water Act which requires permits for facilities that discharge wastewaters into the environment. 

&#183; 

The Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which requires certain solid wastes, including hazardous wastes, to be managed pursuant to a comprehensive regulatory regime. 

&#183; 

The National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to consider potential environmental impacts in their decisions, including siting approvals. 

Government Approvals 

The Company is not currently subject to any government approvals or oversight for its current operations other than normal corporate governance and taxes. However, if we are able to begin developing commercial production facilities, we will be subject to multiple federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, such as those described above and for employee health and safety. In addition, some of these laws and regulations will require our prospective facilities to operate under permits that are subject to renewal or modification. A violation of these laws and regulations or permit conditions can result in substantial fines, natural resource damages, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and/or facility shutdowns. 

Our Technology 

We believe we can convert MSW into cellulosic material using our Biomass Recovery Process, which can then be used by a variety of third party technologies as a feedstock to process that cellulosic material into a variety of energy and chemical products. 

Biomass Recovery Process 

MSW contains valuable resources if they can be recovered economically. Waste haulers often bring unsorted waste by truck to material recovery facilities, also known as MRFs, for sorting and removal of selected materials prior to disposal in sanitary landfills. In addition, certain customers of waste haulers separate recyclables prior to collection. Per a February 2016 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) update on MSW, approximately 34.3% of MSW was recycled or composted in 2013. 

The PSC technology was developed at the University of Alabama in Huntsville and improved by Anthony Noll into the technology we refer to as the Biomass Recovery Process. The process separates curbside MSW into organic and inorganic materials using a patented and proprietary process that involves a unique combination of steam, pressure and agitation. The separation is accomplished by placing waste material in a rotating pressure vessel, or autoclave. In the autoclave, the material is heated to several hundred degrees, which sterilizes the waste material, while the pressure and agitation cause a pulping action. This combination is designed to result in a large volume reduction, yielding the following two sterilized resource streams for further manufacturing of new products: 

&#183; 

Cellulosic biomass, a decontaminated, homogeneous feedstock that we expect will represent approximately 50 to 60 percent of the incoming MSW and will be suitable for conversion to multiple energy or chemical products, and 

&#183; 

Separated recyclables (steel cans and other ferrous materials, aluminum cans, plastics, and glass), which we expect will represent about 25 percent of the MSW input and are sorted and can be sold to recyclers. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

The process also creates residual waste (fines, rocks, soil, textiles and non-recyclable fractions), which we expect will represent the remaining 15 to 25 percent of the MSW input. We do not expect to be able to recover any value in this residual waste. We will be required to deliver this waste to landfills and incur the tipping fees expense. 

The process is currently used in a commercial plant operated by a Third-Party Operator in Coffs Harbor, Australia that has been in operation for over seven years. We believe that our process represents a significant improvement over other autoclave technologies currently in use because of: 

&#183; 

the relationship between agitation of the waste material, moisture, and the temperature and pressure of steam in the vessel uses less energy while obtaining a cleaner biomass resource; 

&#183; 

the method of introduction of steam into the autoclave vessel, the pressure range, along with the method of full depressurization, and treatment of the steam being vented from the process to prevent air pollution make our process more environmentally friendly than any other means to handle MSW; 

&#183; 

the method of mixing the heat and steam with the waste uniformly throughout the vessel creates a homogenous feedstock for fuel production; and 

&#183; 

the direct and critical correlation between the length and diameter of the vessel, internal flighting and the total tonnage of waste to be processed for proper mixing and product yield. 

If we are able to continue to develop our business and pursue opportunities, we may incur research and development costs. We incurred no costs in 2015 and 2014 for research and development. 

Principal Products or Services and their Markets 

If we determine that our licensed technologies are commercially viable and we are able to raise a significant amount of additional capital, we may be in a position to begin to license and/or enter into long-term contracts with municipalities, solid waste haulers, and operators of landfills and materials recovery facilities to process a large portion of their waste streams into biomass and recyclable materials. 

Energy/Chemicals 

We expect the primary product we will sell will be biomass from our Biomass Recovery Process to be used for conversion to energy or chemical products. We believe our potential biomass product can be used in multiple varieties of energy production systems. We expect the uses for our biomass product to potentially expand as new energy production technologies are developed. 

MSW Processing Services 

We believe that the opportunity to help communities, haulers and landfill managers reduce the amount of material transported and deposited in landfills is large and growing. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1991, referred to as RCRA, requires landfills to install expensive liners and other equipment to control leaching toxics. Due to the increased costs and expertise required to manage landfills under RCRA, many small, local landfills closed during the 1990&#8217;s. Larger regional landfills were built requiring increased transportation costs for the waste haulers. As a result, landfill space is increasingly scarce and disposal costs have been increasing. 

Currently, landfill operators charge a tipping fee to deliver MSW to a landfill, waste-to-energy facility, recycling facility, transfer station or similar facility. Tipping fees vary widely based on geographic location and the number of available places to dispose of MSW in a given location. Because of the increasing cost pressures on waste haulers and based on current tipping fee pricing, we believe we will be able to negotiate a payment of part of their tipping fee from waste haulers who deliver MSW to us for processing that would range from as low as $15 per ton in some central parts of the country to over $90 per ton in the Northeast and parts of the Southeast. The availability of tipping fees at favorable rates will be a key component of our business. 

Recyclable Byproducts 

We anticipate that our Biomass Recovery Process will generate other recyclable byproducts from the processing of MSW, such as aluminum, metals, tin, steel, glass and plastic (typically 20 to 25 percent of the total waste stream). The markets for these recovered products are volatile and subject to rapid and unpredictable market changes making it impossible at this time to provide estimated per ton cost to revenue information. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 

We believe the emergence of technologies to convert MSW to energy or chemicals is opening new opportunities. What was once perhaps the greatest sanitation and health challenge for communities may eventually become an economic and environmental asset. Instead of adding to landfills already nearing capacity limits, converting MSW into biomass may provide one of the building blocks to a more sustainable energy future. 

Americans produce more than 250 million tons of MSW annually. About 35% of this waste is currently recovered and recycled. We estimate that approximately up to an additional 45-50% could potentially be recovered. As various waste processing technologies are refined, competition for this future resource will likely intensify. As a result, it will be important for us to attempt to secure access to as much MSW as possible through long-term feedstock supply agreements with operators of materials recovery facilities and landfills. 

Intellectual Property Terms 

Biomass North America Licensing, Inc. 

On September 15, 2008, the Company consummated the acquisition of Biomass North America Licensing, Inc., an Illinois corporation (&#8220;Biomass&#8221;), pursuant to a merger between Biomass and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (with Biomass as the surviving subsidiary of the Company) in accordance with an Agreement and Plan of Merger by and between the Company and Biomass. By virtue of the merger, the Company acquired a license agreement pursuant to which the Company holds a license in the United States and Canada to use the patented technology that cleans and separates MSW that we refer to as the Biomass Recovery Process, which is owned by Biomass North America, LLC, the former parent of Biomass (the &#8220;Licensor&#8221;). In July 2010, the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued US patent number 7,745,208 for this process (the &#8220;BRP Patent&#8221;). The BRP Patent expires in June 2028. 

In accordance with a November 2013 amendment, the Company has an exclusive license in the United States and Canada to use the Biomass Recovery Process and includes no performance requirements on the Company; the license agreement is for a term of 21 years from the date of the amendment or the life of any patent issued for the Biomass Recovery Process, including any amendments, modifications or extensions; the license requires that the Company pay a royalty in the amount of $2.00 per ton of MSW used in the Biomass Recovery Process to the Licensor; and the Company released the 4,000,000 shares of common stock to the Licensor previously held in escrow since the merger. 

PSC Patent 

The Company owns U.S. Patent No. 6,306,248 (the &#8220;PSC Patent&#8221;), which is the underlying technology upon which the BRP Patent is based. The Company acquired the PSC Patent on October 22, 2008, pursuant to a Patent Purchase Agreement with World Waste Technologies, Inc. (&#8220;WWT&#8221;). The Patent is the basis for the pressurized steam classification technology that cleans and separates MSW into its component parts, which we refer to as the PSC technology. The PSC Patent expires in November 2017. Pursuant to a Master License Agreement with Bio-Products that the Company acquired in connection with the acquisition of the PSC Patent (the &#8220;Bio-Products License Agreement&#8221;), Bio-Products was the exclusive licensee of the PSC technology (but not the Biomass Recovery Process), although pursuant to a settlement agreement with Bio-Products in March 2009, the Company has the right to use the Biomass Recovery Process worldwide, for any product and with no royalty due to Bio-Products. On September 22, 2010, the Company sent a Notice of Breach to the licensee of our PSC Patent. We received a response from the licensee on November 5, 2010. In February 2011, we became aware that the licensee affected a transfer of the license in violation of the Bio-Products License Agreement. As a result, on March 21, 2011, we sent a notice of termination to the licensee and the transferee terminating the Bio-Products License Agreement. On June 16, 2011, Steve Vande Vegte, a shareholder of the parent of Bio-Products, filed a lawsuit against various individuals and companies, including the Company. The only Cause of Action against the Company was for Declaratory Relief seeking to void our March 2011 termination of the license to which Mr. Vande Vegte is not a party. On August 5, 2011, the Company filed a demurrer requesting that the court dismiss the case on the grounds that Mr. Vande Vegte lacks standing to pursue a claim concerning the license and that the claim raised in the complaint is not ripe. On December 8, 2011, the demurrer to dismiss the Company was granted. In October 2011, a Cross-Complaint was filed by Clean Conversion Technologies, Inc. (&#8220;CCT&#8221;) and Michael Failla against the Company. CCT was seeking to void the Company&#8217;s termination of the Bio-Products License Agreement. This case was voluntarily dismissed per the filing with the court in February 2014. Additionally, CCT filed suit against the Company and Steve Vande Vegte alleging anti-trust violations. This case was voluntarily dismissed per the filing with the court in August 2013.
