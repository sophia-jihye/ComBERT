 Item 1. Business. 

General 

New Residential is a publicly traded real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;) primarily focused on opportunistically investing in, and actively managing, investments related to residential real estate. We were formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of Newcastle Investment Corp. (&#8220;Newcastle&#8221;) in September 2011 and were spun-off from Newcastle on May 15, 2013, which we refer to as the &#8220;distribution date.&#8221; Our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol &#8220;NRZ.&#8221; We are externally managed and advised by an affiliate (our &#8220;Manager&#8221;) of Fortress Investment Group LLC (&#8220;Fortress&#8221;) pursuant to a management agreement (the &#8220;Management Agreement&#8221;). 

Our goal is to drive strong risk-adjusted returns primarily through our investments, and our investment guidelines are purposefully broad to enable us to make investments in a wide array of assets in diverse markets, including non-real estate related assets such as consumer loans. We generally target assets that generate significant current cash flows and/or have the potential for meaningful capital appreciation. We aim to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders, which at times incorporates the use of leverage. 

We intend to continue to invest opportunistically across the residential real estate market. We expect our asset allocation and target assets to change over time depending on the types of investments our Manager identifies and the investment decisions our Manager makes in light of prevailing market conditions. For more information about our investment guidelines, see &#8220;&#8212;Investment Guidelines.&#8221; 

The residential real estate market includes the approximately $10 trillion U.S. mortgage market. This market is comprised of numerous components, including the following: 

Mortgage Loans: Performing, Non-performing, Re-performing, and Reverse Loans and Real Estate Owned 

Performing loans are mortgage loans where the borrower is generally current on required payments; by contrast, non-performing loans are mortgage loans where the borrower is delinquent or in default. Re-performing loans were formally non-performing but became performing again, often as a result of a loan modification where the lender agrees to modified terms with the borrower rather than foreclosing on the underlying property. Reverse mortgage loans are a special type of loan under which the borrower is typically paid a monthly amount, increasing the balance of the loan, and are typically collected when the property is sold or the borrower no longer resides at the property. If a borrower defaults on a loan and the lender takes ownership of the underlying property through foreclosure, that property is referred to as real estate owned (&#8220;REO&#8221;). 

Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (&#8220;RMBS&#8221;): Agency and Non-Agency and Call Rights 

Mortgage loans are often packaged into pools held in securitization entities which issue securities (RMBS) collateralized by the loans. Agency RMBS are RMBS issued or guaranteed by a U.S. government agency, such as the Government National Mortgage Association (&#8220;Ginnie Mae&#8221;), or by a government-sponsored enterprise (&#8220;GSE&#8221;), such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (&#8220;Fannie Mae&#8221;) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (&#8220;Freddie Mac&#8221;). Non-Agency RMBS are issued by either public trusts or private label securitization (&#8220;PLS&#8221;) entities. 

RMBS may be subject to call rights. Call rights permit the holder of the rights to purchase all of the mortgage loans which are collateralizing the related securitization for a price generally equal to the outstanding balance of such loans plus interest and certain other amounts (such as outstanding servicing advances and unpaid servicing fees). Call rights may be subject to limitations on when they may be exercised (such as specific dates or upon the reduction of the outstanding balances of the remaining mortgage loans to a specified level). 

Mortgage Servicing Rights and Excess Mortgage Servicing Rights 

A mortgage servicing right (&#8220;MSR&#8221;) provides a mortgage servicer with the right to service a pool of mortgage loans in exchange for a portion of the interest payments made on the underlying mortgage loans. An MSR is made up of two components: a basic fee and an Excess MSR. The basic fee is the amount of compensation for the performance of servicing duties, and the Excess MSR is the amount that exceeds the basic fee. An owner of an Excess MSR is not required to assume any servicing duties, advance obligations or liabilities associated with the loan pool underlying the MSR unless otherwise specified through agreement. 

Servicer Advances 

Servicer advances are a customary feature of residential mortgage securitization transactions and represent one of the duties for which a servicer is compensated through the basic fee component of the related MSR, since the advances are non-interest bearing. Servicer advances are generally reimbursable cash payments made by a servicer (i) when the borrower fails to make scheduled payments due on a mortgage loan or (ii) to support the value of the collateral property. The purpose of the advances is to provide liquidity, rather than credit enhancement, to the underlying residential mortgage securitization transaction. Servicer advances are generally permitted to be repaid from amounts received with respect to the related mortgage loan or pool of mortgage loans. 

For more information, see &#8220;&#8212;Mortgage Industry Overview&#8221; below . 

We currently conduct our business through the following segments: &#32; 

Servicing Related Assets 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Excess Mortgage Servicing Rights (&#8220;Excess MSRs&#8221;): &#32;We have acquired Excess MSRs on residential mortgage loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance (&#8220;UPB&#8221;) as of December 31, 2015 &#32;of $402.4 billion . As of December 31, 2015 , the carrying value of our Excess MSRs was approximately $1.8 billion , representing 11.9% &#32;of our total assets, and our Excess MSRs segment represented 58.4% &#32;of our equity, net of financing. 

&#8226; 

Servicer Advances : We have made three direct investments in servicer advances, including the basic fee component of the related MSRs. The first direct investment was made through a joint venture entity of which we are the managing member (the &#8220;Buyer&#8221;), and which we consolidate in our financial statements. In addition, we have indirectly invested in servicer advances through securities collateralized by servicer advances. As of December 31, 2015 , the carrying value of our servicer advances, including the basic fee component of the related MSRs, and related securities, was approximately $7.9 billion , representing 51.7% &#32;of our total assets, and our Servicer Advances segment represented 17.5% &#32;of our equity, net of financing and interests held by third party investors in the Buyer. 

Residential Securities and Loans 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Real Estate Securities: &#32;We acquire and manage a diversified portfolio of credit sensitive real estate securities, including Non-Agency and Agency RMBS. As of December 31, 2015 , the carrying value of our real estate securities, excluding those collateralized by servicer advances, which are included in our Servicer Advances segment above, was approximately $2.1 billion &#32;( $0.9 billion &#32;for Agency RMBS and $1.2 billion &#32;for Non-Agency RMBS), representing 13.6% &#32;of our total assets, and our Real Estate Securities segment represented 16.5% &#32;of our equity, net of financing. In addition, we own call rights with respect to certain securitization trusts which are collateralized by mortgage loans with a UPB of approximately $200.0 billion . 

&#8226; 

Real Estate Loans: &#32;We have acquired residential mortgage loans, including performing, non-performing, re-performing and reverse mortgage loans, and related REO. We have also directly purchased REO unrelated to the collapse or non-performing loan resolution process. As of December 31, 2015 , the carrying value of our residential mortgage loans (including REO) was $1.2 billion , representing 7.6% &#32;of our total assets, and our Real Estate Loans segment represented 9.2% &#32;of our equity, net of financing. 

Other Investments 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Consumer Loans: &#32;In April 2013, we acquired an interest in a pool of consumer loans, including unsecured and homeowner loans, held in an unconsolidated entity. In October 2014, we refinanced this entity and received a distribution in excess of our basis such that the carrying value of our investment in consumer loans was reduced to zero. We continue to own an interest in this entity, from which we expect to receive significant future cash flows. 

In addition, as of December 31, 2015 , we had cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, derivative assets, and other assets of $2.3 billion , representing 15.2% &#32;of our total assets, and our Consumer Loans and Corporate segments represented (1.6)% &#32;of our equity, net of dividends, financings and other payables, primarily as a result of dividends payable. 

The following table summarizes our segments as of December 31, 2015 &#32;(in thousands):

The Market Opportunity 

We believe that unfolding developments in the U.S. residential housing market are generating significant investment opportunities. The U.S. residential real estate market is vast: the value of the housing market totaled approximately $21 trillion as of November 2015, including about $12.1 trillion of home equity and $9.4 trillion of mortgage debt outstanding, according to Freddie Mac. The residential mortgage industry is undergoing major structural changes that are transforming the way mortgages are originated, owned and serviced. 

We also believe that we are one of only a select number of market participants that have the combination of capital, industry expertise and key business relationships we think are necessary to take advantage of these opportunities. 

Mortgage Industry Overview 

Over the last few decades the complexity of the market for residential mortgage loans in the U.S. has dramatically increased. A borrower seeking credit for a home purchase will typically obtain financing from a financial institution, such as a bank, savings association or credit union. In the past, these institutions would generally have held a majority of their originated mortgage loans as interest-earning assets on their balance sheets and would have performed all activities associated with servicing the loans, including accepting principal and interest payments, making advances for real estate taxes and property and casualty insurance premiums, initiating collection actions for delinquent payments and conducting foreclosures. 

Now, institutions that originate mortgage loans generally hold a smaller portion of such loans as assets on their balance sheets and instead sell a significant portion of the loans they originate to third parties. The GSEs are currently the largest purchasers of home mortgage loans. Under a process known as securitization, the GSEs and financial institutions typically package residential mortgage loans into pools that are sold to securitization trusts. These securitization trusts fund the acquisition of mortgage loans by issuing securities, known as RMBS, which entitle the owner of such securities to receive a portion of the interest and/or principal collected on the mortgage loans in the pool. The purchasers of the RMBS are typically large institutions, such as pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies, hedge funds and REITs. The agreement that governs the packaging of mortgage loans into a pool, the servicing of such mortgage loans and the terms of the RMBS issued by the securitization trust is often referred to as a pooling and servicing agreement. 

In the ten years prior to the credit dislocation in 2007, the securitization market drove an increase in the number of residential mortgage loans outstanding. Since 2007, the mortgage industry has been characterized by reduced origination and securitization activities, particularly for subprime and Alt-A mortgage loans. The role of private capital has increased in financing the mortgage origination process despite the GSEs&#8217; presence as the largest purchasers of home mortgage loans. 

In connection with a securitization, a number of entities perform specific roles with respect to the mortgage loans in a pool, including the trustee and the mortgage servicer. The trustee holds legal title to the mortgage loans on behalf of the owner of the RMBS and either maintains the mortgage note and related documents itself or with a custodian. One or more other entities are appointed pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement to service the mortgage loans. In some cases, the servicer is the same institution that originated the loan, and, in other cases, it may be a different institution. The duties of servicers for mortgage loans that have been securitized are generally discussed below, and are generally required to be performed in accordance with industry-accepted servicing practices and the terms of the pooling and servicing agreement, mortgage note and applicable law. A servicer generally takes actions, such as foreclosure, in the name and on behalf of the trustee. The trustee or a separate securities administrator for the trust receives the payments collected by the servicer on the mortgage loans and distributes them to the investors in the RMBS pursuant to the terms of the pooling and servicing agreement. 

Segments of the Residential Mortgage Loan Market 

The residential mortgage market is commonly divided into a number of categories based on certain mortgage loan characteristics, including the credit quality of borrowers and the types of institutions that originate or finance such loans. While there are no universally accepted definitions, the residential mortgage loan market is commonly divided by market participants into the following categories. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

GSE and Government Guaranteed Loans. &#32;This category of mortgage loans includes &#8220;conforming loans,&#8221; which are first lien mortgage loans that are secured by single-family residences that meet or &#8220;conform&#8221; to the underwriting standards established by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The conforming loan limit is established by statute and currently is $417,000 with certain exceptions for high-priced real estate markets. This category also includes mortgage loans issued to borrowers that do not meet conforming loan standards, but who qualify for a loan that is insured or guaranteed by the government through Ginnie Mae, primarily through federal programs operated by the Federal Housing Administration (&#8220;FHA&#8221;) and the Department of Veterans Affairs. 

&#8226; 

Non-GSE or Government Guaranteed Loans. &#32;Residential mortgage loans that are not guaranteed by the GSEs or the government are generally referred to as &#8220;non-conforming loans&#8221; and fall into one of the following categories: jumbo, subprime, Alt-A or second lien loans. The loans may be non-conforming due to various factors, including mortgage balances in excess of Agency underwriting guidelines, borrower characteristics, loan characteristics and level of documentation. 

&#8226; 

Jumbo . Jumbo mortgage loans have original principal amounts that exceed the statutory conforming limit for GSE loans. Jumbo borrowers generally have strong credit histories and provide full loan documentation, including verification of income and assets. 

&#8226; 

Subprime . Subprime mortgage loans are generally issued to borrowers with weak credit histories, who make low or no down payments on the properties they purchase or have limited documentation of their income or assets. Subprime borrowers generally pay higher interest rates and fees than prime borrowers. 

&#8226; 

Alt-A . Alt-A mortgage loans are generally issued to borrowers with risk profiles that fall between prime and subprime. These loans have one or more high-risk features, such as the borrower having a high debt-to-income ratio, limited documentation verifying the borrower&#8217;s income or assets, or the option of making monthly payments that are lower than required for a fully amortizing loan. Alt-A mortgage loans generally have interest rates that fall between the interest rates on conforming loans and subprime loans. 

&#8226; 

Second Lien . Second mortgages and home equity lines are often referred to as second liens and fall into a separate category of the residential mortgage market. These loans typically have higher interest rates than loans secured by first liens because the lender generally will only receive proceeds from a foreclosure of a property after the first lien holder is paid in full. In addition, these loans often feature higher loan-to-value ratios and are less secure than first lien mortgages. 

Servicing Related Assets 

Excess MSRs 

An MSR provides a mortgage servicer with the right to service a pool of mortgage loans in exchange for a portion of the interest payments made on the underlying mortgage loans. This amount typically ranges from 25 to 50 bps times the UPB of the mortgage loans. An MSR is made up of two components: a basic fee and an Excess MSR. The basic fee is the amount of compensation needed for the performance of servicing duties (including advance obligations), and the Excess MSR is the amount that exceeds the basic fee. For example, if an MSR is 30 bps and the basic fee is 5 bps, then the Excess MSR is 25 bps. In our capacity as the owner of an Excess MSR, we are not required to assume any servicing duties, advance obligations or liabilities associated with 

the loan pools underlying our investment, unless otherwise specified through agreement. We have purchased servicer advances, including the basic fee component of the related MSRs, on certain loan pools underlying our Excess MSRs. 

As of the third quarter of 2015, the Top 100 mortgage servicers serviced approximately $10 trillion &#32;of residential mortgages according to Inside Mortgage Finance. Of the $10 trillion , approximately 74% &#32;of these MSRs were serviced by banks, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. We expect this percentage to decline as banks face pressure to reduce their MSR exposure as a result of heightened capital reserve requirements under Basel III, regulatory scrutiny and a more challenging servicing environment, among other reasons. As banks or nonbank servicers sell MSRs, there may be an opportunity for us to invest in the corresponding Excess MSRs. 

There are a number of reasons why we believe Excess MSRs may represent a compelling investment opportunity: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Supply-Demand Imbalance . Since 2010, banks have sold or committed to sell MSRs totaling more than $3 trillion &#32;of the approximately $10 trillion mortgage market. As a result of the regulatory and other pressures facing bank servicers, we believe the volume of MSR sales is likely to be substantial for some period of time. We estimate that MSRs on approximately $150 billion &#32;of mortgages are currently for sale, which would require a capital investment of approximately $1 billion to $1.5 billion &#32;based on current pricing dynamics. We believe that nonbank servicers, who acquire MSRs and are constrained by capital limitations, such as Nationstar Mortgage LLC (&#8220;Nationstar&#8221;), will continue to sell a portion of the Excess MSRs. In addition, approximately $1.5 trillion &#32;of new loans are expected to be originated in 2016 according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. We believe this creates an opportunity to enter into &#8220;flow arrangements,&#8221; whereby loan originators agree to sell Excess MSRs on newly originated loans on a recurring basis (often monthly or quarterly). Given this combined dynamic, we believe $2 trillion &#32;of MSRs could be sold or available over the next few years. Increased competition for these MSR assets has driven prices higher recently. There can be no assurance that we will make additional investments in Excess MSRs or that any future investment in Excess MSRs will generate returns similar to the returns on our original investments in Excess MSRs. 

&#8226; 

Attractive Pricing . While prices have rebounded from the lows, we believe that MSRs continue to offer attractive returns. 

&#8226; 

Significant Barrier to Entry . Non-servicers, like us, cannot directly own an MSR as a named servicer and would therefore need to partner with a servicer in order to invest in MSRs. The number of strong, scalable non-bank servicers is limited. Moreover, in the case of Excess MSRs on Agency pools, the servicer must be Agency-approved. As a result, non-servicers seeking to invest in Excess MSRs generally face a significant barrier to entering the market, particularly if they do not have a relationship with a quality servicer. We believe our track record of investing in Excess MSRs and our established relationship with Nationstar give us a competitive advantage over other potential investors. We have begun the process of acquiring servicing licenses from various states and seeking servicing licenses from GSEs to facilitate our ability to directly purchase mortgage servicing rights. 

We pioneered investments in Excess MSRs (while we were a wholly owned subsidiary of Newcastle) and we believe we remain the most active REIT in the sector. However, the timing, size and potential returns of future investments in Excess MSRs may be less attractive than our prior investments in this sector due to a number of factors, most of which are beyond our control. 

Servicer Advances 

Servicer advances are a customary feature of residential mortgage securitization transactions and represent one of the duties for which a servicer is compensated through the basic fee component of the related MSR, since the advances are non-interest bearing. Our investments in servicer advances include the rights to the basic fee component of the related MSR. 

Servicer advances typically fall into one of three categories: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Principal and Interest Advances : Cash payments made by the servicer to cover scheduled payments of principal of, and interest on, a mortgage loan that have not been paid on a timely basis by the borrower. 

&#8226; 

Escrow Advances (Taxes and Insurance Advances) : Cash payments made by the servicer to third parties on behalf of the borrower for real estate taxes and insurance premiums on the property that have not been paid on a timely basis by the borrower. 

&#8226; 

Foreclosure Advances : Cash payments made by the servicer to third parties for the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the foreclosure, preservation and sale of the mortgaged property, including attorneys&#8217; and other professional fees. 

The purpose of the advances is to provide liquidity, rather than credit enhancement, to the underlying residential mortgage securitization transaction. Servicer advances are generally permitted to be repaid from amounts received with respect to the related 

mortgage loan, including payments from the borrower or amounts received from the liquidation of the property securing the loan, which is referred to as &#8220;loan-level recovery.&#8221; 

Residential mortgage servicing agreements generally require a servicer to make advances in respect of serviced mortgage loans unless the servicer determines in good faith that the advance would not be ultimately recoverable from the proceeds of the related mortgage loan or the mortgaged property. In many cases, if the servicer determines that an advance previously made would not be recoverable from these sources, or if such advance is not recovered when the loan is repaid or related property is liquidated, then, the servicer is, most often, entitled to withdraw funds from the custodial account for payments on the serviced mortgage loans to reimburse the applicable advance. This is what is often referred to as a &#8220;general collections backstop.&#8221; See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business&#8212;Servicer advances may not be recoverable or may take longer to recover than we expect, which could cause us to fail to achieve our targeted return on our investment in servicer advances.&#8221; 

The status of investments in servicer advances for purposes of the REIT requirements is uncertain, and therefore our ability to make these kinds of investments may be limited. We currently hold our investment in servicer advances in a taxable REIT subsidiary. 

In 2015, we purchased our first rated bonds backed by securitized pools of servicer advances issued through transactions sponsored by mortgage servicers. Servicer advance securitizations are generally rated &#8220;Master Trust&#8221; structures with multiple series of notes and one or more variable funding notes sharing in the same pool of collateral. Each note class has a specific advance rate and rating. We may pursue similar investments as opportunities arise. 

Residential Securities and Loans 

RMBS 

We invest in both Agency RMBS and Non-Agency RMBS. As of the third quarter of 2015 , approximately $7 trillion of the $10 trillion &#32;of residential mortgage loans outstanding was securitized, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. Of the securitized mortgage loans, approximately $6 trillion were Agency RMBS, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, and the balance was Non-Agency RMBS. 

Agency RMBS generally offer more stable cash flows and historically have been subject to lower credit risk and greater price stability than the other types of residential mortgage investments we intend to target. The Agency RMBS that we may acquire could be secured by fixed-rate mortgages, adjustable-rate mortgages or hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages. More information about certain types of Agency RMBS in which we have invested or may invest is set forth below. 

Mortgage pass-through certificates . Mortgage pass-through certificates are securities representing interests in &#8220;pools&#8221; of mortgage loans secured by residential real property where payments of both interest and principal, plus pre-paid principal, on the securities are made monthly to holders of the securities, in effect &#8220;passing through&#8221; monthly payments made by the individual borrowers on the mortgage loans that underlie the securities, net of fees paid in connection with the issuance of the securities and the servicing of the underlying mortgage loans. 

Interest Only Agency RMBS . This type of stripped security only entitles the holder to interest payments. The yield to maturity of interest only Agency RMBS is extremely sensitive to the rate of principal payments (particularly prepayments) on the underlying pool of mortgage loans. If we decide to invest in these types of securities, we anticipate doing so primarily to take advantage of particularly attractive prepayment-related or structural opportunities in the Agency RMBS markets. 

To-be-announced forward contract positions (&#8220;TBAs&#8221;) . We utilize TBAs in order to invest in Agency RMBS. Pursuant to these TBAs, we agree to purchase or sell, for future delivery, Agency RMBS with certain principal and interest terms and certain types of underlying collateral, but the particular Agency RMBS to be delivered would not be identified until shortly before the TBA settlement date. Our ability to purchase Agency RMBS through TBAs may be limited by the 75% income and asset tests applicable to REITs. 

We believe there continue to be opportunities to acquire Non-Agency RMBS at attractive risk-adjusted yields, with the potential for meaningful upside if the U.S. economy and housing market continue to strengthen. Furthermore, we believe that in many Non-Agency RMBS vehicles there is a meaningful discrepancy between the value of the Non-Agency RMBS and the recovery value of the underlying collateral. We continue to pursue opportunities in structured transactions that enable us to realize this difference, particularly through the acquisition and execution of call rights. We control the call rights on Non-Agency deals with a total UPB of approximately $200.0 billion . Call rights become exercisable when the current principal balance of the underlying mortgage loans is generally equal to or lower than 10% of their original balance. We will exercise call rights when economical, which is impacted by the value of underlying performing loans as well as non-performing loan and real estate owned percentages and 

values. However, the timing, size and potential returns of future call transactions may be less attractive than our prior activity in this sector due to a number of factors, most of which are beyond our control. 

The Non-Agency RMBS we may acquire could be secured by fixed-rate mortgages, adjustable-rate mortgages or hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages. The mortgage loan collateral may be classified as &#8220;conforming&#8221; or &#8220;non-conforming,&#8221; depending on a variety of factors. 

Real Estate Loans and Real Estate Owned 

We believe there may be attractive opportunities to invest in portfolios of non-performing and other residential mortgage loans, along with foreclosed properties. In certain of these investments, we would expect to acquire the loans at a deep discount to their face amount, and we (either independently or with a servicing co-investor) would seek to resolve the loans at a substantially higher valuation. In other investments, we would expect to acquire the foreclosed property at a deep discount to its value, and we would seek to monetize the discount through property improvements and sales. We would seek to improve performance by transferring the servicing to Nationstar or another reputable servicer, which we believe could increase our returns. In addition, we may seek to employ leverage to increase returns, either through traditional financing lines or, if available, securitization options. 

While a number of portfolios of non-performing residential loans have been sold since the financial crisis, we believe the volume of such sales may increase for a number of reasons. For example, with improved balance sheets, many large banks have more financial flexibility to recognize losses on non-performing assets. HUD, which acquires non-performing loans from Ginnie Mae securitizations, has been increasing the number of portfolio sales. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have also undertaken a number of portfolio sales. In addition, we believe that residential loan servicers&#8212;which have traditionally resorted to loan foreclosure procedures and subsequent property sales to maximize recoveries on non-performing loans&#8212;may increase sales of defaulted loans. To the extent any of these dynamics results in a meaningful volume of non-performing loan sales, we believe they may pose attractive investment opportunities for us. 

Other Investments 

We may pursue other types of investments as the market evolves, such as our opportunistic investment in consumer loans in April 2013. Our Manager makes decisions about our investments in accordance with broad investment guidelines adopted by our board of directors. Accordingly, we may, without a stockholder vote, change our target asset classes and acquire a variety of assets that may differ from, and are possibly riskier than, our current portfolio. For more information about our investment guidelines, see &#8220;&#8212;Investment Guidelines.&#8221;

Over time, we expect to opportunistically adjust our portfolio composition in response to market conditions. 

Investment Guidelines 

Our board of directors has adopted a broad set of investment guidelines to be used by our Manager to evaluate specific investments. Our general investment guidelines prohibit any investment that would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT, and any investment that would cause us to be regulated as an investment company. These investment guidelines may be changed by our board of directors without the approval of our stockholders. If our board changes any of our investment guidelines, we will disclose such changes in our next required periodic report. 

Financing Strategy 

Our objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders, which at times incorporates the use of leverage. To date, we have generally funded the acquisition of Excess MSRs on an unlevered basis; however, we may at times lever our Excess MSRs. The amount of leverage we deploy for a particular investment depends upon an assessment of a variety of factors, which may include the anticipated liquidity and price volatility of our assets; the gap between the duration of assets and liabilities, including hedges; the availability and cost of financing the assets; our opinion of the creditworthiness of financing counterparties; the health of the U.S. economy and the residential mortgage and housing markets; our outlook on interest rates; the credit quality of the loans underlying our investments; and our outlook for asset spreads relative to financing costs. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8212;Debt Obligations&#8221; for further details about our debt obligations. 

Hedging Strategy 

Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and exclusion from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the &#8220;1940 Act&#8221;), we may, from time to time, utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings. Under the U.S. federal income tax laws applicable to REITs, we generally will be able to enter into certain transactions to hedge indebtedness that we may incur, or plan to incur, to acquire or carry real estate assets, although our total gross income from interest rate hedges that do not meet this requirement and other non-qualifying sources generally must not exceed 5% of our gross income. 

Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and exclusion from registration under the 1940 Act, we may also engage in a variety of interest rate management techniques that seek on the one hand to mitigate the influence of interest rate changes on the values of some of our assets and on the other hand help us achieve our risk management objectives. The U.S. federal income tax rules applicable to REITs may require us to implement certain of these techniques through a domestic taxable REIT subsidiary (&#8220;TRS&#8221;) that is fully subject to U.S. federal corporate income taxation. Our interest rate management techniques may include: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

interest rate swap agreements, interest rate cap agreements, exchange-traded derivatives and swaptions; 

&#8226; 

puts and calls on securities or indices of securities; 

&#8226; 

U.S. Treasury securities and options on U.S. Treasury securities; 

&#8226; 

TBAs; and 

&#8226; 

other similar transactions. 

Subject to maintaining our REIT qualification, we may utilize hedging instruments, including interest rate swap agreements, interest rate cap agreements, interest rate floor or collar agreements or other financial instruments that we deem appropriate. Specifically, we may attempt to reduce interest rate risks and to minimize exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of match funded financing structures, when appropriate, whereby we may seek (1) to match the maturities of our debt obligations with the maturities of our assets and (2) to match the interest rates on our assets with like-kind debt (i.e., we may finance floating rate assets with floating rate debt and fixed-rate assets with fixed-rate debt), directly or through the use of interest rate swap agreements, interest rate cap agreements, or other financial instruments, or through a combination of these strategies. We expect these instruments will allow us to minimize, but not eliminate, the risk that we have to refinance our liabilities before the maturities of our assets and to reduce the impact of changing interest rates on our earnings and liquidity. 

The Management Agreement 

We entered into a Management Agreement with our Manager, an affiliate of Fortress, which was subsequently amended and restated on August 1, 2013, on August 5, 2014 and on May 7, 2015, pursuant to which our Manager provides for a management team and other professionals who are responsible for implementing our business strategy, subject to the supervision of our board of directors. Our Manager is responsible for, among other things, (i) setting investment criteria in accordance with broad investment guidelines adopted by our board of directors, (ii) sourcing, analyzing and executing acquisitions, (iii) providing financial and accounting management services and (iv) performing other duties as specified in the Management Agreement. 

We pay our Manager an annual management fee equal to 1.5% of our gross equity. Gross equity is generally the equity that was transferred to us by Newcastle on the distribution date, plus total net proceeds from stock offerings, plus certain capital contributions to subsidiaries, less capital distributions and repurchases of common stock. 

Our Manager is entitled to receive annual incentive compensation in an amount equal to the product of (A) 25% of the dollar amount by which (1)(a) the funds from operations before the incentive compensation, excluding funds from operations from investments in the Consumer Loan Companies and any unrealized gains or losses from mark-to-market valuation changes on investments and debt (and any deferred tax impact thereof), per share of common stock, plus (b) earnings (or losses) from the Consumer Loan Companies computed on a level-yield basis (such that the loans are treated as if they qualified as loans acquired with a discount for credit quality as set forth in ASC No. 310-30, as such codification was in effect on June 30, 2013) as if the Consumer Loan Companies had been acquired at their GAAP basis on the distribution date, plus earnings (or losses) from equity method investees invested in Excess MSRs as if such equity method investees had not made a fair value election, plus gains (or losses) from debt restructuring and gains (or losses) from sales of property, and plus non-routine items, minus amortization of non-routine items, in each case per share of common stock, exceed (2) an amount equal to (a) the weighted average of the book value per share of the equity that was transferred to us by Newcastle on the distribution date and the prices per share of our common stock in any offerings by us (adjusted for prior capital dividends or capital distributions) multiplied by (b) a simple interest rate of 10% per annum, multiplied by (B) the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. 

&#8220;Funds from operations&#8221; means net income (computed in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;)), excluding gains (losses) from debt restructuring and gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus depreciation on real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Funds from operations is computed on an unconsolidated basis. The computation of funds from operations may be adjusted at the direction of our independent directors based on changes in, or certain applications of, GAAP. Funds from operations is determined from the date of our separation from Newcastle and without regard to Newcastle&#8217;s prior performance. Funds from operations does not represent and should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, net income, or as a substitute for, or superior to, cash flows from operating activities, each as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and our calculation of this measure may not be comparable to similarly entitled measures reported by other companies. 

The initial term of our Management Agreement expired on May 15, 2014, and the Management Agreement was and will be renewed automatically each year for an additional one-year period unless (i) a majority consisting of at least two-thirds of our independent directors or a simple majority of the holders of outstanding shares of our common stock, agree that there has been unsatisfactory performance that is materially detrimental to us or (ii) a simple majority of our independent directors agree that the management fee payable to our Manager is unfair; provided, that we shall not have the right to terminate our Management Agreement under clause (ii) foregoing if the Manager agrees to continue to provide the services under the Management Agreement at a fee that our independent directors have determined to be fair. 

If we elect not to renew our Management Agreement at the expiration of any such one-year extension term as set forth above, our Manager will be provided with 60 days&#8217; prior notice of any such termination. In the event of such termination, we would be required to pay the termination fee. The termination fee is a fee equal to the sum of (1) the amount of the management fee during the 12 months immediately preceding the date of termination, and (2) the &#8220;Incentive Compensation Fair Value Amount.&#8221; The Incentive Compensation Fair Value Amount is an amount equal to the incentive compensation that would be paid to the Manager if our assets were sold for cash at their then current fair market value (as determined by an appraisal, taking into account, among other things, the expected future value of the underlying investments). 

Fortress, through its affiliates, and principals of Fortress held 2.4 million &#32;shares of our common stock, and Fortress, through its affiliates, held options relating to an additional 10.9 million &#32;shares of our common stock, representing approximately 5.5% &#32;of our common stock on a fully diluted basis, as of December 31, 2015 . 

Policies with Respect to Certain Other Activities 

Subject to the approval of our board of directors, we have the authority to offer our common stock or other equity or debt securities in exchange for property and to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities and may engage in such activities in the future. 

We also may make loans to, or provide guarantees of certain obligations of, our subsidiaries. 

Subject to the percentage ownership and gross income and asset tests necessary for REIT qualification, we may invest in securities of other REITs, other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers, including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities. 

We may engage in the purchase and sale of investments. 

Our officers and directors may change any of these policies and our investment guidelines without a vote of our stockholders. 

In the event that we determine to raise additional equity capital, our board of directors has the authority, without stockholder approval (subject to certain NYSE requirements), to issue additional common stock or preferred stock in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration it deems appropriate, including in exchange for property. 

Decisions regarding the form and other characteristics of the financing for our investments are made by our Manager subject to the general investment guidelines adopted by our board of directors. 

Conflicts of Interest 

Although we have established certain policies and procedures designed to mitigate conflicts of interest, there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will be effective in doing so. It is possible that actual, potential or perceived conflicts of interest could give rise to investor dissatisfaction, litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. 

One or more of our officers and directors have responsibilities and commitments to entities other than us, including, but not limited to, Newcastle, Nationstar (the servicer for a significant portion of our loans, and the loans underlying our Excess MSRs, servicer advances, and Non-Agency RMBS), and OneMain (the servicer for the consumer loans in which we have invested). For example, we have some of the same directors and officers as Newcastle, Nationstar and OneMain Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as Springleaf Holdings, Inc.) (together with its subsidiaries, including SpringCastle Acquisition LLC, &#8220;OneMain&#8221;). In addition, we do not have a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, officers, securityholders or affiliates from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. Moreover, our certificate of incorporation provides that if Newcastle or Fortress or any of their officers, directors or employees acquire knowledge of a potential transaction that could be a corporate opportunity, they have no duty, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to offer such corporate opportunity to us, our stockholders or our affiliates. In the event that any of our directors and officers who is also a director, officer or employee of Newcastle or Fortress acquires knowledge of a corporate opportunity or is offered a corporate opportunity, provided that this knowledge was not acquired solely in such person&#8217;s capacity as a director or officer of New Residential and such person acts in good faith, then to the fullest extent permitted by law such person is deemed to have fully satisfied such person&#8217;s fiduciary duties owed to us and is not liable to us if Newcastle or Fortress, or their affiliates, pursues or acquires the corporate opportunity or if such person did not present the corporate opportunity to us. However, subject to the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our code of business conduct and ethics prohibits the directors, officers and employees of our Manager from engaging in any transaction that involves an actual conflict of interest with us. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Manager&#8212;There are conflicts of interest in our relationship with our Manager.&#8221; 

Our key agreements, including our Management Agreement, were negotiated among related parties, and their respective terms, including fees and other amounts payable, may not be as favorable to us as terms negotiated with unaffiliated parties. Our independent directors may not vigorously enforce the provisions of our Management Agreement against our Manager. For example, our independent directors may refrain from terminating our Manager because doing so could result in the loss of key personnel. The structure of the Manager&#8217;s compensation arrangement may have unintended consequences for us. We have agreed to pay our Manager a management fee that is not tied to our performance and incentive compensation that is based entirely on our performance. The management fee may not sufficiently incentivize our Manager to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for us, while the performance-based incentive compensation component may cause our Manager to place undue emphasis on the maximization of earnings, including through the use of leverage, at the expense of other objectives, such as preservation of capital, to achieve higher incentive distributions. Investments with higher yield potential are generally riskier or more speculative than investments with lower yield potential. This could result in increased risk to the value of our portfolio of assets and a stockholder&#8217;s investment in us. 

We may compete with entities affiliated with our Manager or Fortress, including Newcastle, for certain target assets. From time to time, affiliates of Fortress may focus on investments in assets with a similar profile as our target assets that we may seek to acquire. These affiliates may have meaningful purchasing capacity, which may change over time depending upon a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, available equity capital and debt financing, market conditions and cash on hand. As of December 31, 2015 , Fortress had two funds primarily focused on investing in Excess MSRs with approximately $0.7 billion &#32;in capital commitments in aggregate. We have co-invested with these funds in Excess MSRs and may do so with similar Fortress funds in the future. Fortress funds generally have a fee structure similar to ours, but the fees actually paid will vary depending on the size, terms and performance of each fund. 

Our Manager may determine, in its discretion, to make a particular investment through an investment vehicle other than us. Investment allocation decisions will reflect a variety of factors, such as a particular vehicle&#8217;s availability of capital (including financing), investment objectives and concentration limits, legal, regulatory, tax and other similar considerations, the source of the investment opportunity and other factors that the Manager, in its discretion, deems appropriate. Our Manager does not have an obligation to offer us the opportunity to participate in any particular investment, even if it meets our investment objectives. 

Operational and Regulatory Structure 

REIT Qualification 

We have elected and intend to qualify to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our qualification as a REIT will depend upon our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various complex requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the &#8220;Internal Revenue Code&#8221;), relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels to our stockholders and the concentration of ownership of our capital stock. We believe that, commencing with our initial taxable year ended December 31, 2013, we have been organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, and that our manner of operation will enable us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. 

1940 Act Exclusion 

We intend to continue to conduct our operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act. Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the 1940 Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer&#8217;s total assets (exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis (the &#8220;40% test&#8221;). Excluded from the term &#8220;investment securities,&#8221; among other things, are U.S. Government securities and securities issued by majority owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exclusion from the definition of investment company for private funds set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act. 

We are organized as a holding company that conducts its businesses primarily through wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries. We intend to continue to conduct our operations so that we do not come within the definition of an investment company because less than 40% of the value of our adjusted total assets on an unconsolidated basis will consist of &#8220;investment securities&#8221; in compliance with the 40% test under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the 1940 Act. The value of securities issued by any wholly owned or majority owned subsidiaries that we may form in the future that are excluded from the definition of &#8220;investment company&#8221; based on Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, together with any other investment securities we may own, may not exceed the 40% test under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the 1940 Act. For purposes of the foregoing, we currently treat our interests in our SLS-serviced servicer advances and our subsidiaries that hold consumer loans as investment securities because these subsidiaries presently rely on the exclusion provided by Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act. We will monitor our holdings to ensure continuing and ongoing compliance with the 40% test under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the 1940 Act. In addition, we believe we will not be considered an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act because we will not engage primarily or hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Rather, through our wholly owned subsidiaries, we will be primarily engaged in the non-investment company businesses of these subsidiaries. 

If the value of securities issued by our subsidiaries that are excluded from the definition of &#8220;investment company&#8221; by Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, together with any other investment securities we own, exceeds the 40% test under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the 1940 Act (e.g., the value of our interests in the taxable REIT subsidiaries that hold servicer advances increases significantly in proportion to the value of our other assets), or if one or more of such subsidiaries fail to maintain an exclusion or exception from the 1940 Act, we could, among other things, be required either (a) to substantially change the manner in which we conduct our operations to avoid being required to register as an investment company or (b) to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act, either of which could have an adverse effect on us and the market price of our securities. As discussed above, for purposes of the foregoing, we currently treat our SLS-serviced servicer advances and our subsidiaries that hold consumer loans as investment securities because these subsidiaries presently rely on the exclusion provided by Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act. If we were required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act, we could, among other things, be required either to (a) change the manner in which we conduct our operations to avoid being required to register as an investment company, (b) effect sales of our assets in a manner that, or at a time when, we would not otherwise choose to do so, or (c) register as an investment company, any of which could negatively affect the value of our common stock, the sustainability of our business model, and our ability to make distributions. 

For purposes of the foregoing, we treat our interests in certain of our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries, which constitutes more than 60% of the value of our adjusted total assets on an unconsolidated basis, as non-investment securities because such subsidiaries qualify for exclusion from the definition of an investment company under the 1940 Act pursuant to Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act (the &#8220;Section 3(c)(5)(C) exclusion&#8221;). The Section 3(c)(5)(C) exclusion is available for entities &#8220;primarily engaged&#8221; in the business of &#8220;purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate.&#8221; The Section 3(c)(5)(C) exclusion generally requires that at least 55% of these subsidiaries&#8217; assets comprise qualifying real estate assets and at least 80% of each of their portfolios must comprise qualifying real estate assets and real estate-related assets under the 1940 Act. Maintenance of our exclusion under the 1940 Act generally limits the amount of our Section 3(c)(5)(C) subsidiaries&#8217; investments in non-real estate assets to no more than 20% of our total assets. 

In satisfying the 55% requirement under the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exclusion, based on guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) and its staff, we treat Agency RMBS issued with respect to an underlying pool of mortgage loans in which we hold all of the certificates issued by the pool as qualifying real estate assets. The SEC and its staff have not published guidance with respect to the treatment of whole pool Non-Agency RMBS for purposes of the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exclusion. Accordingly, based on our own judgment and analysis of the guidance from the SEC and its staff identifying Agency whole pool certificates as qualifying real estate assets under Section 3(c)(5)(C), we treat whole pool Non-Agency RMBS issued with respect to an underlying pool of mortgage loans in which our subsidiary relying on Section 3(c)(5)(C) holds all of the certificates issued by the pool as qualifying real estate assets. We also treat whole mortgage loans that each of our subsidiaries relying on Section 3(c)(5)(C) may 

acquire directly as qualifying real estate assets provided that 100% of the loan is secured by real estate when such subsidiary acquires the loan and the subsidiary has the unilateral right to foreclose on the mortgage. 

Based on our own judgment and analysis of the guidance from the SEC and its staff with respect to analogous assets, we treat Excess MSRs as real estate-related assets for purposes of satisfying the 80% test under the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exclusion. We treat investments in Agency partial pool RMBS and Non-Agency partial pool RMBS as real estate-related assets for purposes of satisfying the 80% test under the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exclusion. 

We expect each of our subsidiaries relying on Section 3(c)(5)(C) to rely on guidance published by the SEC staff or on our analyses of guidance published with respect to other types of assets to determine which assets are qualifying real estate assets and real estate-related assets. The SEC may in the future take a view different than or contrary to our analysis with respect to the types of assets we have determined to be qualifying real estate assets or real estate-related assets. To the extent that the SEC staff publishes new or different guidance with respect to these matters, or disagrees with our analysis, we may be required to adjust our strategy accordingly. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make certain investments and these limitations could result in the subsidiary holding assets we might wish to sell or selling assets we might wish to hold. 

In August 2011, the SEC issued a concept release soliciting public comments on a wide range of issues relating to companies, which are typically REITs, engaged in the business of acquiring mortgages and mortgage-related instruments and that rely on Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act, including the nature of the assets that qualify for purposes of the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exclusion and whether such REITs should be regulated in a manner similar to investment companies. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the laws and regulations governing the 1940 Act status of REITs, or guidance from the SEC or its staff regarding the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exclusion, will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations. If we or our subsidiaries fail to maintain an exclusion or exception from the 1940 Act, we could, among other things, be required either to (a) change the manner in which we conduct our operations to avoid being required to register as an investment company, (b) effect sales of our assets in a manner that, or at a time when, we would not otherwise choose to do so, or (c) register as an investment company, any of which could negatively affect the value of our common stock, the sustainability of our business model, and our ability to make distributions. 

Although we monitor our portfolio periodically and prior to each investment origination or acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exclusion from the definition of an investment company under the 1940 Act for these subsidiaries. 

To the extent that the SEC staff provides more specific guidance regarding any of the matters bearing upon the exclusions or exceptions we and our subsidiaries rely on from the 1940 Act, we may be required to adjust our strategy accordingly. Any additional guidance from the SEC staff could provide additional flexibility to us, or it could further inhibit our ability to pursue the strategies we have chosen. 

Qualification for an exclusion from registration under the 1940 Act will limit our ability to make certain investments. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business&#8212;Maintenance of our 1940 Act exclusion imposes limits on our operations.&#8221; 

Competition 

Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to acquire target assets on terms consistent with our business and economic model. In acquiring these assets, we expect to compete with banks, REITs, independent mortgage loan servicers, private equity firms, hedge funds and other large financial services companies. Many of our anticipated competitors are significantly larger than we are, have access to greater capital and other resources and may have other advantages over us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could lead them to offer higher prices for assets that we might be interested in acquiring and cause us to lose bids for those assets. In addition, other potential purchasers of our target assets may be more attractive to sellers of such assets if the sellers believe that these potential purchasers could obtain any necessary third party approvals and consents more easily than us. 

In the face of this competition, we expect to take advantage of the experience of members of our management team and their industry expertise which may provide us with a competitive advantage and help us assess potential risks and determine appropriate pricing for certain potential acquisitions of our target assets. In addition, we expect that these relationships will enable us to compete more effectively for attractive acquisition opportunities. However, we may not be able to achieve our business goals or expectations due to the competitive risks that we face.
