Overview 

&#160; 

Inspired by the photosynthetic process that plants use to harness the power of the sun to create energy molecules, we are developing a novel solar-powered particle system that mimics photosynthesis to separate hydrogen from water. On November 15, 2011, we filed a patent application to protect the intellectual property rights to the production of renewable hydrogen and natural gas using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. 

&#160; 

Hydrogen is the lightest and abundant chemical element, constituting roughly 75% of the universe's chemical elemental mass (Palmer, D. (13 September 1997). &#34; Hydrogen in the Universe&#34; NASA ). However, naturally occurring elemental hydrogen is relatively rare on earth and hydrogen gas is most often produced using fossil fuels. Industrial production is mainly from the steam reforming of natural gas and is usually employed near its production site, with the two largest uses being crude oil processing (hydrocracking) and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market. We are developing what we believe is a cleaner and greener way to produce this high value product. 

&#160; 

Our research is centered on developing a low-cost and submersible hydrogen production particle that can split water molecules under the sun, emulating the core functions of photosynthesis. Each particle is a complete hydrogen generator that contains a novel high voltage solar cell bonded to chemical catalysts by a proprietary encapsulation coating. On September 15, 2015, we announced that we had surpassed the critical voltage (1.5 Volts) threshold to split water molecules for renewable hydrogen fuel production. We believe this is an extremely important step towards commercialization, as 1.5 V is the minimum voltage needed to produce hydrogen in real world systems. 

&#160; 

Market Opportunity 

&#160; 

Hydrogen production has seen steady growth since 2010 with the global 2016 market value estimated to be USD 117.94 Billion growing to 152.09 Billion by 2021. (Markets and Markets Research; Hydrogen Generation Market). Major factors such as cleaner fuel as compared to fossil fuels, government regulations for desulfurization of petroleum products and decreasing crude oil quality are driving the market worldwide. 

&#160; 

We believe fuel cell technology will be the major growth driver of hydrogen in the future as many major automobile manufacturers such as Honda, Hyundai, BMW and Toyota bring hydrogen-powered cars to market. On May 20, 2014 the first Hyundai fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) rolled onto U.S. soil marking the first delivery of mass-produced fuel cell hydrogen vehicles in the U.S. market. (Source: http://www.hyundainews.com/us/en-us/Media/PressRelease.aspx?mediaid=40852&#38;title=hyundais-first-mass-produced-tucson-fuel-cell-cuvs-arrive-in-southern-california) In October 2015, the first hydrogen powered Toyota Mirais were delivered to customers in California and the Mirai is now for sale in the UK, Denmark, Belgium, Norway and Germany. 

&#160; 

Large Fortune 500 companies have adapted hydrogen fuel cell technologies to serve their warehouse transportation needs, such as forklifts as well as backup power generation with fuel cells supplied by Plug Power ( www.plugpower.com ) and Fuel Cell Energy ( www.fuelcellenergy.com ) . 

&#160; 

A key aspect of our technology is that it has the potential to produce completely renewable hydrogen fuel, known as green hydrogen. Most hydrogen fuel currently on the market is produced from natural gas, known as brown hydrogen. The other key aspect is that the method of production for our technology can produce hydrogen onsite or at the point of distribution rather than requiring large, expensive hydrogen production infrastructure and high cost transportation. According to a US Department of Energy study in 2013, transportation added an additional $1.25 per kilogram ( https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/hpep_report_2013.pdf) .

Our Technology 

&#160; 

Technology for Making Renewable Hydrogen from Sunlight 

&#160; 

Hydrogen (H2) is the third most abundant element on earth and cleanest fuel in the universe ( Dresselhaus, Mildred et al. (May 15, 2003) &#34;Basic Research Needs for the Hydrogen Economy&#8221; ). Unlike hydrocarbon fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas, where carbon dioxide and other contaminants are released into the atmosphere when used, hydrogen fuel usage produces only pure water (H2O) as the byproduct. Unfortunately, pure hydrogen does not exist naturally on earth and therefore must be manufactured. Historically, the cost of manufacturing hydrogen as an alternative fuel has been higher than the cost of the energy used to make it. This is the dilemma of the hydrogen economy, and one that we aim to address. 

&#160; 

For over a century, splitting water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen using electrolysis has been well known. This technology can be used to produce an unlimited amount of clean and renewable hydrogen fuel to power a carbon-free world. However, in practice, current commercial electrolysis technologies require (a) expensive electricity and (b) highly purified water to prevent fouling of system components. We believe these are the major barriers to affordable production of renewable hydrogen. 

&#160; 

The Perfect and Sustainable Energy Cycle 

&#160; 

As it turns out, Mother Nature has been making hydrogen using sunlight since the beginning of time by splitting water molecules (H2O) into its basic elements - hydrogen and oxygen. This is exactly what plant leaves do every day using photosynthesis. Since the produced hydrogen is immediately consumed inside the plant, we cannot simply grow trees to make hydrogen. 

&#160; 

If technology can be developed to mimic photosynthesis to split water into hydrogen, then a truly sustainable, low cost, and renewable energy cycle can be created to power the earth. However, cost has been the biggest barrier to realizing this vision. 

&#160; 

Water Splitting 

&#160; 

In the process of splitting a water molecule, input energy is transferred into the chemical bonds of the resulting hydrogen molecule. So, in essence, manufactured hydrogen is simply a carrier or battery-like storage of the input energy. If the input energy is from fossil fuels, such as oil and gas, then dirty carbon fossil fuel energy is simply transferred into hydrogen. If the input energy is renewable such as solar and wind, then new and clean energy is stored in hydrogen. 

&#160; 

While the concept of water splitting is very appealing, the following challenges must be addressed for renewable hydrogen to be commercially viable: 

&#160; 

&#9679; Energy Inefficiency &#8212; Since hydrogen is an energy carrier, the most energy it can store is 100% of the input energy. However, conventional systems approach to electrolysis lose so much of the input energy in system components, wires and electrodes resulting in only a small portion of electricity making it into the hydrogen molecules. This translates to high production cost and is the fundamental problem with water splitting for hydrogen production. We intend to address this problem with our low cost and energy efficient particle technology. &#160; 

&#9679; Need for Clean Water &#8212; Conventional electrolysis requires highly purified clean water to prevent fouling of system components. This prevents current technology from using large quantities of available water from oceans, rivers, industrial waste and municipal waste as feedstock. Our technology is being designed to use any natural water or waste water for the unlimited production of renewable hydrogen. &#160; 

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Technology 

&#160; 

Electrolysis water-splitting in its simplest form is the transfer of &#34;input electrons&#34; in the following chemical reactions: 

&#160; 

&#9679; Cathode (reduction): 2 H 2 O + 2e- -&#62; H 2 + 2 OH- &#160; &#160; &#9679; Anode (oxidation): 4 OH- -&#62; O 2 + 2 H 2 O + 4 e- &#160; 

From these equations it can be deduced that if every input electron (e-) is put to work and not lost, then a maximum amount of input electrons (i.e. energy) is transferred and stored in the hydrogen molecules (H2). Additionally, if there were a very high number of cathode and anode reaction areas within a given volume of water, then a very high number of these reactions could happen simultaneously throughout the medium to split each water molecule into hydrogen wherever electrons are available. 

&#160; 

To address this fundamental electron transfer efficiency problem, we are developing a novel self-contained particle to maximally ensure that every single electron is put to work in splitting a water molecule. Our self-contained particle has two very important features: 

&#160; 

&#9679; Self-Contained Photoelectrochemical System &#8212; Our low cost, self-contained particle is designed to mimic photosynthesis and contains a solar absorber that generates electrons from sunlight, as well as integrated cathode and anode areas to readily split water and transfer those electrons to the molecular bonds of hydrogen. Unlike solar panels or wind turbines that produce lots of electrons that will be lost before reaching the hydrogen bonds, our particles are optimized to ensure maximal electron generation and utilization efficiency. Consequently, our particles use much less photovoltaic elements, an expensive material, than conventional solar panels to achieve the same system level efficiency thereby significantly lowering the system cost of what is essentially an electrolysis process. &#160; 

&#9679; Protective Coating &#8212; The biggest problem with submerging photovoltaic elements in water for direct electrolysis is corrosion and short circuiting. To address this problem, we are developing a protective coating that encapsulates key elements of the particle to allow it to function for a long period of time in a wide range of water conditions without corrosion. This allows the particles to be submerged or dissolved into any water such as sea water, runoff water, river water or waste water, instead of purified distilled water. &#160; 

HyperSolar H2Generator&#8482; 

&#160; 

Since our particles are intended to mimic the natural room temperature conditions of photosynthesis, they can be housed in very low cost reactors such as glass vessels or clear plastic bags. To facilitate the commercial use of our self-contained particle technology we are developing a modular system that will enable the daily production and storage of hydrogen for any time use in electricity generation, oil and gas refining, fertilizer manufacturing or any other current and future applications of hydrogen. 

&#160; 

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We refer to our technology as the HyperSolar H2Generator which is comprised of the following primary stages: 

&#160; 

&#9679; Reactor Vessels &#8212; These reactors resemble transparent rectangular boxes containing water and tens of thousands of self-contained particles suspended in solution. When exposed to sunlight, hydrogen gas will bubble up into an air gap on top for separation and collection. &#160; &#160; &#9679; Hydrogen Compressor &#8212; Produced hydrogen gas will be compressed for space efficient storage. &#160; 

&#9679; Hydrogen Storage &#8212; Hydrogen can be stored in compressed gas tanks or chemical canisters depending on the application. &#160; 

We anticipate that the HyperSolar H2Generator will be a self-contained renewable hydrogen production system that requires only sunlight and any source of water. As a result, it can be installed almost anywhere to produce hydrogen fuel at or near the point of distribution, for local use. This model of hydrogen production addresses one of the biggest challenges of using clean hydrogen fuel on a large scale, which is the transportation of hydrogen. 

&#160; 

Each stage of the HyperSolar H2Generator can be scaled independently according to the hydrogen demands and length of storage required for a specific application. A small-scale system can be used to produce continuous renewable electricity for a small house, or a large scale system can be used to produce hydrogen to power a community. In the last eight months we have shown how energy from sunlight can be converted to high voltages that can be contained in a simple and inexpensive structure and how we can use the voltages to split inexpensive feedstocks like water and organic waste to produce hydrogen. Specifically, we demonstrated a novel multi-junction semiconducting device architecture, synthesized entirely by inexpensive wet chemical techniques, that can produce photovoltages exceeding 1.5 V. We also demonstrated stable activity for solar photosynthesis using these structures to make chemicals and fuels. 

&#160; 

To compete with other fossil fuel driven hydrogen production techniques such as steam reforming, renewable hydrogen production systems need to be be cheap and highly efficient. It is estimated based largely on theoretical calculations that an autonomous solar H 2 production system should be able to generate photovoltages exceeding 1.5 V, produce photocurrents reaching 10 mA/cm2 (~10% efficient) and the overall system cost should be ~$50/m2. Although our H2Generator achieved photovoltages greater than 1.5V and our system production cost is considerably lower than $50/m2, our focus is on improving photocurrents for our self-contained particles to boost efficiency and production volume in order to be commercially viable. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

On November 15, 2011, we filed a provisional patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect the intellectual property rights for &#8221;Photoelectrochemically Active Heterostructures, Methods For Their Manufacture, And Methods And Systems For Producing Desired Products.&#8221; Disclosed in that patent application are methods for producing desired chemical products, including hydrocarbons such as methane and other alkanes, synthesis gas (carbon monoxide and hydrogen), and methanol, from carbon dioxide and oxidizable reactant compounds in wastewater as a feedstock using solar energy to drive at least a portion of the chemical reaction process ( e.g. , to produce hydrogen gas). Photoelectrochemical processes employ photoelectrochemically active heterostructures (PAHs) to absorb sunlight and transform the light energy into electrochemical potential energy, which converts reactants containing hydrogen atoms into products, which react with carbon dioxide to form desired chemical products. On November 14, 2012, we filed the utility patent application for the above and the examination and prosecution of this patent are ongoing. 

&#160; 

In September of 2012, we jointly filed with the University of California, Santa Barbara (&#34;UCSB&#34;) an additional patent application to protect the intellectual property rights of our proprietary coating for protecting our semiconductor devices from corrosion in various types of water. This patent is titled: &#8220;Process And Systems For Stable Operation of Electroactive Devices&#8221;. The invention is directed towards processes and systems for stable operation of electrical, electrochemical, photoelectrochemical and photosynthetic devices with increased efficiency, stability, and low cost. In particular, what is disclosed are new functional coating materials and applications of those coatings that are optically transparent, electronically conducting, electrocatalytically active, thermally stable, and which can be applied conformally and easily on an electroactive unit for stable and efficient operation. We believe this patent will be valuable beyond our specific utilization in developing hydrogen from water using the power of the sun. In February of 2013 we filed the utility patent application for the above and the examination and prosecution of this patent are ongoing.

&#160;

&#160; 

In March of 2015, we jointly filed a full utility patent application with UCSB for the &#34;method of manufacture of multi-junction artificial photosynthetic cells.&#34; The patent&#8217;s full coverage excludes others from making, using, or selling the technology process, and creates licensing opportunities. We believe licensing opportunities can be created through various industry applications, such as for car charging stations, retail distribution centers, and facilities that would benefit from cost-efficient hydrogen developed at or near the point of distribution. Examination and prosecution of this patent are ongoing. 

&#160; 

Strategic Partners 

&#160; 

Effective May 1, 2016, we entered into a one-year extension of our agreement with the University of Iowa to help accelerate our research and development efforts to reach our goal of producing commercially viable renewable hydrogen. As consideration under the sponsorship research agreement (&#8220;SRA&#8221;), the University of Iowa will receive $78,944 from the Company. When expenditures reach that amount, we will no longer be obligated to fund any additional research activities, and the University of Iowa will not be obligated to perform any additional research activities pursuant to the SRA, unless mutually agreed upon. 

&#160; 

In April of 2016, we extended our sponsorship research agreement (&#8220;SRA&#8221;) with the University of California, Santa Barbara (&#8220;UCSB&#8221;) through June 30, 2017. This agreement is intended to help achieve important milestones in the Company&#8217;s development plan. 

&#160; 

Due to credit on our account and other funds available, the UCSB extension is at no cost to the Company. U.S. Patent Law and university policy will govern any patentable developments or discoveries throughout the course of the SRA. If such an invention is determined to be jointly owned by us and UCSB, we will prepare and file, at our cost, patent applications for such invention and claim it as a joint invention in the name of both the Company and UCSB, and shall prosecute and maintain such joint patent rights. Neither party may assign its joint ownership in such patents without the consent of the other party. We have a time-limited first right to negotiate a license to UCSB&#8217;s interest in any joint invention. 

&#160; 

We believe the partnership with UCSB will enable us to refine our solar-powered particle technology for generating zero carbon hydrogen and renewable natural gas using sunlight, water and carbon dioxide (CO2). The research project is led by Professor Eric McFarland in the Department of Chemical Engineering at UCSB. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Currently, most hydrogen is produced by steam reforming of natural gas or methane. This production technology dominates due to easy availability and low prices of natural gas. Partial oxidation of petroleum oil is second in production capacity after steam reforming of natural gas. The third largest production technology in terms of production capacity is steam gasification of coal. The current industry is heavily dominated by large players such as Air Products and Chemicals Inc. and Air Liquide. 

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The energy source and feedstock used in these existing production technologies are fossil fuels. Therefore, the hydrogen produced is not considered renewable. We are developing a new low cost technology to use sunlight as the energy source to split water into hydrogen in a truly renewable fashion. To our knowledge, there are no commercially available technologies for producing large quantities of renewable hydrogen that are cost competitive with fossil fuel based hydrogen. Niche market electrolysis systems that split water for hydrogen production have existed for a long time but their capital and operating costs are much higher than conventional hydrogen. Various academic and research institutions around the world are attempting to develop renewable hydrogen production technologies as well. To our knowledge, none have reached commercial success. 

&#160; 

If we are able to complete the commercial development of our technology, we do not intend to manufacture hydrogen and compete with companies such as Air Liquide. We intend to license our technology to companies like Air Products and Air Liquide for the production of renewable hydrogen used in applications such as hydrogen vehicle fueling stations and hydrogen power plants.
