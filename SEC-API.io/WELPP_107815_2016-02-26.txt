Represents distribution sales for customers who have purchased power from an alternative electric supplier in Michigan. 

Electric Sales 

Our electric energy deliveries included supply and distribution sales to retail and wholesale customers and distribution sales to those customers who switched to an alternative electric supplier. In 2015, retail electric revenues accounted for 87.6% &#32;of total electric operating revenues, while wholesale (including resale) electric revenues accounted for 9.7% &#32;of total electric operating revenues. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Electric Utility Segment Contribution to Operating Income for information on MWh sales by customer class. 

We are authorized to provide retail electric service in designated territories in the state of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits and boundary agreements with other utilities, and in certain territories in the state of Michigan pursuant to franchises granted by municipalities. 

We buy and sell wholesale electric power by participating in the MISO Energy Markets. The cost of our generation offered into the MISO Energy Markets, compared to our competitors, affects how often our generating units are dispatched and how we buy and sell power. For more information, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211;Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources &#8211; Industry Restructuring. 

Large Electric Retail Customers 

We provide electric utility service to a diversified base of customers in such industries as mining, paper, foundry, food products and machinery production, health services, governmental, and large retail chains. In February 2015, our largest retail electric customer, the owner of two iron ore mines located in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, returned as a customer after choosing an alternative electric supplier in September 2013. We entered into a special contract with each of the mines to provide full requirements electric service through December 31, 2019. In 2015, we deferred, and we expect to continue to defer, the margin from those sales and will apply these amounts for the benefit of Wisconsin retail electric customers in a future rate proceeding. For more information, see Note 20, Michigan Settlement , and Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources &#8211; Industry Restructuring. 

2015 Form 10-K 

Wisconsin Electric Power Company 

Wholesale Customers 

We provide wholesale electric service to various customers, including electric cooperatives, municipal joint action agencies, other investor-owned utilities, municipal utilities, and energy marketers. Wholesale sales accounted for 3.4% , 5.3%, and 5.9% of total electric energy sales during 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Wholesale revenues accounted for 3.0% , 3.9%, and 4.3% of total electric operating revenues during 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. 

Resale 

The majority of our sales for resale are sold to one RTO, MISO, at market rates based on availability of our generation and RTO demand. Resale sales accounted for 23.8% , 18.5%, and 13.3% of total electric energy sales during 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Resale revenues accounted for 6.7% , 7.8%, and 4.3% of total electric operating revenues during 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. 

Electric Sales Growth 

Our service territory experienced slightly declining weather-normalized retail electric sales in 2015 as positive customer growth was more than offset by reduced volumes related to lower use per customer. We currently forecast retail electric sales volumes, excluding the two iron ore mines, to grow at a compound annual rate of between flat and 0.5% over the next five years, assuming normal weather. In addition, we forecast associated electric peak demand, excluding the two iron ore mines, to grow at a compound annual rate of between 0.5% to 1.0% over the next five years, also assuming normal weather. The owner of the two iron ore mines has announced its intention to shut down one of the mines in 2017. The potential loss of retail electric sales associated with this mine is estimated at approximately 3% of our annual total retail electric sales. 

Electric Generation and Supply Mix 

Our electric supply strategy is to provide our customers with energy from plants using a diverse fuel mix that is expected to maintain a stable, reliable, and affordable supply of electricity. We supply a significant amount of electricity to our customers from power plants that we own or lease from We Power. We supplement our internally generated power supply with long-term power purchase agreements, including the Point Beach power purchase agreement discussed in Power Purchase Commitments, below and through spot purchases in the MISO Energy Markets. 

Our rated capacity by fuel type, including the units we lease from We Power, as of December 31 is shown below. For more information on our electric generation facilities, see Item 2. Properties.

Coal-Fired Generation 

Our coal-fired generation, including the units we lease from We Power, consists of five &#32;operating plants with a rated capacity of 3,589 MW as of December 31, 2015 . For more information about our operating plants, see Item 2. Properties. 

Natural Gas-Fired Generation 

Our natural gas-fired generation, including the units we lease from We Power, consists of four &#32;operating plants, including peaking units, with a rated capacity of 2,104 MW as of December 31, 2015 . For more information about our operating plants, see Item 2. Properties. 

Oil-Fired Generation 

Fuel oil is used for combustion turbines at certain of our natural gas-fired plants as well as for ignition and flame stabilization at one of our coal-fired plants. Our oil-fired generation had a rated capacity of 180 MW as of December 31, 2015 . We also have natural gas-fired peaking units with a rated capacity of 782 &#32;MW, which have the ability to burn oil if natural gas is not available due to delivery constraints. For more information about our operating plants, see Item 2. Properties. 

Renewable Generation 

Hydroelectric 

Our hydroelectric generating system consists of 13 operating plants with a total installed capacity of 86 MW and a rated capacity of 86 MW as of December 31, 2015 . All of our hydroelectric facilities follow FERC guidelines and/or regulations. 

Wind 

We have four &#32;wind sites, consisting of 200 &#32;turbines, with an installed capacity of 339 MW and a rated capacity of 51 MW as of December 31, 2015. 

2015 Form 10-K 

Wisconsin Electric Power Company 

Biomass 

We constructed a biomass-fueled power plant at a Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site that went into commercial operation in November 2013. Wood waste and wood shavings are used to produce a rated capacity of approximately 50 MW of electric power as well as steam to support the paper mill's operations. Fuel for the power plant is supplied by both the paper mill and through contracts with biomass suppliers. 

Generation from Leased Power The Future Units 

We also supply electricity to our customers from power plants that we lease from We Power. These plants include the Oak Creek Expansion units and the PWGS units, otherwise known as the PTF units. Lease payments are billed from We Power to us and then recovered in our rates as authorized by the PSCW, the MPSC, and the FERC. We operate the PTF units and are authorized by the PSCW and state law to fully recover prudently incurred operating and maintenance costs in our Wisconsin electric rates. As the operator of the units, we may request We Power to make capital improvements to, or further investments in, the units. Under the lease terms, these capital improvements or further investments will increase lease payments paid by us and should ultimately be recovered in our rates. 

Electric System Reliability 

The PSCW requires us to maintain a planning reserve margin above our projected annual peak demand forecast to help ensure reliability of electric service to our customers. These planning reserve requirements are consistent with the MISO calculated planning reserve margin. The PSCW has a 14.5% reserve margin requirement for long-term planning (planning years two through ten). For short-term planning (planning year one), the PSCW requires Wisconsin utilities to follow the planning reserve margin established by MISO. MISO has a 14.3% reserve margin requirement from January 1, 2016, through May 31, 2016, and 15.2% for the remainder of 2016. The MPSC does not have minimum guidelines for future supply reserves. 

We had adequate capacity through company-owned generation units, leased generating units, and power purchase contracts to meet the MISO calculated planning reserve margin during 2015 &#32;and expect to have adequate capacity to meet the planning reserve margin requirements during 2016 . &#32; However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability across the 15-state MISO market footprint could require us to call upon load management procedures. Load management procedures allow for the reduction of energy use through agreements with customers to directly shut off their equipment or through interruptible service, where customers agree to reduce their load in the case of an emergency interruption. 

Fuel and Purchased Power Costs 

Our retail electric rates in Wisconsin are established by the PSCW and include base amounts for fuel and purchased power costs. The electric fuel rules set by the PSCW allow us to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, under or over-collections of actual fuel and purchased power costs that exceed a 2% &#32;price variance from the costs included in the rates charged to customers. For more information about the fuel rule, see Item 1. Business &#8211; C. Regulation. 

Our average fuel and purchased power costs per MWh by fuel type were as follows for the year ended December 31:

We purchase coal under long-term contracts, which helps with price stability. Coal and associated transportation services have continued to see volatility in pricing due to changing domestic and world-wide demand for coal and the impacts of diesel costs, which are incorporated into fuel surcharges on rail transportation. Certain of our coal transportation contracts contain fuel cost adjustments that are tied to changes in diesel fuel and crude oil prices. Currently, diesel fuel contracts are not actively traded. Therefore, we use financial heating oil contracts to mitigate risk related to diesel fuel prices. 

2015 Form 10-K 

Wisconsin Electric Power Company 

We purchase natural gas for our plants on the spot market from natural gas marketers, utilities, and producers, and we arrange for transportation of the natural gas to our plants. We have firm and interruptible transportation, as well as balancing and storage agreements, intended to support our plants' variable usage. 

We have a PSCW-approved hedging program that allows us to hedge up to 75% of our potential risks related to fuel surcharge exposure. We also have a program that allows us to hedge up to 65% of our estimated natural gas use for electric generation in order to help manage our natural gas price risk. This hedging program is generally implemented on a 36-month forward-looking basis. The results of both of these programs are reflected in the average costs of natural gas and purchased power. 

Coal Supply 

We diversify the coal supply for our electric generating facilities by purchasing coal from several mines in Wyoming, as well as from various other states. For 2016 , approximately 86% of our total projected coal requirements of approximately 12 million tons are contracted under fixed-price contracts. See Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information &#32;on amounts of coal purchases and coal deliveries under contract. 

The annual tonnage amounts contracted for 2016 &#32;through 2018 &#32;are as follows:

Coal Deliveries 

All of our 2016 &#32;coal requirements are expected to be shipped by our owned or leased unit trains under existing transportation agreements. The unit trains transport the coal for electric generating facilities from mines in Wyoming, Pennsylvania, and Montana. The coal is transported by train to our rail-served electric-generating facilities and to dock storage in Superior, Wisconsin, until needed by our lake vessel-served facilities. Additional small volume agreements may also be used to supplement the normal coal supply for our facilities. 

Midcontinent Independent System Operator Costs 

In connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed and operates the MISO Energy Markets, which include its bid-based energy markets and ancillary services market. We are a participant in the MISO Energy Markets. In 2013, MISO expanded its footprint to include entities in Mississippi, Arkansas, Texas, and Missouri, a region referred to as MISO South. These changes have not had a material impact on our allocation of transmission costs, and we do not expect them to have a material impact in the future. For more information on MISO, see Item 1. Business &#8211; C. Regulation. 

Power Purchase Commitments 

We enter into short and long-term power purchase commitments to meet a portion of our anticipated electric energy supply needs. As of December 31, 2015 , our power purchase commitments with unaffiliated parties for the next five years is 1,267 &#32;MW per year. This amount includes 1,033 MW per year related to a long-term power purchase agreement for electricity generated by Point Beach. In addition, 234 MW per year relates to a long-term power purchase agreement under which we purchase power at a price determined monthly based on a formula tied to a natural gas price index. 

Other Matters 

Seasonality 

Our electric sales are impacted by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions. We sell more electricity during the summer months because of the residential cooling load. We continue to upgrade our electric distribution system, including substations, transformers, and lines, to meet the demand of our customers. Our generating plants performed as expected during the warmest periods of the summer, and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, we did not require public appeals for conservation, and we did not interrupt or curtail service to non-firm customers who participate in load management programs. 

2015 Form 10-K 

Wisconsin Electric Power Company 

Competition 

We face competition from various entities and other forms of energy sources available to customers, including self-generation by large industrial customers and alternative energy sources. We compete with other utilities for sales to municipalities and cooperatives as well as with other utilities and marketers for wholesale electric business. 

The retail electric utility market in Wisconsin is regulated by the PSCW. Retail electric customers do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier, and it is uncertain when, if ever, retail electric choice might be implemented in Wisconsin. The regulated energy industry continues to experience significant structural changes, which could eventually lead to increased competition in Wisconsin. 

The retail electric utility market in Michigan remains open to competition with its retail choice program, which allows customers to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customer's power supplier. 

Environmental Matters 

For information regarding environmental matters, especially as they relate to coal-fired generating facilities, see Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies , and Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources &#8211; Environmental Matters. 

Electric Transmission and Energy Markets 

American Transmission Company 

ATC is a regional transmission company that owns, maintains, monitors, and operates electric transmission systems in Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, and Minnesota. ATC is expected to provide comparable service to all customers, including us, and to support effective competition in energy markets without favoring any market participant. ATC is regulated by the FERC for all rate terms and conditions of service and is a transmission-owning member of MISO. MISO maintains operational control of ATC's transmission system, and we are a non-transmission owning member and customer of MISO. As of December 31, 2015 , our ownership interest in ATC was approximately 23%. See Note 4, Investment in American Transmission Company, for more information &#32; 

In April 2011, ATC and Duke Energy announced the creation of a joint venture, DATC, that will seek opportunities to acquire, build, own, and operate new electric transmission infrastructure in North America to address increasing demand for affordable, reliable transmission capacity. In April 2013, DATC acquired a 72% interest in California's Path 15 transmission line. DATC continues to evaluate new projects and opportunities, along with participating in the competitive bidding process on projects it considers viable. These projects are located in the service territories of several different RTOs around the country. On January 20, 2016, the FERC issued an order authorizing ATC to enter into a proposed restructuring involving the creation of three new entities: ATC Holdco, ATC Development, and ATC Development Manager Inc. ATC&#8217;s current member owners will have the option to retain their existing ownership interests limited to ATC in Wisconsin and adjacent states or to exchange their current ATC ownership interests for ownership interests in ATC Holdco, which would allow them to participate in ATC's transmission business in Wisconsin and adjacent states, as well as new transmission development projects throughout the U.S. 

ATC is currently named in a complaint filed with the FERC requesting a reduction in the base ROE used by MISO transmission owners. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources &#8211; Other Matters, for more information.

Natural Gas Deliveries 

Our gas therm deliveries include customer-owned transported natural gas. Transported natural gas accounted for approximately 39.0% &#32;of the total volumes delivered during 2015 , 34.9% &#32;during 2014 , and 35.4% &#32;during 2013 . Our peak daily send-out during 2015 &#32;was 7.3 million therms on January 7, 2015 . 

Large Natural Gas Customers 

We provide natural gas utility service to a diversified base of industrial customers who are largely within our electric service territory. Major industries served include governmental, educational, food products, real estate, and metal. 

Natural Gas Supply, Pipeline Capacity and Storage 

We have been able to meet our contractual obligations with both our suppliers and our customers. For more information on our natural gas utility supply and transportation contracts, see Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies. 

Pipeline Capacity and Storage 

The interstate pipelines serving Wisconsin originate in major natural gas producing areas of North America: the Oklahoma and Texas basins, western Canada and the Rocky Mountains. We have contracted for long-term firm capacity from a number of these sources. This strategy reflects management's belief that overall supply security is enhanced by geographic diversification of the supply portfolio. 

Due to the daily and seasonal variations in natural gas usage in Wisconsin, we have also contracted for substantial underground storage capacity, primarily in Michigan. We target storage inventory levels at approximately 35% of forecasted winter demand; November through March is considered the winter season. Storage capacity, along with our natural gas purchase contracts, enables us to manage significant changes in daily demand and to optimize our overall natural gas supply and capacity costs. We generally inject natural gas into storage during the spring and summer months when demand is lower and withdraw it in the winter months. As a result, we can contract for less long-line pipeline capacity during periods of peak usage than would otherwise be necessary and can purchase natural gas on a more uniform daily basis from suppliers year-round. Each of these capabilities enables us to reduce our overall costs. 

We hold daily transportation and storage capacity entitlements with interstate pipeline companies as well as other service providers under varied-length long-term contracts. 

2015 Form 10-K 

Wisconsin Electric Power Company 

Term Natural Gas Supply 

We have contracts for firm supplies with terms of 3&#8211;7 months with suppliers for natural gas acquired in the Chicago, Illinois market hub and in the producing areas discussed above. The pricing of the term contracts is based upon first of the month indices. 

Combined with our storage capability, management believes that the volume of natural gas under contract is sufficient to meet our forecasted firm peak-day and seasonal demand. Our forecasted design peak-day throughput is 9.5 million therms for the 2015 through 2016 heating season. 

Secondary Market Transactions 

Pipeline long-line and storage capacity and natural gas supplies under contract can be resold in secondary markets. Local distribution companies, like our natural gas operations, must contract for capacity and supply sufficient to meet the firm peak-day demand of their customers. Peak or near peak demand days generally occur only a few times each year. The secondary markets facilitate higher utilization of contracted capacity and supply during those times when the full contracted capacity and supply are not needed by the utility, helping to mitigate the fixed costs associated with maintaining peak levels of capacity and natural gas supply. Through pre-arranged agreements and day-to-day electronic bulletin board postings, interested parties can purchase this excess capacity and supply. The proceeds from these transactions are passed through to rate payers, subject to our approved GCRM. During 2015 , we continued to participate in the secondary markets. For information on our GCRM, see Note 1(d), Revenues and Customer Receivables. 

Spot Market Natural Gas Supply 

We expect to continue to make natural gas purchases in the spot market as price and other circumstances dictate. We have supply relationships with a number of sellers from whom we purchase natural gas in the spot market. 

Hedging Natural Gas Supply Prices 

We have PSCW approval to hedge up to 60% of planned winter demand and up to 15% of planned summer demand using a mix of NYMEX based natural gas options and futures contracts. This approval allows us to pass 100% of the hedging costs (premiums and brokerage fees) and proceeds (gains and losses) to rate payers through our GCRM. Hedge targets (volumes) are provided annually to the PSCW as part of our three-year natural gas supply plan and risk management filing. 

To the extent that opportunities develop and physical supply operating plans are supportive, we also have PSCW approval to utilize NYMEX-based natural gas derivatives to capture favorable forward market price differentials. That approval provides for 100% of the related proceeds to accrue to our GCRM. 

Seasonality 

Since the majority of our customers use natural gas for heating, customer use is sensitive to weather and is generally higher during the winter months. Accordingly, we are subject to variations in earnings and working capital throughout the year as a result of changes in weather. 

Our working capital needs are met by cash generated from operations and debt (both long-term and short-term). The seasonality of natural gas revenues causes the timing of cash collections to be concentrated from January through June. A portion of the winter natural gas supply needs is typically purchased and stored from April through October. Also, planned capital spending on our natural gas distribution facilities is concentrated in April through October. Because of these timing differences, the cash flow from customers is typically supplemented with temporary increases in short-term borrowings (from external sources) during the late summer and fall. Short-term debt is typically reduced over the January through June period. 

Competition 

Competition in varying degrees exists between natural gas and other forms of energy available to consumers. A number of our large commercial and industrial customers are dual-fuel customers that are equipped to switch between natural gas and alternate fuels. We are allowed to offer lower-priced natural gas sales and transportation services to dual-fuel customers. Under natural gas 

2015 Form 10-K 

Wisconsin Electric Power Company 

transportation agreements, customers purchase natural gas directly from natural gas marketers and arrange with interstate pipelines and us to have the natural gas transported to their facilities. We earn substantially the same margin (difference between revenue and cost of natural gas) whether we sell and transport natural gas to customers or only transport their natural gas. 

Our ability to maintain our share of the industrial dual-fuel market depends on our success and the success of third-party natural gas marketers in obtaining long-term and short-term supplies of natural gas at competitive prices compared to other sources and in arranging or facilitating competitively priced transportation service for those customers that desire to buy their own natural gas supplies. 

Federal and state regulators continue to implement policies to bring more competition to the natural gas industry. While the natural gas utility distribution function is expected to remain a highly regulated, monopoly function, the sale of the natural gas commodity and related services are expected to remain subject to competition from third parties for large commercial and industrial customers. It remains uncertain if and when the current economic disincentives for small firm customers to choose an alternative natural gas commodity supplier may be removed such that we begin to face competition for the sale of natural gas to those customers. 

STEAM UTILITY SEGMENT 

We have a steam utility that generates, distributes, and sells steam supplied by VAPP and MCPP to customers in metropolitan Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Steam is used by customers for processing, space heating, domestic hot water, and humidification. We operate a district steam system in downtown Milwaukee and the near south side of Milwaukee, and steam is supplied to this system from VAPP. We also operate the steam production and distribution facilities of the MCPP located on the Milwaukee County Grounds in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. In 2015, we entered into an agreement to sell the MCPP, which is expected to close during the first half of 2016. 

Steam Utility Operating Statistics 

Annual sales of steam fluctuate from year to year based on system growth and variations in weather conditions.

C. REGULATION 

We are subject to the requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 as we meet the definition of a holding company under this Act due to our ownership interest in ATC. 

In addition to the specific regulations noted below, we are also subject to regulations, where applicable, of the EPA, the WDNR, the MDEQ, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 

Rates 

&#160; 

Our rates are regulated by the various commissions shown in the table below. These commissions have general supervisory and regulatory powers over public utilities in their respective jurisdictions.

Embedded within our electric rates is an amount to recover fuel and purchased power costs. The Wisconsin retail fuel rules require us to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any under-collection or over-collection of fuel and purchased power costs that are outside of our symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW typically sets at plus or minus 2% of our approved fuel and purchased power cost plan. Our deferred fuel and purchased power costs are subject to an excess revenues test. If our ROE in a given year exceeds the ROE authorized by the PSCW, the recovery of under-collected fuel and purchased power costs would be reduced by the amount by which our return exceeds the authorized amount. 

Prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs are recovered dollar-for-dollar from our Michigan retail electric customers and our Wisconsin wholesale electric customers. Our natural gas operations operate under a GCRM as approved by the PSCW. Generally, the GCRM allows for a dollar-for-dollar recovery of prudently incurred natural gas costs. 

In May 2015, the PSCW approved the acquisition of Integrys on the condition that we will be subject to an earnings sharing mechanism for three years beginning January 1, 2016 . See Note 2, Acquisition, for more information &#32;on this earnings sharing mechanism.

Electric Transmission, Capacity, and Energy Markets 

In connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid-based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the Energy and Operating Reserves Markets, which include the bid-based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self-provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control. 

2015 Form 10-K 

Wisconsin Electric Power Company 

In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by load-serving entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. The FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 

As part of MISO, a market-based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through ARRs and FTRs. ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO, and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction were completed for the period of June 1, 2015 through May 31, 2016. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs are expected to mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period. 

Beginning June 1, 2013, MISO instituted an annual zonal resource adequacy requirement to ensure there is sufficient generation capacity to serve the MISO market. To meet this requirement, capacity resources could be acquired through MISO's annual capacity auction, bilateral contracts for capacity, or provided from generating or demand response resources. Our capacity requirements during 2015 were fulfilled using our own capacity resources. 

Other Electric Regulations 

We are subject to the Federal Power Act and the corresponding regulations developed by certain federal agencies. The Energy Policy Act amended the Federal Power Act in 2005 to, among other things, make electric utility industry consolidation more feasible, authorize the FERC to review proposed mergers and the acquisition of generation facilities, change the FERC regulatory scheme applicable to qualifying cogeneration facilities, and modify certain other aspects of energy regulations and Federal tax policies applicable to us. Additionally, the Energy Policy Act created an Electric Reliability Organization to be overseen by the FERC, which established mandatory electric reliability standards and which has the authority to levy monetary sanctions for failure to comply with these standards. 

We are subject to Act 141 in Wisconsin and Public Act 295 in Michigan, which contain certain minimum requirements for renewable energy generation. See Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information . 

All of our hydroelectric facilities follow FERC guidelines and/or regulations. 

Other Natural Gas Regulations 

Almost all of the natural gas we distribute is transported to our distribution systems by interstate pipelines. The pipelines' transportation and storage services are regulated by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. In addition, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and the state commissions are responsible for monitoring and enforcing requirements governing our natural gas safety compliance programs for our pipelines under United States Department of Transportation regulations. These regulations include 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 192 (Transportation of Natural and Other Gas by Pipeline: Minimum Federal Safety Standards) and 49 CFR Part 195 (Transportation of Hazardous Liquids by Pipeline). 

We are required to provide natural gas service and grant credit (with applicable deposit requirements) to customers within our service territory. We are generally not allowed to discontinue natural gas service during winter moratorium months to residential heating customers who do not pay their bills. Federal and certain state governments have programs that provide for a limited amount of funding for assistance to our low-income customers. 

D. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE 

Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation by state and federal environmental agencies governing air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste management, environmental remediation, and management of natural resources. Costs associated with complying with these requirements are significant. Additional future environmental regulations or revisions to existing laws, including for example, additional regulation of GHG emissions, coal combustion products, air emissions, or wastewater discharges, could significantly increase these environmental compliance costs. 

Anticipated expenditures for environmental compliance and remediation issues for the next three years are included in the estimated capital expenditures described in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8211; Capital Requirements in Item 7. For a discussion of matters related to certain solid waste and coal combustion product landfills, manufactured gas plant sites, and air and water quality, see Note 15, Commitments and
