 Item 1: Description of Business

General Overview 

&#160;

The Company is developing and marketing software product as a mobile application for end users of the current generation iPhone and iPad from Apple, Inc., and mobile phones using the Android platform. The mobile application's digital content will be customizable by the owner of the particular device using our software. We plan to stay on the cutting edge of the constantly changing mobile application market, and our goal is to create a quality reputation within the mobile software community and marketplace. We plan to sell our initial applications through Apple's App Store or through our own online retail website to small business owners, who desire their own mobile applications and want to control the content. Apple, App Store, iPhone and iPad are trademarks of Apple Inc., and Android is a trademark of Alphabet Inc.

&#160;

Our initial software product is intended to be the framework and basic code for an iPhone/iPad application that can be used as a template for essentially an infinite number of mobile applications for small business owners. By building the engine and template in advance and then using the same basic code repeatedly, we should avoid certain costs of development for each new application. Each new customer would have a set of features to choose from, which would provide the necessary content for the Company to customize an application for such customer's business.

&#160;

The Company is generating the engine/code/template and then customizing it for each mobile application, thus providing a solution for small businesses to have their own iPhone or Android application for a fraction of the cost of developing such an application from scratch. Customers should be able to choose from a variety of features, including but not limited to:

&#160;

- Custom graphics throughout the application (home screen, icons, buttons, etc.)

- Audio/Video/Photo content

- Maps and contact information

- Links to external websites

- Connections to social networking for use of content from popular sites such as, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and MySpace

- Commerce for purchases from within application, or link to an online store

&#160;

In addition to customized mobile applications, our customers will receive a customized publishing application (PC-based initially, with a Mac version coming later) to manage the content in their apps. To update, add, or delete content, the customer uses the publishing application, which in turn communicates with a central server where the content is hosted and the updates will be made to the app the next time it is launched. 

&#160;

We intend to charge each of our customers an initial fee to download our basic application. The fee will be determined based upon the features each user desires. Additionally, each user will be charged a monthly fee for the continued use of our application. Upgrades and other modifications will be available to our customers for appropriate fees. We have not yet finalized the amount of those fees.
