 Item 1. Business 

Our Company 

We are a global luxury lifestyle brand led by a world-class management team and a renowned, award-winning designer. Since launching his namesake brand 35 years ago, Michael Kors has featured distinctive designs, materials and craftsmanship with a jet-set aesthetic that combines stylish elegance and a sporty attitude. Mr. Kors&#8217; vision has taken the Company from its beginnings as an American luxury sportswear house to a global accessories, footwear and apparel company with a presence in over 100 countries. 

We operate our business in three segments &#8212; retail, wholesale and licensing &#8212; and we have a strategically controlled global distribution network focused on company-operated retail stores, leading department stores, specialty stores and select licensing partners. In Fiscal 2016 , our retail segment accounted for approximately 50.8% &#32;of our total revenue. As of April 2, 2016 , our retail segment included: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 390 &#32;retail stores in the Americas, including concessions; 

&#8226; 278 &#32;international retail stores, including concessions, in Europe and Asia; and 

&#8226; our e-commerce sites in U.S. and Canada. 

In Fiscal 2016 , our wholesale segment accounted for approximately 45.5% &#32;of our total revenue. As of April 2, 2016 , our wholesale segment included: 

&#160; 

&#8226; wholesale sales through approximately 1,532 &#32;department store and 929 &#32;specialty store doors in the Americas; and 

&#8226; wholesale sales through approximately 1,222 &#32;specialty store and 206 &#32;department store doors internationally. 

A small number of our wholesale customers account for a significant portion of our net sales. Net sales to our five largest wholesale customers represented 25.8% &#32;of our total revenue for Fiscal 2016 &#32;and 26.3% &#32;of our total revenue for Fiscal 2015 . Our largest wholesale customer, Macy's, accounted for 12.7% &#32;of our total revenue for Fiscal 2016 &#32;and 13.7% &#32;of our total revenue for Fiscal 2015 . 

Our remaining revenue is generated through our licensing segment, through which we license to third parties certain production, sales and/or distribution rights through product and geographic licensing arrangements. In Fiscal 2016 , our licensing segment accounted for approximately 3.7% &#32;of our total revenue and consisted primarily of royalties earned on licensed products and our geographic licenses. 

For additional financial information regarding our segments, see the Segment Information note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

We offer three primary collections: the Michael Kors &#32; Collection &#32;luxury line, the MICHAEL Michael Kors &#32;accessible luxury line and the &#32;Michael Kors Mens &#32;line. Michael Kors &#32; Collection &#32;establishes the aesthetic authority of our entire brand and is carried in many of our retail stores, as well as in the finest luxury department stores in the world, including, among others, Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Holt Renfrew, Harrods, Harvey Nichols and Printemps. In 2004, we saw an opportunity to capitalize on the brand strength of the Michael Kors &#32;collection and address the significant demand opportunity in accessible luxury goods, and we introduced MICHAEL Michael Kors , which has a strong focus on accessories, in addition to offering footwear and apparel. MICHAEL Michael Kors &#32;is carried in all of our lifestyle stores, as well as leading department stores throughout the world, including, among others, Bloomingdale&#8217;s, Nordstrom, Macy&#8217;s, Harrods, Harvey Nichols, Galeries Lafayette, Lotte, Hyundai, Isetan and Lane Crawford. More recently, we have begun to grow our men's business in recognition of the significant opportunity afforded by our brand's established fashion authority and the expanding men's market. Taken together, our primary collections target a broad customer base while retaining our premium luxury image. 

Industry 

We operate in the global luxury goods industry. Over the past ten years, the luxury goods industry has grown and has remained resilient during economic downturns. While this growth has slowed in the recent years, the demand for the worldwide luxury goods industry, and accessories in particular, is predicted to continue to grow. While the wholesale channel has experienced a slower performance, retail channel continues to grow driven by new store openings and the growth of the e-commerce channel. Accessories remains the leader within personal luxury goods, growing at a faster rate than other luxury categories. The jewelry category also continued to grow in the past year, while watch sales have experienced a global decline. We believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on the continued growth of the accessories product category, as it is one of our primary product categories of focus, and grow our sales in other categories with new innovative product offerings. 

Geographic Information 

We generate revenue globally through our segments. Through our retail and wholesale segments we sell our products in three principal geographic markets: the Americas (including North America, Latin America and the Caribbean), Europe and Asia. Through our licensing segment, we enter into agreements that license to third parties use of our brand name and trademarks, certain production, and sales and/or distribution rights. We have wholesale arrangements pursuant to which we sell products to certain of our licensees, including our licensees in Asia (which were previously reported within our Americas wholesale operations).

Competitive Strengths 

We believe that the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors: 

Growing Luxury Lifestyle Brand with Best-in-Class Growth Metrics . We believe that the Michael Kors name has become synonymous with luxurious fashion that is timeless and elegant, expressed through sophisticated accessory and ready-to-wear collections. Each of our collections exemplifies the jet-set lifestyle and features high quality designs, materials and craftsmanship. Some of the most widely recognized global trendsetters&#8212;including celebrities such as Kate Hudson, Halle Berry, Angelina Jolie, Blake Lively, Jennifer Lopez, Taylor Swift, Michelle Obama, Gwyneth Paltrow, the Duchess of Cambridge, and Cate Blanchett&#8212;walk the red carpet in our collections. We have built a solid foundation for continued long-term global growth and currently enjoy best-in-class growth metrics. 

Design Vision Led by World-Renowned, Award-Winning Designer . Michael Kors, a world-renowned designer, personally leads our experienced design team. Mr. Kors and his team are responsible for conceptualizing and directing the design of all of our products, and their design leadership is a unique advantage that we possess. Mr. Kors has received a number of awards, which recognize the contribution Mr. Kors and his team have made to the fashion industry and our Company. 

Leveraging Brand Position to Grow the Global Accessories Product Category . The accessories product category has been the fastest growing product category in the global luxury goods industry. In 2004, we saw the opportunity to capitalize on growing accessories demand by leveraging the strength of the Michael Kors &#32;luxury collection, and we introduced the accessible luxury MICHAEL Michael Kors, further enhancing our brand awareness. 

Proven Multi-Format Retail Segment with Significant Growth Opportunity . In Fiscal 2016 , our retail segment reported net sales of $2.395 billion , which represented a 12.2% &#32;increase from net sales of $2.135 billion &#32;in Fiscal 2015 . Within our retail segment we have four primary retail store formats: collection stores, lifestyle stores, outlet stores and e-commerce sites. Our collection stores are located in some of the world&#8217;s most prestigious shopping areas, such as Madison Avenue in New York and Rodeo Drive in California, and are generally 3,200 square feet in size. Our lifestyle stores are located in some of the world&#8217;s most frequented metropolitan shopping locations and leading regional shopping centers, and are generally 2,700 square feet in size. We also extend our reach to additional consumer groups through our outlet stores, which are generally 3,600 square feet in size. We also have e-commerce sites in the United States and Canada and plan to launch additional e-commerce sites in Europe and Asia in Fiscal 2017 and 2018. In addition to these four retail store formats, we operate concessions in a select number of department stores in North America and internationally. 

Strong Relationships with Premier Wholesale Customers . We partner with leading wholesale customers, such as Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Holt Renfrew, Bloomingdale&#8217;s and Macy&#8217;s in North America; and Harrods, Harvey Nichols, Selfridges and Galeries Lafayette in Europe. These relationships enable us to access large numbers of our key consumers in a targeted manner. Our "shop-in-shops" have specially trained staff, as well as customized fixtures, wall casings, decorative items, and flooring, and provide department store consumers with a more personalized shopping experience than traditional retail department store configurations. We are also engaged with our wholesale customers on initiatives designed to maximize their e-commerce growth and have entered into new innovative supply chain partnerships with our wholesale customers designed to increase the speed at which our products reach the ultimate consumer. These initiatives, among others, have helped increase total revenue for our wholesale segment by 3.8% &#32;from $2.065 billion &#32;in Fiscal 2015 &#32;to $2.144 billion &#32;in Fiscal 2016 , despite a challenging wholesale environment. 

Innovative Product Offerings from our Licensing Segment . The strength of our global brand has been instrumental in helping us build our licensing business. We collaborate with a select number of product licensees who produce and sell what we believe are products requiring specialized expertise that are enhanced by our brand strength. Our relationship with Fossil Partners, LP. (&#8220;Fossil&#8221;), for instance, has helped us create a line of watches and jewelry that we believe have become status items for young fashion-conscious consumers. As of April 2, 2016 , our product licensees also included the Aramis and Designer Fragrances division of The Est&#233;e Lauder Companies Inc. (&#8220;Est&#233;e Lauder&#8221;) for fragrances and beauty, and Luxottica Group (Luxottica) for eyewear, among others. Our relationships with our product licensees have helped us leverage our success across demographics and categories by taking advantage of their unique expertise, resulting in total revenue for licensed products increasing from $171.8 million &#32;in Fiscal 2015 &#32;to $173.3 million &#32;in Fiscal 2016 , despite taking direct control of our previously licensed businesses in Latin America and South Korea in Fiscal 2016. During Fiscal 2017, we plan to introduce new fragrance offerings and connected technology, in collaboration with our licensees. In addition, we have agreements with non-manufacturing third-party licensees who we believe have particular expertise in the distribution of fashion accessories, footwear and apparel in specific geographic territories, such as the Middle East, Eastern Europe, certain parts of Asia and Australia. 

Proven and Experienced Management Team . Our senior management team has extensive experience across a broad range of disciplines in the retail industry, including design, sales, marketing, public relations, merchandising, real estate, supply chain and finance. With an average of 25 years of experience in the retail industry, including at a number of public companies, and an average of eleven years with Michael Kors, our senior management team has strong creative and operational experience and a successful track record. This extensive experience extends beyond our senior management team and deep into our organization. 

Business Strategy 

Our goal is to continue to create shareholder value by increasing our revenue and profits, increasing our comparable store sales and strengthening our global brand. We plan to achieve our business strategy by focusing on the following six strategic initiatives: 

Trend Setting Innovative Product Offerings. &#32;We will continue to grow our market share and revenue by ensuring that the majority of our product offerings each season are comprised of new products across our lifestyle portfolio, in order to strengthen our position as a fashion leader and continue to generate business growth. We also plan to specifically focus on global diversity in our product offerings. 

Diversified Product Planning . We plan to continue to expand our luxury accessories product category and leverage our success to strengthen our position across our product portfolio through: 

&#8226; 

introduction of new innovative licensed product categories, including new fragrance offerings and wearable technology; 

&#8226; 

men's business growth through new store openings and increasing men's product assortment, including apparel and accessories, within our retail and wholesale channels; and

holding our semi-annual runway shows that reinforce Mr. Kors' designer status and high-fashion image, events in key markets around the world and creating excitement around Michael Kors Collection, MICHAEL Michael Kors &#32;and &#32;Michael Kors Mens , and generating global multimedia press coverage.

continuing to open new retail stores in preeminent, high-visibility locations around the world; and 

&#8226; 

maintaining our strong advertising position in global fashion publications, growing our online advertising exposure and social media presence and continuing to distribute our store catalog featuring our new collections. 

Optimizing Customer Engagement. &#32;We plan to continue to invest in technology and focus on customer relationship initiatives as part of our omni-channel strategy to provide a seamless customer experience across the different channels by: 

&#8226;

&#8226; 

introduction of limited addition exclusive product offerings in certain of our premiere locations. 

Expanding Our Global Presence. &#32;We will continue our international expansion in Asia and Europe and leverage our existing operations in international locations to increase global brand awareness and market share by: 

&#8226; 

continuing to expand internationally through acquisition of our geographic licensees in the Greater China region, including China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan during the first quarter of Fiscal 2017, as well as growing our recently acquired business in South Korea; and 

&#8226; 

growing our existing operations in Europe and Asia through new store openings, expanding our international e-commerce presence, and increasing our wholesale doors and shop-in-shop conversions. 

Leading Luxury Digital Presence . We intend to continue making investments in technology focused on optimizing our digital presence, including: 

&#8226; 

expanding our international e-commerce presence by launching new e-commerce sites in Europe and Asia in Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2018; and 

&#8226; 

continuing to evolve our digital experience along with shifts in consumer behavior to mobile devices while reacting to new levels of customer expectations regarding service. 

Collections and Products 

We have three primary collections that offer accessories, footwear and apparel: the Michael Kors &#32; Collection, &#32; MICHAEL Michael Kors &#32;and Michael Kors Mens , all of which are offered through our retail and wholesale segments. We also offer licensed products primarily through our retail segment. Our net sales by major product category were as follows (in millions):

Marketing and Advertising 

Our marketing strategy is to deliver a brand and product message that is consistent with the Michael Kors brand image, across all customer touch points on their path from brand consideration through purchase. Our global image is created and executed internally by our creative marketing, visual merchandising and public relations teams, which helps ensure the consistency of our message. 

In Fiscal 2016 , we recognized approximately $103.9 million &#32;in advertising and marketing expenses globally. We engage in a wide range of integrated marketing programs, across various marketing channels including but not limited to email marketing, print advertising, outdoor advertising, online marketing, social media, direct print mailings, public relations outreach, visual merchandising and partnership marketing, in an effort to engage our existing and potential customer base and ultimately stimulate sales in a consumer-preferred shopping venue. In addition, our spring and fall ready-to-wear collections along with our latest accessories are showcased at New York Fashion Week. The semi-annual runway shows generate extensive media coverage. 

The growing number of visitors to our michaelkors.com &#32;online store provides an opportunity to increase the size of our customer database and to communicate with our consumers to increase online and physical store sales, as well as build brand awareness. In September 2014, we launched a new in-house U.S. e-commerce platform at michaelkors.com . Our mobile optimized e-commerce site features the Michael Kors lifestyle images, which allows us to better engage new and existing customers and create innovative ways to keep the brand at the forefront of consumers&#8217; minds by offering a broad selection of products, including accessories, apparel, and footwear. Since e-commerce growth is critical to our overall growth strategy, we continued to expand our global e-commerce presence by launching a new e-commerce site in Canada in April 2015, and plan to launch e-commerce sites in Europe and Asia during Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. 

Manufacturing and Sourcing 

We contract for the purchase of finished goods principally with independent third-party manufacturing contractors, whereby the manufacturing contractor is generally responsible for the entire manufacturing process, including the purchase of piece goods and trim. Although we do not have written agreements with any of our manufacturing contractors, we believe we have mutually satisfactory relationships with them. We allocate product manufacturing among third-party agents based on their capabilities, the availability of production capacity, pricing and delivery. We have relationships with various agents who source our finished goods with numerous manufacturing contractors on our behalf. Although our relationships with our agents are generally terminable at any time, we believe we have mutually satisfactory relationships with them. In Fiscal 2016 &#32;and &#32;2015 , one third-party agent sourced approximately 14.9% &#32;and 11.7% &#32;of our finished goods purchases, respectively. In Fiscal 2016 , by dollar volume, approximately 97.2% &#32;of our products were produced in Asia and Europe. See Item 1A. &#8212; &#8220;Import Restrictions and Other Government Regulations&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;We primarily use foreign manufacturing contractors and independent third-party agents to source our finished goods, which poses legal, regulatory, political and economic risks to our business operations.&#8221; 

Manufacturing contractors and agents operate under the close supervision of our global manufacturing divisions and buying agents headquartered in North America, Europe and Asia. All products are produced according to our specifications. Production staff monitors manufacturing at supplier facilities in order to correct problems prior to shipment of the final product. Quality assurance is focused on as early as possible in the production process, allowing merchandise to be received at the distribution facilities and shipped to customers with minimal interruption. 

Distribution 

Our primary distribution facility in the United States is the 1,284,400 square foot leased facility in Whittier, California, which we operate. We also have several smaller distribution facilities across the United States. Outside of the United States, we have regional distribution centers in Canada, Holland, Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong, which are either leased or operated by third-parties. In April 2015, we expanded our existing distribution facility in Whittier, California to service our e-commerce site. In addition, during Fiscal 2016, we began building our own 1,076,390 square foot distribution facility in Holland, which is expected to be completed in Fiscal 2017 and will be the first Company-owned and operated distribution facility. The new facility will support all of our European operations, including the e-commerce sites expected to be launched in Fiscal 2017. 

Intellectual Property 

We own the Michael Kors &#32;and MICHAEL Michael Kors &#32;trademarks, as well as other material trademark rights related to the production, marketing and distribution of our products, both in the United States and in other countries in which our products are principally sold. We also have trademark applications pending for a variety of related logos. We aggressively police our trademarks and pursue infringers both domestically and internationally. We also pursue counterfeiters in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, the Far East and elsewhere in the world in both online and offline channels through leads generated internally, as well as through our network of customs authorities, law enforcement, legal representatives and brand specialists around the world. 

Pursuant to an agreement entered into by Mr. Kors in connection with the acquisition by our former principal shareholder of a majority interest in the Company in 2003, Mr. Kors (i) represented that all intellectual property rights used in connection with the Company&#8217;s business at such time were owned exclusively by the Company, (ii) assigned to the Company (to the extent not already assigned to and owned by the Company) exclusive worldwide rights in perpetuity to the &#8220; Michael Kors &#8221; name and trademark and all derivations thereof, as well as to Mr. Kors&#8217; signature and likeness, and all goodwill associated therewith, (iii) agreed not to take any action against the Company inconsistent with such ownership by the Company (including, without limitation, by asserting any privacy, publicity or moral rights) and (iv) agreed not to use, whether or not he is employed by the Company, any of such intellectual property in connection with any commercial enterprise (provided that he may use the name Michael Kors as his legal name only, and not as service mark or trade name, to identify himself personally and to engage in charitable activities and other activities that do not compete with any businesses of the Company). 

Employees 

At the end of Fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 , we had approximately 12,689, 11,094 and 9,184 total employees, respectively. As of April 2, 2016 , we had approximately 6,144 full-time employees and approximately 6,545 part-time employees. Approximately 10,410 of our employees were engaged in retail selling and administrative positions, and our remaining employees were engaged in other aspects of our business as of April 2, 2016 . None of our employees are currently covered by collective bargaining agreements and we believe that our relations with our employees are good. 

Competition 

We face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we compete. Our products compete with other branded products within their product category. In varying degrees, depending on the product category involved, we compete on the basis of style, price, customer service, quality, brand prestige and recognition, among other bases. In our wholesale business, we compete with numerous manufacturers, importers and distributors of accessories, footwear and apparel for the limited space available for product display. Moreover, the general availability of manufacturing contractors allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of our competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business. 

Over the last several years the accessories category, in particular, has grown, encouraging the entry of new competitors, as well as increasing the competition from existing competitors. We believe, however, that we have significant competitive advantages because of our brand recognition and the acceptance of our brand name by consumers. See Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors" &#8212; "The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, both within North America and internationally, and increased competition based on a number of factors could cause our profitability to decline.&#8221; 

Seasonality 

We experience certain effects of seasonality with respect to our wholesale and retail segments. Our wholesale segment generally experiences its greatest sales in our third and fourth fiscal quarters while our first fiscal quarter experiences the lowest sales. Our retail segment generally experiences greater sales during our third fiscal quarter as a result of Holiday season sales. In the aggregate, our first fiscal quarter typically experiences significantly less sales volume relative to the other three quarters and our third fiscal quarter generally has higher sales volume relative to the other three quarters. 

Import Restrictions and Other Governmental Regulations 

Virtually all of our merchandise imported into the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia is subject to duties. In addition, most of the countries to which we ship could impose safeguard quotas to protect their local industries from import surges that threaten to create market disruption. The United States and other countries may also unilaterally impose additional duties in response to a particular product being imported at unfairly traded prices that, in such increased quantities, cause or threaten injury to the relevant domestic industry (generally known as &#8220;anti-dumping&#8221; actions). If dumping is suspected in the United States, the United States government may self-initiate a dumping case on behalf of a particular industry. Furthermore, additional duties, generally known as countervailing duties, can also be imposed by the United States government to offset subsidies provided by a foreign government to foreign manufacturers if the importation of such subsidized merchandise injures or threatens to injure a United States industry. We are also subject to other international trade agreements and regulations, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement. See Item 1A.&#8220;Risk Factors" &#8212; "We primarily use foreign manufacturing contractors and independent third-party agents to source our finished goods, which poses legal, regulatory, political and economic risks to our business operations.&#8221; 

Accessories, footwear and apparel sold by us are also subject to regulation in the United States and other countries by governmental agencies, including, in the United States, the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Products Safety Commission. These regulations relate principally to product labeling, licensing requirements, flammability testing and product safety. We are also subject to environmental laws, rules and regulations. Similarly, accessories, footwear and apparel sold by us are also subject to import regulations in the United States and other countries concerning the use of wildlife products for commercial and non-commercial trade, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. We do not estimate any significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either in the current fiscal year or in the near future. Our licensed products and licensing partners are also subject to regulation. Our agreements require our licensing partners to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and we are not aware of any violations that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results. 

We are also required to comply with the disclosure requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, relating to the use of conflict minerals in our products. As a result, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, additional costs to comply with this rule. 

Although we have not suffered any material restriction from doing business in desirable markets in the past, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce additional trademarks to new markets.
