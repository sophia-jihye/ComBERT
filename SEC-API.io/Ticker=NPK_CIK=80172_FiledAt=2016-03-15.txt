&#160; 

A. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

&#160; 

The business of National Presto Industries, Inc. (the &#8220;Company" or &#8220;National Presto&#8221;) consists of three business segments. For a further discussion of the Company&#8217;s business, the segments in which it operates, and financial information about the segments, please ref er to Note L to t he Consolidated Financial Statements. The Housewares/Small Appliance segment designs, markets and distributes housewares and small electrical appliances, including pressure cookers and canners, kitchen electrics, and comfort appliances. The Defense segment manufactures 40mm ammunition, precision mechanical and electro-mechanical assemblies, medium caliber cartridge cases; performs Load, Assemble and Pack (LAP) operations on ordnance-related products primarily for the U.S. Gover nment and prime contractors; produces and sells a variety of less lethal products and support accessories, and provides training for the use of less lethal products ; and manufactures detonators, booster pellets, release cartridges, lead azide, and other military energetic devices and materials. The Absorbent Products segment manufactures and sells private label and branded adult incontinence products. 

&#160; 

1. Housewares/Small Appliance Segment 

Housewares and electrical appliances sold by the Company include pressure cookers and canners; the Presto Control Master&#174; heat control single thermostatic control line of skillets in several sizes, griddles, woks and multi-purpose cookers; deep fryers of various sizes; waffle makers; pizza ovens; slicer/shredders; electric heaters; corn poppers (hot air, oil, and microwave); dehydrators; rice cookers; microwave bacon cookers; coffeemakers and coffeemaker accessories; electric tea kettles; electric k nife sharpeners; &#160; a line of kitchen gadgets; and timers. Pressure cookers and canners are available in various sizes and are fabricated of aluminum and, in the case of cookers, of stainless steel, as well. 

&#160; 

For the year ended December 31, 201 5 , approximately 1 0 % of consolidated net sales were provided by cast products (griddles, waffle makers, die cast deep fryers, skillets and multi-cookers), and approximately 18% by noncast/thermal appliances (stamped cookers and canners, pizza ovens, corn poppers, coffee makers, microwave bacon cookers, dehydrators, rice cookers, tea kettles, electric stainless steel appliances, non-cast fryers and heaters). For the year ended December 31, 201 4 , approximately 1 1 % of consolidated net sales were provided by cast products, and approximately 1 8 % by noncast/thermal appliances. For the year ended December 31, 201 3 , approximately 1 3 % of consolidated net sales were provided by cast products, and approximately 1 8 % by noncast/thermal appliances. For the year s ended December 31, 201 5 and 201 4 , this segment had one customer which accounted for 10% or more of Company consolidated net sales. That customer was Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. which accounted for 10% of consolidated net sales in both 201 5 and 201 4 . The loss of Wal-Mart Stores as a customer would have a material adverse effect on the segment. 

&#160; 

Products are sold primarily in the United States and Canada directly to retailers and also through independent distributors. Although the Company has long established relationships with many of its customers, it does not have long-term supply contracts with them. The loss of, or material reduction in, sales to any of the Company's major customers could adversely affect the Company's business. Most housewares and electrical appliances are sourced from vendors in the Orient. (See Note J to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) 

&#160; 

The Company has a sales force of 1 3 employees that sell to and service most customers. A few selected accounts are handled by manufacturers' representatives who may also sell other product lines. Sales promotional activities are conducted primarily through the use of newspaper advertising. The business is seasonal, with the normal peak sales period occurring in the fourth quarter of the year prior to the holiday season. This segment operates in a highly competitive and extremely price sensitive environment. Increased costs that cannot be fully absorbed into the price of products or passed along in the form of price increases to the retail customer can have a significant adverse impact on operating results. Several 

&#160;

companies compete for sales of housewares and small electrical appliances, some of which are larger than the Company&#8217;s segment and others which are smaller. In addition, some customers maintain their own private label, as well as purchase brokered product directly from the Orient. Product competition extends to special product features, product pricing, product quality, marketing programs, warranty provisions, service policies and other factors. New product introductions are an important part of the Company's sales to offset the morbidity rate of other products and/or the effect of lowered acceptance of seasonal products due to weather conditions. New products entail unusual risks. Engineering and tooling costs are increasingly expensive, as are finished goods that may not have a ready market or achieve widespread consumer acceptance. High-cost advertising commitments which may accompany such new products or may be required to maintain sales of existing products may not be fully absorbed by ultimate product sales. Initial production schedules, set in advance of introduction, carry the possibility of excess unsold inventories. New product introductions are further subject to delivery delays from supply sources, which can impact availability for the Company's most active selling periods. 

&#160; 

Research and development costs related to new product development for the years 201 5 , 201 4 , and 201 3 were absorbed in operations of these years and were not a material element in the aggregate costs incurred by the Company. 

&#160; 

Products are generally warranted to the original owner to be free from defects in material and workmanship for a period of one to twelve years from date of purchase, depending on the product. The Company allows a sixty-day over-the-counter initial return privilege through cooperating dealers. Products are serviced through a corporate service repair operation. The Company's service and warranty programs are competitive with those offered by other manufacturers in the industry. 

&#160; 

The Company primarily warehouses and distributes its products from distribution centers located in Canton and Jackson, Mississippi. Selective use is made of leased tractors and trailers. 

&#160; 

The Company invests funds not currently required for business activities (see Note A(5) to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Income from invested funds is included in Other Income in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

Earnings from investments may vary significantly from year to year depending on interest yields on instruments meeting the Company's investment criteria, and the extent to which funds may be needed for internal growth, acquisitions, newly identified business activities, and reacquisition of Company stock. 

&#160; 

2. &#160; Defense Segment 

AMTEC Corporation was acquired on February 24, 2001, and manufactures 40mm ammunition, and precision mechanical and electro-mechanical products for the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) and DOD prime contractors. AMTEC&#8217;s 75,000 square foot manufacturing facility located in Janesville, Wisconsin is focused on producing niche market ordnance products (such as training ammunition, fuzes, firing devices, and initiators). AMTEC is also the prime contractor for the 40mm ammunition system to the DOD (more fully described below). 

&#160; 

Spectra Technologies LLC, a subsidiary of AMTEC, was acquired on July 31, 2003, and is engaged in the manufacture and delivery of munitions and ordnance-related products for the DOD and DOD prime con tractors. Spectra maintains 2 9 6 ,000 square feet of space located in East Camden, Arkansas, dedicated primarily to Load, Assemble and Pack (LAP) type work and during 2008, completed a facility which enabled it to perform LAP work for the 40mm systems program previously mentioned and referenced below. 

&#160; 

Amron, a division of AMTEC, holds the assets that were purchased from Amron LLC on January 30, 2006. Amron manufactures cartridge cases used in medium caliber ammunition (20mm, 25mm, 30mm and 40mm) primarily for the DOD and DOD prime contractors, which includes the 40mm systems program previously mentioned and referenced below. The Amron manufacturing facility is 208,000 square feet and is located in Antigo, Wisconsin. 

&#160; 

&#160;

AMTEC Less Lethal Systems, Inc., a subsidiary of AMTEC Corporation, holds the assets that were purchased from ALS Technologies, Inc, a small Arkansas manufacturer of less lethal ammunition, on November 1, 2011. The subsidiary&#8217;s products include smoke and tear gas grenades, specialty impact munitions, diversionary devices and stun munitions, support accessories like launchers and gas masks, as well as training for the use of its products. The subsidiary&#8217;s new state-of-the-art less lethal ammunition manufacturing and training facility, which was completed in 2013, is 54,000 square feet and is located in Perry, Florida. Previously, the subsidiary operated out of a 15,000 square foot facility in Bull Shoals, Arkansas. 

&#160; 

Tech Ord, a division of AMTEC, holds the assets of Chemring Energetic Devices, Inc.&#8217;s business located in Clear Lake, South Dakota and all of the real property owned by Technical Ordnance Realty, LLC that were acquired on January 24, 2014. The 88,000 square f oo t Clear Lake facility is a manufacturer of detonators, booster pellets, release cartridges, lead azide, and other military energetic devices and materials, and its major customers include US and foreign government agencies, AMTEC Corporation, and other defen s e contractors. 

&#160; 

The Defense segment competes for its business primarily on the basis of technical competence, product quality, manufacturing experience, and price. This segment operates in a highly competitive environment with many other organizations, some of which are larger and others that are smaller. 

&#160; 

On April 25, 2005, AMTEC Corporation was awarded the high volume, five-year prime contract for management and production of the Army&#8217;s 40mm Ammunition System. The Army selected AMTEC as one of two prime contractors responsible for supplying all requirements for 40mm practice and tactical ammunition for a period of five years. AMTEC was awarded the majority share of requirements, and the Army estimated the total for the two contract awards, if all of the options were fully exercised, to be $1.3 billion. Deliveries under the contract exceeded $671,000,000, with final deliveries completed in 2013. On February 18, 2010, the Army awarded AMTEC a second five-year contract for the management and production of the 40mm Ammunition System. As in the original five -year contract, AMTEC was awarded the majority share of the 40mm requirement. The total dollar amount of th is contract awarded to AMTEC w as $ 566 ,000,000. The Company expects deliveries under this contract to continue through 2017. In addition, as part of an acquisition of a group of assets from DSE, Inc. completed on November 7, 2013 (see Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements) , AMTEC acquired through a novation agreement an additional $188,000,000, representing the remaining undelivered portion of the award that had been given to AMTEC&#8217;s competitor under the second five-year contract mentioned above. Total deliveries for the systems program under the second 40mm contract were $1 3 4 ,000,000 during 201 5 . A dditional shipments under the contract will be made during 201 6 and 2017 . The Company submitted its bid for a third cont ract. Although the FY 15 (Army&#8217;s fiscal year beginning October 1, 2014) bid request was subsequently cancelled, the 40mm program requirements remain. A new solicitation and award is expected in 2016. 

&#160; 

During June of 2015, the U.S. Army awarded AMTEC two contracts to develop the next generation of 40 mm &#160; high and low velocity training rounds. &#160; Two contracts, one in each category, were a lso awarded to other contractors . The value s of AMTEC&#8217;s high and low velocity development awards were $2,985,000 and $2,990,000, respectively. The development performance periods for the two contracts extend through the first quarter of 2017. Each contract has three production option years beginning in 2018. If exercised, the first year would be at a low initial rate, while the last two years would be at a full productio n rates. At the end of the development period, the Army will select the round s in each category that provide the best value, at which point it will decide whether to exercise the production options under the applicable contracts. 

&#160; 

During 201 5 , almost all of the work performed by this segment directly or indirectly for the DOD was performed on a fixed- price basis. Under fixed-price contracts, the price paid to the contractor is awarded based on competition at the outset of the contract and therefore is generally not subject to adjustments reflecting the actual costs incurred by the contractor, with the exception of some limited escalation clauses, which on the 2010 contract applied to only three materials &#8211; steel, aluminum and zinc. The Defense segment&#8217;s contracts and subcontracts contain the customary provision permitting termination at any time for the convenience of the government, with payment for any work completed, associated profit and inventory/work in progress at the time of termination. The segment&#8217;s business does not tend to be seasonal. 

&#160;

&#160; 

3. Absorbent Products Segment 

The Absorbent Products segment business (Presto Absorbent Products, Inc.) was formed on November 21, 2001 to purchase assets from RMED International, a company that manufactured primarily private label diapers. On October 6, 2003, the segment purchased the assets of NCN Hygienic Products, Inc., a Marietta, Georgia company which manufactured adult incontinence products and puppy pads, which were likewise primarily private label products. Focus continues to be on private label, although branded product is produced under the &#8220;PRESTO&#8221; label. The absorbent products business is capital intensive. New absorbent product equipment is extremely complex. Not only is considerable time required to secure and install the equipment, but even more time is required to develop the requisite employee skill sets to utilize the equipment efficiently. Sales channels must be in place to sell the increased capacity that results from new equipment and improved efficiency in operations. 

&#160; 

In 2007 , the Company consolidate d its adult incontinence production capabilities and relocat ed its adult incontinence manufacturing equipment from its Marietta, Georgia facility to its Eau Claire, Wisconsin facility. At that time , it discontinue d the manufacture of puppy pads. 

&#160; 

Unlike the housewares/small appliance business, the absorbent product business is not seasonal. To the extent there are variations from month to month, that is primarily a function of customer promotional timing or a change in the customer base. As private label products tend to emulate branded product, new product development is important, but is largely limited to providing features similar to those found in national branded product. Research and development costs are absorbed in operations. 

&#160; 

The absorbent product industry is a very competitive, high volume-low margin business. There are several competitors, most of which are larger than this segment of the Company. Product competition is largely based on product pricing, quality, and features. 

&#160; 

Product cost is heavily influenced by commodity costs which include wood pulp, as well as many petroleum based products. It is also influenced by equipment operating speed, efficiency, and utilization. 

&#160; 

Advertising is typically the responsibility of the owner of the private label and is thus minimal. Most sales are currently handled through distributor/brok er arrangements. 

&#160; 

The segment, which realized its first significantly profitable year in 2009, began experiencing capacity constraints towards the end of that year . To date, it has ordered four multi-million dollar machines, all of which had been installed in the Eau Claire, Wisconsin facility by the end of 201 5 . The segment also completed a warehouse addition to the current facility in Eau Claire and installed an automated handling system, both of which were in operation by the third quarter of 2011. Additional equipmen t purchases are in process. As the segment is now outfitted with equipment to offer the full lineup of adult incontinent products required by private label retailers, a major national retailer will be placing the segment&#8217;s briefs in all of its stores. Shipments are expected to begin in 2016. &#160; 

&#160; 

B. OTHER COMMENTS 

&#160; 

1. Sources and Availability of Materials 

See Note J to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

2. Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses 

Patents, particularly on new products, trademarks and know-how are considered significant to the Company&#8217;s Housewares/Small Appliance segment. The Company's current and future success depends upon judicial protection of its intellectual property rights (patents, trademarks and trade dress). Removal of that protection would expose the Company to competitors who seek to take advantage of the Company's innovations and proprietary rights. The Company has dozens of U.S. and foreign patents pending and granted. Of those U.S. patents granted, the following is a non-exhaustive list of those relevant to current products and their expiration dates, assuming continued payment of maintenance fees (the date is the latest expiration date of the corresponding patents): Quick Release Appliance Cord Assemblies (US 6,719,576, 

&#160;

December 2022, and 6,527,570, October 2021), Rotatable Cooking Apparatus (US 6,125,740 and 6,354,194, March 2019), Coffee brewer (US D695,064 December 2027), Griddle w/ folding legs (US 7,635,827 November 2027), Griddle w/ attached warming tray (US D674,656 January 2027), Low profile griddle (US D575,098 August 2022), Stirring popcorn maker (US D615,797 May, 2024) , and Parabolic Heater (US D633,189, February 2025). To date, the Company has vigorously protected its rights and enjoyed success in all its intellectual property suits. The Defense segment holds a United States patent related to its non-dud signature training round (US 8,640,621, Oct 2029) and the Absorbent Products segment holds a United States patent for a disposable absorbent article with extensible and retractable core (US 8,834,427, Sept. 2032) , as well as some licenses and trademarks , respectively, which would be deemed significant to their respective operations. 

&#160; 

3. Effects of Compliance with Environmental Regulations 

In May 1986, the Company's Eau Claire, Wisconsin, site was placed on the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Priorities List (NPL) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) because of alleged hazardous waste deposited on the property. At year end 1998, all remediation projects at the Eau Claire, Wisconsin, site had been installed, were fully operational, and restoration activities had been completed. 

&#160; 

Based on factors known as of December 31, 201 5 , it is believed that the Company's environmental liability reserve will be adequate to satisfy on-going remediation operations and monitoring activities; however, should environmental agencies require additional studies or remediation projects, it is possible the existing accrual could be inadequate. 

&#160; 

Management believes that in the absence of any unforeseen future developments, known environmental matters will not have any material effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the Company. 

&#160; 

4. &#160; Number of Employees of the Company 

As of December 31, 201 5 , the Company and its subsidiaries had 1,0 90 employees compared to 1,043 employees at the end of December 201 4 . 

&#160; 

Approximately 1 9 6 employees of Amron are members of the United Steel Workers union. The most recent contract between Amron and the union i s effective through February 2 9 , 20 20 . 

&#160; 

5. Industry Practices Related to Working Capital Requirements 

The major portion of the Company's sales was made with terms of 60 days or shorter. 

&#160; 

For the Housewares/Small Appliance segment, inventory levels increase in advance of the selling period for products that are seasonal, such as pressure canners, heaters, and major new product introductions. Inventory build-up also occurs to create stock levels required to support the higher sales that occur in the latter half of each year. Buying practices of the Company's customers require "just-in-time" delivery, necessitating that the Company carry large finished goods inventories. 

&#160; 

The multiple stock keeping units inherent in the private label absorbent product business, combined with the desire to avoid excessive machine changeover (which can have a negative impact on efficiency), necessitates the carrying of a large finished goods inventory in the Absorbent Product segment as well. 

&#160; 

The ability to meet U.S. Department of Defense demands also necessitates the carrying of large inventories in the Defense segment. 

&#160; 

6. &#160; Order &#160; Backlog 

Shipment of most of the Company's Housewares/Small Appliance products occurs within a relatively short time after receipt of the order and, therefore, there is usually no substantial order backlog. New product introductions may result in order backlogs that vary from product to product and as to timing of introduction. 

&#160; 

&#160;

The contract backlog of the Defe nse segment was approximately $284 ,000,000, $ 4 07 ,000,000, and $ 452 ,000,000 at December 31, 201 5 , 201 4 , and 201 3 , respectively. Backlog is defined as the value of orders from the customer less the amount of sales recognized against the orders. It is anticipated that the backlog will be produced and shipped during a 18 to 24 -month &#160; period, after December 31, 2015 . 

&#160; 

Shipment of Absorbent Products typically occurs within 7 to 30 days from receipt of an order and thus there is usually no substantial long term backlog of orders.
