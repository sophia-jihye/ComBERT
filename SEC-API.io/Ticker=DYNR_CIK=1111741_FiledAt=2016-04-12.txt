 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

History and Organization 

The Company is a minerals investment, management, and exploration company, and currently conducting test mining and pilot milling operations through an operating subsidiary in M&#233;xico, with specific focus on precious and base metals in M&#233;xico. The Company was originally incorporated in the State of California on September 28, 1937, under the name West Coast Mines, Inc. In November 1998, the Company re-domiciled from California to Delaware and changed its name to DynaResource, Inc. (&#8220;DynaUSA&#8221;).

We currently conduct operations in M&#233;xico through our operating subsidiaries. We currently own 80% of the outstanding shares of DynaResource de M&#233;xico, S.A. de C.V. (&#8220;DynaM&#233;xico&#8221;). DynaM&#233;xico owns 100% of mining concessions, equipment, camp and related facilities which comprise the San Jose de Gracia Property, in northern Sinaloa State, M&#233;xico. We also own 100% of Mineras de DynaResource S.A. de C.V. (&#8220;DynaMineras&#8221;), the exclusive oper ator of the San Jos&#233; de Gracia Project, under contract with DynaM&#233;xico. 

In 2000, the Company formed DynaM&#233;xico for the purpose of acquiring and holding mineral properties and mining concessions in M&#233;xico. DynaM&#233;xico owns a portfolio of mining concessions which comprise the San Jos&#233; de Gracia Project (&#8220;SJG&#8221;). The mining concessions which comprise the SJG District cover 69,121 hectares (170,802 acres) on the west side of the Sierra Madre mountain range. At the incorporation of DynaM&#233;xico, 100 shares of Fixed Capital Series &#8220;A&#8221; shares were issued with DynaUSA receiving 99 shares and its CEO receiving 1 share.

In 2005, the Company formed Mineras de DynaResource S.A. de C.V. (&#8220;DynaMineras&#8221;), a wholly owned subsidiary. DynaMineras entered into an operating agreement with DynaM&#233;xico on April 15, 2005. As a consequence of that agreement and subsequent amendments to that agreement, DynaMineras is the exclusive operating entity for the SJG Project.

Also in 2005, the Company formed another wholly owned subsidiary, DynaResource Operaciones, S.A. de C.V. (&#8220;DynaOperaciones&#8221;). DynaOperaciones entered into a personnel management agreement with DynaMineras and, as a consequence of that agreement, is the exclusive management company for personnel and consultants involved at the SJG Project.

From January 2008 through March 2011, DynaM&#233;xico issued 100 Variable Capital Series &#8220;B&#8221; Shares to Goldgroup Resources Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Goldgroup Mining Inc., in Vancouver, BC. (&#8220;Goldgroup&#8221;), in exchange for Goldgroup&#8217;s total capital contributions of $18,000,000 to DynaM&#233;xico. At the time of the issuance of the 100 Series B Shares to Goldgroup, Goldgroup owned 50% of the outstanding capital shares of DynaM&#233;xico.

On May 17, 2013, DynaUSA agreed to acquire a stock certificate for 300 Series &#8220;B&#8221; Variable Capital Shares of DynaM&#233;xico, in exchange for the settlement of accounts receivable from DynaM&#233;xico in the amount of $31,090,710 Mexican Pesos (approximately $2.4 million USD). After giving effect to the issuance of the 300 Series B Shares on June 21, 2013, DynaUSA owns 80% of the total outstanding Capital of DynaM&#233;xico. (See table representation of the outstanding Capital of DynaM&#233;xico below). The exchange of shares by DynaM&#233;xico for amounts payable to DynaUSA was unanimously approved by attending shareholders at a meeting of the shareholders of DynaM&#233;xico, held on the second call for shareholder's meeting on May 17, 2013 in Mazatl&#225;n, Sinaloa, M&#233;xico. The date of issuance of the 300 Series B Share Certificate was June 21, 2013. As a result of the issuance to DynaUSA of the 300 Variable Capital shares for amounts owed to DynaUSA, the accounts payable amount owed by DynaM&#233;xico to DynaUSA was retired in full.

After giving effect to the issuance to DynaUSA of the 300 Series B Variable Capital shares of DynaM&#233;xico as described above, the current outstanding Capital of DynaM&#233;xico is set forth in the table below:

Segment Information 

Our only current operating segment is M&#233;xico.

Products 

The end use product at our gold and silver test mining and pilot milling operations is either in the form of primarily gold-silver Dore, or primarily gold-silver concentrate. The end use product from current activities at the San Jose de Gracia Property generally consist of approximately 100% concentrate and 0% Dore. Dore is an alloy consisting primarily of gold and silver but also containing other metals. Dore is sent to refiners to produce bullion that meets the required market standard of 99.95% gold and 99.9% silver. Under the terms of our refining agreements, the Dore bars are refined for a fee, and our share of the refined gold and silver is credited to our account. Gold-silver concentrates, or simply concentrate, is raw precious metals materials that has been crushed and ground finely to a sand-like product where gangue (waste) and non-precious metals are removed or reduced, thus concentrating the precious metals component. Concentrates processed and produced from San Jose de Gracia are shipped to third-party smelters, refineries or third parties for further processing or re-sale.

&#160;

&#160;

During 2015, we reported the delivery and sale of 1,308 Oz gold contained in concentrates. All gold-silver concentrate originated from the San Jose de Gracia Property in M&#233;xico.

Gold-silver concentrates are sold at a small discount to the prevailing spot market price based on the price per ounce of gold and silver quoted at the London PM fix, with the actual net precious metals prices received depending on the sales contract. Concentrates are priced by individual concentrate lots of 36 to 72 tons, or as a series of lots under contract, whereby the final selling price and gold-silver quantities are subject to final adjustments at the time of final purchase settlement. No gold and silver Dore was produced from San Jose de Gracia in 2015.

Gold and Silver Pilot Processing Methods 

Gold and silver are extracted from mined mineralized material, by crushing, grinding, milling, and further by simple gravity and flotation recoveries. The mineralized material is extracted by underground mining methods. The processing plant at the San Jos&#233; de Gracia mine is composed of conventional crushing and grinding circuits, and with gravity and flotation recovery methods. The gravity and flotation concentrates are dewatered or dried, and shipped to purchasers in semi-trailers.

Gold and Silver Reserves / No Known Reserves 

The Company currently has no mineral &#8220;reserves&#8221; as defined by SEC Industry Guide 7 promulgated by the SEC.

General Government Regulations 

M&#233;xico 

Mining in M&#233;xico is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances governing mineral rights, operations and environmental protection.

Mineral Concession Rights. Exploration and exploitation of minerals in M&#233;xico may be carried out through Mexican companies incorporated under Mexican law by means of obtaining mining concessions. Mining concessions are granted by the Mexican government for a period of fifty years from the date of their recording in the Public Registry of Mining and are renewable for a further period of fifty years upon application within five years prior to the expiration of such concession in accordance with the Mining Law and its regulations. Mining concessions are subject to annual work requirements and payment of annual surface taxes which are assessed and levied on a semi-annual basis. Such concessions may be transferred or assigned by their holders, but such transfers or assignments must be registered with the Public Registry of Mining in order to be valid against third parties. The holder of a concession must pay semi-annual duties in January and July of each year on a per hectare basis and in accordance with the amounts provided by the Federal Fees Law. During the month of May of each year, the concessionaire must file with the General Bureau of Mines, the work assessment reports made on each concession or group of concessions for the preceding calendar year. The regulations of the Mining Law provide tables containing the minimum investment amounts that must be made on a concession. This amount is updated annually in accordance with the changes in the Consumer Price Index.

Surface Rights. In M&#233;xico, while mineral rights are administered by the federal government through federally issued mining concessions, E jidos (communal owners of land recognized by the federal laws in M&#233;xico) control surface access rights to the land. An Ejido may sell or lease lands directly to a private entity. While the Company has agreements or is in the process of negotiating agreements with the Ejido that impact all of its projects in M&#233;xico, some of these agreements may be subject to renegotiations.

Mining Royalties. In October 2013, the Mexican lower house passed a bill levying a tax-deductible mining royalty of 7.5% on earnings before the deduction of interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, along with an additional 0.5% surcharge on precious metals revenue for mining companies. The effective date of the law was January 1, 2014. Although there are a number of uncertainties surrounding the scope, calculation and enforcement of the royalty, based on the Company's current interpretation of the bill, the royalty or surcharge was not material for 2015.

Environmental Law. The Environmental Law in M&#233;xico, called the &#34;General Law of Ecological Balance and Protection to the Environment&#34; (&#34;General Law&#34;), provides for general environmental policies, with specific requirements for certain activities such as exploration set forth in regulations called &#34;Mexican official norms&#34;. Responsibility for enforcement of the General Law, the regulations and the Mexican official norms is with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, which regulate all environmental matters with the assistance of Procuradur&#237;a Federal de Protecci&#243;n al Ambiente (known as &#34;PROFEPA&#34;).

The primary laws and regulations used by the State of Sinaloa where our San Jose de Gracia property is located, in order to govern environmental protection for mining and exploration are: The General Law, Forestry Law, Residues Law, as well as their specific regulations on air, water and residues, and the Mexican official norms (known as &#34;NOM-120&#34;). In order to comply with the environmental regulations, a concessionaire must obtain a series of permits during the exploitation and exploration stage. The time required to obtain the required permits is dependent on a number of factors including the type of vegetation and trees impacted by proposed activities.

&#160;

&#160;

Mining Permits. The Secretariat of Environmental and Natural Resources, the Mexican Government environmental authority (&#34;SEMARNAT&#34;), is responsible for issuing environmental permits associated with mining. Three main permits required before construction can begin are: Environmental Impact Statement (known in M&#233;xico as Manifesto Impacto Ambiental ) (&#34;MIA&#34;), Land Use Change (known in M&#233;xico as Estudio Justificativo Para Cambio Uso Sueldo ) (&#34;ETJ&#34;), and Risk Analysis (known in M&#233;xico as Analisis de Riesgo ) (&#34;RA&#34;). A construction permit is required from the local municipality and an archaeological release letter must be obtained from the National Institute of Anthropology and History (known as &#34;INAH&#34;). An explosives permit is required from the ministry of defense before construction can begin. The Environmental Impact Statement is required to be prepared by a third-party contractor and submitted to SEMARNAT and must include a detailed analysis of climate, air quality, water, soil, vegetation, wildlife, cultural resources and socio-economic impacts. The Risk Analysis Study (which is included into the Environmental Impact Statement and submitted as one complete document) identifies potential environmental releases of hazardous substances and evaluates the risks in order to establish methods to prevent, respond to, and control environmental emergencies. The Land Use Change requires that an evaluation be made of the existing conditions of the land, including a plant and wildlife study, an evaluation of the current and proposed use of the land, impacts to naturally occurring resources, and an evaluation of reclamation/re-vegetation plans.
