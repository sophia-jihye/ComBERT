BUSINESS 

OVERVIEW 

Flowserve Corporation is a world leading manufacturer and aftermarket service provider of comprehensive flow control systems. Under the name of a predecessor entity, we were incorporated in the State of New York on May 1, 1912. Flowserve Corporation as it exists today was created in 1997 through the merger of two leading fluid motion and control companies &#8212; BW/IP and Durco International. Over the years, we have evolved through organic growth and strategic acquisitions, and our 220-year history of Flowserve heritage brands serves as the foundation for the breadth and depth of our products and services today. Unless the context otherwise indicates, references to "Flowserve," "the Company" and such words as "we," "our" and "us" include Flowserve Corporation and its subsidiaries. 

We develop and manufacture precision-engineered flow control equipment integral to the movement, control and protection of the flow of materials in our customers&#8217; critical processes. Our product portfolio of pumps, valves, seals, automation and aftermarket services supports global infrastructure industries, including oil and gas, chemical, power generation (including nuclear, fossil and renewable) and water management, as well as certain general industrial markets where our products and services add value. Through our manufacturing platform and global network of Quick Response Centers ("QRCs"), we offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services, such as installation, advanced diagnostics, repair and retrofitting. 

We sell our products and services to more than 10,000 companies, including some of the world&#8217;s leading engineering, procurement and construction firms ("EPC"), original equipment manufacturers, distributors and end users. Our products and services are used in several distinct industries having a broad geographic reach. Our bookings mix by industry in 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;consisted of:

We have pursued a strategy of industry diversity and geographic breadth to mitigate the impact on our business of normal economic downturns in any one of the industries or in any particular part of the world we serve. For events that may occur and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, refer to "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;("Annual Report"). For information on our sales and long-lived assets by geographic areas, see Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" ("Item 8") of this Annual Report. 

We conduct our operations through three business segments based on type of product and how we manage the business: 

&#8226; 

Engineered Product Division ("EPD") for long lead time, custom and other highly-engineered pumps and pump systems, mechanical seals, auxiliary systems and replacement parts and related services; 

&#8226; 

Industrial Product Division ("IPD") for pre-configured engineered pumps and pump systems and related products and services; and &#32; 

&#32;1 

&#8226; 

Flow Control Division ("FCD") for engineered and industrial valves, control valves, actuators and controls and related services. &#32; 

Our business segments share a focus on industrial flow control technology and benefit from our global footprint and our economies of scale in reducing administrative and overhead costs to serve customers more cost effectively. EPD and IPD have a high number of common customers and complementary product offerings and technologies that are often combined in applications that provide us a net competitive advantage. All segments share certain resources and functions, including elements of research and development ("R&#38;D"), supply chain, safety, quality assurance and administrative functions that provide efficiencies and an overall lower cost structure. 

Our operations leadership reports to our Chief Operating Officer, and the segments share leadership for operational support functions such as R&#38;D, marketing and supply chain. We believe this leadership structure positions the Company to leverage operational excellence, cost reduction initiatives and internal synergies across our entire operating platform to drive further growth and increase shareholders' value. 

Strategies 

Our overarching objective is to grow our position as a product and integrated solutions provider in the flow control industry. This objective includes continuing to sell products by building on existing sales relationships and leveraging the power of our portfolio of products and services. It also includes delivering specific end-user solutions that help customers attain their business goals by ensuring maximum reliability at a decreased cost of ownership. This objective is pursued by cultivating a corporate culture based on workplace safety for our employees, ethical and transparent business practices and a dedicated focus on serving our customers. These three pillars support a collaborative, 'One Flowserve' approach that leverages a diverse and inclusive work environment worldwide. We seek to drive increasing enterprise value by using the following strategies: disciplined profitable growth, customer intimacy, innovation and portfolio management, strategic localization, operational excellence, employee focus and sustainable business model. The key elements of these strategies are outlined below. 

Disciplined Profitable Growth 

Disciplined profitable growth is focused on growing revenues profitably from our existing portfolio of products and services, as well as through the development or acquisition of new customer-driven products and services. Its overarching goals are to focus on opportunities that can maximize the organic growth from existing customers and to evaluate potential new customer-partnering initiatives that maximize the capture of products' total life cycle. We believe we are the largest major pump, valve and seal company that can offer customers a differentiated option of flow management products and services across a broad portfolio, as well as offer additional options that include any combination of products and solution support packages. 

We also seek to continue to review our substantial installed pump, valve and seal base as a means to expand the aftermarket parts and services business, as customers are increasingly using third-party aftermarket parts and service providers to reduce their fixed costs and improve profitability. To date, the aftermarket business has provided us with a steady source of revenues and cash flows at higher margins than are typically realized with original equipment sales. Aftermarket sales represented approximately 43% &#32;&#32;and 42% &#32;of total sales in 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. We are building on our established presence through an extensive global QRC network to provide the immediate parts, service and technical support required to effectively manage and expand the aftermarket business created from our installed base. 

Customer Relationship 

Through our ongoing relationships with our customers, we seek to gain a rich understanding of their business objectives and how our portfolio of offerings can best help them succeed. We collaborate with our customers on the front-end engineering and design work to drive flow management solutions that effectively generate the desired business outcomes. As we progress through original equipment projects, we work closely with our customers to understand and prepare for the long-term support needs for their operations with the intent of maximizing total life cycle value for our customers&#8217; investments. 

We seek to capture additional aftermarket business by creating mutually beneficial opportunities for us and our customers through sourcing and maintenance alliance programs where we provide all or an agreed-upon portion of customers&#8217; parts and servicing needs. These alliances enable us to develop long-term relationships with our customers and serve as an effective platform for introducing new products and services and generating additional sales. 

&#32;2 

Innovation and Portfolio Management 

The ongoing management of our portfolio of products and services is critical to our success. As part of managing our portfolio, we continue to rationalize our portfolio of products and services to ensure alignment with changing market requirements. We also continue to invest in R&#38;D to expand the scope of our product offerings and our deployment of advanced technologies. The infusion of advanced technologies into new products and services continues to play a critical role in the ongoing evolution of our product portfolio. Our objective is to improve the percentage of revenue derived from new products as a function of overall sales, utilizing technological innovation to improve overall product life cycle and reduce total cost of ownership for our customers. 

We employ a robust portfolio management and project execution process to seek out new product and technology opportunities, evaluate their potential return on investment and allocate resources to their development on a prioritized basis. Each project is reviewed on a routine basis for such performance measures as time to market, net present value, budget adherence, technical and commercial risk and compliance with customer requirements. Technical skill sets and knowledge are deployed across business segment boundaries to ensure that we bring the best capabilities to bear for each project. Collectively, our R&#38;D portfolio is a key to our ability to differentiate our product and service offerings from other competitors in our target markets. 

We are focused on exploring and commercializing new technologies. In many of our research areas, we are teaming with universities and experts in the appropriate scientific fields to accelerate the required learning and to shorten the development time in leveraging the value of applied technologies in our products and services. Our intent is to be a market leader in the application of advanced technology to improve product performance and return on investment for our customers. 

Predictive diagnostics and asset management continue to be one of the key areas of effort for us across our business segments. Building on the strength of our ValveSight, Technology Advantage solutions and integration with host control systems, we have continued to deploy more diagnostics capabilities into our devices and expand on the equipment that can be monitored continuously. These capabilities continue to provide a key source of competitive advantage in the marketplace and are saving our customers time and money in keeping their operations running. 

We continually evaluate acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic investment opportunities to broaden our product portfolio, service capabilities, geographic presence and operational capabilities to meet the growing needs of our customers. We evaluate all investment opportunities through a decision filtering process to ensure a good strategic, financial and cultural fit. 

Strategic Localization 

Strategic localization continues to drive our global growth strategy. While we are a global company, we recognize that opportunities still remain. Therefore, we strive to advance our presence in geographies that we believe are critical to our future success as a company by focusing on the following areas: 

&#8226; 

expanding our global presence to capture business in developing geographic market areas; 

&#8226; 

expanding our low cost manufacturing capabilities in South East Asia and Latin America for local markets and exports; 

&#8226; 

utilizing low-cost sourcing opportunities to remain competitive in the global economy; and 

&#8226; 

attracting and retaining the global intellectual capital required to support our growth plans in new geographical areas. 

We believe there are attractive opportunities in international markets, particularly in Africa, China, India, Latin America and the Middle East, and we intend to continue to utilize our global presence and strategically invest to further penetrate these markets. In the aftermarket services business, we seek to strategically add QRC sites in order to provide rapid response, fast delivery and field repair on a global scale for our customers. 

We believe that our future success will be supported by investments made to establish indigenous operations to effectively serve the local market while taking advantage of low-cost manufacturing, competent engineering and strategic sourcing to support both local markets and export. We believe that this positions us well to support our global customers from project conception through commissioning and throughout the life of their operations. For example, we are currently expanding our pump and valve operations in China, valve operations in India and pump operations in Mexico. 

&#32;3 

We continue to develop and increase our manufacturing, engineering and sourcing functions in lower-cost regions and emerging markets such as India, China, Mexico, Latin America, the Middle East and Eastern Europe as we drive higher value-add from our supply base of materials and components and satisfy local content requirements. In 2015 , these lower-cost regions supplied our business segments with direct materials ranging from 22% &#32;to 42% &#32; of business segment spending. 

Operational Excellence 

The operational excellence strategy encapsulates ongoing programs that work to drive increased customer fulfillment and yield internal productivity. This initiative includes: 

&#8226; 

driving improved customer fulfillment through metrics such as on-time delivery, cost reduction, quality, cycle time reduction and warranty cost reduction as a percentage of sales; 

&#8226; 

continuing to develop a culture of continuous improvement that delivers maximum productivity and cost efficiencies; and 

&#8226; 

implementing global functional competencies to drive standardized processes. 

We seek to increase our operational efficiency through our Continuous Improvement Process ("CIP") initiative, which utilizes tools such as value analysis, value engineering, six sigma methodology, lean manufacturing and capacity management to improve quality and processes, reduce product cycle times and lower costs. Recognizing that employees are our most valuable resource in achieving operational excellence goals, we have instituted CIP training tailored to maximize the impact on our business. At this date, we have approximately 2,100 &#32;active employees that are CIP-trained or certified as "Green Belts," "Black Belts" or "Master Black Belts," and are deployed on CIP projects throughout our operations and supporting functions of the business. As a result of the CIP initiative, we have developed and implemented processes at various sites to reduce our engineering and manufacturing process cycle time, improve on-time delivery and service response time, optimize working capital levels and reduce costs. We have also experienced success in sharing and applying best practices achieved in one business segment and deploying those ideas to other segments of the business. 

We continue to rationalize existing Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") systems onto six &#32;strategic ERP systems. Going forward, these six &#32;strategic ERP systems will be maintained as core systems with standard tool sets, and will be enhanced as needed to meet the growing needs of the business in areas such as e-commerce, back office optimization and export compliance. Further investment in non-strategic ERP systems will be limited to compliance matters and conversion to strategic ERP systems. 

We also seek to improve our working capital utilization, with a particular focus on management of accounts receivable and inventory. See further discussion in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of "Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" ("Item 7") of this Annual Report. 

Employee Focus 

We focus on several elements in our strategic efforts to continuously enhance our organizational capability, including: 

&#8226; 

institutionalizing our succession planning along with our core competencies and performance management capabilities, with a focus on key positions and critical talent pools; 

&#8226; 

utilizing these capabilities to drive employee engagement through our training initiatives and leadership development programs and facilitate our cross-business segment and functional development assignments; 

&#8226; 

developing talent acquisition programs such as our engineering recruitment program to address current and future critical talent needs to support our emerging markets and global growth; 

&#8226; 

capturing the intellectual capital in the current workforce, disseminating it throughout our company and sharing it with customers as a competitive advantage; 

&#8226; 

creating a total compensation program that provides our associates with equitable opportunities that are competitive and linked to business and individual performance while promoting employee behavior consistent with our code of business conduct and risk tolerance; and 

&#8226; 

building a diverse and globally inclusive organization with a strong ethical and compliance culture based on transparency and trust. 

&#32;4 

We continue to focus on training through the distribution of electronic learning packages in multiple languages for our Code of Business Conduct, workplace harassment, facility safety, anti-bribery, export compliance and other regulatory and compliance programs. We also drive our training and leadership development programs through the deployment of general management development, manager competencies and a series of multi-lingual programs that focus on enhancing people management skills. 

Sustainable Business Model 

The sustainable business model initiative is focused on areas that have the potential of adversely affecting our reputation, limiting our financial flexibility or creating unnecessary risk for any of our stakeholders. We proactively administer an enterprise risk management program with regular reviews of high-level matters with our Board of Directors. We work with our capital sourcing partners to ensure that the terms of our credit facilities and long-term debt are appropriately aligned with our business strategy. We also train our associates on and monitor matters of a legal or ethical nature to support understanding and compliance on a global basis. 

Competition 

Despite consolidation activities in past years, the markets for our products remain highly competitive, with primary competitive drivers being price, reputation, project management, timeliness of delivery, quality, proximity to service centers and technical expertise, as well as contractual terms and previous installation history. In the pursuit of large capital projects, competitive drivers and competition vary depending on the industry and products involved. Industries experiencing slow growth generally tend to have a competitive environment more heavily influenced by price due to supply outweighing demand, and price competition tends to be more significant for original equipment orders than aftermarket services. Considering the domestic and global economic environments in 2015 &#32;and current forecasts for 2016 , pricing was and may continue to be a particularly influential competitive factor. The unique competitive environments in each of our three business segments are discussed in more detail under the &#8220;Business Segments&#8221; heading below. 

In the aftermarket portion of our business, we compete against large, well-established national and global competitors and, in some markets, against regional and local companies. In the oil and gas and chemical industries, the primary competitors for aftermarket services tend to be customers&#8217; own in-house capabilities. In the nuclear power generation industry, we possess certain competitive advantages due to our "N Stamp" certification, which is a prerequisite to serve customers in that industry, and our considerable base of proprietary knowledge. Aftermarket competition for standardized products is aggressive due to the existence of common standards allowing for easier replacement or repair of the installed products. 

In the sale of aftermarket products and services, we benefit from our large installed base of pumps, valves and seals, which continually require maintenance, repair and replacement parts due to the nature of the products and the conditions under which they operate. Timeliness of delivery, quality and the proximity of service centers are important customer considerations when selecting a provider for aftermarket products and services. In geographic regions where we are locally positioned to provide a quick response, customers have traditionally relied on us, rather than our competitors, for aftermarket products relating to our highly-engineered and customized products, although we are seeing increased competition in this area. 

Generally, our customers attempt to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase, thereby reducing the size and diversity of their supply chain. Although vendor reduction programs could adversely affect our business, we have been successful in establishing long-term supply agreements with a number of customers. While the majority of these agreements do not provide us with exclusive rights, they can provide us a "preferred" status with our customers and thereby increase opportunities to win future business. We also utilize our LifeCycle Advantage program to establish fee-based contracts to manage customers&#8217; aftermarket requirements. These programs provide an opportunity to manage the customer&#8217;s installed base and expand the business relationship with the customer. 

Our ability to use our portfolio of products, solutions and services to meet customer needs is a competitive strength. Our market approach is to create value for our customers throughout the life cycle of their investments in flow control management. We continue to explore and develop potential new offerings in conjunction with our customers. In the early phases of project design, we endeavor to create value in optimizing the selection of equipment for the customer&#8217;s specific application, as we are capable of providing technical expertise on product and system capabilities even outside the scope of our specific products, solutions and services. After the equipment is constructed and delivered to the customer&#8217;s site, we continue to create value through our aftermarket capabilities by optimizing the performance of the equipment over its operational life. Our skilled service personnel can provide these aftermarket services for our products, as well as many competitors&#8217; products, within the installed base. This value is further enhanced by the global reach of our QRCs and, when combined with our other solutions for our customers&#8217; flow control management needs, allows us to create value for our customers during all phases of the capital expenditure cycle. 

&#32;5 

New Product Development 

We spent $45.9 million , $40.9 million and $37.8 million during 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively, on company-sponsored R&#38;D initiatives. Our R&#38;D group consists of engineers involved in new product development and improvement of existing products. Additionally, we sponsor consortium programs for research with various universities and jointly conduct limited development work with certain vendors, licensees and customers. We believe our R&#38;D expenditures are adequate to sustain our ongoing and necessary future product development. In addition, we work closely with our customers on customer-sponsored research activities to help execute their R&#38;D initiatives in connection with our products and services. New product development in each of our three business segments is discussed in more detail under the "Business Segments" heading below. 

Customers 

We sell to a wide variety of customers globally including leading EPC firms, original equipment manufacturers, distributors and end users in several distinct industries: oil and gas, chemical, power generation, water management and general industries. We do not believe that we have sales to any individual customer that represent 10% &#32;or more of consolidated 2015 &#32;revenues. Customer information relating to each of our three business segments is discussed in more detail under the "Business Segments" heading below. 

We are not normally required to carry unusually high amounts of inventory to meet customer delivery requirements, although higher backlog levels and longer lead times generally require higher amounts of inventory. We typically require advance cash payments from customers on longer lead time projects to help offset our investment in inventory. We have initiated programs targeted at improving our operational effectiveness to reduce our overall working capital needs. While we do provide cancellation policies through our contractual relationships, we generally do not provide rights of product return for our customers. 

Selling and Distribution 

We primarily distribute our products through direct sales by employees assigned to specific regions, industries or products. In addition, we use distributors and sales representatives to supplement our direct sales force in countries where it is more appropriate due to business practices or customs, or whenever the use of direct sales staff is not economically efficient. We generate a majority of our sales leads through existing relationships with vendors, customers and prospects or through referrals. 

Intellectual Property 

We own a number of trademarks and patents relating to the names and designs of our products. We consider our trademarks and patents to be valuable assets of our business. In addition, our pool of proprietary information, consisting of know-how and trade secrets related to the design, manufacture and operation of our products, is considered particularly valuable. Accordingly, we take proactive measures to protect such proprietary information. We generally own the rights to the products that we manufacture and sell and are unencumbered by licensing or franchise agreements. Our trademarks can typically be renewed indefinitely as long as they remain in use, whereas our existing patents generally expire 10 &#32;to 20 years from the dates they were filed, which has occurred at various times in the past. We do not believe that the expiration of any individual patent will have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Raw Materials 

The principal raw materials used in manufacturing our products are readily available and include ferrous and non-ferrous metals in the form of bar stock, machined castings, fasteners, forgings and motors, as well as silicon, carbon faces, gaskets and fluoropolymer components. A substantial volume of our raw materials is purchased from outside sources, and we have been able to develop a robust supply chain and anticipate no significant shortages of such materials in the future. We continually monitor the business conditions of our suppliers to manage competitive market conditions and to avoid potential supply disruptions. We continue to expand global sourcing to capitalize on localization in emerging markets and low-cost sources of purchased goods balanced with efficient consolidated and compliant logistics. 

We are a vertically-integrated manufacturer of certain pump and valve products. Certain corrosion-resistant castings for our pumps and valves are manufactured at our foundries. Other metal castings are either manufactured at our foundries or purchased from qualified and approved foundry sources. 

&#32;6 

Concerning the products we supply to customers in the nuclear power generation industry, suppliers of raw materials for nuclear power generation markets must be qualified to meet the requirements of nuclear industry standards and governmental regulations. Supply channels for these materials are currently adequate, and we do not anticipate difficulty in obtaining such materials in the future. 

Employees and Labor Relations 

We have approximately 19,000 employees globally as of December 31, 2015 . In the United States ("U.S."), a portion of the hourly employees at our pump manufacturing plant located in Vernon, California, our pump service center located in Cleveland, Ohio, our valve manufacturing plant located in Lynchburg, Virginia and our foundry located in Dayton, Ohio, are represented by unions. Additionally, some employees at select facilities in the following countries are unionized or have employee works councils: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, The Netherlands, Spain, South Africa, Sweden and the &#32;United Kingdom (U.K.). We believe relations with our employees throughout our operations are generally satisfactory, including those employees represented by unions and employee works councils. No unionized facility accounted for more than 10% &#32;of our consolidated 2015 &#32;revenues. 

Environmental Regulations and Proceedings 

We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which we have operating facilities. These requirements primarily relate to the generation and disposal of waste, air emissions and waste water discharges. We periodically make capital expenditures to enhance our compliance with environmental requirements, as well as to abate and control pollution. At present, we have no plans for any material capital expenditures for environmental control equipment at any of our facilities. However, we have incurred and continue to incur operating costs relating to ongoing environmental compliance matters. Based on existing and proposed environmental requirements and our anticipated production schedule, we believe that future environmental compliance expenditures will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

We use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in many of our manufacturing and foundry operations. Most of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes and some may require clean-up of historical contamination. During the due diligence phase of our acquisitions, we conduct environmental site assessments to identify potential environmental liabilities and required clean-up measures. We are currently conducting follow-up investigation and/or remediation activities at those locations where we have known environmental concerns. We have cleaned up a majority of the sites with known historical contamination and are addressing the remaining identified issues. 

Over the years, we have been involved as one of many potentially responsible parties ("PRP") at former public waste disposal sites that are or were subject to investigation and remediation. We are currently involved as a PRP at five &#32;Superfund sites. The sites are in various stages of evaluation by government authorities. Our total projected "fair share" cost allocation at these five &#32;sites is expected to be immaterial. See "Item 3. Legal Proceedings" included in this Annual Report for more information. 

We have established reserves that we currently believe to be adequate to cover our currently identified on-site and off-site environmental liabilities. 

Exports 

Our export sales from the U.S. to foreign unaffiliated customers were $295.6 million in 2015 , $338.5 million in 2014 &#32;and $355.7 million in 2013 . 

Licenses are required from U.S. and other government agencies to export certain products. In particular, products with nuclear power generation and/or military applications are restricted, as are certain other pump, valve and seal products. 

BUSINESS SEGMENTS 

In addition to the business segment information presented below, Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report contains additional financial information about our business segments and geographic areas in which we have conducted business in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . 

ENGINEERED PRODUCT DIVISION 

&#32;7 

Our largest business segment is EPD, through which we design, manufacture, distribute and service custom and other highly-engineered pumps and pump systems, mechanical seals, auxiliary systems, replacement parts and related equipment. The business consists of long lead time, highly-engineered, custom-configured products, which require extensive test requirements and superior project management skills, as well as aftermarket services supporting global infrastructure industries. EPD products and services are primarily used by companies that operate in the oil and gas, power generation, chemical, water management and general industries. We market our pump and mechanical seal products through our global sales force and our regional QRCs and service and repair centers or through independent distributors and sales representatives. A portion of our mechanical seal products are sold directly to original equipment manufacturers for incorporation into rotating equipment requiring mechanical seals. 

Our pump products are manufactured in a wide range of metal alloys and with a variety of configurations to meet the critical operating demands of our customers. Mechanical seals are critical to the reliable operation of rotating equipment in that they prevent leakage and emissions of hazardous substances from the rotating equipment and reduce shaft wear on the equipment caused by the use of non-mechanical seals. We also manufacture a gas-lubricated mechanical seal that is used in high-speed compressors for gas pipelines and in the oil and gas production and process markets. Our products are currently manufactured at 33 &#32;plants worldwide, 10 &#32;of which are located in Europe, 11 &#32;in North America, seven &#32;in Asia Pacific and five &#32;in Latin America. 

We also conduct business through strategic foreign joint ventures. We have six unconsolidated joint ventures that are located in China, India, Japan, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates, where a portion of our products are manufactured, assembled or serviced in these territories. These relationships provide numerous strategic opportunities, including increased access to our current and new markets, access to additional manufacturing capacity and expansion of our operational platform to support low-cost sourcing initiatives and capacity demands for other markets. 

EPD Products 

We manufacture more than 40 &#32;different active types of pumps and approximately 185 &#32;different models of mechanical seals and sealing systems. The following is a summary list of our EPD products and globally recognized brands:

EPD New Product Development 

Our investments in new product R&#38;D continue to focus on increasing the capability of our products as customer applications become more advanced, demanding greater levels of production (i.e., flow, power and pressure) and under more extreme conditions beyond the level of traditional technology. We continue to develop innovations that improve product performance and our competitive position in the engineered equipment industry, specifically targeting pipeline, offshore and downstream applications for the oil and gas market. The emergence of extreme pressure applications prompted the development of an advanced stage design and construction of high pressure test capability necessary to validate the technology prior to introduction into the market. 

As new sources of energy generation are explored, we have been developing new product designs to support the most critical applications in the power generation market. New designs and qualification test programs continue to support the critical services found in the modern nuclear power generation plant. In addition to nuclear pump product development, we have focused development efforts on an advanced seal design required to accommodate upset conditions recently identified by the nuclear industry. Continued engagement with our end users is exemplified through completion of advancements in coke cutting technology, nozzle design and auxiliary equipment improvements, as well as creation of an automated cutting system to improve operator safety. 

We continue to address our core products with design enhancements to improve performance and the speed at which we can deliver our products. Application of advanced computational fluid dynamics methods utilizing unsteady flow analysis led to the development of an advanced inlet chamber and impeller vane design for high energy injection water pumps. Our engineering teams continue to apply and develop sophisticated design technology and methods supporting continuous improvement of our proven technology. Additionally, we are incentivizing our operations and tracking the R&#38;D projects more closely, which is leading to broader engagement in developing new products. 

In 2015 , EPD continued to advance our Technology Advantage platform through the Integrated Solutions Organization ("ISO"). This platform utilizes a combination of our developed technologies and leading edge technology partners to increase our asset management and service capabilities for our end-user customers. These technologies include intelligent devices, advanced communication and security protocols, wireless and satellite communications and web-enabled data convergence. Additionally, we have been exploring the "additive manufacturing" opportunities in our products and auxiliary systems.
