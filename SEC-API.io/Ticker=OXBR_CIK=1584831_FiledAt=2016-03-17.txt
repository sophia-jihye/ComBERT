 I TEM 1 &#160; BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are a Cayman Islands exempted company that was organized in April 2013 to provide reinsurance business solutions primarily to property and casualty insurers in the Gulf Coast region of the United States. Through our licensed reinsurance subsidiary, Oxbridge Reinsurance Limited, we write fully collateralized policies to cover property losses from specified catastrophes. We specialize in underwriting medium frequency, high severity risks, where we believe sufficient data exists to analyze effectively the risk/return profile of reinsurance contracts. 

&#160; 

Our company was formed by investors with significant experience in the U.S. property and casualty insurance market who saw an opportunity to provide more competitive reinsurance products to property and casualty insurance providers in the Gulf Coast region. Oxbridge Reinsurance Limited was approved by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority as a licensed Class C insurance company under Cayman Islands law in April 2013. In June 2013, we completed a private placement in the amount of $6.7 million and in April 2014, we completed our initial public offering, raising approximately $26.9 million. Our core business is focused on the provision of property catastrophe reinsurance coverage to a broad range of select insurance companies and other reinsurers. We entered into our initial reinsurance contracts with Claddaugh Casualty Insurance Company, Ltd. (&#8220;Claddaugh&#8221;), a captive reinsurance company and a subsidiary of HCI Group, a Florida-based, publicly traded holding company (&#8220;HCI Group&#8221;), following our private placement in June 2013. We have since entered into additional reinsurance contracts with a number of third-party insurers and reinsurers.

&#160; 

We underwrite reinsurance contracts on a selective and opportunistic basis as opportunities arise based on our goal of achieving favorable long-term returns on equity for our shareholders. Our goal is to achieve long-term growth in book value per share by writing business that generates attractive underwriting profits relative to the risk we bear. Unlike other insurance and reinsurance companies, we do not intend to pursue an aggressive investment strategy and instead will focus our business on underwriting profits rather than investment profits. However, we intend to complement our underwriting profits with investment profits on an opportunistic basis. Our primary business focus is on fully collateralized reinsurance contracts for property catastrophes, primarily in the Gulf Coast region of the United States, with an emphasis on Florida. Within that market and risk category, we attempt to select the most economically attractive opportunities across a variety of property and casualty insurers. As our capital base grows, however, we expect that we will consider further growth opportunities in other geographic areas and risk categories. 

&#160; 

Our Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Our goal is to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders through the prudent management of underwriting risks relative to our capital base. To achieve this objective, the following are the principal elements of our business strategy. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Maintain a Commitment to Disciplined Underwriting. We employ a disciplined and data-driven underwriting approach to select a diversified portfolio of risks that we believe will generate an attractive return to our shareholders over the long term. Neither our underwriting nor our investment strategies are designed to generate smooth or predictable quarterly earnings, but rather to optimize growth in book value per share over the long term. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Focus on Risk Management. We treat risk management as an integral part of our underwriting and business management processes. All of our reinsurance contracts contain loss limitation provisions that limit our losses to the value of the assets collateralizing our reinsurance contracts. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Partial Deployment of Capital. &#160; In order to eliminate the possibility of complete losses, we intend to place only a portion of our total capital at risk in any single year. This means that we expect lower returns than some of our competitors in years where there are lower than average catastrophe losses but that our capital will be better protected in the event of large losses. We are committed to maintaining our capitalization and financial strength over the long term and to developing a history of paying a consistent dividend on our ordinary shares. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Take Advantage of Market Opportunities. Although our business is initially focused on catastrophe coverage for Gulf Coast insurers with an emphasis on Florida, we intend to continuously evaluate various market opportunities in which our business may be strategically or financially expanded or enhanced in the future. Such opportunities could take the form of further diversifying our business into other geographic or market areas, could include quota share reinsurance contracts, joint ventures, renewal rights transactions, corporate acquisitions of other insurers or reinsurers, or the formation of insurance or reinsurance platforms in new markets. We believe the environment in the reinsurance and insurance markets will continue to produce opportunities for us, either through organic expansion, through acquisitions, or a combination of both.

The Reinsurance Industry 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Reinsurance is an arrangement in which an insurance company, referred to as the reinsurer, agrees to assume from another insurance company, referred to as the ceding company or cedant, all or a portion of the insurance risks that the ceding company has underwritten under one or more insurance contracts. In return, the reinsurer receives a premium for the insured risks that it assumes from the ceding company, although reinsurance does not discharge the ceding company from its liabilities to policyholders. It is standard industry practice for primary insurers to reinsure portions of their insurance risks with other insurance companies under reinsurance agreements or contracts. This permits primary insurers to underwrite policies in amounts larger than the risks they are willing to retain. Reinsurance is generally designed to: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Reduce the ceding company&#8217;s net liability on individual risks, thereby assisting it in managing its risk profile and increasing its capacity to underwrite business as well as increasing the limit to which it can underwrite on a single risk; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

assist the ceding company in meeting applicable regulatory and rating agency capital requirements; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

assist the ceding company in reducing the short-term financial impact of sales and other acquisition costs; and 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

enhance the ceding company&#8217;s financial strength and statutory capital. 

&#160; 

When reinsurance companies purchase reinsurance to cover their own risks assumed from ceding companies, this is known as retrocessional reinsurance. Reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance can benefit a ceding company or reinsuring company, referred to herein as a &#8220;retrocedant,&#8221; as applicable, in various ways, such as by reducing exposure to individual risks and by providing catastrophe protection from larger or multiple losses. Like ceding companies, retrocedants can use retrocessional reinsurance to manage their overall risk profile or to create additional underwriting capacity, allowing them to accept larger risks or to write more business than would otherwise be possible, absent an increase in their capital or surplus . 

&#160; 

Reinsurance contracts do not discharge ceding companies from their obligations to policyholders. Ceding companies therefore generally require their reinsurers to have, and to maintain, either a strong financial strength rating or security, in the form of collateral, as assurance that their claims will be paid. 

&#160; 

Insurers generally purchase multiple tranches of reinsurance protection above an initial retention elected by the insurer. The amount of reinsurance protection purchased by an insurer is typically determined by the insurer through both quantitative and qualitative methods. In the event of losses, the amount of loss that exceeds the amount of reinsurance protection purchased is retained by the insurer. As a program is constructed from the ground up, each tranche added generally has a lower probability of loss than the prior tranche and therefore is generally subject to a lower reinsurance premium charged for the reinsurance protection purchased. Insurer catastrophe programs are typically supported by multiple reinsurers per program. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Reinsurance brokers play an important role in the reinsurance market. Brokers are intermediaries that assist the ceding company in structuring a particular reinsurance program and in negotiating and placing risks with third-party reinsurers. In this capacity, the broker is selected and retained by the ceding company on a contract-by-contract basis, rather than by the reinsurer. Though brokers are not parties to reinsurance contracts, reinsurers generally receive premium payments from brokers rather than ceding companies, and reinsurers that do not provide collateralized reinsurance are frequently required to pay amounts owed on claims under their policies to brokers. These brokers, in turn, pay these amounts to the ceding companies that have reinsured a portion of their liabilities with reinsurers. 

&#160; 

Types of Reinsurance Contracts 

&#160; 

Property reinsurance products are often written in the form of treaty reinsurance contracts, which are contractual arrangements that provide for the automatic reinsurance of a type or category of risk underwritten. Treaty reinsurance premiums, which are typically due in installments, are a function of the number and type of contracts written, as well as prevailing market prices. The timing of premiums written varies by line of business. The majority of property catastrophe business is written at the January and June annual renewal periods, depending on the type and location of the risks covered. Most hurricane and wind-storm coverage, particularly in the Gulf Coast region of the United States, is written at the June annual renewal periods. 

&#160; 

Property catastrophe reinsurance contracts are typically &#8220;all risk&#8221; in nature, providing protection to the ceding company against losses from hurricanes and other natural and man-made catastrophes such as floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, storms and fires, referred to herein collectively as &#8220;perils.&#8221; The predominant exposures covered by these contracts are losses stemming from property damage and business interruption resulting from a covered peril. Coverage can also vary from &#8220;all natural&#8221; perils, which is the most expansive form, to more limited types such as windstorm-only coverage. 

&#160; 

Property catastrophe reinsurance contracts are typically written on an &#8220;excess-of-loss&#8221; basis, which provides coverage to the ceding company when aggregate claims and claim expenses from a single occurrence for a covered peril exceed an amount that is specified in a particular contract. The coverage provided under excess-of-loss reinsurance contracts may be on a worldwide basis or may be limited in scope to specific regions or geographical areas. Under these contracts, protection is provided to an insurer for a portion of the total losses in excess of a specified loss amount, up to a maximum amount per loss specified in the contract. 

&#160; 

Excess-of-loss contracts are typically written on a losses-occurring basis, which means that they cover losses that occur during the contract term, regardless of when the underlying policies came into force. Premiums from excess-of-loss contracts are earned ratably over the contract term, which is ordinarily 12 months. Most excess-of-loss contracts provide for a reinstatement of coverage following a covered loss event in return for an additional premium. 

&#160; 

The Florida Property and Casualty Insurance Market 

&#160; 

General Overview 

&#160; 

Florida&#8217;s property and casualty insurance market has undergone significant changes in the past few decades. This market, which was formerly dominated by large, national, multi-line insurance companies, now includes: (i) Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (&#8220;Citizens&#8221;), a state-sponsored insurance company created by the Florida Legislature; (ii) Florida-based insurance companies that focus primarily on writing property insurance policies in the state of Florida; and (iii) Florida-based subsidiaries of national insurance companies that focus on writing property insurance policies in the state of Florida. While these three types of insurance companies participate in the market at varying levels, Citizens and the Florida-based insurance companies are now the dominant market participants. Within the private market, which excludes Citizens, there is an emerging prominence of small insurance companies, which have limited capitalization and a limited ability to diversify. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

According to The State of Florida&#8217;s Property Insurance Market 2nd Annual Report Released in January 2013 for the Florida Legislature by The Florida Catastrophic Storm Risk Management Center (the &#8220;Report&#8221;), the shift from a market dominated by large, national, multi-line insurance companies to a market dominated by Citizens and the smaller, Florida-based insurance companies has resulted in an increased reliance on the global reinsurance market for diversification and capital. For the smaller, Florida-based insurance companies, reinsurance companies serve as the primary means of accessing broader capital markets. 

&#160; 

Catastrophic Events 

&#160; 

While the Florida property and casualty insurance market faces various challenges, the primary challenge is the potential for exposure to catastrophic windstorms. According to the Report, the state of Florida has: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

more than $1.8 trillion in insured residential property exposure; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

more than $4 billion in expected average annual losses due to windstorms (with respect to residential and commercial residential properties only); and 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

nearly $60 billion in 1-in-100 probable maximum losses due to windstorms (with respect to residential and commercial residential properties only). 

&#160; 

According to Technical Memorandum NWS NHC-6, entitled &#8220;The Deadliest, Costliest, and Most Intense United States Tropical Cyclones from 1851 to 2010 (and Other Frequently Requested Hurricane Facts)&#8221; (the &#8220;NOAA Memorandum&#8221;) published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (the &#8220;NOAA&#8221;), &#8220;[f]orty percent of all U.S. hurricanes and major hurricanes were in Florida,&#8221; and &#8220;[s]ixty percent of category 4 or higher hurricane strikes have occurred in either Florida or Texas.&#8221; The NOAA Memorandum also indicates that, between 1851 and 2010, there were 114 hurricane strikes and 37 major hurricanes in Florida. For these purposes, a &#8220;major hurricane&#8221; is a category 3, 4, or 5 hurricane. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

For information regarding risks faced by our company due to weather-related incidents, see the risk factor on page [18] entitled &#8220; Our property and property catastrophe reinsurance operations will make us vulnerable to losses from catastrophes and may cause our results of operations to vary significantly from period to period .&#8221; 

&#160; 

Our Reinsurance Contracts and Products 

&#160; 

We write primarily property, property catastrophe, and short-tail specialty and casualty reinsurance. We currently expect that substantially all of the reinsurance products we write in the foreseeable future will be in the form of treaty reinsurance contracts. When we write treaty reinsurance contracts, we do not evaluate separately each of the individual risks assumed under the contracts and are therefore largely dependent on the individual underwriting decisions made by the cedant. Accordingly, as part of our initial review and renewal process, we carefully review and analyze the cedant&#8217;s risk management and underwriting practices in evaluating whether to provide treaty reinsurance and in appropriately pricing the treaty. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Tablle of Contents 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our contracts are written on an excess-of-loss basis, generally with a per-event cap. We generally receive the premium for the risk assumed and indemnify the cedant against all or a specified portion of losses and expenses in excess of a specified dollar or percentage amount. Our contracts are generally both single-year or multi-year contracts and our policy years generally commence on June 1 of each year and end on May 31 of the following year. 

&#160; 

The bulk of our portfolio of risks is assumed pursuant to traditional reinsurance contracts. However, we may also from time to time take underwriting risk by purchasing a catastrophe-linked bond, or via a transaction booked as an industry loss warranty (as described below) or an indemnity swap. An indemnity swap is an agreement which provides for the exchange between two parties of different portfolios of catastrophe exposure with similar expected loss characteristics (for example, U.S. earthquake exposure for Asian earthquake exposure). 

&#160; 

We believe our most attractive near-term opportunity is in property catastrophe reinsurance coverage for insurance companies. In addition to seeking profitable pricing, we manage our risks with contractual limits on our exposure. Property catastrophe reinsurance contracts are typically &#8220;all risk&#8221; in nature, meaning that they protect against losses from earthquakes and hurricanes, as well as other natural and man-made catastrophes such as tornados, fires, winter storms, and floods (where the contract specifically provides for such coverage). Losses on these contracts typically stem from direct property damage and business interruption. We generally write property catastrophe reinsurance on an excess-of-loss basis. These contracts typically cover only specific regions or geographical areas. 

&#160; 

We are not licensed or admitted as an insurer in any jurisdiction other than the Cayman Islands. In addition, we do not have a financial rating and do not expect to have one in the near future. Many jurisdictions such as the United States do not permit clients to take credit for reinsurance on their statutory financial statements if such reinsurance is obtained from unlicensed or non-admitted insurers without appropriate collateral. As a result, we anticipate that all of our clients will require us to fully collateralize the reinsurance contracts we bind with them. Each of our contracts are fully collateralized and separately structured, with our liability being limited to the value of the assets held in the trust. We are generally not required to top-up the value of the assets held as collateral in respect of a particular reinsurance agreement, unless such collateral is subject to market risk. For each reinsurance agreement, a reinsurance trust is established in favor of the cedant, and the trustee of the reinsurance trust is a large bank that is agreed upon by our company and the cedant. The premium for the contract is ordinarily deposited into the trust, together with additional capital from our company, up to the coverage limit. Each reinsurance contract contains express limited recourse language to the effect that the liabilities of the relevant reinsurance contract are limited to the realizable value of the collateral held in respect of that contract. Upon the expiration of the reinsurance contract, the assets of the trust net of insured losses and other expenses are transferred to our company. 

&#160; 

Underwriting and Retrocessional Coverage 

&#160; 

Most of our reinsurance contracts have other reinsurers participating as lead underwriters, and these lead underwriters generally set the premium for the risk. We follow the premium pricing of the lead underwriters in most cases subject to the guidance of the Underwriting Committee of our Board of Directors. Each quarter, our Board of Directors will set parameters for the maximum level of capital to be deployed for the quarter and the expected premium and risk profile that each of our contracts must meet. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Tablle of Contents 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We have not yet and have no current plans to purchase retrocessional coverage. We may, however, decide to do so in the future to manage our overall exposure and to balance our portfolio and, if we do, we expect that we will only purchase uncollateralized retrocessional coverage from a reinsurer with a minimum financial strength rating of A- from either A.M. Best or Standard &#38; Poors. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Distribution 

&#160; 

We expect that, in the future, the majority of our business will be sourced through reinsurance brokers. Brokerage distribution channels provide us with access to an efficient, variable distribution system without the significant time and expense that would be incurred in creating an in-house marketing and distribution network. Reinsurance brokers receive a brokerage commission that is usually a percentage of gross premiums written. 

&#160; 

We intend to build relationships with global reinsurance brokers and captive insurance companies located in the Cayman Islands. Our management team has significant relationships with most of the primary and specialty broker intermediaries in the reinsurance marketplace in our target market. We believe that maintaining close relationships with brokers will give us access to a broad range of reinsurance clients and opportunities. 

&#160; 

Brokers do not have the authority to bind us to any reinsurance contract. We review and approve all contract submissions in our corporate offices located in the Cayman Islands. From time to time, we may also enter into relationships with managing general agents who could bind us to reinsurance contracts based on narrowly defined underwriting guidelines. 

&#160; 

Investment Strategy 

&#160; 

Our company&#8217;s business focus is primarily on underwriting profit. However, we remain opportunistic with respect to investment income, and intend to increase shareholder value through supplemental investment income when favorable opportunities are available. Most of our company&#8217;s capital is held in trust accounts that collateralize the reinsurance policies that we write. The investment parameters for capital held in such trust accounts is generally established by the cedant for the relevant policy. Our investments are held in cash, fixed-maturity securities and equity securities. 

&#160; 

Funds that are not held in collateralized trust accounts are generally invested in a relatively conservative manner, with a focus on generating income while equally being liquid. 

&#160; 

Our Board of Directors periodically reviews our investment policy and returns. 

&#160; 

Claims Management 

&#160; 

We have not paid any claims as of March 5, 2016. We anticipate that, for the foreseeable future, we will enter into only a limited number of reinsurance contracts and that, therefore, claims, if any, will be handled on a case-by-case basis. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Tablle of Contents 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Loss Reserves 

&#160; 

Loss reserves represent estimates, including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time, of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of claims incurred (including claims incurred but not reported (IBNR)). Estimates are not precise in that, among other things, they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency and other variable factors such as inflation. It is likely that the ultimate liability will be greater or less than such estimates and that, at times, this variance will be material. 

&#160; 

For our property and other catastrophe policies, we initially establish our loss reserves based on loss payments and case reserves reported by ceding companies. As we are not the only reinsurer on a contract, the lead reinsurer will set the loss amount estimates for the contract and the cedant will have the ability to pay for case losses consistent with that amount on our pro-rata share of the contract. 

&#160; 

We then add to these case reserves our estimates for IBNR. To establish our IBNR estimates, in addition to the loss information and estimates communicated by cedants, we also use industry information, knowledge of the business written by us, management&#8217;s judgment and general market trends observed from our underwriting activities. We may also use our computer-based vendor and proprietary modeling systems to measure and estimate loss exposure under the actual event scenario, if available. Although the loss modeling systems assist with the analysis of the underlying loss, and provide us with information and the ability to perform an enhanced analysis, the estimation of claims resulting from catastrophic events is inherently difficult because of the variability and uncertainty of property catastrophe claims and the unique characteristics of each loss. 

&#160; 

If IBNR estimates are made, we assess the validity of the assumptions we use in the reserving process on a quarterly basis during an internal review process. During this process actuaries verify that the assumptions we have made continue to form what they consider to be a sound basis for projection of future liabilities. 

&#160; 

Although we believe that we are prudent in our assumptions and methodologies, we cannot be certain that our ultimate payments will not vary, perhaps materially, from the estimates we have made. If we determine that adjustments to an earlier estimate are appropriate, such adjustments are recorded in the quarter in which they are identified. The establishment of new reserves, or the adjustment of reserves for reported claims, could result in significant upward or downward changes to our financial condition or results of operations in any particular period. We regularly review and update these estimates, using the most current information available to us. 

&#160; 

Our estimates, if any, are reviewed annually by an independent actuary in order to provide additional insight into the reasonableness of our loss reserves. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The reinsurance industry is highly competitive. We expect to compete with major reinsurers, most of which are well established with significant operating histories, strong financial strength ratings, long-standing client relationships. 

&#160; 

Our competitors include Third Point Reinsurance Ltd., Blue Capital Reinsurance Holdings Ltd., ACE Ltd., Everest Re, General Re Corporation, Hannover Re Group, Munich Reinsurance Company, Partner Re Ltd., Swiss Reinsurance Company, Transatlantic Reinsurance Company, Berkshire Hathaway, PartnerRe Ltd, Aeolus, and Nephila, as well as smaller companies and other niche reinsurers. Although we seek to provide coverage where capacity and alternatives are limited, we directly compete with these larger companies due to the breadth of their coverage across the property and casualty market in substantially all lines of business. We also compete with smaller companies and other niche reinsurers from time to time. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Tablle of Contents 

&#160; 

&#160; 

While we have a limited operating history, we believe that our unique approach to multi-year underwriting will allow us to be successful in underwriting transactions against more established competitors. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of March 5, 2016, we had two employees, both of whom were full time employees. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements, and we are not aware of any current efforts to implement such agreements. We believe that we will continue to have relatively few employees and intend to outsource some functions to specialist firms in the Cayman Islands if and when we determine that such functions are necessary. We intend to use the expertise of our Board of Directors and where necessary, external consultants to provide any other service we may require from time to time. 

&#160; 

Legal Proceedings 

&#160; 

We are not currently involved in any litigation or arbitration. We anticipate that, similar to the rest of the insurance and reinsurance industry, we will be subject to litigation and arbitration in the ordinary course of business. 

&#160; 

Regulation and Capital Requirements 

&#160; 

Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Oxbridge Reinsurance Limited, holds a Class C Insurer&#8217;s License issued in accordance with the terms of the Insurance Law (as revised) of the Cayman Islands (the &#8220;Law&#8221;), and is subject to regulation by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (&#8220;CIMA&#8221;), in terms of the Law. As the holder of a Class C Insurer&#8217;s License, Oxbridge Reinsurance Limited is permitted to undertake insurance business approved by CIMA. 

&#160; 

Oxbridge Reinsurance Limited is subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements, and our failure to meet these requirements could subject us to regulatory action. Pursuant to The Insurance (Capital and Solvency) (Classes B, C and D Insurers) Regulations, 2012 (the &#8220;Capital and Solvency Regulations&#8221;) published under the Law, Oxbridge Reinsurance Limited is required to maintain the statutory minimum capital requirement (as defined under the Capital and Solvency Regulations) of $500 and prescribed capital requirement (as defined under the Capital and Solvency Regulations) of $500, and a minimum margin of solvency equal to or in excess of the total prescribed capital requirement. Any failure to meet the applicable requirements or minimum statutory capital requirements could subject us to further examination or corrective action by CIMA, including restrictions on dividend payments, limitations on our writing of additional business or engaging in finance activities, supervision or liquidation. 

&#160; 

CIMA may at any time direct Oxbridge Reinsurance Limited, in relation to a policy, a line of business or the entire business, to cease or refrain from committing an act or pursing a course of conduct and to perform such acts as in the opinion of CIMA are necessary to remedy or ameliorate the situation. See the discussion in &#8220; Risk Factors &#8221; under the heading &#8220; Any suspension or revocation of our reinsurance license would materially impact our ability to do business and implement our business strategy&#8221; for more information.
