 Item 1. BUSINESS 

Helmerich &#38; Payne, Inc. (which together with its subsidiaries is identified as the "Company", "we", "us" or "our," except where stated or the context requires otherwise), was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on February 3, 1940, and is successor to a business originally organized in 1920. We are primarily engaged in contract drilling of oil and gas wells for others and this business accounts for almost all of our operating revenues. 

Our contract drilling business is composed of three reportable business segments: U.S. Land, Offshore and International Land. During fiscal 2016, our U.S. Land operations drilled primarily in Oklahoma, California, Texas, Wyoming, Colorado, Louisiana, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Mexico and North Dakota. Offshore operations were conducted in the Gulf of Mexico and Equatorial Guinea. Our International Land segment conducted drilling operations in five international locations during fiscal 2016: Ecuador, Colombia, Argentina, Bahrain and United Arab Emirates ("UAE"). 

We are also engaged in the ownership, development and operation of commercial real estate and the research and development of rotary steerable technology. Our real estate investments located exclusively within Tulsa, Oklahoma, include a shopping center containing approximately 441,000 leasable square feet, multi-tenant industrial warehouse properties containing approximately one million leasable square feet and approximately 210 acres of undeveloped real estate. Since 2008, our subsidiary, TerraVici Drilling Solutions, Inc., has pursued the development of patented rotary steerable technology as a means to enhance our horizontal and directional drilling services. We expect to continue research and development of this and other technology in 2017. Each of the businesses operates independently of the others through wholly-owned subsidiaries. This operating decentralization is balanced by centralized finance and legal organizations. 

CONTRACT DRILLING 

General 

We believe that we are one of the major land and offshore platform drilling contractors in the western hemisphere. Operating principally in North and South America, we specialize in shallow to deep drilling in oil and gas producing basins of the United States and in drilling for oil and gas in international locations. In the United States, we draw our customers primarily from the major oil companies and the larger independent oil companies. In South America, our current customers include major international and national oil companies. 

In fiscal 2016, we received approximately 68 percent of our consolidated operating revenues from our ten largest contract drilling customers. Occidental Oil and Gas Corporation, Continental Resources and Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales (respectively, "Oxy", "Continental" and "YPF"), including their affiliates, are our three largest contract drilling customers. We perform drilling services for Oxy on a world-wide basis, Continental in U.S. land operations and YPF in Argentina. Revenues from drilling services performed for Oxy, Continental and YPF in fiscal 2016 accounted for approximately 30 percent, 18 percent and 15 percent, respectively, of our consolidated operating revenues for the same period. 

Rigs, Equipment, R&#38;D, Facilities, and Environmental Compliance 

We provide drilling rigs, equipment, personnel and camps on a contract basis. These services are provided so that our customers may explore for and develop oil and gas from onshore areas and from fixed platforms, tension-leg platforms and spars in offshore areas. Each of the drilling rigs consists of engines, drawworks, a mast, pumps, blowout preventers, a drill string and related equipment. The intended well depth and the drilling site conditions are the principal factors that determine the size and 

type of rig most suitable for a particular drilling job. A land drilling rig may be moved from location to location without modification to the rig. A platform rig is specifically designed to perform drilling operations upon a particular platform. While a platform rig may be moved from its original platform, significant expense is incurred to modify a platform rig for operation on each subsequent platform. In addition to traditional platform rigs, we operate self-moving platform drilling rigs and drilling rigs to be used on tension-leg platforms and spars. The self-moving rig is designed to be moved without the use of expensive derrick barges. The tension-leg platforms and spars allow drilling operations to be conducted in much deeper water than traditional fixed platforms. 

Mechanical rigs rely on belts, pulleys and other mechanical devices to control drilling speed and other rig processes. As such, mechanical rigs are not highly efficient or precise in their operation. In contrast to mechanical rigs, SCR rigs rely on direct current for power. This enables motor speed to be controlled by changing electrical voltage. Compared to mechanical rigs, SCR rigs operate with greater efficiency, more power and better control. AC rigs provide for even greater efficiency and flexibility than what can be achieved with mechanical or SCR rigs. AC rigs use a variable frequency drive that allows motor speed to be manipulated via changes to electrical frequency. The variable frequency drive permits greater control of motor speed for more precision. Among other attributes, AC rigs are electrically more efficient, produce more torque, utilize regenerative braking, have digital controls and AC motors require less maintenance. 

During the mid-1990's, we undertook an initiative to use our land and offshore platform drilling experience to develop a new generation of drilling rigs that would be safer, faster-moving and more capable than mechanical rigs. In 1998, we put to work a new generation of highly mobile/depth flexible land drilling rigs (individually the "FlexRig&#174;"). Since the introduction of our FlexRigs, we have focused on designing and building high-performance, high-efficiency rigs to be used exclusively in our contract drilling business. We believed that over time FlexRigs would displace older less capable rigs. With the advent of unconventional shale plays, our AC drive FlexRigs have proven to be particularly well suited for more complex horizontal drilling requirements. The FlexRig has been able to significantly reduce average rig move and drilling times compared to similar depth-rated traditional land rigs. In addition, the FlexRig allows greater depth flexibility and provides greater operating efficiency. The original rigs were designated as FlexRig1 and FlexRig2 rigs and were designed to drill wells with a depth of between 8,000 and 18,000 feet. In 2001, we announced that we would build the next generation of FlexRigs, known as "FlexRig3", which incorporated new drilling technology and new environmental and safety design. This new design included integrated top drive, AC electric drive, hydraulic BOP handling system, hydraulic tubular make-up and break-out system, split crown and traveling blocks and an enlarged drill floor that enables simultaneous crew activities. FlexRig3s are designed to target well depths of between 8,000 and 22,000 feet. 

In 2006, we placed into service our first FlexRig4. While FlexRig4s are similar to our FlexRig3s, the FlexRig4s are designed to efficiently drill more shallow depth wells of between 4,000 and 18,000 feet. The FlexRig4 design includes a trailerized version and a skidding version, which incorporate additional environmental and safety designs. This design permits the installation of a pipe handling system which allows the rig to be more efficiently operated and eliminates the need for a casing stabber in the mast. While the FlexRig4 trailerized version provides for more efficient well site to well site rig moves, the skidding version allows for drilling of up to 22 wells from a single pad which results in reduced environmental impact. In 2011, we announced the introduction of the FlexRig5 design. The FlexRig5 is suited for long lateral drilling of multiple wells from a single location, which is well suited for unconventional shale reservoirs. The new design preserves the key performance features of FlexRig3 combined with a bi-directional pad drilling system and equipment capacities suitable for wells in excess of 25,000 feet of measured depth. 

Industry trends toward more complex drilling have accelerated the retirement of less capable mechanical rigs. Over time our mechanical rigs have been sold or decommissioned as we added new 

AC drive rigs to our fleet. The decommission of our remaining seven mechanical rigs in fiscal 2011 marked the end of a multi-year evolution in the high-grading of our fleet from mechanical rigs to high-efficiency, high-performance rigs. In fiscal 2015, we also decommissioned 23 of our 37 remaining SCR rigs including six of the eight 3,000 horsepower conventional rigs in our U.S. Land fleet, all six of our FlexRig1 SCR rigs and all 11 of our FlexRig2 SCR rigs. In fiscal 2016, we did not decommission any of our remaining 14 SCR rigs. 

Since 1998, we have built 232 FlexRig3s, 88 FlexRig4s, and 52 FlexRig5s with 367 of those delivered to the field. Of the total 372 AC drive FlexRigs built through September 30, 2016, 157 have been built in the last five fiscal years. As of November 17, 2016, there was one additional FlexRig under construction. Additionally, five previously completed FlexRigs are scheduled for delivery to the field at a later date per the request of certain customers. 

The effective use of technology is important to the maintenance of our competitive position within the drilling industry. We expect to continue to focus on new technology solutions and applications in the future. Our research and development expense totaled $10.3 million in fiscal 2016, $16.1 million in fiscal 2015, and $15.9 million in fiscal 2014. 

We currently have three facilities that provide vertically integrated solutions for drilling rig fabrication, upgrades, retrofits and modifications, as well as overhauling and repairing of drilling rigs, equipment and associated component parts. We have a gulf coast fabrication and assembly facility near Houston, Texas as well as a 123,000 square foot fabrication facility located on approximately 11 acres near Tulsa, Oklahoma. Additionally, we lease a 150,000 square foot industrial facility near Tulsa, Oklahoma. 

Our business is subject to various federal, state and local laws enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. We do not anticipate that compliance with currently applicable environmental regulations and controls will significantly change our competitive position, capital spending or earnings during fiscal 2017. For further information on environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations, see Item 1A&#151;"Risk Factors". 

Industry / Competitive Conditions 

Our business largely depends on the level of capital spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Sustained increases or decreases in the price of oil and natural gas generally have a material impact on the exploration, development and production activities of our customers. As such, significant declines in the price of oil and natural gas may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Oil prices have declined significantly since 2014 when prices exceeded $100 per barrel. While oil prices have rebounded modestly from lows observed in early 2016, the decline in prices continued to negatively affect demand for services in fiscal 2016. Specifically, at the close of fiscal 2016 we had 118 contracted rigs, compared to 168 contracted rigs at the close of fiscal 2015 and 325 contracted rigs at the close of fiscal 2014. In addition, and in light of the price of oil and the status of the drilling industry and our rig fleet, in fiscal 2015 we performed an impairment evaluation of all our long-lived drilling assets in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment . Our evaluation resulted in $39.2 million of impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of seven SCR land rigs within our International Land segment to their estimated fair value. Similarly, during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 we recorded a $6.3 million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of certain rig and rig related equipment classified as held for sale in our U.S. Land segment to their estimated fair values. While we continue to periodically perform impairment evaluations, no additional impairments were identified in fiscal 2016 for any rigs in our domestic, international or offshore fleets. For further information concerning risks associated with our business, including volatility surrounding oil and natural gas prices and the impact of low oil prices 

on our business, see Item 1A&#151;"Risk Factors" and Item 7&#151;"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in this Form 10-K. 

Our industry is highly competitive. The land drilling market is generally more competitive than the offshore market due to the larger number of drilling rigs and market participants. While we strive to differentiate our services based upon the quality of our FlexRigs and our engineering design expertise, operational efficiency, safety and environmental awareness, the number of available rigs generally exceeds demand in many of our markets, resulting in strong price competition. In all of our geographic markets the ability to deliver rigs with new technology and features is also a significant factor in determining which drilling contractor is awarded a job. In recent years, rigs equipped with moving systems and configured to accommodate drilling of multiple wells on a single site have offered a competitive advantage. Other factors include quality of service and safety record, the availability and condition of equipment, the availability of trained personnel possessing specialized skills, experience in operating in certain environments, and relationships with customers. 

We compete against many drilling companies and certain competitors are present in more than one of our operating regions. In the United States, we compete with Nabors Industries Ltd., Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. and many other competitors with regional operations. Internationally, we compete directly with various contractors at each location where we operate. In the Gulf of Mexico platform rig market, we primarily compete with Nabors Industries Ltd. and Blake International Rigs, LLC. 

Drilling Contracts 

Our drilling contracts are obtained through competitive bidding or as a result of negotiations with customers, and often cover multi-well and multi-year projects. Each drilling rig operates under a separate drilling contract. During fiscal 2016, all drilling services were performed on a "daywork" contract basis, under which we charge a fixed rate per day, with the price determined by the location, depth and complexity of the well to be drilled, operating conditions, the duration of the contract, and the competitive forces of the market. We have previously performed contracts on a combination "footage" and "daywork" basis, under which we charged a fixed rate per foot of hole drilled to a stated depth, usually no deeper than 15,000 feet, and a fixed rate per day for the remainder of the hole. Contracts performed on a "footage" basis involve a greater element of risk to the contractor than do contracts performed on a "daywork" basis. Also, we have previously accepted "turnkey" contracts under which we charge a fixed sum to deliver a hole to a stated depth and agree to furnish services such as testing, coring and casing the hole which are not normally done on a "footage" basis. "Turnkey" contracts entail varying degrees of risk greater than the usual "footage" contract. We have not accepted any "footage" or "turnkey" contracts in over fifteen years. We believe that under current market conditions, "footage" and "turnkey" contract rates do not adequately compensate us for the added risks. The duration of our drilling contracts are "well-to-well" or for a fixed term. "Well-to-well" contracts are cancelable at the option of either party upon the completion of drilling at any one site. Fixed-term contracts generally have a minimum term of at least six months but customarily provide for termination at the election of the customer, with an "early termination payment" to be paid to us if a contract is terminated prior to the expiration of the fixed term. However, under certain limited circumstances such as destruction of a drilling rig, our bankruptcy, sustained unacceptable performance by us or delivery of a rig beyond certain grace and/or liquidated damage periods, no early termination payment would be paid to us. 

Contracts generally contain renewal or extension provisions exercisable at the option of the customer at prices mutually agreeable to us and the customer. In most instances contracts provide for additional payments for mobilization and demobilization. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had 88 existing rigs under fixed-term contracts. While the original duration for these current fixed-term contracts are for six-month to five-year periods, some fixed-term and well-to-well contracts are expected to be extended for longer periods than the original terms. However, the contracting parties have no legal obligation to extend these contracts and some customers may elect to early terminate fixed-term contracts as discussed above. 

Backlog 

Our contract drilling backlog, being the expected future revenue from executed contracts with original terms in excess of one year, as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1.8 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. The decrease in backlog at September 30, 2016 from September 30, 2015, is primarily due to the revenue earned since September 30, 2015 and the expiration and termination of long-term contracts. Approximately 53.2 percent of the total September 30, 2016 backlog is not reasonably expected to be filled in fiscal 2017. A small portion of the backlog represents term contracts for new rigs that will begin operations in the future. 

The following table sets forth the total backlog by reportable segment as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the percentage of the September 30, 2016 backlog not reasonably expected to be filled in fiscal 2017: 

&#160; &#160; Total Backlog Revenue &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Percentage Not Reasonably Expected to be Filled in Fiscal 2017 &#160; Reportable Segment 

&#160; 9/30/2016 &#160; 9/30/2015 &#160; &#160; &#160; (in billions) &#160; &#160; &#160; U.S. Land &#160; $ 1.2 &#160; $ 2.2 &#160; &#160; 47.5 % Offshore &#160; &#160; 0.1 &#160; &#160; 0.1 &#160; &#160; 44.4 % International &#160; &#160; 0.5 &#160; &#160; 0.8 &#160; &#160; 68.8 % &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#160; $ 1.8 &#160; $ 3.1 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 

As noted above, under certain limited circumstances a customer is not required to pay an early termination fee. There may also be instances where a customer is financially unable or refuses to pay an early termination fee. Accordingly, the actual amount of revenue earned may vary from the backlog reported. For further information, see Item 1A&#151;"Risk Factors". 

U.S. Land Drilling 

At the end of September 2016, 2015, and 2014, we had 348, 343 and 329, respectively, of our land rigs available for work in the United States. The total number of rigs at the end of fiscal 2016 increased by a net of five rigs from the end of fiscal 2015. The net increase is due to five new FlexRigs completed in 2016. Our U.S. Land operations contributed approximately 77 percent ($1.2 billion) of our consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2016, compared with approximately 80 percent ($2.5 billion) of consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2015 and approximately 83 percent ($3.1 billion) of consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2014. Rig utilization was approximately 30 percent in fiscal 2016, approximately 62 percent in fiscal 2015 and approximately 86 percent in fiscal 2014. A rig is considered to be utilized when it is operated or being mobilized or demobilized under contract. At the close of fiscal 2016, 95 out of an available 348 land rigs were generating revenue. 

Offshore Drilling 

Our Offshore operations contributed approximately 9 percent in fiscal year 2016 ($138.6 million) of our consolidated operating revenues compared to approximately 8 percent ($241.7 million) of consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2015 and 7 percent ($251.3 million) of consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2014. Rig utilization in fiscal 2016 was approximately 82 percent 

compared to approximately 93 percent in fiscal 2015 and 89 percent in fiscal 2014. At the end of fiscal 2016, we had seven of our nine offshore platform rigs under contract compared to eight at the end of fiscal 2015. We continued to work under management contracts for two customer-owned rigs at the close of fiscal 2016. Revenues from drilling services performed for our largest offshore drilling customer totaled approximately 61percent ($84.1 million) of offshore revenues during fiscal 2016. 

International Land Drilling 

General 

Prior to September 30, 2015, for financial reporting purposes, fiscal years of our foreign operations ended on August 31 to facilitate reporting of consolidated results, resulting in a one-month reporting lag when compared to the remainder of the Company. Starting October 1, 2015, the reporting year-end of these foreign operations was changed from August 31 to September 30 eliminating the previously existing one-month reporting lag. Accordingly, the results of operations below have been changed to reflect the period-specific effects of this change, unless otherwise noted. See Note 1&#151;"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" included in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding this change. 

At the end of September 2016 and 2015, we had 38 land rigs available for work in locations outside of the United States compared to 36 land rigs at the end of 2014. Our International Land operations contributed approximately 14 percent ($229.9 million) of our consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2016, compared with approximately 12 percent ($382.3 million) of consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2015 and 9 percent ($351.3 million) of consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2014. Rig utilization in fiscal 2016 was 39 percent, 51 percent in fiscal 2015 and 74 percent in fiscal 2014. Our international operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties not typically encountered in U.S. operations. For further information on various risks associated with doing business in foreign countries, see Item 1A&#151;"Risk Factors. 

Argentina 

At the end of fiscal 2016, we had 19 rigs in Argentina. Our utilization rate was approximately 54 percent during fiscal 2016, approximately 57 percent during fiscal 2015 and approximately 77 percent during fiscal 2014. Revenues generated by Argentine drilling operations contributed approximately 10 percent in fiscal 2016 ($159.4 million) of our consolidated operating revenues compared to approximately 6 percent ($178.0 million) of our consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2015 and approximately 3 percent ($107.2 million) of our consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2014. Revenues from drilling services performed for our two largest customers in Argentina totaled approximately 9 percent of consolidated operating revenues and approximately 66 percent of international operating revenues during fiscal 2016. The Argentine drilling contracts are primarily with large international or national oil companies. 

Colombia 

At the end of fiscal 2016, we had eight rigs in Colombia. Our utilization rate was approximately 13 percent during fiscal 2016, approximately 48 percent during fiscal 2015 and approximately 62 percent during fiscal 2014. Revenues generated by Colombian drilling operations contributed approximately 1 percent in fiscal 2016 ($20.5 million) of our consolidated operating revenues compared to approximately 2 percent ($70.1 million) of our consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2015 and approximately 2 percent ($81.2 million) of our consolidated operating revenues during fiscal 2014. Revenues from drilling services performed for our two customers in Colombia totaled approximately 1 percent of consolidated operating revenues and approximately 9 percent of international operating 

revenues during fiscal 2016. The Colombian drilling contracts are primarily with large international or national oil companies. 

Ecuador 

At the end of fiscal 2016, we had six rigs in Ecuador. The utilization rate in Ecuador was 4 percent in fiscal 2016, compared to 29 percent in fiscal 2015 and 83 percent in fiscal 2014. Revenues generated by Ecuadorian drilling operations contributed less than 1 percent ($4.9 million) during fiscal 2016 of our consolidated operating revenues compared to approximately 1 percent during fiscal 2015 ($31.0 million) of our consolidated operating revenues and 2 percent in fiscal 2014 ($68.0 million) of our consolidated operating revenues. At the end of fiscal 2016 all of our rigs in Ecuador were idle. The rigs in Ecuador, along with other rig related assets, were classified as held for sale at September 30, 2016. 

UAE&#151;Abu Dhabi 

At the end of fiscal 2016, we had two rigs in the UAE. The utilization rate in the UAE was 100 percent in fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and in fiscal 2014. Revenues generated by drilling operations in the UAE contributed 2 percent ($34.6 million) during fiscal 2016 of our consolidated operating revenues compared to approximately 2 percent during fiscal 2015 ($47.7 million) of our consolidated operating revenues and 1 percent during fiscal 2014 ($48.5 million) of our consolidated operating revenues. The UAE drilling contracts are with a single national oil company that contributed approximately 15 percent of international operating revenues during fiscal 2016. 

Bahrain 

At the end of fiscal 2016, we had three rigs in Bahrain. The utilization rate in Bahrain was 33 percent in fiscal 2016, compared to 56 percent in fiscal 2015 and 100 percent in fiscal 2014. Revenues generated by drilling operations in Bahrain contributed 1 percent during fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 ($10.2 million, $41.9 million and $33.2 million, respectively) of our consolidated operating revenues. Bahrain drilling contracts are with a single national oil company that contributed approximately 4 percent of international operating revenues during fiscal 2016.
