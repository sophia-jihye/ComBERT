Unless the context otherwise requires, references to the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;Green Brick&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; refer to the consolidated company, which has been renamed Green Brick Partners, Inc. and its subsidiaries, resulting from the acquisition by BioFuel Energy Corp. and its then consolidated subsidiaries (&#8220;BioFuel&#8221;) of JBGL Builder Finance LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries and affiliated companies (collectively &#8220;Builder Finance&#8221;), and JBGL Capital Companies (&#8220;Capital&#8221;), a combined group of commonly managed limited liability companies and partnerships (collectively with Builder Finance, &#8220;JBGL&#8221;) by means of a reverse recapitalization transaction on October 27, 2014. 

General 

Green Brick Partners, Inc. (formerly named BioFuel Energy Corp.) was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on April 11, 2006, to invest solely in BioFuel Energy, LLC, a limited liability company organized on January 25, 2006, to build and operate ethanol production facilities in the Midwestern United States. On November 22, 2013, the Company disposed of its ethanol plants and all related assets. Following the disposition of these production facilities, we were a public shell company with no substantial operations. 

On June 10, 2014, the Company entered into a definitive transaction agreement with the owners of JBGL, which provided that we would acquire JBGL for $275 million , payable in cash and shares of our common stock (the &#8220;Transaction&#8221;). JBGL is a real estate operator involved in the purchase and development of land for residential use, construction lending and home building operations. The Transaction was completed on October 27, 2014 &#32;(the &#8220;Transaction Date&#8221;). Pursuant to the terms of the Transaction, we paid the $275 million &#32;purchase price with approximately $191.8 million &#32;in cash and the remainder in 11,108,500 &#32;shares of our common stock valued at approximately $7.49 &#32;per share. 

The cash portion of the purchase price was primarily funded from the proceeds of a $70.0 million &#32;rights offering conducted by the Company (the $70.0 million &#32;includes proceeds from purchases of shares of common stock by certain funds and accounts managed by Greenlight Capital, Inc. and its affiliates (&#8220;Greenlight&#8221;) and Third Point LLC and its affiliates (&#8220;Third Point&#8221;)), and $150.0 million &#32;of debt financing provided by Greenlight pursuant to a loan agreement, with the lenders from time to time party thereto (the &#8220;Loan Agreement&#8221;), which provided for a five year term loan facility (the "Term Loan Facility"). 

The $70.0 million &#32;rights offering included a registered offering by the Company of transferable rights to the public holders of its common stock, as of September 15, 2014 (the &#8220;Rights Offering&#8221;) to purchase additional shares of common stock. Each right permitted the holder to purchase, at a rights price ultimately equal to $5.00 &#32;per share of common stock, 2.2445 &#32;shares of common stock. 4,843,384 &#32;shares of common stock were purchased in the public Rights Offering for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $24.2 million . 

In addition to the Rights Offering, Greenlight and Third Point participated in a private rights offering to purchase additional shares of common stock pursuant to commitment letters. Pursuant to its commitment letter, Third Point agreed to participate in the private rights offering for its full basic subscription privilege in the Rights Offering and to purchase, simultaneously with the consummation of the Rights Offering to the public, all of the available shares not otherwise sold in the Rights Offering following the exercise of all other public holders&#8217; basic subscription privileges. Pursuant to such commitment letters, Greenlight purchased 4,957,618 &#32;shares of common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $24.8 million &#32;and Third Point purchased 4,198,998 &#32;shares of common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $21.0 million . 

In connection with the Transaction, we entered into a backstop agreement with Third Point. The backstop agreement set forth, among other things, the terms of Third Point's backstop commitment. Third Point did not receive compensation for its commitment to participate in the private rights offering or its backstop commitment. 

At the time the Transaction was completed, BioFuel was a non-operating public shell corporation with nominal operations and assets consisting of cash, deferred tax assets, and nominal other nonoperating assets. As a result of the Transaction the owners and management of JBGL gained effective operating control of the combined company. 

Accordingly, for financial reporting purposes, the Transaction was deemed to be a capital transaction in substance and recorded as a reverse recapitalization of JBGL whereby JBGL is deemed to be the continuing, surviving entity for accounting purposes, but through reorganization, has deemed to have adopted the capital structure of BioFuel. Because the acquisition was considered a reverse recapitalization for accounting purposes, the combined historical financial statements of JBGL became our historical financial statements and from the completion of the acquisition on October 27, 2014, the financial statements have 

been prepared on a consolidated basis. The assets and liabilities of BioFuel have been brought forward at their book value and no goodwill has been recognized in connection with the Transaction. 

As a result of the Transaction, Green Brick changed its business direction and is now in the real estate industry. 

On July 1, 2015, we completed an underwritten public offering of 17 million shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $10.00 per share and granted to the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an aggregate of 841,500 additional shares of common stock to cover over-allotments (the &#8220;Equity Offering&#8221;). On July 23, 2015, the underwriters exercised the option and purchased 444,897 additional shares. All of the shares were sold by us pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement previously filed with the SEC. 

The Equity Offering resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately $170.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. On July 1, 2015, we used approximately $154.9 million of the net proceeds from the Equity Offering to repay all of the outstanding principal, interest and a prepayment premium under the Term Loan Facility. Upon repayment, the Term Loan Facility was terminated and all security interests in, and all liens held by Greenlight with respect to, the assets of Green Brick securing the amounts owed under the Term Loan Facility were terminated and released. We used the remaining net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

Our Company 

We are a uniquely structured company that combines residential land development and homebuilding. We acquire and develop land, provide land and construction financing to our controlled builders and participate in the profits of our controlled builders. Our core markets are in the high growth U.S. metropolitan areas of Dallas, Texas and Atlanta, Georgia. We are engaged in all aspects of the homebuilding process, including land acquisition and the development, entitlements, design, construction, marketing and sales and the creation of brand images at our residential neighborhoods and master planned communities. We believe we offer higher quality homes with more distinctive designs and floor plans than those built by our competitors at comparable prices. Our communities are located in premium locations in our core markets and we seek to enhance homebuyer satisfaction by utilizing high-quality materials, offering a broad range of customization options and building well-crafted energy-efficient homes. We seek to maximize value over the long term and operate our business to mitigate risks in the event of a downturn by controlling costs and quickly reacting to regional and local market trends. 

We are a leading lot developer in the Dallas and Atlanta markets and believe that our strict operating discipline provides us with a competitive advantage in seeking to maximize returns while minimizing risk. We currently own or control over 4,700 &#32;home sites in premium locations in the Dallas and Atlanta markets. We consider premium locations to be lot supply constrained with high housing demand and where much of the surrounding land has already been developed. We are strategically positioned to either build new homes on our lots through our controlled builders or to sell finished lots to large unaffiliated homebuilders. 

We sell finished lots or option lots from third-party developers to our controlled builders for their homebuilding operations and provide them with construction financing and strategic planning. Our controlled builders provide us with their local knowledge and relationships. We support our controlled builders by financing their purchases of land from us at an unlevered internal rate of return (&#8220;IRR&#8221;) of at least 20% &#32;and by providing construction financing at approximately a 13.8% &#32;interest rate. Our income is further enhanced by our 50% &#32;equity interest in the profits of our controlled builders. In addition, the land we sell to third-party homebuilders also typically generates an unlevered IRR targeted at 20% &#32;or greater. 

References to our &#8220;controlled builders&#8221; refer to our homebuilding subsidiaries in which we own at least a 50% controlling interest.

Our Competitive Strengths 

Our business is characterized by the following competitive strengths: 

Optionality Provided by Our Combined Land Development and Homebuilding Structure 

We are a uniquely structured company that combines residential land development and homebuilding. We are strategically positioned to either build and sell new homes on lots through our controlled builders or develop land and sell finished lots to large unaffiliated homebuilders. While our business plan increasingly has focused on building new homes on our owned and controlled lots, we proactively monitor market conditions to opportunistically sell a minority of our finished lots to large unaffiliated homebuilders if we believe that doing so will maximize our returns or lower our risk. 

Experienced Management Team 

Our management team is comprised of homebuilding and finance veterans that collectively have decades of experience and local knowledge of our core markets. Our founder and Chief Executive Officer, James R. Brickman has over 38 years of experience in real estate development and home building. Richard A. Costello, our Chief Financial Officer, joined the Company in 2015 and provides oversight of all financial reporting, lending relationships, audit supervision, cash management, and investor relations. Mr. Costello has over 25 years of financial and operational experience in all aspects of real estate management. Jed Dolson, Head of Land Acquisition and Development, joined JBGL as an employee in 2013 and is responsible for land entitlement and development activities, including overseeing our land development operations in Dallas. Our management team has a proven record of running profitable businesses and making prudent investment decisions. We believe that our experienced management team is well positioned to design and execute the development of complex, master planned residential communities. 

Focus on Operations in Dallas and Atlanta Housing Markets with a Favorable Growth Outlook and Strong Demand Fundamentals 

We currently operate in the Dallas and Atlanta markets, which we believe are among the most desirable homebuilding markets in the nation. We believe our core markets exhibit attractive residential real estate investment characteristics, such as growing economies, improving levels of employment and population growth relative to national averages, favorable migration patterns, general housing affordability, and desirable lifestyle and weather characteristics. 

Among the 12 largest metropolitan areas in the country, the Dallas metropolitan area ranked third in both the rate of job growth and in the number of jobs added from October 2014 to October 2015 &#32;(Source: US Bureau of Labor Statistics, October 2015 ). The Atlanta metropolitan area has recorded employment gains each month, as compared to the same month in the prior year, since July 2010 (Source: US Bureau of Labor Statistics, &#32; November 2015 ). 

We believe that increasing demand and supply constraints in our core markets create favorable conditions for our future growth. 

Attractive Land Positions in Our Core Markets 

We believe that we have strategically well-located land positions and lot positions within our core markets. We believe we have acquired our land and lot positions at attractive prices, providing us with significant opportunity for a healthy return on our investment. We expect the demand for housing in our core markets to continue to improve, due to rising consumer confidence, high affordability metrics, and a reduction in home inventory levels. 

We seek to acquire land with convenient access to Dallas and Atlanta metropolitan areas which have diverse economic and employment bases and demographics that we believe will support long-term growth. For example, Capital currently owns, controls or is developing approximately 2,700 &#32;home sites under the brand Green Brick Communities in the Dallas market. Builder Finance owns or controls approximately 2,000 &#32;home sites in the Dallas and Atlanta markets. 

We believe that our attractive inventory of home sites will enable us to capture the benefits of expected increases in home sales volumes and home prices as the U.S. housing market continues to recover and demand for new homes increases. 

Land Sourcing and Evaluation Capabilities 

We believe that our extensive experience and the strong reputation of our management team combined with our long-standing relationships with other market participants provide us with a competitive advantage in efficiently sourcing, purchasing and entitling land. We are actively involved in every step of the land entitlement, home design and construction process with our controlled builders. Our management team has developed significant collaborative relationships over decades 

with land sellers, developers, contractors, lenders, brokers and investors throughout the Dallas and Atlanta markets. Our deep and wide-ranging knowledge of the Dallas and Atlanta markets and our ability to quickly and efficiently identify, acquire and develop land in desirable locations and on favorable terms are key to our success. 

Disciplined Investment Approach 

We seek to maximize value over the long-term and operate our business to mitigate risks in the event of a downturn by controlling costs and focusing on regional and local market trends. 

Our management team has gained significant operating expertise through varied economic cycles. The perspective gained from these experiences has helped shape our investment approach. We believe that our management team has learned to effectively evaluate housing trends in our markets, and to react quickly and rationally to market changes. For example, we made significant land investments during the downturn at prices that we view as attractive. Our cycle-tested management approach balances strategic planning with local day-to-day decision-making responsibilities freeing up our controlled builders to concentrate on growing our homebuilding business rather than focusing on obtaining capital to fund their operations. We believe that our strict operating discipline provides us with a competitive advantage in seeking to maximize returns while minimizing risk. 

No Legacy Issues 

We do not have distressed legacy assets or liabilities to manage. All of our owned land and lots, as well as those we have under option contracts, purchase contracts or non-binding letter of intent, are located in markets that we targeted during the downturn or after recovery had commenced. The absence of legacy issues has allowed us to attract and retain experienced and talented land development personnel who became available during the downturn. We believe that the absence of legacy issues enables us to achieve superior growth and profitability instead of diverting resources to manage troubled assets and relationships. 

Business Strategy 

We believe we are well-positioned for growth in our core Dallas and Atlanta markets through the disciplined execution of the following elements of our strategy: 

Combine Land Acquisition and Development Expertise with Homebuilding Operations to Maximize Profitability 

Our ability to identify, acquire and develop land in desirable locations and on favorable terms is critical to our success. We evaluate land opportunities based on how we expect such opportunities will contribute to overall corporate profitability and returns, rather than how they might drive volume on a market basis. We believe our expertise in land development and planning enables us to create desirable communities that meet or exceed our target homebuyer&#8217;s expectations, while selling homes at competitive prices. Our strategy of holding land inventory provides us with a multi-year supply of lots for future homebuilding. We focus on the development of entitled parcels in communities where we can generally sell all lots and homes within 24 to 60 months from the start of sales. This focus allows us to limit exposure to land development and market cycle risk while pursuing attractive returns on our investments. We seek to minimize our exposure to land risk through disciplined management of entitlements, the use of land options and other flexible land acquisition arrangements. 

Maximize Benefits of Unique Land Development and Homebuilding Structure 

Our unique land development and homebuilding structure provides the flexibility to monetize the value of our land assets either by building and selling homes through our controlled builders or developing land and selling finished lots to large unaffiliated homebuilders. When evaluating our land assets, we consider the potential contribution of each asset to our overall performance, taking into account the timeframe over which we may monetize the asset. While we currently expect the majority of our land to be utilized by our controlled homebuilders, we believe our land development and homebuilding strategy provides us with increased flexibility to seek to maximize risk-adjusted returns as market conditions warrant. 

Increase Long-Term Value by Investing in Infrastructure 

In our communities, we typically make enhanced investment in infrastructure, including landscaping, amenity centers and enforcing higher construction standards on our controlled and unaffiliated builders in our communities. We believe this creates greater long-term value for us and for our controlled and unaffiliated builders, homebuyers, shareholders and the communities in which we build. 

Drive Revenue by Opening New Communities from Existing Land Supplies 

We have strategically invested in new land in a number of prime neighborhoods in our core markets. We currently own or control over 4,700 &#32;home sites in the Dallas and Atlanta markets. We believe that a majority of our land inventory was purchased or controlled at low price points during the downturn in the housing cycle. We expect these land purchases to provide us with the opportunity for continued revenue growth and strong gross margin performance. We continue to identify development opportunities that should allow us to profit from lot sales, construction interest and our 50% equity interest in the profits of our controlled builders. 

Increase Market Position in Dallas and Atlanta 

We believe that there are significant opportunities to profitably expand in our core Dallas and Atlanta markets. We continually review the allocation of our investments in these markets taking into account demographic trends and the likely impact on our operating results. We use the results of these reviews to re-allocate our investments to those areas where we believe we can maximize our profitability and return on capital. We seek to use our local relationships with land sellers, brokers and investors to pursue the purchase of additional land parcels in our core markets. While our primary growth strategy focuses on increasing our market position in our existing markets, we may, on an opportunistic basis, explore expansion into attractive new markets. 

Superior Design, Broad Product Range and Enhanced Homebuying Experience 

Within each of our core markets, we partner our expertise with our controlled builders to design attractive neighborhoods and homes to appeal to a wide variety of potential homebuyers. One of our core operating philosophy is to create a culture which provides a positive, memorable experience for our homebuyers through active engagement in the building process. At higher price points, we provide our homebuyers with customization options to suit their specific needs and tastes. We engineer our homes for energy-efficiency to reduce the impact on the environment and lower energy costs for our homebuyers. In consultation with nationally and locally recognized architecture firms, interior and exterior consultants and homeowner focus groups, we research and design a diversified range of products for various levels and price points. Our homebuilding projects include townhomes, single family homes and luxury custom homes. We believe we can adapt quickly to changing market conditions and optimize performance and returns while strategically reducing portfolio risk because of our diversified product strategy. 

Pursue Further Growth Through the Prudent Use of Leverage 

As of December 31, 2015, our debt to total capitalization ratio is less than 14% . It is our intent to prudently employ leverage to continue to invest in our land acquisition, development and homebuilding businesses. We intend to target a total capitalization ratio of approximately 35% to 40%, which we expect will provide us with significant additional growth capital. 

Pursue Acquisitions of Additional Homebuilders 

We intend to pursue the acquisition of additional homebuilders in our core and new markets. Our preference is to continue to acquire controlling interest in homebuilders with existing management continuing to own a significant ownership stake. We will seek to acquire and then retain management teams which have the deep local relationships with land owners and have a strong reputation for building well-crafted homes in their markets. We expect that our ability to provide capital discipline and strategic oversight will complement the local skills, relationships and reputations to our future homebuilder partners. 

Our Homebuilding Projects &#32; 

Our homebuilding projects usually take approximately 24 to 60 months to complete from the start of sales, although certain projects may take longer to complete. The following table presents project information relating to each of our markets as of December 31, 2015 , as well as current projects under development. Our backlog reflects the number and value of homes for which we have entered into non-contingent sales contracts with customers but not yet delivered. (While we may accept sales contracts on a contingent basis in limited circumstances, such contracts are not included in our backlog until the contingency is removed).

Owned and Controlled Lots &#32; 

The following table presents the lots we owned or controlled as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 . Owned lots are those to which we hold title, while controlled lots are those that we have the contractual right to acquire title but do not currently own. With respect to controlled lots, we generally enter into lot option contracts where an earnest money deposit of up to 20% &#32;of the total purchase price of the lots is deposited with the seller. The earnest money deposit is applied to the purchase price of the lots within the lot option contract. Certain of our lot option contracts require an escalation in lot price from zero to six percent per year. The length of the lot option contract is generally based upon the number of lots being purchased and the agreed upon lot takedown schedule, which determines the number and frequency of lot purchases. Townhome lot option contracts typically require two to four &#32;lot purchases per month and single family lot option contracts typically require two to three &#32;lot purchases per month.

Acquisition Process 

Our ability to identify, evaluate and acquire land in desirable locations and on favorable terms is critical to our success. We evaluate land opportunities based on risk-adjusted returns and employ a rigorous due diligence process to identify risks, which we then seek to mitigate if we pursue the property. 

We often purchase land parcels from large, long-term landowners who sell portions of their land to benefit from our experience in planning and executing complex land development projects. We also purchase land from large real estate developers that recognize the benefit of working with an experienced and reputable developer and homebuilder. Additionally, we acquire land from owners that want to leverage our expertise in land entitlement so that the owners may later sell all or part of their land to us after entitlement. We also acquire land from other developers that want our controlled builders to build homes in their neighborhoods. 

We also identify attractive properties that are typically located in existing prime neighborhood locations. We consider the existing and future supply of developable land before working to acquire the best-valued properties. Analysis includes development costs in addition to land costs. We have found that the prime quality infill locations have limited supply competition that may result in smaller value declines in down markets. 

After contracting for a property, we perform due diligence to evaluate any environmental or geotechnical issues that may exist. We often seek to secure entitlements such as zoning or plat approval during this period. After title has been reviewed and approved the property is acquired. We manage and oversee all land development with our in-house staff. 

Homebuilding, Marketing and Sales Process 

TPG builds town homes, single family homes, and luxury homes in the Atlanta market. TPG&#8217;s town homes range from 1,900 to 3,000 square feet, have two or more bedrooms and range in price from $260,000 to $590,000. TPG&#8217;s single family homes range from 2,300 to 5,800 square feet, have three or more bedrooms and range in price from $315,000 to $1.4 million. TPG&#8217;s luxury homes have over 4,000 square feet, four or more bedrooms and range in price from $770,000 to more than $3.0 

million. TPG has received numerous industry awards, including the best master planned community by the Greater Atlanta Home Builders Association in 2013. 

In the Dallas market our controlled builders construct townhomes, single family homes and luxury homes. CB JENI builds town homes with 1,400 to 2,600 square feet, two or more bedrooms and prices ranging from $210,000 to $290,000. Normandy constructs single family homes with square footage of over 1,800 square feet, three or more bedrooms and a price between $280,000 and $700,000. Southgate builds luxury homes that have over 3,400 square feet, four or more bedrooms and prices of $600,000 and above. Southgate also acts as a contractor on homes up to $2.0 million. Centre Living builds homes and luxury townhomes, in premier centrally located neighborhoods in the Dallas market, that range from 2,100 to 3,300 square feet, two to three bedrooms and prices from $500,000 to more than $1,000,000. Centre also acts as a contractor on homes up to $2.5 million and on amenity centers for our other Dallas builders. 

We offer a preferred lender referral program to provide lending options to homebuyers in need of financing. We offer homeowners a comprehensive warranty on each home. Homes are generally covered by a ten year warranty for structural concerns, one year for defects and products used, two years for electrical and plumbing and ten years for HVAC parts and labor. Our Homeowner Services Department aims to respond to any questions or concerns from homebuyers within three business days. 

We sell our homes through our own sales representatives and also through independent real estate brokers. Our in-house sales force typically works from sales offices located in model homes close to or in each community. Sales representatives assist potential buyers by providing them with basic floor plans, price information, development and construction timetables, tours of model homes, and the selection of customization and upgrade options. Sales personnel are trained by us and generally have had prior experience selling new homes in the local market. Our personnel, along with subcontracted marketing and design consultants, carefully design the exterior and interior of each home to appeal to the lifestyles of targeted homebuyers. Additionally, we advertise through the use of model homes, Internet, newspapers, billboards, publications, brochures, and newsletters. 

Seasonality 

Historically, the homebuilding industry experiences seasonal fluctuations in quarterly operating results and capital requirements. We typically experience the highest new home order activity in spring and summer, although this activity is also highly dependent on the number of active selling communities, timing of new community openings and other market factors. Since it typically takes five to eight months to construct a new home, we deliver more homes in the second half of the year as spring and summer home orders are delivered. Because of this seasonality, home starts, construction costs and related cash outflows have historically been highest in the second and third quarters, and the majority of cash receipts from home deliveries occur during the third and fourth quarters. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue over the long-term, although it may be affected by volatility in the homebuilding industry. 

Segments 

We organize our operations into two reportable segments: land development and homebuilding services. Within homebuilding services, our two operating segments consist of Texas and Georgia. The reportable segments follow the same accounting policies as our consolidated financial statements. Operational results of each segment are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have occurred had the segment been an independent stand-alone entity during the periods presented. Financial information about our segments appears in Note 14, "Segment Information," of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Raw Materials 

Typically, all the raw materials and most of the components used in our business are readily available in the United States. Most are standard items carried by major suppliers. However, a rapid increase in the number of homes started could cause shortages in the availability of such materials or in the price of services, thereby leading to delays in the delivery of homes under construction. We continue to monitor the supply markets to achieve the best prices available. See &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Labor and raw material shortages and price fluctuations could delay or increase the cost of land development and home construction, which could materially and adversely affect our business. &#8221; 

Corporate Organization and Structure 

We carry out our business generally through a number of project-specific, wholly-owned limited liability company subsidiaries. Our homebuilding operations business is conducted primarily through Builder Finance, and the land development operations conducts its business under the brand Green Brick Communities. 

Government Regulation and Environmental Matters 

Our developments are subject to numerous local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, development, building design, construction and similar matters that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements, the result of which is to limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Projects that are not entitled may be subjected to periodic delays, changes in use, less intensive development or elimination of development in certain specific areas due to government regulations. We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or &#8220;slow-growth&#8221; or &#8220;no-growth&#8221; initiatives that could be implemented in the future. Local governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development and service fees for projects in their jurisdiction. Projects for which we have received land use and development entitlements or approvals may still require a variety of other governmental approvals and permits during the development process and can also be impacted adversely by unforeseen health, safety and welfare issues, which can further delay these projects or prevent their development. 

We are also subject to a variety of local, state, federal and other statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the environment. The particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding site vary according to multiple factors, including the site&#8217;s location, its environmental conditions and the present and former uses of the site, as well as adjoining properties. Environmental laws and conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding and land development activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas. In addition, in those cases where an endangered or threatened species is involved, environmental rules and regulations can result in the restriction or elimination of development in identified environmentally sensitive areas. From time to time, the United States Environmental Protection Agency and similar federal or state agencies review homebuilders&#8217; compliance with environmental laws and may levy fines and penalties for failure to comply strictly with applicable environmental laws or impose additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures. Any such actions taken may increase our costs. Further, we expect that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on homebuilders and land developers in the future. Environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber. 

Under various environmental laws, current or former owners of real estate, as well as certain other categories of parties, may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases, and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for related damages, including for bodily injury, and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination. Please see the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Competition 

Competition in the homebuilding industry is intense, and there are relatively low barriers to entry into our business. Homebuilders compete for, among other things, homebuyers, desirable land parcels, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. Increased competition could hurt our business, as it could prevent us from acquiring attractive land parcels on which to build homes or make such acquisitions more expensive, hinder our market share expansion, and lead to pricing pressures on our homes that may adversely impact our revenues and margins. If we are unable to successfully compete, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Our competitors may independently develop land and construct housing units that are superior or substantially similar to our products. Furthermore, a number of our primary competitors are significantly larger, have a longer operating history and may have greater resources or lower cost of capital; accordingly, they may be able to compete more effectively in one or more of the markets in which we operate. Many of these competitors also have longstanding relationships with subcontractors and suppliers in the markets in which we operate. We also compete for sales with individual resales of existing homes and with available rental housing. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 200 &#32;employees, including those of our controlled builders. Although none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, certain of the subcontractors engaged by us or our affiliates are represented by labor unions or are subject to collective bargaining arrangements. We believe that our relations with our employees and subcontractors are good.
