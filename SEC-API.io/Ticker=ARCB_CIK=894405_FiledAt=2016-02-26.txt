ArcBest Corporation 

&#160; 

ArcBest Corporation &#174; (the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221;) is a logistics company with The Skill &#38; The Will &#174; to solve complex freight transportation and logistics challenges. The Company, formerly known as Arkansas Best Corporation, was incorporated in Delaware in 1966. On May 1, 2014, we changed our name to ArcBest Corporation and our common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under a new symbol, ARCB. In conjunction with our name change, we adopted a new unified logo system as we strengthen our identity as a holistic provider of transportation and logistics solutions for a wide variety of customers. The Skill and The Will embodies our vision to find a way to meet our customers&#8217; transportation and logistics needs. By focusing on our values &#8212; creativity, integrity, collaboration, growth, excellence, and wellness &#8212; we work together to deliver solutions to our customers, support our employees, grow our business with integrity, and strive to exceed expectations. From Fortune 100 companies to small businesses, our customers trust and rely on ArcBest brands and companies for all their transportation and logistics needs. Our employees deliver knowledge, expertise and a can-do attitude with every shipment and supply chain solution, residential move, and vehicle repair. 

&#160; 

ArcBest Corporation, the parent holding company, has five reportable operating segments. Our principal operations are conducted through our Freight Transportation (ABF Freight &#174; ) segment, which consists of ABF Freight System, Inc. and certain other subsidiaries. Our asset-light logistics segments, which accounted for approximately 29% of our 2015 total revenues before other revenues and intercompany eliminations, are: Premium Logistics (Panther), Transportation Management (ABF Logistics &#174; ), Emergency &#38; Preventative Maintenance (FleetNet), and Household Goods Moving Services (ABF Moving &#174; ). As of December 2015, we had approximately 13,000 active employees of which approximately 6 5 % were members of labor unions. 

&#160; 

Our strategy is to be a balanced, highly profitable and financially sustainable enterprise, using creativity and cooperation to solve transportation and logistics challenges for customers worldwide who value quality and an exceptional experience. We work to build long-term shareholder value by: 

&#183; 

Expanding our revenue opportunities. We seek to expand our revenue opportunities through deepening our existing customer relationships and securing new ones. We build relationships that last for decades and our customers assign a high degree of value for the high level of service and professionalism we provide. When customers talk about us, they say that we solve problems, we are easy to do business with , and we are good partners who understand them. This focus on meeting our customers&#8217; needs has resulted in the development of many of the businesses we now operate. 

&#183; 

Balancing our revenue and profit mix. We are differentiated from our competition in our ability to offer logistics solutions with a wide variety of fulfillment options which can include our own assets. As our asset-light logistics businesses continue to grow alongside ABF Freight, we are balancing the mix of our revenue and profits between our asset-based and asset-light businesses. This balance drives long-term financial sustainability by making our business less capital-intensive relative to its size, and by reducing volatility in our business performance through varying cycles, events , and/or environments. 

&#183; 

Optimizing our cost structure . We are focused on profitable growth, which causes us to continually review our costs and investment decisions accordingly. Our technology infrastructure enables business processes, insight and analytics that allow us to optimize our cost structure, and we continue to invest in technology to transform our business. Management is also incentivized to drive long-term shareholder value. 

&#160; 

We continually analyze where additional capital should be invested and where management resources should be focused to improve relationships with customers and meet their expanding needs. Our management is focused on increasing returns to our stockholders. In response to customers&#8217; needs for expanded service offerings, we have strategically increased investment in our asset-light logistics businesses. The additional resources invested in growing the asset-light logistics businesses is part of management&#8217;s long-term strategy to ensure we are positioned to serve the changing marketplace through these businesses and our traditional less-than-truckload (&#8220;LTL&#8221;) operations by providing a comprehensive suite of transportation and logistics services. As part of such strategy, we have completed the following acquisitions and changes to our business model: 

&#183; 

On June 15, 2012, we acquired Panther Expedited Services, Inc., one of North America&#8217;s largest providers of expedited freight transportation services with expanding service offerings in premium freight logistics and freight forwarding. 

&#183; 

On May 31, 2013, we acquired a privately-owned business which is included in the ABF Moving segment. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Effective July 1, 2013, we formed the ABF Logistics segment in a strategic alignment of the sales and operations functions of our logistics businesses. 

&#183; 

On April 30, 2014, we acquired a privately-owned business which is reported within the FleetNet segment. 

&#183; 

During 2014, we established our enterprise solutions group to offer more easily accessible transportation and logistics solutions for our customers through a single point of contact. 

&#183; 

On January 2, 2015, ABF Logistics acquired Smart Lines Transportation Group, LLC (&#8220;Smart Lines&#8221;) , a privately-owned truckload brokerage firm. 

&#183; 

On December 1, 2015, ABF Logistics acquired Bear Transportation Services, L.P. (&#8220;Bear&#8221;), a privately-owned truckload brokerage firm. 

&#160; 

Through ABF Freight, Panther, ABF Logistics, FleetNet, and ABF Moving , we offer end-to-end solutions and expertise for our customers&#8217; unique transportation and logistics needs, including: domestic and global transportation of LTL, truckload or full-container load (&#8220;FCL&#8221;), and less-than container load (&#8220;LCL&#8221;) shipments; expedited ground and time-definite delivery solutions; freight forwarding services; freight brokerage; transportation and warehouse management services; roadside assistance and total maintenance services for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles; and household goods moving market services for consumers, corporations, and the military. 

&#160; 

Freight Transportation (ABF Freight) Segment 

&#160; 

ABF Freight Business Overview 

The ABF Freight segment includes ABF Freight System, Inc., our largest subsidiary, and certain other subsidiaries, including ABF Freight System (B.C.), Ltd.; ABF Freight System Canada, Ltd.; ABF Cartage, Inc.; and Land-Marine Cargo, Inc. ABF Freight&#8217;s revenues, which totaled $1.9 billion, $1.9 billion, and $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, accounted for approximately 71%, 73%, and 75% of our total revenues before other revenues and intercompany eliminations in the respective year. Note M to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains additional segment financial information, including revenues, operating income, and total assets for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. 

&#160; 

ABF Freight has been in continuous service since 1923. ABF Freight System, Inc. is the successor to Arkansas Motor Freight, a business originally organized in 1935 which was the successor to a local transfer and storage carrier that was originally organized in 1923. ABF Freight expanded operations through several strategic acquisitions and organic growth and is now one of the largest LTL motor carriers in North America, providing direct service to more than 98% of U.S. cities having a population of 30,000 or more. ABF Freight provides interstate and intrastate direct service to more than 48,000 communities through 248 service centers in all 50 states, Canada, and Puerto Rico. ABF Freight also provides motor carrier freight transportation services to customers in Mexico through arrangements with trucking companies in that country. 

&#160; 

ABF Freight offers transportation of general commodities through standard, time-critical, expedited, and guaranteed LTL services &#8212; both nationally and regionally. General commodities include all freight except hazardous waste, dangerous explosives, commodities of exceptionally high value, commodities in bulk, and those requiring special equipment. ABF Freight&#8217;s shipments of general commodities differ from shipments of bulk raw materials, which are commonly transported by railroad, truckload tank car, pipeline, and water carrier. General commodities transported by ABF Freight include, among other things, food, textiles, apparel, furniture, appliances, chemicals, nonbulk petroleum products, rubber, plastics, metal and metal products, wood, glass, automotive parts, machinery, and miscellaneous manufactured products. 

&#160; 

ABF Freight provides shipping services to its customers by transporting a wide variety of large and small shipments to geographically dispersed destinations. Typically, LTL shipments are picked up at customers&#8217; places of business and consolidated at a local service terminal. Shipments are consolidated by destination for transportation by intercity units to their destination cities or to distribution centers. At distribution centers, shipments from various terminals can be reconsolidated for other distribution centers or, more typically, local terminals. After arriving at a local terminal, a shipment is delivered to the customer by local trucks operating from the terminal. In some cases, when one large shipment or a sufficient number of different shipments at one origin terminal are going to a common destination, they can be combined to make a full trailer load. A trailer is then dispatched to that destination without rehandling. The LTL transportation industry, which requires networks of local pickup and delivery service centers combined with larger distribution facilities, is significantly more infrastructure-intensive than truckload operations and, as such, has higher barriers to entry. Costs associated with an expansive LTL network, including investments in or costs associated with real 

&#160;

estate and labor costs related to local pickup, delivery, and cross-docking of shipments, are to a large extent fixed in nature unless service levels are significantly changed. 

&#160; 

ABF Freight offers regional service with its traditional long-haul model to facilitate its customers&#8217; next-day and second-day delivery needs in most areas throughout the United States. Development and expansion of the regional network required added labor flexibility, strategically positioned freight exchange points, and increased door capacity at a number of key locations. R egional service offerings within the ABF Freight network have resulted in reduced transit times and allows for consistent and continuous LTL service. ABF Freight defines the regional market, which represented approximately 60% of its tonnage in 2015, as tonnage moving 1,000 miles or less. 

&#160; 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, no single customer accounted for more than 4% of ABF Freight&#8217;s revenues, and the 10 largest customers, on a combined basis, accounted for approximately 12% of its revenues. In 2015, ABF Freight managed 5.1 million customer shipments weighing a total of 6.6 billion pounds for an average weight of 1,298 pounds per shipment. As of December 31, 2015, ABF Freight utilized approximately 4,200 tractors and 20,800 trailers in its linehaul and local pickup and delivery operations. 

&#160; 

ABF Freight Employees 

As of December 2015, ABF Freight had approximately 11,000 active employees. Employee compensation and related costs are the largest components of ABF Freight&#8217;s operating expenses. In 2015, such costs amounted to 61.2% of ABF Freight&#8217;s revenues. As of December 2015, approximately 7 7 % of ABF Freight&#8217;s employees were covered under a collective bargaining agreement, the ABF National Master Freight Agreement (the &#8220;ABF NMFA&#8221;), with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (the &#8220; IBT &#8221;) , which extends through March 31, 2018. The ABF NMFA included a 7% wage rate reduction upon the November 3, 2013 implementation date, followed by wage rate increases of 2% on July 1 in each of the next three years, which began in 2014, and a 2.5% increase on July 1, 2017; a one-week reduction in annual compensated vacation effective for employee anniversary dates on or after April 1, 2013; the option to expand the use of purchased transportation; and increased flexibility in labor work rules. The ABF NMFA and the related supplemental agreements provide for continued contributions to various multiemployer health, welfare, and pension plans maintained for the benefit of ABF Freight employees who are members of the IBT. The estimated net effect of the November 3, 2013 wage rate reduction and the benefit rate increase which was applied retroactively to August 1, 2013 was an initial reduction of approximately 4% to the combined total contractual wage and benefit rate under the ABF NMFA. Following the initial reduction, the combined contractual wage and benefit contribution rate under the ABF NMFA is estimated to increase approximately 2.5% to 3.0% on a compounded annual basis throughout the contract period which extends through March 31, 2018. 

&#160; 

Amendments to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;), pursuant to the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 (the &#8220;MPPA Act&#8221;), substantially expanded the potential liabilities of employers who participate in multiemployer pension plans. Under ERISA, as amended by the MPPA Act, an employer who contributes to a multiemployer pension plan and the members of such employer&#8217;s controlled group are jointly and severally liable for their share of the plan&#8217;s unfunded vested benefits in the event the employer ceases to have an obligation to contribute to the plan or substantially reduces its contributions to the plan (i.e., in the event of a complete or partial withdrawal from the multiemployer plans). The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 (the &#8220;Reform Act&#8221;), which was included in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2015 (the &#8220;CFCAA&#8221;) that was signed into law on December 16, 2014, includes new multiemployer pension provisions to address the funding of multiemployer pension plans in critical and declining status by reducing accrued benefits under those plans. Any actions taken by trustees of multiemployer pension plans under the Reform Act will not reduce benefit rates ABF Freight is obligated to pay under its current contract with the IBT; however, management believes the Reform Act is a constructive step in addressing the complex funding issues facing multiemployer pension plans and their contributing employers. See Note I to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more specific disclosures regarding the multiemployer pension plans to which ABF Freight contributes and the actions taken by one of these plans to seek approval for benefit reductions under the Reform Act. 

&#160; 

ABF Freight operates in a highly competitive industry which consists predominantly of nonunion motor carriers. ABF Freight&#8217;s nonunion competitors have a lower fringe benefit cost structure and less stringent labor work rules, and certain carriers also have lower wage rates for their freight-handling and driving personnel. Wage and benefit concessions granted to certain union competitors also allow for a lower cost structure than that of ABF Freight. ABF Freight has continued to address with the IBT the effect of ABF Freight&#8217;s wage and benefit cost structure on its operating results. The combined effect of cost reductions under the ABF NMFA, lower cost increases throughout the contract period, and increased 

&#160;

flexibility in labor work rules are important factors in bringing ABF Freight&#8217;s labor cost structure closer in line with that of its competitors; however, under its collective bargaining agreement, ABF Freight continues to pay some of the highest benefit contribution rates in the industry. These rates include contributions to multiemployer plans, a portion of which are used to fund benefits for individuals who were never employed by ABF Freight. Information provided by a large multiemployer pension plan to which ABF Freight contributes indicates that approximately 50% of the plan&#8217;s benefit payments are made to retirees of companies that are no longer contributing employers. 

&#160; 

Due to its national reputation, its working conditions, and its wages and benefits, ABF Freight has not historically experienced any significant long-term difficulty in attracting or retaining qualified employees, although short-term difficulties have been encountered in certain situations . Management believes that its employees are critical to ABF Freight&#8217;s focus on customer service and careful cargo handling. See &#8220;Reputation and Responsibility&#8221; within this ABF Freight Segment section for information regarding ABF Freight&#8217;s recognition for safety, claims prevention, and employee leadership. 

&#160; 

Competition, Pricing, and Industry Factors 

ABF Freight competes with nonunion and union LTL carriers, including YRC Freight and YRC Regional Transportation (reporting segments of YRC Worldwide Inc.), FedEx Freight, Inc., UPS Freight (a business unit of United Parcel Service, Inc.), Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc., Saia, Inc., Roadrunner Transportation Systems, Inc. , and the LTL operations of XPO Logistics, Inc. ABF Freight actively competes for freight business with other national, regional, and local motor carriers and, to a lesser extent, with private carriage, domestic and international freight forwarders, railroads, and airlines. Competition is based primarily on price, service, and availability of flexible shipping options to customers. ABF Freight seeks to offer value through identifying specific customer needs, then providing operational flexibility and seamless access to its services and those of our other operating segments in order to respond with customized solutions. ABF Freight&#8217;s careful cargo handling and use of technology, both internally to manage its business processes and externally to provide shipment visibility to its customers, are examples of how ABF Freight adds value to its services. 

&#160; 

Approximately 35% of ABF Freight&#8217;s business is subject to ABF Freight&#8217;s base LTL tariffs, which are affected by general rate increases, combined with individually negotiated discounts. Rates on the other 65% of ABF Freight&#8217;s business, including business priced in the spot market, are subject to individual pricing arrangements that are negotiated at various times throughout the year. The majority of the business that is subject to negotiated pricing arrangements is associated with larger customer accounts with annually negotiated pricing arrangements, and the remaining business is priced on an individual shipment basis considering each shipment&#8217;s unique profile, value provided by ABF Freight to the customer, and current market conditions. ABF Freight also charges a fuel surcharge which is based on the index of national on-highway average diesel fuel prices published weekly by the U.S. Department of Energy . While the fuel surcharge is one of several components in ABF Freight&#8217;s overall rate structure, the actual rate paid by customers is governed by market forces and the overall value of services provided to the customer. 

&#160; 

The level of tonnage managed by ABF Freight is directly affected by industrial production and manufacturing, distribution, residential and commercial construction, consumer spending, primarily in the North American economy, and capacity in the trucking industry. ABF Freight&#8217;s operating results are affected by economic cycles, customers&#8217; business cycles, and changes in customers&#8217; business practices. Freight shipments, operating costs, and earnings are also adversely affected by inclement weather conditions. In addition, seasonal fluctuations affect tonnage and shipment levels. The second and third calendar quarters of each year usually have the highest tonnage levels, while the first quarter generally has the lowest, although other factors, including the state of the U.S. and global economies, may influence quarterly freight tonnage levels. 

&#160; 

The trucking industry faces rising costs, including costs of compliance with government regulations on safety, equipment design and maintenance, driver utilization, and fuel economy, and rising costs in certain non-industry specific areas, including health care and retirement benefits. The trucking industry is dependent upon the availability of adequate fuel supplies. ABF Freight has not experienced a lack of available fuel but could be adversely impacted if a fuel shortage develops. 

&#160; 

The U.S. Department of Transportation (&#8220;DOT&#8221;) hours-of-service rules regulating driving time for commercial truck drivers became effective in January 2004. The effective date of the current hours-of-service rules issued by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (&#8220;FMCSA&#8221;) of the DOT was February 27, 2012, with a July 1, 2013 compliance date for selected provisions. Implementation of the hours-of-service rules has had a slightly negative impact on ABF Freight&#8217;s fleet utilization. The CFCAA amended certain provisions of the hours-of-service rules; however, the changes did not have 

&#160;

an impact on ABF Freight&#8217;s operations. Future modifications to the hours-of-service rules may impact ABF Freight&#8217;s operating practices and costs. 

&#160; 

The FMCSA issued a final rule, which became effective in February 2016, regarding the requirements for interstate commercial trucks to install electronic logging devices (&#8220;ELDs&#8221;) to monitor compliance with hours-of-service regulations. Motor carriers will be required to be in compliance with the mandate by December 2017. ABF Freight is in the final stages of equipping its fleet with ELDs and is in the process of integrating existing reporting with the new ELD solution that will allow for the electronic capture of drivers&#8217; hours of service, as well as improve administrative, dispatch, operational, and maintenance efficiencies. 

&#160; 

Technology 

Our advancements in technology are important to customer service and provide a competitive advantage. The majority of the applications of information technology ABF Freight uses have been developed internally and tailored specifically for customer or internal business processing needs. 

&#160; 

ABF Freight makes information readily accessible to its customers through various electronic pricing, billing, and tracking services, including a n application for mobile devices which allows customers to access information about their ABF Freight shipments and request shipment pickup. Online functions tailored to the services requested by ABF Freight customers include bill of lading generation, pickup planning, customer-specific price quotations, proactive tracking, customized e-mail notification, logistics reporting, dynamic rerouting, and extensible markup language (XML) connectivity. This technology allows customers to incorporate data from ABF Freight&#8217;s systems directly into their own Web site or backend information systems. As a result, ABF Freight&#8217;s customers can provide shipping information and support directly to their own customers. 

&#160; 

Wireless technology enhances the speed and utility of the system by streamlining procedures across ABF Freight&#8217;s transportation network. City drivers, dockworkers, dispatchers, and others are connected to the system and to customers in real time via mobile devices. These devices allow for more efficient shipment pickups, paperless dock operations, and optimal load planning. 

&#160; 

Insurance, Safety, and Security 

Generally, claims exposure in the motor carrier industry consists of workers&#8217; compensation, third-party casualty, and cargo loss and damage. ABF Freight is effectively self-insured for $1.0 million of each workers&#8217; compensation loss, generally $1.0 million of each third-party casualty loss, and $1.0 million of each cargo loss. We maintain insurance that we believe is adequate to cover losses in excess of such self-insured amounts. However, we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage will provide adequate protection under all circumstances or against all potential losses. We have experienced situations where excess insurance carriers have become insolvent. We pay assessments and fees to state guaranty funds in states where we have workers&#8217; compensation self-insurance authority. In some of these states, depending on the specific state&#8217;s rules, the guaranty funds may pay excess claims if the insurer cannot pay due to insolvency. However, there can be no certainty of the solvency of individual state guaranty funds. 

&#160; 

We have been able to obtain what we believe to be adequate insurance coverage for 2016 and are not aware of any matters which would significantly impair our ability to obtain adequate insurance coverage at market rates for our operations in the foreseeable future. A material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents, cargo claims, or workers&#8217; compensation claims or the material unfavorable development of existing claims could have a material adverse effect on our cost of insurance and results of operations. 

&#160; 

As evidenced by being a seven-time winner of both the American Trucking Associations&#8217; President&#8217;s Trophy for Safety and the Excellence in Security Award and a six-time winner of the Excellence in Claims/Loss Prevention Award, ABF Freight believes that it has maintained one of the best safety records and one of the lowest cargo claims ratios in the LTL industry. 

&#160; 

ABF Freight has been subject to cargo security and transportation regulations issued by the Transportation Security Administration (&#8220;TSA&#8221;) since 2001 and regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security since 2002. ABF Freight is not able to accurately predict how past or future events will affect government regulations and the transportation industry. ABF Freight believes that any additional security measures that may be required by future regulations could result in additional costs; however, other carriers would be similarly affected. 

&#160;

Environmental and Other Government Regulations 

We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other things: emissions control, transportation of hazardous materials, underground and aboveground storage tanks, stormwater pollution prevention, contingency planning for spills of petroleum products, and disposal of waste oil. 

&#160; 

New tractor engine design requirements mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) intended to reduce emissions became effective on January 1, 2007, and more restrictive EPA emission-control design requirements became effective for engines built on or after January 1, 2010. In August 2011, the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (the &#8220;NHTSA&#8221;) established a national program to reduce greenhouse gas (&#8220;GHG&#8221;) emissions and establish new fuel efficiency standards for commercial vehicles beginning in model year 2014 and extending through model year 2018. The new tractors ABF Freight placed in service in 2014 and 2015 are equipped with engines that meet such standards . In June 2015, the EPA and the NHTSA jointly proposed a national program that would establish the second phase of greenhouse gas emissions (&#8220;EPA/NHTSA Phase 2&#8221;) and impose new fuel efficiency standards for heavy-duty vehicles , such as those operated by ABF Freight, and also institute fuel efficiency improvement technology requirements for trailers beginning with model year 2018 and extending through model year 2027. A number of states have individually enacted , and California and certain other states may continue to enact , legislation relating to engine emissions, fuel economy, and/or fuel formulation, such as regulations enacted by the California Air Resources Board (&#8220;CARB&#8221;). At the present time, management believes that these regulations may not result in significant net additional overall costs should the technologies developed for tractors, as required in the EPA/NHTSA Phase 2 proposed rulemaking for later implementation dates , prove to be as cost-effective as forecasted by the EPA/NHTSA. However, although fuel consumption and emissions may be reduced under the new standards, emission-related regulatory actions have historically resulted in increased costs of revenue equipment, diesel fuel, and equipment maintenance, and future legislation, if enacted, could result in increases in these and other costs. We are unable to determine with any certainty the effects of any future climate change legislation beyond the currently enacted regulations, and there can be no assurance that more restrictive regulations than those previously described will not be enacted. 

&#160; 

ABF Freight stores fuel for use in tractors and trucks in 62 underground tanks located in 18 states. Maintenance of such tanks is regulated at the federal and, in most cases, state levels. We believe ABF Freight is in substantial compliance with all such regulations. The underground storage tanks are required to have leak detection systems, and we are not aware of any leaks from such tanks that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our operating results. 

&#160; 

Certain ABF Freight branch facilities operate with stormwater permits under the federal Clean Water Act (&#8220;CWA&#8221;). The stormwater permits require periodic monitoring and reporting of stormwater sampling results and establish maximum levels of certain contaminants that may be contained in such samples. ABF Freight is currently involved in litigation related to alleged CWA violations at a branch facility in New York, as disclosed in Note O to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K . &#160; T he site qualified for an exemption from the permitting requirements of the CW A under a procedure known as &#8220;no exposure certification&#8221; (&#8220;NEC&#8221;) ; however , the validity of the NEC filing is being contested in such suit. It is not possible to determine the likelihood of loss or the amount of any penalties which might be assessed against ABF Freight in this suit . 

&#160; 

We have received notices from the EPA and others that we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, or other federal or state environmental statutes, at several hazardous waste sites. After investigating our subsidiaries&#8217; involvement in waste disposal or waste generation at such sites, we have either agreed to de minimis settlements or determined that our obligations, other than those specifically accrued with respect to such sites, would involve immaterial monetary liability, although there can be no assurance in this regard. It is anticipated that the resolution of our environmental matters could take place over several years. Our reserves for environmental cleanup costs are estimated based on management&#8217;s experience with similar environmental matters and on testing performed at certain sites. 

&#160; 

Reputation and Responsibility 

ABF Freight is consistently recognized for best-in-class performance in service and in electronic and market innovation. In 2015, ABF Freight was named to Inbound Logistics&#8217; list of &#8220;Top 100 Trucking Companies.&#8221; For the third consecutive year and the fourth time overall, ABF Freight received the &#8220; Quest for Quality Award &#8221; from Logistics Management magazine. ABF Freight has been ranked in the top 25 on Selling Power magazine&#8217;s list of &#8220;Best Companies to Sell For&#8221; for 14 consecutive years. Marking the seventh year in a row to be honored by Training magazine, ABF Freight was listed twenty-third in the &#8220;Training Top 125 &#8221; in February 2016 . For the third consecutive year and the fifth time in the last six years, ABF Freight was named as the &#8220;National LTL Carrier of the Year&#8221; by the National Shippers Strategic Transportation 

&#160;

Council, which recognizes transportation providers on a quantitative scale in the areas of customer service, operational excellence, pricing, business relationship, leadership, and technology. 

&#160; 

ABF Freight is dedicated to safety and security in providing transportation and freight-handling services to its customers. As previously discussed in &#8220;Insurance, Safety, and Security&#8221; within this ABF Freight Segment section, ABF Freight is a seven-time winner of both the American Trucking Associations&#8217; President&#8217;s Trophy for Safety and the Excellence in Security Award, and a six-time winner of the Excellence in Claims/Loss Prevention Award. In January 2015, three ABF Freight drivers were named by the American Trucking Associations as captains of the 2015-2016 &#8220;America&#8217;s Road Team,&#8221; continuing the tradition of ABF Freight&#8217;s representation in this select program based on the drivers&#8217; exceptional safety records and their strong commitment to safety and professionalism. 

&#160; 

ABF Freight is actively involved in efforts to promote a cleaner environment by reducing both fuel consumption and emissions. For many years, ABF Freight &#160; has voluntarily limited the maximum speed of its trucks, which reduces fuel consumption and emissions and contributes to ABF Freight&#8217;s excellent safety record. ABF Freight also utilizes engine idle management programming to automatically shut down engines of parked tractors. Fuel consumption and emissions have also been minimized through a strict equipment maintenance schedule. In 2015, ABF Freight began voluntarily installing aerodynamic aids on its fleet of over-the-road trailers to further enhance fuel economy and reduce emissions. In 2006, ABF Freight was accepted in the EPA&#8217;s SmartWay Transport Partnership, a collaboration between the EPA and the freight transportation industry that helps freight shippers, carriers, and logistics companies reduce greenhouse gases and diesel emissions. In recognition of ABF Freight&#8217;s industry leadership in freight supply chain environmental performance and energy efficiency, the EPA&#8217;s SmartWay Transport Partnership awarded ABF Freight a SmartWay Excellence Award in 2014. For the past six years, ABF Freight was recognized in Inbound Logistics&#8217; annual list of supply chain partners committed to sustainability. Furthermore, in association with the American Trucking Associations&#8217; Sustainability Task Force, ABF Freight has participated in other opportunities to address environmental issues.

Asset-Light Logistics Segments &#160; 

&#160; 

As part of management&#8217;s long-term strategy to ensure we are positioned to serve our customers within the changing marketplace by providing a comprehensive suite of transportation and logistics services, we continued to strategically invest resources to grow our asset-light logistics segments during 2015. Through unique methods and processes, including technology solutions, these businesses provide various logistics and maintenance services without significant investment in revenue equipment or real estate. Competition is based primarily on price, service, and the ability to provide high-quality logistics solutions to customers. For the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, the combined revenues of our asset-light logistics segments (formerly referred to as &#8220;non-asset-based&#8221; segments) totaled $798.1 million, $722.5 million, and $571.8 million, respectively, accounting for approximately 29%, 27%, and 25% of our total revenues before other revenues and intercompany eliminations in the respective periods. Note M to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains additional segment financial information, including revenues, operating income, and total assets for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. 

&#160; 

Premium Logistics (Panther ) 

The Panther segment includes the operating results of Panther Premium Logistics, Inc., formerly Panther Expedited Services, Inc. which was founded in 1992 and acquired by the Company on June 15, 2012. Panther is a leading provider of premium logistics services including time-sensitive, mission-critical, and white-glove delivery. Panther provides expedited freight transportation services to commercial and government customers and offers premium logistics services that involve the rapid deployment of highly specialized equipment to meet extremely specific linehaul requirements, such as temperature control, hazardous materials, geofencing (routing a shipment across a mandatory, defined route with satellite monitoring and automated alerts concerning any deviation from the route), specialized government cargo, security services, and life sciences. Through its premium logistics and global freight forwarding businesses, Panther solves the toughest shipping and logistics challenges that customers face through a global network of owner operators and partners specializing in ground, air, and ocean shipping. Additional value is created for Panther customers through seamless access to both ABF Freight and ABF Logistics services which facilitate delivery of more holistic transportation and logistics solutions. As of December 2015, Panther had approximately 50 0 active employees to support its operations. 

&#160; 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, Panther revenues, which totaled $300.4 million, $316.7 million, and $246.8 million , respectively, accounted for ap p roximately 11%, 12%, and 11%, respectively, of our total revenues before other revenues and intercompany eliminations. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Panther&#8217;s expedited freight transportation customers communicate their freight needs, typically on a shipment-by-shipment basis, by means of telephone, email, internet, or Electronic Data Interchange (&#8220;EDI&#8221;). The information about each shipment is entered into a proprietary operating system which facilitates selection of a contracted carrier or carriers based on the carrier&#8217;s service capability, equipment availability, freight rates, and other relevant factors. Once the contracted carrier is selected, the cost for the transportation has been agreed upon, and the contract carrier has committed to provide the transportation, Panther is in contact with the contract carrier through numerous means of communication (including EDI, its proprietary Web site, email, fax, telephone, and mobile applications) and utilizes satellite tracking and communication units on the vehicles to continually update the position of equipment to meet customers&#8217; requirements as well as to track the status of the shipment from origin to delivery. The satellite tracking and communication system automatically updates Panther&#8217;s fully-integrated internal software and provides customers with real-time electronic updates. &#160; 

&#160; 

Substantially all of the network capacity for Panther&#8217;s operations is provided by third-party contract carriers, including owner operators, ground line-haul providers, cartage &#160; agents, air freight carriers, ocean shipping lines, and other transportation asset providers, which are selected based on their ability to serve Panther&#8217;s customers effectively with respect to price, technology capabilities, geographic coverage, and quality of service. Third-party owned vehicles are driven by independent contract drivers and by drivers engaged directly by independent owners of multiple pieces of equipment, commonly referred to as fleet owners. Panther owns a fleet of trailers, the communication devices used by its owner operators, and certain highly specialized equipment, primarily temperature-controlled trailers, to meet the service requirements of certain customers. 

&#160; 

Panther faces market competition from service providers that offer one or more similar premium freight logistics services. Panther&#8217;s highly fragmented competitive landscape includes both non-asset-based and asset-based logistics companies, including freight forwarders that dispatch shipments via asset-based carriers; smaller expedited carriers; integrated transportation companies that operate their own aircraft and trucks; cargo sales agents and brokers; internal shipping departments at companies that have substantial transportation requirements; associations of shippers organized to consolidate their members&#8217; shipments to obtain lower freight rates; and smaller niche service providers that provide services in a specific geographic market, industry, or service area. Panther and FedEx Custom Critical are North America&#8217;s largest expedited freight transportation service providers. In this market, Panther also competes directly with several small regional and specialized carriers that have close relationships with certain of their customers. Panther has many significantly larger competitors in the truckload market. The premium freight logistics market is the largest market in which Panther competes, and Panther is a relatively smaller and newer competitor in comparison to companies that have operations worldwide and those that have been in business for several decades. 

&#160; 

Quality of service, technological capabilities, and industry expertise are critical differentiators among the competition. In particular, companies with advanced technological systems that offer optimized shipping solutions, real-time visibility of shipments, verification of chain of custody procedures, and advanced security have significant operational advantages and create enhanced customer value. Panther&#8217;s performance in each of these areas of competitive distinction has enabled the segment to secure business and help meet growth expectations within the asset-light logistics portion of our business. In recognition of its commitment to quality, Panther was awarded the &#8220;Quest for Quality Award&#8221; in the expedited motor carrier category by Logistics Magazine in 2013. Panther was recognized by Inbound Logistics&#8217; as one of the &#8220;Top 100 Trucking Companies&#8221; in 2014 and 2015. 

&#160; 

Panther is subject to various laws, rules, and regulations and is required to obtain and maintain various licenses and permits, some of which are difficult to obtain. Panther&#8217;s network of third-party contract carriers must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the DOT, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service. Implementation of the current hours-of-service rules has had a slightly negative impact on Panther&#8217;s fleet utilization, and future modifications to these rules and other regulations impacting the transportation industry, which are more fully described in &#8220;Competition, Pricing, and Industry Factors&#8221; of the ABF Freight Segment section of Business, may impact Panther&#8217;s operating practices and costs. 

&#160; 

Panther&#8217;s operations are influenced by seasonal fluctuations that impact customers&#8217; supply chains and the resulting demand for expedited services. Expedited shipments may decline during winter months because of post-holiday slowdowns but can be subject to short-term increases, depending on the impact of weather disruptions to customers&#8217; supply chains. Plant shutdowns during summer months may affect shipments for automotive and manufacturing customers, and major weather events can result in higher demand for expedited services. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Transportation Management (ABF Logistics) 

The ABF Logistics segment includes the results of operations of our businesses which provide freight brokerage and intermodal transportation services, worldwide ocean shipping solutions, and transportation and warehouse management services. Our investments in the strategic development of our asset-light logistics operating segments include ABF Logistics&#8217; acquisitions of the privately-owned truckload brokerage firms Smart Lines and Bear on January 2, 2015 and December 1, 2015, respectively. As of December 2015, ABF Logistics had approximately 400 active employees to support its operations. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the segment&#8217;s 10 largest customers, on a combined basis, accounted for approximately 14% of its revenues. 

&#160; 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, ABF Logistics revenues, which totaled $ 203.5 million, $ 152.6 million, and $ 105.2 million , respectively, accounted for ap p roximately 7 %, 6 %, and 5 %, respectively, of our total revenues before other revenues and intercompany eliminations. 

&#160; 

ABF Logistics provides third-party transportation brokerage and management services throughout North America by sourcing a variety of capacity solutions, including dry van over the road and intermodal, flatbed, temperature-controlled, and specialized equipment, coupled with strong technology and carrier- and customer-based Web tools. ABF Logistics also provides LCL and FCL service through its ocean transport offering to approximately 90% of the total ocean international market to and from the United States. Furthermore, the segment provides scalable transportation and warehouse management services that can be customized to efficiently manage customers&#8217; supply chain needs. 

&#160; 

ABF Logistics does not own any revenue equipment, ocean vessels, or warehouses; instead, it relies on a network of subcontracted third-party transportation and service providers. The segment&#8217;s operating success depends on the ability to find suitable transportation and service providers at the right time, place, and price to provide freight transportation and management services for customers. ABF Logistics seeks to offer value through identifying specific challenges of customers&#8217; supply chain needs and providing customized solutions utilizing technology, both internally to manage its business processes and externally to provide shipment and inventory visibility to its customers. Additional value is created for ABF Logistics customers through seamless access to both ABF Freight and Panther services which facilitate delivery of more holistic transportation and logistics solutions. 

&#160; 

ABF Logistics operates in a very competitive market that includes approximately 13,000 active brokerage authorities, thousands of foreign and U.S.-based non-vessel-operating common carriers, freight forwarders, and a wide variety of solution providers, including large transportation integrators as well as regional warehouse and transportation management firms. ABF Logistics competes on service, product and supplier performance, and price. ABF Logistics was recognized for the first time on Transport Topics&#8217; list of &#8220;2015 Top Brokerage Firms.&#8221; 

&#160; 

The industries and markets served by the segment are impacted by seasonal fluctuations which affect tonnage and shipment levels and, consequently, revenues and operating results of the segment. Freight shipments and operating costs of the ABF Logistics segment can be adversely affected by inclement weather conditions. The second and third calendar quarters of each year usually have the highest business levels while the first quarter generally has the lowest, although other factors, including the state of the U.S. and global economies, may influence quarterly business levels. However, seasonal fluctuations are less apparent in the operating results of ABF Logistics than in the industry as a whole because of business growth in the segment. 

&#160; 

Emergency &#38; Preventative Maintenance (FleetNet) 

The FleetNet segment includes the results of operations of FleetNet America, Inc. (&#8220;FleetNet&#8221;), our subsidiary that provides roadside assistance and maintenance management services for commercial vehicles to customers in the United States and Canada through a network of third-party service providers. FleetNet began in 1953 as the internal breakdown department for Carolina Freight Carriers Corp. In 1993, the department was incorporated as Carolina Breakdown Service, Inc. to allow the opportunity for other trucking companies to take advantage of the established nationwide service. In 1995, we purchased WorldWay Corporation, which operated various subsidiaries including Carolina Freight Carriers Corp. and Carolina Breakdown Service, Inc. The name of Carolina Breakdown Service, Inc. was changed to FleetNet America, Inc. in 1997. FleetNet&#8217;s operations were expanded with the acquisition of a privately-owned business on April 30, 2014. FleetNet had approximately 350 active employees as of December 2015. 

&#160; 

FleetNet strategically competes in the commercial vehicle maintenance and repair industry in two major sectors: emergency roadside and preventive maintenance. FleetNet competes directly against other third-party service providers, automotive fleet managers, leasing companies, and companies handling repairs in-house via individual service providers. 

&#160;

While no one company encompasses all of FleetNet&#8217;s service offerings, competition is based primarily on providing maintenance solutions services. In partnership with best-in-class third-party vendors, FleetNet offers flexible, customized solutions and utilizes technology to provide valuable information and data to minimize fleet downtime, reduce maintenance events, and lower total maintenance costs for its customers. 

&#160; 

Emergency roadside service events of the FleetNet segment are favorably impacted by severe weather conditions that affect commercial vehicle operations, and the segment&#8217;s results of operations will be influenced by seasonal variations in service event volume. 

&#160; 

Household Goods Moving Services (ABF Moving) 

ABF Moving includes the results of operations of our businesses which provide third-party transportation, warehousing, and delivery services to the consumer, corporate, and military household goods moving markets. This segment includes the operations of Albert Companies, Inc., of which we acquired a 75% ownership in 2009 and the remaining 25% in 2011, and Moving Solutions, Inc., which was established internally to provide sales, marketing, technology, and customer service to facilitate our household goods moving businesses. In 2013, we acquired a privately-owned moving business to enhance the services offered by the ABF Moving segment. ABF Moving generates a significant portion of its revenues from military relocation services under government contracts. A substantial portion of the freight transportation related to consumer self-move services is handled by ABF Freight, which directly invoices customers for such services. Certain sales, marketing, technology, and customer service costs incurred by ABF Moving in support of consumer self-move services provided by ABF Freight are allocated to the ABF Freight segment at cost. ABF Moving had approximately 2 50 active employees as of December 2015. 

&#160; 

ABF Moving offers flexibility and convenience to the way people move through targeted service offerings for the &#8220;do it yourself &#8221; consumer, corporate account employee relocations, and government employee relocations. ABF Moving offers these targeted services at competitive prices that reflect the additional value customers find in the segment&#8217;s convenient, reliable service offerings. Industry leading technology, customer-friendly interfaces, and supply chain solutions are combined to provide a wide range of options customized to meet unique customer needs. ABF Moving competes with truck rental, self-move, and van line service providers, and a number of emerging self-move competitors who offer moving and storage container service. 

&#160; 

Albert Companies, Inc. was named one of the &#8220;Best Companies to Work for in Texas&#8221; in 2015. Albert Moving and Storage, a subsidiary within the ABF Moving segment, was honored as a 2015 Torch Award for Ethics recipient, as selected by the Better Business Bureau of North Central Texas in the large company category based on standard s of ethics, customer and supplier relationships, and overall business conduct . 

&#160; 

Operating results for ABF Moving are impacted by the state of the national economy, including housing, unemployment, and U.S. mobility, as well as decisions made by the U.S. military which affect personnel moves. Operations of the segment are also impacted by seasonal fluctuations, generally resulting in higher business levels in the second and third quarters as the demand for moving services are typically higher in the summer months. 

&#160; 

Corporate Reputation and Responsibility 

&#160; 

The value of the ABF and Panther brands is critical to our success. As previously discussed in &#8220;Reputation and Responsibility&#8221; within the &#8220;Freight Transportation (ABF Freight) Segment&#8221; section, ABF Freight is recognized as an industry leader for its commitment to quality, customer service, safety, and technology. Independent research has consistently shown that ABF Freight is regarded as a premium service provider, and that the ABF brand stands for excellence in the areas of customer service, reliability, strategic business partnership, and tactical problem solving. Our reputation is dependent on the image of the ABF brand as it applies to both ABF Freight and ABF Logistics. The Panther brand is also associated with premium service that surpasses customer expectations. 

&#160; 

Through our subsidiaries, we hold trademark registrations and applications for trademark registration in the United States and in international locations for numerous service marks, including ArcBest Corporation, ABF, and Panther, among many others. We believe these marks are of significant value to our business and play an important role in enhancing brand recognition and executing our marketing strategy. 

&#160; 

We have a corporate culture focused on quality service and responsibility. Our employees are committed to the communities in which they live and work. We make financial contributions to a number of charitable organizations, many 

&#160;

of which are supported by our employees. These employees volunteer their time and expertise and many serve as officers or board members of various charitable organizations. In our hometown of Fort Smith, Arkansas, we have been a long-time supporter of the United Way of Fort Smith Area and its 34 partner organizations. In 2015, with employee support, we again earned the United Way&#8217;s coveted Pacesetter award by setting the standard for leadership and community support. As a past winner of the Outstanding Philanthropic Corporation Award, we have been recognized by the Arkansas Community Foundation for the service that our employees provide to exemplify the spirit of good citizenship, concern for the community, and support of worthy philanthropic endeavors.
