 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

Background 

&#160;

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 5, 1998, under the name "Octillion Corp." On December 2, 2008, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to effect a change of name to New Energy Technologies, Inc. Effective as of March 9, 2015, we amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to SolarWindow Technologies, Inc.

&#160;

We have been developing two (2) sustainable electricity generating systems. These novel technologies are branded as SolarWindow&#8482; and MotionPower&#8482;. On March 2, 2015, we announced that we will exclusively focus on further developing and bringing to market products derived from our SolarWindow&#8482; technology.

&#160;

&#160; 3 

&#160;

At the time of this filing, our proprietary patent-pending SolarWindow&#8482; see-through (&#8220;transparent&#8221;) electricity-generating coatings are the subject of fourteen U.S. and international patent filings.

&#160;

Our SolarWindow&#8482; technology provides the ability to harvest light energy from the sun and artificial sources and generate electricity from a transparent, coating of organic photovoltaic (&#8220; OPV &#8221;) solar cells applied to glass and plastics. Our SolarWindow&#8482; technology is the subject of fourteen pending patents. Initially being developed for application on glass surfaces, SolarWindow&#8482; could potentially be used on any of the more than 85 million commercial and residential buildings in the United States alone.

&#160;

The development of our SolarWindow&#8482; technology has advanced through our Sponsored Research Agreement with the University of South Florida Research Foundation (&#8220; USF &#8221;) and continues to advance through the Stevenson-Wydler Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (the &#8220; NREL CRADA &#8221;) with the Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC (the &#8220; Alliance for Sustainable Energy &#8221;), which is the operator of The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (&#8220; NREL &#8221;).

&#160;

We have achieved numerous important milestones and overcome major technical challenges in the development of our SolarWindow&#8482; technology, including the ability to generate electricity on glass while remaining transparent. We have successfully scaled-up our technology from a single solar cell &#8211; only one-quarter the size of a grain of rice &#8211; to a working array of solar cells which form a one-foot by one-foot working prototype &#8211; our largest-ever SolarWindow&#8482;. A pane of glass coated with our SolarWindow&#8482; technology is fabricated by applying our see-through, electricity-generating coatings onto glass surfaces at room temperature and pressure, a significant technical achievement which may provide a manufacturing advantage over expensive and cumbersome high temperature and high positive or negative pressure-sensitive manufacturing methods common to conventional solar photovoltaic (&#8220; PV &#8221;) manufacturing.

&#160;

To advance the technical development and subsequent commercialization of our SolarWindow&#8482; products, we are actively seeking technology and product licensing and joint venture arrangements with research institutions, commercial partners, and organizations with established technical competencies, market reach, and mature distribution networks in the solar PV, building-integrated PV, and alternative and renewable energy market industries. We have not yet entered into any such arrangements.

&#160;

Our Important Milestones 

&#160;

We have been working to further designing, testing, our SolarWindow&#8482; technology, as well as developing a prototype of our SolarWindow&#8482;, for application to commercial flat glass in tall towers since November 2006. 

&#160;

To date we have achieved a number of important milestones in our development efforts, including:

&#160;

&#183; entered into the NREL CRADA which is still in effect. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; filed fourteen patent applications for our electricity-generating coating and SolarWindow&#8482; technology development efforts that are independent of both the USF sponsored research and NREL CRADA research. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; expanded the use of our SolarWindow&#8482; coatings to include two new product lines for commercial and military aircraft, and the safety and security of military pilots. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; determined the correct combination of compounds to create a single solar cells, which can successfully generate electricity on glass while remaining stable and transparent. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; scaled-up from a single solar cell to a one-inch by one-inch &#8220;array&#8221;. An &#8220;array&#8221; is an arrangement of multiple solar cells rather than an individual single solar cell. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; developed a method for spraying our see-through electricity-generating coatings onto glass surfaces at room temperature and pressure, a significant technical achievement which may provide a manufacturing advantage over expensive and cumbersome high temperature-specific and high positive or negative pressure-sensitive manufacturing methods common to conventional solar PV manufacturing. 

&#160;

&#160; 4 

&#160;

&#183; invented and fabricated novel contacts that conduct electricity on SolarWindow&#8482;, yet remain see-through. Conventional contacts for conducting electricity use materials which generally block visibility and inhibit transparency, sometimes otherwise creating visible lines on or &#8220;in&#8221; the window. &#160;

&#183; engineered new methods for absorbing light energy to improve the flow of electrons (negatively charged particles), a process fundamental to generating electricity necessary for power appliances and fixtures. In principle, this advance increases the efficiency of the solar cell and hence its ability to create more electricity from a given level of solar irradiation. &#160;

&#183; discovered new, solution-based compounds that successfully mobilize the electrons necessary for generating electricity on SolarWindow&#8482; and eliminated the use of other materials that could be prone to breakdown or failure. We have been able to produce these compounds from comparatively in-expensive starting materials, and have discovered methods that allow for reproducibility. &#160;

&#183; created methods for increasing power output by maximizing the number of solar-cells present in our SolarWindow&#8482; array for a defined surface area. &#160;

&#183; successfully scaled-up SolarWindow&#8482; prototypes from a one-inch square to a twelve-inch square (144 square inches in surface area). &#160;

&#183; generated electricity on flexible plastic using novel see-through SolarWindow&#8482; coatings. &#160;

&#183; developed new SolarWindow&#8482; coatings with increased transparency and improved color. &#160;

&#183; successfully fabricated its latest working window prototype using a faster, rapid scale-up process for applying solution-based coatings. &#160;

&#183; produced the largest OPV device ever fabricated at NREL in the institute&#8217;s history. &#160;

&#183; successfully collected and transported electricity using a virtually &#8216;invisible&#8217; conductive wiring system developed for SolarWindow&#8482;. &#160;

&#183; completed performance tests of its transparent electricity-generating coatings for glass and flexible plastics for glass-to-glass lamination processes. &#160;

&#183; successfully demonstrated SolarWindow&#8482; coatings performed under test conditions designed to simulate the high pressure and temperatures of the &#8216;autoclave&#8217; manufacturing processes used by commercial glass and window producers. &#160; SolarWindow&#8482; generates electricity by harnessing the energy of the sun and artificial light to create a &#8220;photovoltaic&#8221; effect. Photovoltaics (&#8220;PV&#8221;) are best known as a method for generating electric power by using solar cells to convert energy from the sun into a flow of electrons. Typically, conventional PV power is generated by making use of solar modules composed of a number of cells containing PV and electricity-conducting materials. These materials are usually opaque (i.e., not see-through) and generate electricity with sun light, only. Our researchers have replaced these materials with compounds that allow our SolarWindow&#8482; technology to remain see-through, while generating electricity when exposed to both sun and artificial light.

&#160;

&#160;

Products Derived from our SolarWindow TM Technology 

&#160;

On September 16, 2010, we publicly unveiled a working four-inch by four-inch prototype of our proprietary SolarWindow&#8482; technology. Scientists at the event powered lights on a scale-model house by exposing our transparent SolarWindow&#8482; to artificial light from fluorescent lamps, mimicking lighting typically installed inside offices. 

&#160;

Researchers also repeatedly opened and closed window shades, successfully powering LED lights each time SolarWindow&#8482; was exposed to natural light. This demonstration mimicked outdoor exposure such as sunlight on the exterior fa&#231;ade of commercial buildings &#8211; our initial target market and, we believe, a promising early application of the technology.

&#160;

Scientists at the debut event not only demonstrated the ability to generate &#8220;voltage&#8221; to power lighting, but also revealed SolarWindow TM capacity to produce &#8220;current&#8221; necessary for powering mechanical devices and appliances. Researchers successfully powered the mechanical rotor blades of a small helicopter using only a single, small-scale SolarWindow&#8482; prototype exposed to a solar simulator.

&#160;

In February 2012, we successfully developed the largest OPV device fabricated at NREL, measuring 170cm 2 , approximately 14 times larger than previous devices produced at NREL. In March 2012, we, in collaboration with NREL researchers, successfully collected and transported electricity using a virtually 'invisible' conductive wiring system developed for SolarWindow&#8482;. The ability to transport electricity on glass windows while remaining transparent is especially important to the eventual deployment of an aesthetically pleasing commercial product.

&#160;

On March 8, 2014, we made public never-before-seen images of our largest area, high-performance SolarWindow&#8482; arrays. These SolarWindow&#8482; arrays measure over 232 cm&#178; &#8211; a significant achievement for size, improving upon our previous achievements at NREL, and produced with highly-uniform, colored tints preferred by commercial window manufacturers for installation on skyscrapers, worldwide. Among the most important criteria for developing SolarWindow&#8482; coating applications for today's skyscrapers is providing a set of neutral colors that remain see-through and are uniform in fabrication. We revealed a record-breaking, largest-area transparent, OPV SolarWindow&#8482; array that addresses tall-tower and commercial building glass requirements, they also bear the promise of facile scale-up capabilities and manufacturability. This SolarWindow&#8482; array is over 35% larger than our previously-fabricated, 170 cm&#178; working module achievement. That prior module was already 14 times larger than the then-previous largest-area OPV module for the same type device structure ever fabricated at the NREL.

&#160;

In September 2014, we demonstrated SolarWindow&#8482; electricity-generating coatings to Congress during the first ever National Lab Day on Capitol Hill. National Lab Day was cosponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy. On April 8, 2015, Engineers and research scientists at the University of North Carolina Charlotte Energy Production and Infrastructure Center (&#8220; UNCC-EPIC &#8221;) have independently reviewed and validated our proprietary Model. The Model calculates a financial payback of less than one year for our transparent electricity-generating SolarWindow&#8482; technology. UNCC-EPIC team of engineering and science experts, who independently validated the modeling assumptions, reference data, and technical basis important to calculating our one-year financial payback period for SolarWindow&#8482; systems. UNCC-EPIC validation also confirmed the proficiency of our methodology for modeling the performance of competing PV technologies.

&#160;

In May, 2015 we announced plans to replace traditional electrical wiring connections with a simplified next-generation system for collecting the power produced by its transparent electricity-generating windows. In addition to reducing costs, ease of electrical installation will be important to window fabricators, glass installers (i.e., glaziers), electricians, and maintenance personnel. The replacement of today's cumbersome methods with our easy power connection system ('module interconnects') is also important for new construction and retrofit applications of SolarWindow&#8482; electricity-generating window modules on skyscrapers and tall towers.

&#160;

On August 20, 2015, we featured a first-ever demonstration of our working, electricity-generating window unit, during our webcast. Webcast participants witnessed clean electricity being generated on a demonstration window unit. Its glass is tinted in a high-demand color and framed in aluminum, popular with architects and developers of commercial towers &#8211; our target market. Participants also heard us explain exactly how we plan to: generate revenue, work towards product development and getting SolarWindow &#8482; ready for commercial manufacturing, build shareholder value, expand our name recognition and branding plans, increase investor outreach, engage media, and outlined important next steps for commercialization and bring SolarWindow&#8482; products to market. 

&#160;

&#160; 6 

&#160;

We are currently developing seven products (collectively, the &#8220; SolarWindow&#8482; Products &#8221;) derived from our SolarWindow&#8482; technology:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

SolarWindow&#8482; &#8211; Commercial &#8211; A flat glass product for installation in new commercial towers under construction and replacement windows;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

SolarWindowTM &#8211; Structural Glass &#8211; Structural glass walls and curtains for tall structures;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

SolarWindowTM &#8211; Architectural Glass &#8211; Textured and decorative interior glass walls, room dividers, etc.;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

SolarWindow&#8482; &#8211; Residential &#8211; A window glass for installation in new residential homes under construction and replacement windows;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

SolarWindow&#8482; &#8211; Flex &#8211; Flexible films which may be applied directly onto &#8220;previously installed (window) glass, similar to aftermarket window tint films, for retrofit to existing commercial towers, buildings, and residential homes; Note these films can also be applied to otherwise conventional windows during construction;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

SolarWindow&#8482; &#8211; BIPV &#8211; Components associated with BIPV applications in homes, buildings, and office towers; and

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

SolarWindow&#8482; Retrofit Veneer - Transparent, tinted, and flexible veneers that installers can apply directly over top of existing windows.

&#160;

Our focus is on the development and deployment of SolarWindow&#8482;-Commercial, Structural, and Architectural products. Our product development efforts have already produced early working prototypes for these applications. Commercialization of the SolarWindow TM technology will require significant further research, development and testing. This additional work should enable us to ascertain whether the SolarWindow TM technology can actually form the basis for a commercially viable technology or product.

&#160;

SolarWindow&#8482; Retrofit Veneer products are being developed as transparent, tinted, flexible veneers that installers can apply directly over top of existing windows. This expanded product line broadens our market reach beyond new and replacement installations, to include windows currently installed on the estimated five million commercial buildings constructed in the U.S. alone. This retrofit veneer product will be developed in parallel to the SolarWindow&#8482; products currently under product development.

&#160;

Our Industry and Market Opportunity 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

Global energy consumption is expected to increase 53% from 2008 to 2035, according to the Energy Information Administration, and domestic electricity prices have been rising as a consequence of the increased cost of conventional electricity generation fuels and the easing of price caps in some states.

&#160;

From a total glass market perspective, the world demand for flat glass is forecast to rise 6.3% per year through 2016 to 8.3 billion square meters. The global flat glass market is estimated to be worth $8.3 billion for 2016. Importantly, the global market value of fabricated flat glass is forecast to exceed $100 billion for 2016.

&#160;

America is the world&#8217;s largest consumer of electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, with nearly 70% of the nation&#8217;s electricity generated by coal and natural gas; 50% of the total U.S. electrical generation relies on coal, a fossil fuel. The environmental impact and rising costs of these non-renewable fuels, along with the potential doubling of global electricity consumption in the coming years, illustrate the need for more creative, sustainable methods for generating electrical power. A forecast of US electricity demand shows an expected increase is usage of 40% by 2032.

&#160;

We believe our products uniquely address a growing market opportunity for technologies able to generate sustainable electricity. Rising energy costs, increasing electricity consumption, and the need for a cleaner alternative to today&#8217;s non-renewable energy sources, all contribute to the growing demand for clean, renewable alternative energy sources.

&#160;

&#160; 7 

&#160;

The Market Opportunity for our SolarWindow&#8482; Technology and Products 

&#160;

Based on initial market research, there are no commercially marketed OPV see-through glass windows capable of generating electricity available for sale in the United States. We believe our SolarWindow&#8482; technology and products could be uniquely positioned as first-to-market, if commercially launched.

&#160;

Unprecedented levels of government initiatives, heightened residential demand for green construction, and improvements in sustainable materials are driving green building. Because buildings account for almost 50% of the energy consumed in developed countries, governments are putting increased focus on legislation and policies to improve their energy efficiency, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency. In North America, initiatives such as the environmental building rating system (LEED) run by the U.S. Green Building Council are helping to transform the market for added-value glazing, and this trend is expected to continue. We anticipate similar opportunities in Europe, through the development of a European Union-wide energy labeling system for windows. The growth rate for &#8220;Green Buildings&#8221; is rapidly increasing: 97.5% market share is in retrofits and 2.5% market share in new buildings.

&#160;

Our SolarWindow&#8482; Products are under development for application to glass surfaces in such buildings, often referred to as &#8220;architectural flat glass&#8221; and &#8220;fabricated glass products&#8221;. In the United States, the country&#8217;s ten largest cities have more than 444 million square feet of architectural glass, as estimated in a 2010 industry report on flat glass by Pilkington, a major global glass manufacturer. This market is growing in volume, with global growth of around 4-5% annually, with Europe, China and North America accounting for over 70% of global demand, according to the same report. Market research shows the global flat glass market is estimated to be worth $8.3 Billion.

&#160;

Our Competitive Strengths 

&#160;

We believe that the following strengths of our SolarWindow&#8482; technology should enable us to compete successfully in the alternative energy industry:

&#160;

&#183; Our products are first-of-their-kind solutions for generating sustainable electricity. There are no commercially-available transparent OPV products for sale in competition to our technologies and products, and therefore, our SolarWindow&#8482; and MotionPower&#8482; products may be positioned as &#8216;first-to-market.&#8217; &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Our products have unique characteristics, not readily-achievable by other technologies. Our SolarWindow&#8482; products generate electricity while remaining see-through, and are able to produce electricity from both natural and artificial light. These traits are unique to our products and technologies, and have not been replicated by any commercially-available technology. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Our SolarWindow&#8482; products are designed for application on the vast glass facades of commercial skyscrapers and are not confined to installation on limited rooftop space. The installation of typical roof-rack PV modules is often constrained by limited roof-top areas on commercial skyscrapers. In contrast, our SolarWindow TM Products may be applied to the entire vertical glass fa&#231;ades of skyscrapers. This is important in higher latitude countries where much of the sunlight strikes vertical surfaces more directly in contrast to a more oblique angle on horizontal flat roofs. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; The electricity generated by our technologies is compatible for use with existing energy infrastructure. Our SolarWindow&#8482; and MotionPower&#8482; products are under development for seamless applications in order to avoid burdening potential customers with special utility management systems. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; SolarWindow&#8482; repurposes passive windows as see-through energy generators. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Attractive, &#8216;passive&#8217; and totally silent product which addresses growing energy demand. 

&#160;

&#160; 8 

&#160;

&#183; Anticipated price point may help deliver greater energy and cost savings when compared to alternatives. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; SolarWindow&#8482; technology offers a sustainable and disruptive clean technology play. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Being developed for high volume and speed production using lower-cost, ambient, area-manufacturing techniques. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Go-to-Market strategy focuses on deployment using glass companies in an existing large global market with total glass market focus (Raw Glass, Handling, Tempering, Processing, Glazing/Assembly, Installation). &#160;

&#160;

&#183; The SolarWindow&#8482; product is the element of value is the inherent benefit of turning a passive window into an active electricity-generating window. 

&#160;

Our Business Strategy 

&#160;

Our goal is to complete the product development phase for our SolarWindow&#8482; technologies and then, to the extent warranted, work towards commercial launch of SolarWindow&#8482; products. Key elements of our business strategy include:

&#160;

&#183; Partnering with research institutions, product development firms, and others with proven technology expertise. We are currently working with scientists at NREL for the ongoing development of our SolarWindow&#8482; Products. We will seek to engage additional firms and institutions with important technical and product development competencies as needed. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Identifying partnerships for technology out-licensing and in-licensing opportunities . We are actively engaged in identifying potential industry or commercial partnerships for the out-licensing of our technologies, or, if warranted, the in-licensing of certain enabling technologies that could help accelerate our product development programs by reducing our need for internal research and development. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Fostering commercial partnerships and joint ventures with industry partners. We are continuously working to develop commercial partnerships and joint ventures with third-parties, which could help us accelerate the development of our sales and distribution pipeline for any products which we develop. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Developing pricing models that capitalize on available energy subsidies in order to make our products affordable and attractive to end-users. In developing pricing strategies for any products we are able to develop, we would seek to provide our potential customers with access to various subsidies, government incentives, tax credits, and other related financial mechanisms. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Developing cost-effective and efficient supply-chain management and manufacturing processes. Both our SolarWindow&#8482; and MotionPower&#8482; technologies and products would require manufacturing systems and supply-chain management expertise. We have begun to strategize and work towards addressing these needs in a cost-effective and efficient manner. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Identifying and potentially acquiring strategic and/or complementary technologies. We are actively engaged in identifying technologies which may be strategic and/or complementary to our SolarWindow&#8482; and/or MotionPower&#8482; technologies for potential acquisition. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Raising capital in new, engaging, and innovative ways in order to continue and potentially accelerate our path to commercialization as well as building shareholder value. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Formalizing strategic relationships with glass, energy, and building industries - partnerships can provide commercial reach. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Working with strategic partners to design and build SolarWindow&#8482; products that are ready for commercial production. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Identifying and developing additional applications and markets for our SolarWindow&#8482; products. &#160; &#160; 9 

&#160; &#160;

Competition for SolarWindow&#8482; Technology and Products 

&#160;

Competition in the solar PV industry is growing. Although we are not aware of other products utilizing technology substantially similar to our SolarWindow&#8482; technology, numerous solar cell technologies have been developed, or are being developed, by a number of companies.

&#160;

Such technologies include, but are not necessarily limited to, the use of organic materials, advanced crystalline silicon thin film concepts, amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride, copper-indium-gallium-selenide, titanium dioxide, and copper indium diselenide, and others to generate electricity from the sun&#8217;s light. Given the time, investment and advances in manufacturing technologies, any of these competing technologies may achieve lower manufacturing costs, superior performance, or greater market acceptance than our SolarWindow&#8482; technology product, currently under development.

&#160;

We face competition from many companies, major universities and research institutions in the United States and abroad. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources, experience in conducting research, experience in obtaining regulatory approvals for their products, operating experience, research and development and marketing capabilities name recognition and production capabilities. We will face competition from companies marketing existing products or developing new products which may render our technologies (and products) obsolete. 

&#160;

The descriptions of the products and technologies being developed or marketed by our competitors listed below have been taken from publicly available documents or reports filed by these companies:

&#160;

&#183; BELECTRIC Solarkraftwerke GmbH (through the acquisition of Konarka Technologies, Inc. and its assets) is focused on the development and advancement of nano-enabled polymer PV materials that are lightweight, flexible and more versatile than traditional solar materials. Following Belectric&#8217;s takeover of Konarka Technologies, the company plans to set up OPV production facilities in Germany in the coming months (Ref: October 24, 2012). Belectric has subsidiaries in seventeen countries. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Ubiquitous Energy is a company that began at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is initially moving toward the electronics (tablet &#38; E-reader, cell phone) market. Their first product seems to be a very clear, high VLT, low efficiency charging system for the electronics market. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Solarmer is developing organic photovoltaic or OPV technology, targeting portable power, off-grid power, and building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) markets. Solarmer will utilize its materials, devices, and roll-to-roll process technology to manufacture OPV modules with strategic partners throughout the world. Solarmer sells and provides OPV modules to product developers and system integrators who will integrate them into various products. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; ONYX Solar is a new type of solar company, while they are not an OPV material company, the company is considered a competitor in the space for generating power under low light conditions. Their current technology is mixture of semitransparent amorphous Si, Crystalline Si and possibly Copper, Indium, Gallium, Selenide (CIS or CIGS) and is also working on OPV. They are currently in production, and are generating revenue. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; XsunX, Inc. develops and markets proprietary Thin Film Photovoltaic (&#8220; TFPV &#8221;) solar cell designs and core solar cell manufacturing systems, enabling licensees to manufacture TFPV solar devices on various substrates. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; Sharp Corporation has developed mass-production technology for stacked triple-junction thin-film solar cells by turning a conventional two-active-layer structure (amorphous silicon plus microcrystalline silicon) into a triple-junction structure with amorphous silicon (two active layers) and microcrystalline silicon (single active layer). 

&#160;

&#160; 10 

&#160;

These companies may have numerous competitive advantages, including:

&#160;

&#183; significantly greater name recognition; &#160;

&#183; established distribution networks; &#160;

&#183; more advanced technologies and product development; &#160;

&#183; additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates, higher discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage; &#160;

&#183; greater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, obtaining regulatory approval for products, and marketing approved products; and &#160;

&#183; greater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing, and patent litigation. 

&#160;

Our commercial success will depend on our ability and the ability of our licensee or sublicensees, if any, to compete effectively in product development areas such as, but not limited to: safety, price, marketing and distribution.

&#160;

If our competitors were to succeed in developing products that are more effective than our SolarWindow&#8482; technology, some or all of our SolarWindow&#8482; Products could be rendered obsolete and non-competitive. Accordingly, in addition to our research and development efforts, we have undertaken a public relations, advertising, and market access outreach programs designed to establish our &#8220;brand&#8221; name recognition early on in our corporate development; we intend to continue to develop and market our brand name pending commercialization of products, if any, we may derive from our research and development efforts. We believe our strategy ultimately will facilitate the marketing, distribution and public acceptance of any products we may derive from our research and development efforts if and when regulatory approval is received.

&#160;

Competition with respect to our technologies is and will be based, among other things, on safety, reliability, availability, price, marketing, distribution and patent position. Our competitive position will also depend upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, to obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes, and to secure sufficient capital resources for the often substantial period between technology development and commercial sales. Another important factor will be the timing of market introduction of any SolarWindow&#8482; products we develop. Accordingly, the speed with which we can develop our SolarWindow&#8482; products, complete safety approvals processes and ultimately supply commercial quantities of any products we develop to the market is expected to be an important competitive factor.

Our MotionPower&#8482; technology, harvests &#8220;kinetic&#8221; or &#8220;motion&#8221; energy from vehicles when they slow down before coming to a stop and converts this captured energy into electricity. Our MotionPower&#8482; systems can be engineered as either discreet or disruptive products, depending upon customer specifications. These systems are also designed to function independently of daily management, and do not require the presence of wind, sunlight, or other natural environmental influences in order to function. Although we are not currently further developing the SolarWindow&#8482; technology, we are assessing potential market and commercialization options available to us with respect to the SolarWindow&#8482;, and the technology is the subject of fifty-nine patent filings . 

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

Our SolarWindow&#8482; technology may be subject to certain government regulations. Our ability to remain viable will depend on favorable government decisions at various stages of the technology&#8217;s development by various agencies. From time to time, legislation is introduced that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing our research and development processes, as well as approval of the manufacturing and marketing of any products derived from such research and development activities.

&#160;

The production and marketing of SolarWindow&#8482; technology derived products would be subject to existing safety regulations and may be subject to yet unknown regulations.

&#160;

Current safety requirements for electrical products can include, but may not be limited to, Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations, National Electrical Code as approved as an American National Standard by the American National Standards Institute or ANSI/NFPA-70, certification by Underwriters Laboratories and the Society of Automotive Engineers, and compliance with local building codes. These regulations are subject to change, and our ability to remain viable is contingent upon successfully satisfying regulatory requirements as stipulated by these agencies and/or others as the development of our SolarWindow&#8482; technology evolves.
