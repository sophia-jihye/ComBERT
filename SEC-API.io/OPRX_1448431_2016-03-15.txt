12) We began a search for a new CEO to help lead us through our next stage of growth, which culminated in the hiring of Will Febbo, who became CEO on February 22, 2016. &#160; 

We generated positive cash flow from operations in 2015, and we expect to continue to do so in 2016, as well as to be profitable during the upcoming year based on the expected escalation of revenues. 

&#160; 

Our success in acquiring, integrating and expanding into new promotional EHR/eRx platforms continues to grow as well. We are discussing 2016 rollout dates with potential additional networks. 

&#160; 

Pharmaceutical Sales and Marketing Updates 

&#160; 

Our sales team continues to expand opportunities within existing and new clients. We are focused on adding additional brands for existing clients, expanding the utilization of our network for existing brands, and obtaining new clients. 

&#160; 

Additionally, we are expanding our non e-Coupon services as follows: 

&#160; 

&#9679; New Drug File Integration &#8211; we are designing a service to better insure that manufacturers&#8217; drugs are present in every ePrescribing platform available. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; We are actively expanding our messaging capabilities with the goal of rapidly increasing revenue through this complementary service. &#160; 

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; ePrescribe Training &#8211; we are pursuing opportunities to leverage our partnership with WPP/Grey to train representatives on understanding and leveraging EHR sales opportunities. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; VoucherDVM - we continue advancing our negotiations with each of the leading veterinarian technology platforms and have signed an agreement with National Veterinary Associates, one of the largest veterinary groups in the U.S., to initiate a beta launch in January, 2016. &#160; 

We are also continuing to ramp up our marketing efforts as follows: 

&#160; 

&#9679; Held multiple meetings initiated and arranged by Pharmaceutical companies to bring on new Health Systems/ePrescribe Platforms. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Spoke at Coupon and Co-Pay Off-set Strategies Conference. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Spoke at multiple conferences in 2015, including the Marcum 2015 MicroCap conference, the Liolios 4 th annual Gateway conference and the LD Micro investor conference. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Sponsored the 3rd Annual ePrescribe/EHR Conference. &#160; 

With the growth of both our pharmaceutical products and our distribution network, we expect that our distribution of eCoupons will continue to increase substantially over last year. 

&#160; 

Operational Update 

&#160; 

In 2016, in addition to expanding our network, we plan to intensively focus on increasing physician utilization of our partner networks. We intend to working individually with each of our partners based on their particular situation to improve workflow to increase coupon utilization by those providers that have access, obtain access for those prescribers that currently do not have e-coupon access, and increase overall revenue derived from each channel. We believe there is significant revenue growth available within our existing brands by better utilizing our existing partner networks, in addition to the revenue growth provided by new brands and new network partners. 

&#160; 

In 2015, we began the search for an experienced EHR executive to lead our expansion efforts. In January, 2016, we hired James Brooks as Senior Vice President of Business Development to champion our EHR business through the development of new relationships with other EHR providers and patient platforms. 

&#160; 

Technology Updates 

&#160; 

To support our growth, we have migrated our platform to Oracle database software. The system can now manage up to 1 million rules and return the appropriate content within 1 second. This allows unsurpassed response time to avoid delays, and the ability to meet the upcoming dramatic scale we expect. 

&#160; 

We have launched downloadable &#8220;wrapper&#8221; code, which streamlines the integration requirements for our solution from a few weeks to a few days, if EHR channel partners choose to utilize this method. This addresses one of the biggest hurdles we face in getting health systems and EHRs to implement our system, given the extensive demand on their available technical resources. 

&#160; 

We have developed a stand-alone desktop eCoupon application that can be used by prescribers that either are not using an eprescribing application, or whose EHR vendor does not offer e-Coupon functionality. We have sold one such application to a major pharmaceutical manufacturer for use as a tool by their sales force and to distribute to physicians. We expect this to be a source of revenue growth in 2016. 

&#160;

Other Key Events in 2015 

&#160; 

We secured a strategic investment from WPP of approximately $4.7 million. The completion of this transaction represents a significant expansion of our relationship with WPP, the largest marketing services company in the world, and Lynn Vos, CEO of WPP&#8217;s subsidiary, Grey Healthcare Group, has joined our Board. We have hired a top executive to focus on overall client services, including the WPP relationship, and to focus on expanding opportunities available to us. 

&#160; 

In addition to the strategic value, we expect the WPP relationship to provide promotional support, help add pharmaceutical brands, aid in expansion of our EHR network, expand our service offerings, and help us expand our management and infrastructure. We anticipate that that the WPP relationship will have a significant and positive impact on our business. 

&#160; 

We also signed an agreement with Allscripts to become its exclusive provider of eCoupons throughout all of its platforms as well as to integrate our e-Coupons into its Touchworks network. The Touchworks platform is used by large health systems throughout the country and is expected to represent a significant expansion of our network. ECoupon functionality within Touchworks is expected to launch on a test basis in late 2016 and on a wide-scale basis in early 2017. 

&#160; 

Summary 

&#160; 

Despite the lengthy sales cycle involved in creating this new eCoupon market, we remain very excited about our core eCoupon business and expect acceleration to continue with the launch of additional channels and our joint pursuit of leading health systems with our pharmaceutical partners. We expect our active network to grow substantially in 2016. 

&#160; 

Principal Products and Applications 

&#160; 

Our principal products and applications can be summarized as follows: 

&#160; 

&#9679; SAMPLEMD - Our platform, which we refer to as SampleMD, is a revolutionary virtual &#34;Patient Support Center&#34; that allows doctors and staff to access a universe of sample vouchers, co-pay coupons and other patient support through their EMR and/or e-Prescribe systems to search, print or electronically dispense directly to patients and a national network of pharmacies. SampleMD eliminates the need for physicians to manage and store physical drug samples by offering a more convenient and efficient way to allocate, administer and track samples and co-pay savings provided to their patients. Today, almost 60% of doctors&#8217; offices ban or limit drug representatives and the samples they offer. Although samples are still valuable, many healthcare systems and doctors are looking for an easier, more effective way to increase affordable access and adherence to their prescribed branded medications. Over 90% of our revenue comes through activities related to our SampleMD platform. &#160; 

&#9679; OPTIMIZEHR &#8211; Our consulting practice is focused on educating and working with pharmaceutical manufacturers on identifying, formulating, and implementing new eRx media strategies for promoting their products. Our consulting services include: 1) Drug File Integration - a service designed to better insure that manufacturers&#8217; drugs are present in every ePrescribing platform available; 2) Sales Force Training &#8211; a service to educate the extended field sales force on this new integrated solution and what to look for within their client base to insure maximum exposure of their brands; and 3) Strategy Development &#8211; a service that assists manufactures in identifying and building a competitive strategy to take advantage of this new digital frontier. Currently, this activity results in less than 5% of our revenue, but represents a significant growth opportunity for us. &#160; 

&#9679; OPTIMIZERx.com &#8211; Our Direct to Consumer Website is a portal to healthcare savings for patients to centrally review and participate in prescription and healthcare savings and support programs. To date, we have over 2.4 million members who have registered. We strive to provide all the information and guidance that patients undergoing long-term pharmaceutical treatments may require. Patients can search by their medication or their condition in order to access educational information regarding their condition, information regarding their medication, coupons for instant savings when they purchase their medications, information on free drug trials, and guidance to any other savings programs available to them. At the present time, we generate no revenue through this site, but we believe it represents a significant potential future revenue source. &#160;

&#160; 

Marketing and Sales 

&#160; 

We continue to extend our marketing efforts to build both brand and capabilities awareness in the market. As previously discussed, we continue to actively participate in industry and partner events such as exlPharma and the ACE &#8211; Allscripts Users Conference, as well as taking a lead sponsor position in the CBInet eRx and EHR conferences in March and October of 2015. We are also the named sponsor of the March 2016 conference. During the course of the year, we also initiated and delivered successful email marketing campaigns, which generated viable leads for our sales force. 

&#160; 

In 2015, we also announced the expansion of our strategic partnership with WPP/Grey Health Group, a leading agency within the healthcare marketplace, which included a significant investment by an affiliated entity of WPP. We plan to continue to increase our marketing efforts with all of our strategic partners, as we intend to continue to promote our platform primarily through the following: 

&#160; 

&#9679; Industry and Partner Events; &#9679; Email Campaigns; &#9679; Internet Marketing; &#9679; Public Relations Campaigns; &#9679; Physician Offices; &#9679; Direct to Consumer Marketing; &#9679; Trade Media Advertising; &#9679; Pharmacy Partners; &#9679; Physician Organizations and Associations; and &#9679; Strategic Relationships. &#160; 

Competition 

Our platform competes in the highly competitive pharmaceutical and healthcare advertising industry that is dominated by large well-known companies with established names, solid market niches, wide arrays of product offerings and marketing networks. Coupon offerings compete for pharmaceutical budgets with a variety of other forms of advertising and promotion. 

Despite these overall competitors, we do not have major competition in our specific portion of the market. We have been experiencing a growing list of potential partners whom either have content that they want to deliver through our distribution engine and network, or whom have complementary technology and want to integrate our solution as a channel partner, expanding our reach to clinicians. The primary competitors in our space of the market are PDR Network, LLC and Physicians Interactive Holdings, Inc. However, we believe our breadth of brands offered, extensive list of pharmaceutical clients, and the vast reach of our network give us a substantial advantage and allow us to achieve a dominant position in the marketplace. 

Intellectual Property 

In 2012, we were awarded a patent for our innovative solution (US Patent No. 8,341,015). This award was a result of our extensive research and development efforts. The awarded claims cover our ability to electronically process, display and distribute eligible prescription savings on the medications and therapies healthcare providers wish to prescribe for their patients. 

We have hired Harness, Dickey &#38; Pierce, a nationally ranked IP firm, to further expand and protect our intellectual property. Through them, we have filed two additional patents on our technology. We believe our current and expanding IP will allow us to continue being the leader in this rapidly growing space. We stand ready to prepare additional filings, as necessary, to protect our intellectual property on any forthcoming solutions that will further assist and support physicians, pharmacists and patients.

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Fraud and Abuse Laws 

&#160; 

Anti-Kickback Statutes 

&#160; 

The federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or part under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid. The definition of remuneration has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash and waivers of payments. Several courts have interpreted the statute's intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals or otherwise generate business involving goods or services reimbursed in whole or in part under federal healthcare programs, the statute has been violated. The law contains a few statutory exceptions, including payments to bona fide employees, certain discounts and certain payments to group purchasing organizations. Violations can result in significant penalties, imprisonment and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Exclusion of a manufacturer would preclude any federal healthcare program from paying for its products. In addition, kickback arrangements can provide the basis for an action under the Federal False Claims Act, which is discussed in more detail below. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and potentially prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements, the Office of Inspector General of Health and Human Services, or OIG, issued a series of regulations, known as the safe harbors, beginning in July 1991. These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all the applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as the OIG. Arrangements that implicate the Anti-Kickback Law, and that do not fall within a safe harbor, are analyzed by the OIG on a case-by-case basis. Government officials have focused recent enforcement efforts on, among other things, the sales and marketing activities of healthcare companies, and recently have brought cases against individuals or entities with personnel who allegedly offered unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business. Settlements of these cases by healthcare companies have involved significant fines and/or penalties and in some instances criminal pleas. In addition to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, many states have their own kickback laws. Often, these laws closely follow the language of the federal law, although they do not always have the same exceptions or safe harbors. In some states, these anti-kickback laws apply with respect to all payors, including commercial health insurance companies. 

&#160; 

False Claims Laws 

&#160; 

Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Manufacturers can be held liable under false claims laws, even if they do not submit claims to the government, if they are found to have caused submission of false claims. The Federal Civil False Claims Act also includes whistle blower provisions that allow private citizens to bring suit against an entity or individual on behalf of the United States and to recover a portion of any monetary recovery. Many of the recent highly publicized settlements in the healthcare industry related to sales and marketing practices have been cases brought under the False Claims Act. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer's products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment.

Privacy and Security 

&#160; 

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and the rules promulgated there under require certain entities, referred to as covered entities, to comply with established standards, including standards regarding the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI. HIPAA further requires that covered entities enter into agreements meeting certain regulatory requirements with their business associates, as such term is defined by HIPAA, which, among other things, obligate the business associates to safeguard the covered entity's PHI against improper use and disclosure. While not directly regulated by HIPAA, our customers or distributors might face significant contractual liability pursuant to such an agreement if the business associate breaches the agreement or causes the covered entity to fail to comply with HIPAA. It is possible that HIPPA compliance could become a substantial regulatory burden and expense to our operations, although we do not believe that this will occur as a general website publisher. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 12 full-time employees and 3 part-time employees, in addition to contracted programmers, as needed, through our established relationship with Simple eSolutions, a technical and programming resources partner. 

&#160; 

Subsidiaries 

&#160; 

We conduct our operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, OptimizeRx Corporation, a Michigan corporation.
