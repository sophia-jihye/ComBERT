 ITEM 1 . BUSINESS 

&#160; 

&#160; Overview 

&#160; 

On July 1, 2015, Cable One, Inc. ( &#8220;Cable One,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;we&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) became an independent company traded under the ticker symbol &#8220;CABO&#8221; on the New York Stock Exchange after completion of its spin-off from Graham Holdings Company (&#8220;GHC&#8221;). The spin-off was effected through the distribution by GHC of 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Cable One to GHC stockholders as of the record date for the distribution (the &#8220;spin-off&#8221;) in a pro rata dividend (the &#8220;Distribution&#8221;). In connection with the spin-off, approximately 5.84 million shares of Cable One&#8217;s common stock were issued and outstanding on July 1, 2015 at 12:01 a.m., based on approximately 0.96 million shares of GHC Class A Common Stock and 4.88 million shares of GHC Class B Common Stock outstanding as of June 30, 2015. No preferred stock was issued or outstanding. 

&#160; 

We are a fully integrated provider of data, video and voice services in 19 Western, Midwestern and Southern states. We provide these broadband services to residential and business customers in 38 cable systems covering over 400 cities and towns. The markets we serve are primarily non-metropolitan, secondary markets, with 75% of our customers located in five states: Mississippi, Idaho, Oklahoma, Texas and Arizona. Our biggest customer concentrations are in the Mississippi Gulf Coast region and in the greater Boise, Idaho region. We are the tenth-largest cable system operator in the United States based on customers and revenues in 2015, making services available to approximately 1,644,000 homes in the United States as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we provided service to 664,604 residential and business customers out of approximately 1,644,000 homes passed. Of these customers, 501,241 subscribed to data services, 364,150 to video services and 127,094 to voice services. In the third quarter of 2015, we completed the implementation of a new billing system. This new billing system generally counts each unit in a multi-dwelling unit (&#8220;MDU&#8221;) as one home passed, whereas our prior billing system generally counted each MDU as a single home passed. Comparative period counts have not been adjusted for this new counting convention. 

&#160; 

We offer a complete solution of data, video and voice services in all of our markets. Ranked by share of our total revenues in 2015, they are residential video (41.2%), residential data (36.5%), business services (data, voice and video &#8211; 11.0%), residential voice (6.2%) and advertising sales (3.8%). The profit margins, growth rates and capital intensity of our five primary products vary significantly due to competition and product maturity. 

&#160; 

Prior to 2012, we were focused on growing revenues through subscriber retention and growth in overall primary service units (&#8220;PSUs&#8221;). To that end, our strategies consisted of, among others, offering promotional discounts to new and existing subscribers adding new services and to subscribers purchasing more than one service offering. 

&#160; 

Since 2012, we have adapted our strategy to face the relatively recent trend, affecting the entire cable industry, of declining margins in residential video and voice services. We believe these declining margins are due to competition from other content providers, increasing programming costs, rate increases, high levels of market penetration and increasing use of wireless voice services in addition to, or instead of, wireline voice. From 2013 through the fourth quarter of 2015, we shifted our focus away from maximizing customer PSUs and towards growing and maintaining our higher margin businesses, namely residential data and business services. Separately, we have also focused on retaining customers with a relatively high expected life-time value (&#8220;LTV&#8221;), who are less attracted by discounting, require less support and churn less. This strategy focuses on increasing cash flow, free cash flow and margins. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The trends described above have impacted our four largest product lines in the following ways: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Residential data . We experienced growth in the number of our residential data customers and revenues from sales to residential data customers in 2013, 2014 and 2015. We expect this growth to continue due to projected increases in the number of potential customers for us to serve, as there are still a number of households in our markets that do not subscribe to data services from any provider. We expect to capture a portion of these customers and anticipate capturing additional market share from existing data subscribers due to our recent upgrades in broadband capacity and our ability to offer higher access speeds than many of our competitors. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Residential video . Residential video service is a competitive and highly-penetrated business. As we focus on the higher-margin businesses of residential data and business services, we are de-emphasizing our residential video business and, as a result, expect residential video revenues to decline in the future. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Residential voice . We have experienced declines in residential voice customers as a result of homes in the United States deciding to terminate their landline voice service and exclusively use wireless voice service. We believe this trend will continue because of competition from wireless voice service. Revenues from residential voice customers have declined since 2012, and we expect this decline will continue. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Business services . We have experienced significant growth in business data, voice and video customers and revenues and expect this to continue. We attribute this growth to our strategic focus, which we began in 2013 and which we expect to continue in the future, on increasing sales to business customers. As noted above, in the third quarter of 2015, we completed the implementation of a new billing system. This new billing system counts each business customer relationship at a unique business address as a single customer, whereas our prior billing system calculated multiple relationships based on revenue generated at an address. This change in methodology negatively impacted our business data and voice customer counts in 2015 compared to 2014. Margins in products sold to business customers have remained attractive, and we expect this trend to continue. 

&#160; 

We continue to experience increased competition, particularly from telephone companies, cable overbuilders, over-the-top (&#8220;OTT&#8221;) video providers and satellite television providers. Because of the levels of competition we face, we believe it is important to make investments in our infrastructure. We are investing at an aggressive pace by increasing cable plant capacities and reliability, launching all-digital video services , which can free up approximately three-fourths of average plant bandwidth for data services, and increasing data capacity by moving from four-channel bonding to 32-channel bonding, an 800% increase. We believe these investments are necessary to remain competitive. However, we anticipate that a significant amount of these capital projects will be completed by the end of 2016, freeing up sources of cash that would otherwise have been used on such investments. 

&#160; 

The spin-off provided us the opportunity to further tailor our strategies to achieve greater operational focus and drive our return on investment. Our goals are to continue to grow residential data and business services and to maintain profit margins to deliver strong cash flow. To achieve these goals, we intend to continue our focus-driven cost management, remain focused on customers with high LTV and follow through with planned investments in broadband plant upgrades. 

&#160; 

Our business is subject to extensive governmental regulation. Such regulation has led to increases in our operational and administrative expenses. In addition, we could be significantly impacted by changes to the existing regulatory framework, whether triggered by legislative, administrative or judicial rulings. On February 26, 2015, the Federal Communications Commission (the &#8220;FCC&#8221;) voted to use its Title II authority to regulate broadband Internet access services, and on March 12, 2015, the FCC released the text of the Open Internet Order (the &#8220;Order&#8221;). According to the Order, under this regime, the FCC will forbear from systematic rate regulation of Internet access service at the subscriber level, which we believe will permit us to continue to manage data usage efficiently by establishing appropriate rates. An appeal to overturn the Order is currently pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. However, we cannot predict whether or not future changes to the regulatory framework that are inconsistent with the Order will occur or whether the appeal will be successful. 

&#160; 

We serve our customers through a plant and network with 100% two-way capacity currently measuring approximately 750 MHz on average and DOCSIS 3.0 capabilities in all of our systems. Our technically advanced infrastructure provides for delivery of a full suite of data, video and voice products. Our broadband plant offers fiber-to-the-node with ample unused capacity and standard download speeds of 100 Megabits per second (&#8220;Mbps&#8221;), which meaningfully distinguishes our offering from competitors in most of our markets. We expect to complete a substantial multi-year investment program in our plant by the end of 2016, which will result in increased broadband capacity and reliability and which has enabled and will continue to enable us to offer even higher download speeds to our customers (at both the standard and enhanced data service levels), which we believe will reinforce our competitive strength in this area. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Corporate History 

&#160; 

In 1986, The Washington Post Company (the prior name of our prior corporate parent, GHC) acquired from Capital Cities Communications, Inc. a number of other companies owning, in total, 53 cable television systems. The Washington Post Company paid $350 million for these systems. The cable systems acquired in that transaction had approximately 350,000 subscribers in 15 Western, Midwestern and Southern states. All other mid-sized cable operators that existed when we were established have since exited the cable business. 

&#160; 

Subsequent to the Capital Cities transaction, we completed over 30 acquisitions and dispositions of cable systems, both through cash sales and trades of certain of our cable systems for cable systems of other cable operators, ultimately increasing our customer count to the current total of approximately 665,000. We have been disciplined about the price we pay in acquisitions, acquiring new customers opportunistically at what we considered favorable prices. In the process, we have substantially reshaped our original geographic footprint and resized our typical system, exiting a number of metropolitan markets and many very small markets. For example, we traded to other cable operators our cable systems in the Chicago, San Francisco, Cleveland and Indianapolis markets (which we acquired as part of the Capital Cities transaction) for cable systems in non-metropolitan markets that fit our business model. 

&#160; 

While we are smaller than the nation&#8217;s biggest cable companies, we have a record of consistent, long-term financial and operational success driven by our differentiated operating philosophy. We emphasize focus as opposed to scale, which is a departure from more conventional strategies in the cable industry, but is well suited to the markets in which we operate and enables us to take advantage of our strengths as a cable operator. 

&#160; 

Industry Overview 

&#160; 

Cable companies in the United States are typically fully integrated providers of video, data and voice services to residential and business customers in various geographic regions. A dedicated local headend typically serves each of a cable company&#8217;s individual cable systems, receiving video, data and voice service signals by connecting directly to the network backbone, which aggregates signals delivered through over-the-air broadcasting, fiber optic networks and satellite transmissions. From the headend, cable companies modulate, amplify and distribute these signals over a proprietary network of coaxial and fiber optic cable to the homes and businesses of subscribers via cable modems and television set-top boxes. In addition to leasing physical access to the network backbone from telecommunications companies, cable companies also purchase licenses to provide their subscribers with access to cable television channels owned by programmers and distributed over the network backbone. Cable companies also typically sell advertising on their video channels. The cable industry has benefited from a progression of profitable new broadband product introductions over the past 15 years, including, but not limited to, high-speed data service, high-definition and digital video service and Voice over Internet Protocol (&#8220;VoIP&#8221;) voice service. 

&#160; 

Cable companies generate revenue by charging subscription fees to their residential and business customers, typically billed in advance on a monthly basis, at rates that vary according to the data, video and/or voice services for which customers subscribe, and the type of video and Internet access equipment furnished to them, as well as through advertising sales. The margins that a cable company can earn on its PSU offerings vary from product to product. Because of rising programming costs, the profit margin on video services is generally lower than it once was and significantly lower than the current margins on data services. Despite low video margins, the strategy of many cable companies is to market and sell all three PSUs as a single &#8220;triple play&#8221; package in order to maximize the number of PSUs per household. Many in the industry believe it is desirable to sell all three products as a package because they consider video service a gateway offering to sell data service and because fixed costs per customer can be spread over multiple PSUs. However, recent industry trends have been towards increases in data subscribers even as video subscriptions have declined. 

&#160; 

Cable companies generally operate by establishing cable systems in geographic markets under non-exclusive franchises granted by state or local authorities for specified periods of time. The most sought-after markets by major cable companies have generally been the largest metropolitan markets. These markets are thought to offer the advantages of population density (which may permit efficient construction and operation of a cable distribution system) and attractive demographics, including customers with higher income-per-household than their counterparts in non-metropolitan, secondary markets, leading to lower price sensitivity and a willingness to purchase a greater number of PSUs. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Our Strengths 

&#160; 

We have a variety of strengths as a cable operator, stemming from, among other things, ongoing capital investments in our plant and our focus on serving customers in non-metropolitan markets. These strengths include the following: 

&#160; 

Attractive markets . Our customers are located primarily in non-metropolitan, secondary markets with favorable competitive dynamics in comparison to major urban centers. In particular: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

We tend to face less vigorous competition from telephone companies than cable operators in metropolitan markets. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Advances in technology come later to our markets&#8212;for example, very few of our competitors offer fiber-to-the-home. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Our subscribers tend to be value-focused, enabling us to save costs by not carrying expensive programming options with low subscriber demand. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

We are regionally diversified, reducing the impact that an economic downturn in a specific geographic market would have on our overall business. 

&#160; 

Deep customer understanding. We have operated as a non-metropolitan cable business for over 20 years. In order to understand our customers&#8217; demands and preferences, we have conducted daily customer research for nearly two decades and currently conduct thousands of customer satisfaction surveys per year. We believe we have gained valuable insight into how to serve customers in non-metropolitan markets, including with respect to providing an optimal mix of video channel options, price points and best-in-class customer service levels. 

&#160; 

Superior broadband technology with ample unused capacity . We offer our residential and business data customers Internet products at faster speeds than those available from competitors in most of our markets. Our broadband plant consists of a hybrid fiber coax (&#8220;HFC&#8221;) system offering fiber-to-the-node with ample unused capacity. Our standard broadband offering for our residential customers between 2011 and the third quarter of 2015 was a download speed of 50 Mbps, which is at the high end of the range of standard residential offerings even today in our markets. In October 2015, we doubled our standard download speeds for new and existing residential customers in more than 90% of our markets to 100 Mbps. Our enhanced broadband offering for our residential customers is currently a download speed of up to 200 Mbps. 

&#160; 

In addition, we have made significant investments in our business consistent with our strategic focus to enhance sales of residential data services and business services. We expect to complete substantial, multi-year plant and product enhancements by the end of 2016, which will increase our broadband capacity and reliability. These initiatives caused us to incur several years of higher than usual capital spending. However, we believe the competitive benefits will be significant, particularly for data services. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Since 2014, we decreased the average number of data customers per unique service area by 32% to below 175 by aggressively splitting service areas (fiber nodes), which substantially improves data throughput during periods of peak usage, minimizing disruptions in data access speeds to our customers. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

In 2015, we completed a three-year plant reinforcement project in substantially all of our cable systems, which enhanced reliability and expanded average plant bandwidth to an average of 750 MHz. We expect to complete the reinforcement of our remaining cable systems in the second quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

In 2016, we expect to complete a 30-month replacement of nearly all headend cable modem termination systems, allowing us to move from four-channel bonding to 32-channel bonding, an 800% increase. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

In the first quarter of 2016, we will begin to systematically roll out our 1 Gigabit data service (GigaONE TM ) to residential customers in our markets. We expect that this level of service will be available to the majority of our residential customers by the end of 2016. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

In 2016, we expect to complete a four-year video product conversion to all-digital distribution, which can free up approximately three-fourths of average plant bandwidth for data services at speeds up to and exceeding 1 Gigabit per second (&#8220;Gbps&#8221;). 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We anticipate the foregoing capital projects will facilitate sustained increases in residential data and business services and customer satisfaction. We also believe that our levels of capital spending will decline going forward as these large projects are completed. 

&#160; 

Low cost structure and competitive pricing . We believe our operating and capital costs, taken as a whole, are as low as or lower than any major cable operator. We attribute our low cost structure to a commitment to focusing on retaining our highest value customers, rather than seeking to obtain as many customers as possible, and the lower costs of operations available in a non-metropolitan market compared to a metropolitan market. In addition, because we operate our residential and business broadband data service with a competitive plant and cost structure, we are able to offer our customers both attractive pricing and compelling products. 

&#160; 

Customer satisfaction . We have a customer-focused approach, influencing how we are organized, how we sell our services and how we service our customers. For example, we offer a same-day-service guarantee in almost every one of our markets, which we believe none of our major competitors in our markets currently offer. We believe that our dedication to providing a differentiated customer experience is an important driver of our overall value proposition and creates loyalty, improves customer retention and drives increased demand for our services. We have always focused on customer satisfaction, with an emphasis on consistently benchmarking our customer satisfaction over time and relative to our competitors based on internally and externally generated customer-satisfaction data. 

&#160; 

Associate satisfaction. We have also focused on employee, or associate, satisfaction, believing our customers&#8217; satisfaction is tightly linked to our associate satisfaction. Associate satisfaction has been routinely measured over time internally and has been consistently high throughout the past decade, based on internal measurements. We currently measure our associate satisfaction annually. None of our employees have been unionized for over two decades. 

&#160; 

Experienced management team . Our senior management team is comprised of senior executives who have significant experience in the cable industry. Our executive management team has an average tenure at Cable One (or its predecessors) of approximately 20 years, and we believe this team is deeply knowledgeable about cost and competitive conditions in our markets. They also understand and are deeply committed to our strategy, which we developed on a collaborative basis over many years. 

&#160;

Our Strategies 

&#160; 

We have a multi-faceted strategy that builds upon our long track record of focusing on the right markets, the right products and the right customers, as well as controlling our operating and capital costs. More specifically, our strategy includes the following principal components: 

&#160; 

Focus on larger non-metropolitan markets. We believe our decision over 20 years ago to concentrate on non-metropolitan markets has served us well and we intend to continue to focus on offering our products primarily in these markets. The cable economics of non-metropolitan markets, for which we have optimized our strategy and our operations, are different from cable operations in major cities, and yield positive operating results for our business. Because price points for services in non-metropolitan markets are generally lower, and customers in non-metropolitan markets tend to subscribe to fewer PSUs, our average revenue per user and PSUs are lower than they might be in metropolitan markets. However, many of our costs are lower than they would be in metropolitan markets. The dynamics of larger, non-metropolitan markets enable us to operate at attractive margins and earn substantial returns, while remaining consistent with our focus on meeting customer demand for low prices while simultaneously keeping costs down. In addition, we tend to face less vigorous competition from telephone companies than cable operators in metropolitan markets. 

&#160; 

Maximize free cash flow and drive profitable growth. We concentrate on the products and customers that maximize our free cash flow and provide the best opportunity for profitable growth. We believe residential video and residential voice face inexorable long-term declines. With respect to the video product, programmers are charging higher rates for content to cable companies providing video services (often for content for which viewership is declining), and cable companies have had to choose between absorbing those increases to the detriment of their margins or passing on the full cost to customers, which adversely affects customer demand. At the same time, the rapid expansion of OTT offerings via the Internet has given customers new alternatives to cable companies&#8217; video offerings. In addition, demand for cellular and smartphone offerings have reduced residential voice starts for us and others in our industry. As a result, we have reduced our focus on these two products and prioritized higher growth opportunities such as residential data and business services. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We have declined to cross-subsidize our video business with cash flow from our higher growth, higher margin products, which has resulted in our residential video customers declining at a faster rate than the industry average. Our residential video customers decreased by 19.8% in 2015 versus 2014 and by 16.9% in 2014 versus 2013. Our residential video revenues declined by $29.0 million, or 8.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 versus 2014 and by $24.5 million, or 6.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 versus 2013. While this strategy runs contrary to conventional wisdom in the cable industry, which puts heavy emphasis on video customer counts and maximizing the number of PSUs per customer by bundling services, we believe it best positions us for long-term success. For us, success in winning and retaining residential data and business services customers are far more important metrics than the number of triple-play customers we have. 

&#160; 

Target higher value residential customers. Over the past three years, we have introduced rigorous analytics to determine the LTV of current and potential residential customers. We target marketing and customer service at customers who we believe are likely to produce the greatest free cash flow over the life of their service relationships with us, rather than seeking to obtain the highest possible number of new customers. We analyze the net present value of every residential start and seek to identify customers with relatively higher LTV than other potential customers. These high-LTV customers tend to be more likely than low-LTV customers generally to buy data service rather than video service, less likely to contribute to overall customer churn and more likely to pay on time. By seeking to retain and sell more services to residential customers with a high LTV, we are significantly reshaping our customer base. This has enabled us to earn higher profits with fewer customers and PSU subscriptions. We believe that optimizing the LTV of data-only customers as video and voice cord-cutting accelerates is both a necessity and an opportunity for our business. 

&#160; 

Drive growth in residential data and business services. We believe our residential data and business services products provide attractive current and future growth opportunities. Our disciplined prioritization of residential data and business services is reflected in everything we do, including pricing, the allocation of sales, marketing and customer service resources, capital spending and the way we conduct negotiations with suppliers, especially video suppliers. During 2015, we continued to further diversify our revenue streams away from video as residential data and business services represented 47.5% of our total revenues versus 42.0% for 2014. Our residential data revenues grew to $294.5 million in 2015, a 10.8% increase versus 2014. We believe we have demonstrated that it is possible to decouple unit growth in our residential data and residential video businesses, which historically have been marketed as a package. Our data-only connects are growing significantly faster than any other segment of our residential business. We expect that a majority of our residential customers will be data-only in the future. 

&#160; 

Our business services revenues grew to $88.7 million in 2015, a 15.5% increase versus 2014. We expect to generate continued growth in business services by leveraging our existing infrastructure capabilities and footprint to offer higher broadband speeds than other providers in our markets and to expand our business services to attract more small, mid-size and enterprise business customers. 

&#160; 

Continue our culture of cost leadership. We do not subscribe to the view that a mid-sized cable company cannot be successful because we believe that successful strategies that substitute focus for size can be as effective as the economies-of-scale strategy pursued by many of our competitors. 

&#160; 

We believe our total combined operating and capital costs per PSU over the past decade have been among the lowest of any cable company with publicly reported numbers and that our operating margins compare very favorably with those of significantly bigger firms in the cable industry. This is the antithesis of normal cable economies-of-scale expectations, where higher volumes are expected to create lower costs per PSU and increase operating margins. Rather than increasing our size and seeking cost savings through economies-of-scale, we have achieved our lower cost structure over many years by focusing on: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

serving non-metropolitan, secondary markets and not expanding into metropolitan markets, which contain different customer dynamics and would require us to implement additional operational components; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

the adoption of new technologies only after they have been tested by other companies in other markets, rather than incurring the level of capital expenditures necessary to be an early adopter of all new technologies; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

implementing a virtually centralized call center to receive inbound customer service calls and dispatch technicians across all of our markets, while keeping the majority of our call center associates in our non-metropolitan markets; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

standardizing our cable programming offerings across our markets, which reduces our customer service costs, in contrast to other cable companies that offer different programming packages in different markets; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

focusing on high-LTV customers rather than retaining or seeking to obtain non-value adding customers; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

recently, aligning our resources to emphasize increased sales of residential data services and sales to business customers, rather than committing resources equally to sales of all of our products. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We believe our strategy of focus has produced positive results. From 2011 through December 31, 2015, we have experienced a 73% reduction in bad debt; a 28% reduction in the frequency of telephone customer service calls, resulting in a 25% headcount reduction in telephone customer service personnel; a decline of 22% in the frequency of technicians being dispatched to customer locations, resulting in a 15% headcount reduction in the staff devoted to that function; and an overall headcount reduction of 358, representing a reduction, primarily through attrition, of more than 15% of our total workforce (1,972 associates as of the end of 2015). 

&#160; 

Balanced capital allocation . We are committed to a disciplined approach to evaluating acquisitions and internal investments, capital structure optimization and return of capital. 

&#160;

Our Products 

&#160; 

Residential Video Services 

&#160; 

For 2015, residential video services represented approximately 41.2% of our total revenues. We offer a broad variety of residential video services, generally ranging from a basic video service to a full digital service with access to hundreds of channels. Our basic video service generally consists of local networks, local community programming, such as governmental and public access, and certain other channels, such as weather, shopping and religious channels. Our digital video service includes national and regional cable networks, premium channels, music channels and an interactive, electronic programming guide with parental controls. Premium channels include networks such as HBO, Showtime, Starz and Cinemax that generally offer, without commercial interruption, movies, original programming, live sporting events and concerts and other features. Our digital video customers may also subscribe to our advanced services. Our advanced video services include TiVo DVRs, which digitally record programming and pause and rewind live programming, and high-definition set-top boxes, which provide high-resolution picture quality, improved audio quality and a wide-screen format and allow our customers to access Internet content on their televisions. 

&#160; 

Our TV Everywhere product enables our video customers to stream content on their computers, allowing them to watch our programming away from a television. Customers also have the ability to browse our program guide, search for programming and schedule DVR recordings from inside and outside the home online and through our mobile TV app. Our online offerings include many of our largest and most popular networks, including HBO and Cinemax. 

&#160; 

Residential Data Services 

&#160; 

For 2015, residential data services represented approximately 36.5% of our total revenues. We offer multiple tiers of data services with download speeds up to 200 Mbps to our residential customers. In the first quarter of 2016, we will begin to systematically roll out our 1 Gigabit data service (GigaONE TM ) to residential customers in our markets, and we expect that this level of service will be available to the majority of our residential customers by the end of 2016. Our data services also include our Internet portal, http://home.cableone.net , which provides multiple e-mail addresses. To meet the increasing bandwidth needs of our customers who use multiple Internet-connected devices in the home, our customers may lease wireless routers to maximize their wireless Internet speeds. 

&#160; 

Residential Voice Services 

&#160; 

For 2015, residential voice services represented approximately 6.2% of our total revenues. Our residential voice service transmits digital voice signals over our network and is an interconnected VoIP service. Our voice services include unlimited local and long-distance calling, voicemail, call waiting, three-way calling, caller ID, anonymous call rejection and other features. Our voice services also provide international calling by the minute. 

&#160;

Business Services 

&#160; 

We consider the data, voice and video services products we sell to our business customers as a separate product from our residential versions of these services. For 2015, business services represented approximately 11.0% of our total revenues. We offer multiple tiers of data, voice and video services for a variety of small-sized to enterprise-level businesses. Business video packages range from a basic video service tier to a comprehensive video selection including variety, news and sports programming in high-definition. We offer our business customers data services with download speeds ranging from 25 Mbps to 200 Mbps, with varying upload speed options and the ability to have a single Internet Protocol (&#8220;IP&#8221;) address, which increase their ability to provide uninterrupted services to their own customers. Business voice services packages range from one line to multi-line options including availability of all the most popular calling features like caller ID, call waiting, call forwarding and much more. We also lease fiber-optic cable capacity on a wholesale basis to our business customers. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We offer dedicated bandwidth via fiber optic technology to medium-sized and enterprise-level businesses, in addition to wholesale services to other carriers. Our fiber optic-based products include Dedicated Internet Access and Ethernet Private Line with speeds ranging from 10 Mbps to 10 Gbps in scalable increments. We also offer Network to Network Interface connections to other carriers at multiple Points of Presence across the United States. 

&#160; 

Advertising 

&#160; 

For 2015, advertising sales represented approximately 3.8% of our total revenues. Our agreements with each of our programmers provide that we may sell a specified amount of time on our programmers&#8217; channels, during both local and national programming spots, to our advertising customers. We also produce television commercials for these customers. We also sell advertising space on select cable network websites. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

We operate in highly competitive, subscriber-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products, services and content to subscribers. Our competitors have historically included, and we expect will continue to include, over-the-air reception providers; direct broadcast satellite (&#8220;DBS&#8221;) providers; telephone companies that offer data and video services through digital subscriber line (&#8220;DSL&#8221;) technology or fiber-to-the-node networks; and other cable companies that have been granted a franchise to operate in a geographic market in which we are already operating. 

&#160; 

Substantially all of our cable systems are in markets in which CenturyLink or AT&#38;T is the established local telephone company and our primary competitor. The remainder of our cable systems are in markets where we compete with various other companies. CenturyLink, AT&#38;T (through its U-verse brand) and other companies have overbuilt approximately 25% of our homes passed with fiber-to-the-node or other high-speed networks, such that they are able to offer voice, video and data services with video and data services with high access speeds (albeit generally lower when compared to those that we offer). However, less than 3% of the customers in our markets have access to fiber-to-the-home from our competitors, which offer a triple play product offering comprised of high-speed data, video and voice. Fiber-to-the-home facilitates greater access speeds than we are able to offer through our fiber-to-the-node HFC infrastructure at this time, although in the next few years we expect our access speeds to be comparable to those provided by fiber-to-the-home. In addition, on their own or via strategic partnerships or other arrangements with DBS operators that permit telephone companies to package the video services of DBS operators with telephone companies&#8217; own DSL service, voice and mobile services, some telephone companies are competing with our video programming and data and voice services. An example of such an arrangement is the recent merger of AT&#38;T and DirecTV. We also face increasing competition for residential voice services from wireless telephone companies, as some of our customers are replacing our landline voice service completely with wireless voice service. 

&#160; 

In addition, new entrants with significant financial resources may compete on a larger scale with our video and data services. Through Google Fiber, Google has launched data and video services in several areas of the country, and has announced plans to increase the number of cities in which it provides these services, although none of the existing or currently announced cities are in regions in which we compete. Google&#8217;s infrastructure consists of fiber optic wirelines, which is technologically superior to the DSL technology of certain of our competitors. 

&#160; 

In addition, a number of municipalities have announced plans to construct their own data networks with access speeds that match or exceed those of our own through the use of fiber optic technology. While historically municipalities in many of the markets we serve have been subject to state laws that restrain municipalities from providing broadband coverage through government-owned networks, the FCC issued an order preempting these laws in March 2015. An appeal of this order is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. In addition, in some cases, local government entities and municipal utilities may legally compete with us without obtaining a franchise from a state or local governmental franchising authority (&#8220;LFA&#8221;), reducing their barriers to entry into our markets. Affirmation of the FCC preemption ruling and the entrance of municipalities as competitors in our markets would add to the competition we face and could lead to additional customer attrition. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Our video business also faces substantial and increasing competition from other forms of in-home entertainment and recreational activities, including video games, mobile apps and Internet and other media companies. Internet and other media companies, including Google, Amazon, Apple, Sling TV and Netflix, increasingly offer video programming via OTT streaming on the Internet. Because of the significant size and financial resources of such companies, we anticipate that they will continue to invest resources in increasing the availability of video content on the Internet. 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 1,972 full-time employees, and none were represented by a union.

&#160;

Regulation and Legislation 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Our data, video and voice operations are subject to various requirements imposed by the U.S. local, state and Federal governmental authorities. The regulation of certain cable rates pursuant to procedures established by Congress has negatively affected our revenue. Certain other legislative and regulatory matters discussed in this section also have the potential to adversely affect our data, video and voice businesses. The following discussion does not purport to be a complete summary of all of the provisions of U.S. Federal and state law that may affect our operations. Proposals for additional or revised regulations and requirements are pending before Congress, state legislatures, and state and federal regulatory agencies. We generally cannot predict whether new legislation, court action, new regulations, or a change in the extent of application or enforcement of current laws and regulations would have an adverse impact on our operations. 

&#160;

Cable 

&#160; 

Title VI of the U.S. Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Communications Act&#8221;), establishes the principal federal regulatory framework for our operation of cable systems and for the provision of our video services. The Communications Act allocates primary responsibility for enforcing the federal policies among the FCC and state and local governmental authorities. 

&#160; 

Franchising. We are required to obtain franchises from state or local governmental authorities to operate our cable systems. Those franchises typically are non-exclusive and limited in time, contain various conditions and limitations and provide for the payment of fees to the local authority, determined generally as a percentage of revenues. Failure to comply with all of the terms and conditions of a franchise may give rise to rights of termination by the franchising authority. The FCC has adopted rules designed to expedite the process of awarding competitive franchises and relieving applicants for competing franchises of some locally-imposed franchise obligations. This development, which is especially beneficial to new entrants, is expected to continue to accelerate the competition we are experiencing in the video service marketplace. 

&#160; 

Rate Regulation. FCC regulations prohibit LFAs or the FCC from regulating the rates that cable systems charge for certain levels of video cable service, equipment and service calls when those cable systems are subject to &#8220;effective competition.&#8221; In 2015, the FCC revised its rate regulations to create a presumption that all cable systems are subject to the effective-competition exemption unless proven otherwise. That decision has been appealed to a U.S. Federal court, and we cannot predict the outcome. 

&#160; 

&#8220;Must-Carry&#8221; and Retransmission Consent and Content Rules. U.S. Federal law provides that a television broadcast station may, subject to certain limitations, insist on carriage of its signal on cable systems located within the station&#8217;s prescribed area. As a result, certain of our cable systems must carry broadcast stations that we might not otherwise have elected to carry. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In other cases, we have been required to provide consideration to broadcasters to obtain retransmission consent, such as commitments to carry other program services offered by a station or an affiliated company, to purchase advertising on a station or to provide advertising availabilities on cable to a station, or to provide cash compensation. This development results in increased operating costs for cable systems, which ultimately increases the rates cable systems charge subscribers. In March and November 2014, the FCC and Congress imposed new requirements in this area including restrictions on broadcasters&#8217; ability to jointly negotiate with cable providers for carriage of their stations, and the FCC is seeking comment on possible changes to regulations in this area, including possibly eliminating rules preventing cable and satellite providers from carrying duplicating network or syndicated programming under certain circumstances, which could affect our business. In September 2014, the FCC repealed its sports blackout rules, which prohibited cable and satellite operators from retransmitting any sports event that was blacked out on a local broadcast station. 

&#160; 

Pole Attachments. U.S. Federal law requires most telephone and power utilities to charge reasonable rates to cable operators for utilizing space on utility poles or in underground conduits. In May 2010 and again in April 2011, the FCC adopted new requirements relating to pole access and construction practices that were expected to improve the ability of cable operators to attach to utility poles on a timely basis and to lower the pole attachment rate for telecommunications services. In October 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review a lower court&#8217;s decision to uphold the FCC&#8217;s pole attachment regulations. The FCC further revised its pole attachment rules in November 2015 to adjust the formula for calculating pole rental rates, which resulted in similar rates for telecommunications attachments and cable attachments, and eliminated the ability of utility companies to justify higher rates for pole attachments used to provide broadband Internet access service . It is likely the FCC&#8217;s revisions to the pole attachment rate formula will be challenged in court by the utility companies. We cannot predict the extent to which these and other rule changes will affect our ability over time to secure timely access to poles at reasonable rates. As a general matter, changes to our pole attachment rate structure could significantly increase our annual pole attachment costs. 

&#160; 

U.S. Federal Copyright Issues. The U.S. Federal Copyright Act of 1976, as amended (the &#8220;Copyright Act&#8221;), gives cable systems the ability, under certain terms and conditions and assuming that any applicable retransmission consents have been obtained, to retransmit the signals of television stations pursuant to a compulsory copyright license. 

&#160; 

The U.S. Federal Copyright Office is considering requests for clarification and revisions of certain cable compulsory copyright license reporting requirements, and from time to time, other revisions to the cable compulsory copyright rules are considered. We cannot predict the outcome of any such inquiries. However, it is possible that changes in the rules or copyright compulsory license fee computations or compliance procedures could have an adverse effect on our business by, for example, increasing copyright compulsory license fee costs or by causing us to reduce or discontinue carriage of certain broadcast signals that we currently carry on a discretionary basis. 

&#160; 

Telephone Company Competition. U.S. Federal law permits telephone companies to offer video programming services. Over the past decade, telephone companies have pursued multiple strategies to enter the market for the delivery of multichannel video programming services, such as merging with DBS operators, in the case of AT&#38;T and DirecTV, or obtaining local franchise agreements. Increased competition from telephone companies that provide competing services could have a material effect on our business. 

&#160; 

Over-the-Top (OTT) Video Programming. The continued proliferation of broadband services in the United States has enabled cable programmers and broadcast television stations and networks to &#8220;stream&#8221; their video content to consumers over the Internet. Although we have benefited generally from the growth in broadband due to our role as a provider of broadband services, the continued and growing availability of cable programming and broadcast television content on the Internet may result in less demand for our video cable service offering. Some providers of cable service are marketing their own version of OTT video programming, thus enabling their subscribers to access cable programming outside of their home or business. For example, Verizon Wireless offers the ability to stream NFL games on its smartphones over the Internet. In addition, online video distributors and other OTT video distributors have begun to stream broadcast programming over the Internet. In some cases, distributors streamed broadcast programming without the consent of broadcasters and copyright owners. Broadcasters challenged this practice, and in June 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court determined that such streaming requires the consent of the applicable copyright owner. However, there is a potential for other streaming services to attempt to enter the market, and in December 2014, the FCC opened a proceeding concerning how OTT providers should be classified for purposes of the FCC&#8217;s rules. We cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings, nor related litigation, nor how widespread these practices may become or the extent to which the integrated functionality and ease of use of the cable platform will continue to appeal to the majority of our subscribers. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Wireless Services. &#160; The FCC is in the process of preparing to auction additional spectrum, including spectrum currently in the television broadcast band, for use by wireless broadband providers. The FCC rules will provide for both the auction of spectrum and a &#8220;repacking,&#8221; whereby the FCC will require certain broadcast stations to move to new channel allotments so as to free up a nationwide block of spectrum for wireless broadband use. The availability of more spectrum to enable wireless video services over time will create additional competitive alternatives to cable services. The auction is scheduled to begin in March 2016, but we cannot predict when the auction will conclude or the effect it may have on us. 

&#160; 

Set-Top Boxes. Congress, the FCC and other government agencies have for some time been developing and implementing regulations that affect the types of set-top boxes that cable operators can lease or deploy to their subscribers. Prior to 2015, FCC rules banned the integration of security and non-security function in set-top boxes and required multichannel video programming distributors (&#8220;MVPDs&#8221;) to allow third-party vendors to provide set-top boxes with basic converter functions. In 2015, Congress repealed the integration ban and mandated that the FCC establish a working group to a successor technology-and platform-neutral security solution. In February 2016, the FCC opened a rulemaking to consider proposals that would allow any retail video device to work on any cable operator&#8217;s system. We cannot predict what effect these changes may have on our operations or if they will increase our costs and impair our ability to deliver programming to our customers. 

&#160; 

Disability Access. In September 2010, Congress passed the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (the &#8220;CVAA&#8221;). The CVAA directs the FCC to impose additional accessibility requirements on cable operators. For example, cable operators that serve 50,000 or more subscribers must provide 50 hours of video description per calendar quarter, during prime time or on children&#8217;s programming, on each channel on which they carry one of the top five national non-broadcast networks. In addition, cable operators of all sizes must pass through video description that is provided for each broadcast station or non-broadcast network that they carry. Compliance imposes certain costs on us. The CVAA also directs the FCC to adopt rules to help ensure that persons with disabilities have access to video programming and related information. In October 2013, the FCC adopted a requirement that equipment used by consumers to access video programming and other services offered by cable operators make on-screen text menus and guides for the display or selection of video programming audibly accessible to individuals who are blind or visually impaired. The compliance deadline for these new rules is December 2016 (subject to certain exceptions). In October 2013, the FCC also initiated a proceeding to consider additional rules. In February 2014, the FCC issued an order adopting closed captioning quality standards for video programming distributors (&#8220;VPDs&#8221;) and a notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on whether it should extend some of the responsibilities for compliance with the closed captioning compliance standards to entities involved with the delivery of video programming, not simply VPDs. The FCC also sought comment on the handling of complaints regarding closed captioning quality. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding or the extent to which any such requirements may impose new costs on us. 

&#160; 

Other Requirements. The FCC regulates various other aspects of cable operations, including certain terms for commercial leased access, signal leakage, distant broadcast station signals and technical standards. We cannot predict whether, when or to what extent changes to these and other regulations may affect our operations or costs. 

&#160; 

Broadband Internet Access Service 

&#160; 

Broadband Internet access service, which we currently offer on virtually all of our cable systems, is subject to some regulation at the Federal level, and is not subject to state or local government regulation at this time. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Reclassification and Network Neutrality Regulation . On February 26, 2015, the FCC elected, by a 3-2 vote, to reclassify broadband Internet access service as a &#8220;telecommunications service&#8221; and to subject the service to network neutrality and certain common carrier regulations under Title II of the Communications Act. The new regulations: (1) prohibit broadband Internet access service providers from blocking access to lawful content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; (2) prohibit broadband Internet access service providers from impairing or degrading lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications or services; (3) prohibit broadband Internet access service providers from favoring lawful traffic from one provider of Internet content over lawful traffic of another content provider in exchange for consideration; (4) establish a new &#8220;general conduct standard&#8221; that prohibits broadband Internet access service providers from unreasonably interfering with or unreasonably disadvantaging the ability of consumers to select, access and use the lawful Internet content, applications, services or devices of their choosing; and (5) require broadband Internet access service providers to disclose information regarding network management, performance and commercial terms of the service to their customers. These new net neutrality obligations could cause us to incur certain compliance costs, and the FCC&#8217;s enforcement or interpretation of these new obligations could adversely affect our business. The FCC&#8217;s regulations have been challenged in a U.S. Federal court, and we cannot predict the outcome of that review. States also may attempt to use the FCC&#8217;s reclassification of broadband Internet access service in an attempt to justify imposing new regulations or taxes and/or fees on broadband Internet access service providers that could adversely affect our business. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Privacy. Broadband Internet access service is subject to many of the same U.S. Federal and state privacy laws that apply to other electronic communications. These include the U.S. Federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which addresses interceptions of electronic communications that are in transit; the Stored Communications Act, which addresses acquisitions of electronic data in storage; and other Federal and state privacy laws and regulations. As the collection and use of consumer data becomes more prevalent in the communications industry, our compliance obligations may grow. We cannot predict whether, when or to what extent these obligations may impose costs on our business. 

&#160; 

Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Owners of copyrights and trademarks actively seek to prevent use of the Internet to violate their rights. For example, copyright and trademark owners assert claims that a customer used an Internet service or resources accessed via the Internet to post, download or disseminate copyrighted music, movies, software or other content without the consent of the copyright owner or to seek to profit from the use of the goodwill associated with another person&#8217;s trademark. In some cases, copyright and trademark owners have sought to recover damages from the broadband Internet access service provider, as well as or instead of the customer. The law relating to the potential liability of broadband Internet access service providers in these circumstances is unsettled. In 1998, Congress adopted the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which grants broadband Internet access service providers protection against certain claims of copyright infringement resulting from the actions of customers if the Internet provider complies with certain requirements. So far, Congress has not adopted similar immunity for broadband Internet access service providers for trademark infringement claims. 

&#160; 

Voice 

&#160; 

Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP). Cable companies, including Cable One and others, offer VoIP service, which permits users to make voice calls over broadband communications networks, including the Internet, to recipients on the public switched telephone network and other broadband communications networks. U.S. Federal law preempts state and local regulatory barriers to the offering of voice service by cable companies and others, and the FCC and U.S. Federal courts generally have preempted state laws that seek to regulate or classify VoIP. 

&#160; 

The FCC has held that VoIP services are IP-enabled services, which are interstate in nature and thus subject exclusively to the FCC&#8217;s U.S. Federal jurisdiction and not to state regulation. This decision was upheld on appeal, although the FCC has an ongoing proceeding to consider whether VoIP services provided by cable companies and others are properly classified as an &#8220;information service,&#8221; &#8220;telecommunications service&#8221; or some other new category of service. This determination, once made, could have numerous regulatory implications for cable companies that provide interconnected VoIP services, including us. Although the FCC has yet to ascribe a regulatory definition to VoIP services, the FCC nevertheless has imposed a number of obligations on interconnected VoIP service providers, some of which are discussed more fully below. 

&#160; 

Emergency 911 Services. The FCC has ruled that an interconnected VoIP service provider that enables its customers to make calls to and receive calls from persons who use the public switched telephone network must provide its customers with the same enhanced 911 (&#8220;E911&#8221;) features that traditional telephone and wireless companies are obligated to provide. This requirement was upheld on appeal. In January 2015, the FCC established indoor location requirements when E911 calls are made by interconnected VoIP subscribers. 

&#160; 

CALEA. FCC regulations require providers of interconnected VoIP service to comply with the requirements of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, which requires covered entities and their equipment suppliers to deploy equipment that law enforcement officials can access readily for lawful wiretap purposes. 

&#160; 

Universal Service. The FCC has determined that interconnected VoIP service providers must contribute to the U.S. Federal Universal Service Fund (the &#8220;USF&#8221;). The amount of a company&#8217;s USF contribution is based on a percentage of revenues earned from end-user interstate and international interconnected VoIP services. We are permitted to recover these contributions from our customers. In October 2011, the FCC adopted an order and new rules intended to transition the USF so that it supports the build out of broadband, rather than telecommunications facilities. The order principally addressed the manner in which universal service funds will be distributed to network operators for broadband build out. In April 2012, the FCC initiated a proceeding that focused on reforming the nature and manner in which entities should contribute to the USF and at what levels. We cannot predict whether and how such reform will occur and the extent to which it may affect providers of VoIP services, including us and our competitors. The FCC&#8217;s 2011 universal service reform order was subject to both reconsideration requests and appeals, and in May 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit upheld the order in its entirety. A number of parties filed petitions with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review of that decision, but the Supreme Court declined to review the case. In November 2010, the FCC determined that states may impose state USF fees on interconnected VoIP service providers subject to certain limitations and requirements. State USF contributions are based on a percentage of revenues earned from end-user intrastate interconnected VoIP services, and we are typically permitted to recover these contributions from our customers. We cannot predict whether or how the imposition of such state-based universal service fees will affect our operations and business.

Intercarrier Compensation. The order and new rules adopted by the FCC in October 2011 in connection with universal service reform also addressed intercarrier compensation and specified that &#8220;VoIP-PSTN traffic,&#8221; that is, traffic exchanged over public switched telephone network facilities that originates and/or terminates in IP format, which includes interconnected VoIP traffic, is subject to intercarrier compensation obligations either on the basis of specified default charges or through negotiated rates. The FCC&#8217;s order was subject to both reconsideration requests and appeals, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit upheld the order in its entirety. A number of parties filed petitions with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review of that decision, but the Supreme Court declined to review the case. Future FCC determinations regarding the rates, terms and conditions for transporting and terminating such traffic could have a profound and material effect on the profitability of providing voice and data services. 

&#160; 

Customer Proprietary Network Information. In 2007, the FCC adopted rules expanding the protection of Customer Proprietary Network Information (&#8220;CPNI&#8221;) and extending CPNI protection requirements to providers of interconnected VoIP service. CPNI is information about the quantity, technical configuration, type, location and amount of a voice customer&#8217;s use. These requirements generally have increased the cost of providing interconnected VoIP service, as providers now must implement various safeguards to protect CPNI from unauthorized disclosure. 

&#160; 

Access for Persons with Disabilities. FCC regulations require providers of interconnected VoIP services to comply with all disability access requirements that apply to telecommunications carriers, including the provision of telecommunications relay services for persons with speech or hearing impairments. The FCC also has adopted reporting requirements associated with disability access obligations. We and other interconnected VoIP service providers must also contribute to the interstate Telecommunications Relay Service Fund to support such access. These requirements generally have had the effect of increasing the cost of providing VoIP services. 

&#160; 

Service Discontinuance and Outage Obligations. In 2009, the FCC adopted rules subjecting providers of interconnected VoIP services to the same service discontinuance requirements applicable to providers of wireline telecommunication services. In 2012, the FCC adopted mandatory outage reporting requirements for interconnected VoIP service providers, which apply when customers of interconnected VoIP service lose service or connectivity and, as a result, are unable to access 911 service. Along with other FCC actions described in this section, which impose legacy telecom obligations on interconnected VoIP providers, this development will subject our interconnected VoIP services to greater regulation and, therefore, greater burdens and costs. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Fees. The FCC requires interconnected VoIP service providers to contribute to shared costs of FCC regulation through an annual regulatory fee assessment. These fees have increased our cost of providing VoIP services. In 2012, the FCC initiated a proceeding to reform the regulatory fee regime in light of marketplace changes. The FCC from time to time revises its regulatory fees and sometimes creates new fees. We cannot predict when or the extent to which the FCC will adopt new rules or regulatory fees affecting VoIP service providers, which could affect our cost of doing business. 

&#160; 

Local Number Portability. Providers of interconnected VoIP services and their &#8220;numbering partners&#8221; must ensure that their subscribers have the ability to port their telephone numbers when changing service providers. We, along with other providers of interconnected VoIP service, must contribute funds to cover the shared costs of local number portability and the costs of North American Numbering Plan Administration. In June 2015, the FCC adopted rules requiring additional numbering requirements, such as allowing consumers access to abbreviated dialing codes like 211 and 311 in certain circumstances, to be applied to interconnected VoIP service providers. Although consumers&#8217; ability to port their existing telephone numbers to interconnected VoIP service has created additional opportunities for us to gain voice customers, the local number portability and associated rules overall have had the effect of increasing the cost of providing VoIP service. 

&#160; 

Rural Calling Issues. In October 2013, the FCC adopted new rules to combat problems with the completion of long-distance calls to rural areas. The new rules apply detailed record keeping, record retention and reporting requirements on all voice providers, including VoIP service providers, subject to certain exceptions. The rules also prohibit VoIP service providers (and other voice providers) from using false audible ringing when originating calls. Compliance with these new rules could have the effect of increasing the cost of providing VoIP services. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Reporting Requirements for Special Access Services. The FCC has initiated a proceeding to collect certain data to evaluate its Special Access Services rules. As part of that proceeding, the FCC has imposed a mandatory data collection obligation on all providers and purchasers of Special Access Services as well as some entities, including us, that provide best efforts business broadband data access services, meaning that they may advertise download and upload speeds that may be in excess of those actually provided to consumers, so long as they implement their best efforts to provide the advertised speeds. We cannot predict whether or how compliance with the data collection requirements will affect our operations and business. 

&#160; 

State&#160;and Local Taxes 

&#160; 

The Internet Tax Freedom Act prohibits most states and localities from imposing taxes on Internet access service charges. Legislative and administrative proceedings in some states and localities have imposed or are considering adopting changes to general business taxes, central assessments for property tax and new taxes and fees applicable to our services. Often, DBS and other competitors that deliver their services over the Internet do not face similar state tax and fee burdens. In addition, the FCC&#8217;s reclassification of broadband Internet access services as Title II telecommunications services may cause or allow, directly or indirectly, some states and localities to seek to impose additional taxes and fees on our data service.
