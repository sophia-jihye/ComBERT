 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Overview 

Unless otherwise indicated by the context, all references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Prestige&#8221; refer to Prestige Brands Holdings, Inc. and our subsidiaries. Similarly, reference to a year (e.g., &#8220;2016&#8221;) refers to our fiscal year ended March 31 of that year. 

We are engaged in the marketing, sales and distribution of well-recognized, brand name, over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) healthcare and household cleaning products to mass merchandisers, drug stores, supermarkets, and club, convenience, and dollar stores in North America (the United States and Canada) and in Australia and certain other international markets. We use the strength of our brands, our established retail distribution network, a low-cost operating model and our experienced management team to our competitive advantage. Our ultimate success is dependent on several factors, including our ability to: 

&#8226; 

Develop and execute effective sales, advertising and marketing programs; 

&#8226; 

Integrate acquired brands; 

&#8226; 

Grow our existing product lines; 

&#8226; 

Develop innovative new products; 

&#8226; 

Respond to the technological advances and product introductions of our competitors; and 

&#8226; 

Continue to grow our presence in the United States and international markets. 

We engaged in strategic mergers and acquisitions over the last three years as follows: 

2016 Acquisition 

Acquisition of DenTek 

On February 5, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of DenTek Holdings, Inc. ("DenTek"), a privately-held marketer and distributor of specialty oral care products. The closing was finalized pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, announced November 23, 2015, under which Prestige agreed to acquire DenTek from its stockholders, including TSG Consumer Partners, for a purchase price of $228.3 million. The acquisition expands Prestige's portfolio of brands, strengthens its existing oral care platform and increases its geographic reach in parts of Europe. The Company financed the transaction with a combination of available cash on hand, available cash from its Asset Based Loan ("ABL") revolver, and financing of an additional unsecured bridge loan. This acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the Business Combinations topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 805, which requires that the total cost of an acquisition be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The DenTek brands are primarily included in our North American and International OTC Healthcare segments. 

&#160; 

2015 Acquisitions 

Acquisition of Insight Pharmaceuticals 

On September 3, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of Insight Pharmaceuticals Corporation ("Insight"), a marketer and distributor of feminine care and other OTC healthcare products, for $745.9 million in cash after receiving a return of approximately $7.2 million from escrow related to an arbitrator's ruling. The closing followed the Federal Trade Commission&#8217;s (&#8220;FTC&#8221;) approval of the acquisition and was finalized pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement announced on April 25, 2014. Pursuant to the Insight purchase agreement, the Company acquired 27 OTC brands sold in North America (including related trademarks, contracts and inventory), which extended the Company's portfolio of OTC brands to include a leading feminine care platform in the United States and Canada anchored by Monistat , the leading North American brand in OTC yeast infection treatment. The acquisition also added brands to the Company's cough &#38; cold, pain relief, ear care and dermatological platforms. In connection with the FTC's approval of the Insight acquisition, we sold one &#32;of the competing brands that we acquired from Insight on the same day as the Insight closing. Insight is primarily included in our North American OTC Healthcare segment. The Insight acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the Business Combinations topic of the FASB ASC 805, which requires that the total cost 

&#32;2 

of an acquisition be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. 

Acquisition of Hydralyte 

On April 30, 2014, we completed the acquisition of the Hydralyte &#32;brand in Australia and New Zealand from The Hydration Pharmaceuticals Trust of Victoria, Australia, which was funded through a combination of cash on hand and our existing senior secured credit facility. Hydralyte &#32;is the leading OTC brand in oral rehydration in Australia and is marketed and sold through our Care Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd. subsidiary ("Care Pharma"). Hydralyte &#32;is available in pharmacies in multiple forms and is indicated for oral rehydration following diarrhea, vomiting, fever, heat and other ailments. Hydralyte &#32;is included in our International OTC Healthcare segment. The Hydralyte &#32;acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the Business Combinations topic of the FASB ASC 805, which requires that the total cost of an acquisition be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. 

2014 Acquisition 

Acquisition of Care Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd. 

On July 1, 2013, we completed the acquisition of Care Pharma, which included brands that complemented our OTC Healthcare portfolio and was funded through a combination of our existing senior secured credit facility and cash on hand. The Care Pharma brands include the Fess line of cold/allergy and saline nasal health products, which is the leading saline spray for both adults and children in Australia. Other key brands include Painstop analgesic, Rectogesic &#32;for rectal discomfort, and the Fab &#32;line of nutritional supplements. Care Pharma also markets a line of brands for children including Little Allergies , Little Eyes , &#32; and Little Coughs . This acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the Business Combinations topic of the FASB ASC 805, which requires that the total cost of an acquisition be allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. 

&#32;3 

Major Brands 

Our major brands, set forth in the table below, have strong levels of consumer awareness and retail distribution across all major channels. These brands accounted for approximately 81.7% , 86.8% , and 86.3% &#32;of our net revenues for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, during the period the respective brands were owned by us.

We have prepared the information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with regard to the market share and ranking for our brands based in part on data generated by Information Resources, Inc., an independent market research firm (&#8220;IRI&#8221;). IRI reports total U.S. Multi-Outlet retail sales data in the food, drug, mass merchandise markets (including Walmart), dollar stores (Dollar General, Family Dollar, Fred's), selected warehouse clubs (BJ's and Sam's) and DeCA military commissaries and convenience stores, representing approximately 90% of Prestige Brands' categories for retail sales. 

(2) 

&#8220;Market segment&#8221; is defined by us and is either a standard IRI category or a segment within a standard IRI category and is based on our product offerings and the categories in which we compete. 

(3) 

&#8220;Market share&#8221; is based on sales dollars in the United States, as calculated by IRI for the 52 weeks ended March 20, 2016. 

(4) 

&#8220;ACV&#8221; refers to the All Commodity Volume Food Drug Mass Index, as calculated by IRI for the 52 weeks ended March 20, 2016. ACV measures the ratio of the weighted sales volume of stores that sell a particular product to all the stores that sell products in that market segment generally. For example, if a product is sold by 50% of the stores that sell products 

&#32;4 

in that market segment, but those stores account for 85% of the sales volume in that market segment, that product would have an ACV of 85%. We believe that a high ACV evidences a product&#8217;s attractiveness to consumers, as major national and regional retailers will carry products that are attractive to their customers. Lower ACV measures would indicate that a product is not as available to consumers because the major retailers generally would not carry products for which consumer demand is not as high. For these reasons, we believe that ACV is an important measure for investors to gauge consumer awareness of the Company&#8217;s product offerings and of the importance of those products to major retailers. 

(5) 

Gaviscon &#32;is distributed by us in Canada only, and the market information was generated by Nielsen, an independent third party market research firm for the period ending March 5, 2016. Figures represent national, all channel retail sales data in the food, drug, mass merchandise (e.g. Walmart), general merchandise (e.g. Dollarama), and warehouse club stores (e.g. Costco). Data reported for warehouse club and general merchandise is calculated based on home scan panel data, and not direct point of sale data. 

(6) 

The Care Pharma brands include the Fess &#32;line of cold/allergy and saline nasal health products, which is the leading saline spray for both adults and children in Australia, and Hydralyte , which is the leading OTC brand in oral rehydration in Australia . &#32;&#32;Market information was generated by IMS Australian Proprietary Index, an independent market research firm, for the period ending February 29, 2016. 

Our products are sold through multiple channels, including mass merchandisers and drug, food, dollar, convenience, and club stores, which reduces our exposure to any single distribution channel. 

We have grown our product portfolio both organically and through acquisitions. We develop our core brands organically by investing in new product lines, brand extensions and providing advertising support. Acquisitions of OTC brands have also been an important part of our growth strategy. We have acquired well-recognized brands from consumer products and pharmaceutical companies as well as from private equity investors. While many of these brands have long histories of brand development and investment, we believe that, at the time we acquired them, many were considered &#8220;non-core&#8221; by their previous owners. As a result, these acquired brands did not benefit from adequate management focus and marketing support during the period prior to their acquisition, which created opportunities for us to achieve our objective of reinvigorating these brands and improving their performance post-acquisition. After adding a brand to our portfolio, we seek to increase its sales, market share and distribution in both existing and new channels through our established retail distribution network. This is achieved often through increased spending on advertising and promotional support, new sales and marketing strategies, improved packaging and formulations and innovative development of brand extensions. Our business, business model, competitive strengths and growth strategy face various risks that are described in &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Competitive Strengths 

Diversified Portfolio of Well-Recognized and Established Consumer Brands 

We own and market well-recognized consumer brands, some of which were established over 60 years ago. Our diverse portfolio of products provides us with multiple sources of growth and minimizes our reliance on any one product or category. We provide significant marketing support to our core brands that is designed to enhance our sales growth and our long-term profitability. The markets in which we sell our products, however, are highly competitive and include numerous national and global manufacturers, distributors, marketers and retailers. Many of these competitors have greater research and development and financial resources than us and may be able to spend more aggressively on sales, advertising and marketing programs and research and development, which may have an adverse effect on our competitive position. 

Strong Competitor in Attractive Categories 

We compete in product categories that address recurring consumer needs. We believe we are well positioned in these categories due to the long history and consumer awareness of our brands, our strong market positions, and our low-cost operating model. However, a significant increase in the number of product introductions or increased advertising, marketing and trade support by our competitors in these markets could have a material adverse effect on our results from operations. 

Proven Ability to Develop and Introduce New Products 

We focus our marketing and product development efforts on the identification of under-served consumer needs, the design of products that directly address those needs, and the ability to extend our highly recognizable brand names to other products. As an example of this philosophy, in 2016, we launched Clear Eyes Pure Relief for Dry Eyes and Multi Symptom , Nix Ultra Lice Elimination System , Little Remedies Probiotic Plus Electrolytes , Fiber Choice Flavor Drops Tropical Orange, and &#32;Goody's Mixed Fruit Blast and &#32;Back and Body Single Dose . &#32; &#32; In 2015, we launched Dramamine Naturals , Compound W Freeze Off Advanced , Fiber Choice Immunity Support &#32;and Fiber Choice Metabolism &#32; and Energy . Although line extensions and new product introductions 

&#32;5 

are important to the overall growth of a brand, our efforts may reduce sales of existing products within that brand. In addition, certain of our product introductions may not be successful. 

Efficient Operating Model 

To gain operating efficiencies, we oversee the production planning and quality control aspects of the manufacturing, warehousing and distribution of our products, while we outsource the operating elements of these functions to well-established third-party providers. This approach allows us to benefit from their core competencies and maintain a highly variable cost structure, with low overhead, limited working capital requirements, and minimal investment in capital expenditures, as evidenced by the following:

In 2016, our gross margin percentage was comparable to the prior year with an increase of 110 &#32;basis points. In 2015, our gross margin percentage was comparable to the prior year with a slight increase of 60 &#32;basis points from 2014. General and administrative costs, as a percentage of total revenues, decreased 240 &#32;basis points in 2016 versus 2015, primarily as a result of costs associated with the acquisition of Insight in the prior year period and a lease termination charge related to lease payments from the Insight office incurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2015. In 2016, our capital expenditures remained consistent as a percentage of revenues, with a decrease of 50 &#32;basis points versus 2015. 

Management Team with Proven Ability to Acquire, Integrate and Grow Brands 

Our business has grown through acquisition, integration and expansion of the many brands we have purchased. Our management team has significant experience in consumer product marketing, sales, legal and regulatory compliance, product development and customer service. Unlike many larger consumer products companies, which we believe often entrust their smaller brands to successive junior employees, we dedicate experienced managers to specific brands. We seek more experienced personnel to bear the substantial responsibility of brand management and to effectuate our growth strategy. These managers nurture the brands to allow the brands to grow and evolve. 

Growth Strategy 

In order to continue to enhance our brands and drive growth, we focus our growth strategy on our core competencies: 

&#8226; 

Effective Marketing and Advertising; 

&#8226; 

Sales Excellence; 

&#8226; 

Extraordinary Customer Service; and 

&#8226; 

Innovation and Product Development. 

We execute this strategy through the following efforts: 

&#8226; 

Investments in Advertising and Promotion 

We invest in advertising and promotion to drive the growth of our core brands. Our marketing strategy is focused primarily on consumer-oriented programs that include targeted coupon programs, media, in-store and digital advertising. While the absolute level of marketing expenditures differs by brand and category, we have often increased the amount of investment in our brands after acquiring them. Advertising and promotion spend on our top five selling brands was approximately 13.9% &#32;of the revenues associated with these brands in 2016. &#32; In 2016 and 2015, advertising and promotional spend on the core brands was approximately 15.7% &#32;and 16.0% , respectively, of the revenues associated with these brands. In 2016, advertising and promotional spend for the newly acquired DenTek brands was approximately 18.1% &#32;of revenues associated with those brands, from the acquisition date of February 5, 2016 through March 31, 2016. Given the competition in our industry, there is a risk that our marketing efforts may not result in increased sales and profitability. Additionally, we can offer no assurance that we can maintain any increased sales and profitability levels once attained. 

&#32;6 

&#8226; 

Growing our Categories and Market Share with Innovative New Products 

One of our strategies is to broaden the categories in which we participate and increase our share within those categories through ongoing product innovation. In 2016, we launched Clear Eyes Pure Relief for Dry Eyes and Multi Symptom , Nix Ultra Lice Elimination System , Little Remedies Probiotic Plus Electrolytes , Fiber Choice Flavor Drops Tropical Orange, and &#32;Goody's Mixed Fruit Blast and &#32;Back and Body Single Dose . In 2015, we launched Dramamine Naturals , Compound W Freeze Off Advanced , Fiber Choice Immunity Support &#32;and Fiber Choice Metabolism and Energy . While there is always a risk that sales of existing products may be reduced by new product introductions, our goal is to grow the overall sales of our brands. 

&#8226; 

Increasing Distribution Across Multiple Channels 

Our broad distribution base attempts to ensure that our products are well positioned across all available channels and that we are able to participate in changing consumer retail trends. In an effort to ensure continued sales growth, we have altered our focus by expanding our reliance on direct sales while reducing our reliance on brokers. We believe this philosophy allows us to better: 

&#8226; Know our customer; 

&#8226; Service our customer; and 

&#8226; Support our customer. 

While we make great efforts to both maintain our customer base and grow in new markets, there is a risk that we may not be able to maintain or enhance our relationships across distribution channels, which could adversely impact our business, and results from operations. 

&#8226; 

Growing Our International Business 

International sales beyond the borders of North America represented 7.4% , 8.9% &#32;and 5.4% &#32;of revenues in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, and are primarily from the acquisition of DenTek in 2016, the acquisition of Hydralyte &#32;in 2015, and the acquisition of Care Pharma in 2014. We have designed and developed both products and packaging for specific international markets and expect that our international revenues will continue to grow. In addition to Clear Eyes , Murine &#32;and Chloraseptic, &#32;which are currently sold internationally, we have licensed to an international consumer packaged goods company (the "licensee") the right to use the Comet, Spic and Span &#32;and Chlorinol&#174; &#32;trademarks in the commercial/institutional/industrial business throughout the world (excluding Russia and specified Eastern European countries). We have also transferred to the licensee the Comet &#32;and Chlorinol &#32;trademarks in Russia and specified Eastern European countries. These agreements were amended in December 2014 to allow the licensee to obtain the trademarks in certain specified Eastern European countries for $10.0 million. The amended agreement expires December 31, 2025, and includes an option (which we expect the licensee will elect to exercise such option) for the licensee to buy out the remaining commercial/institutional/industrial business at any time after July 1, 2016 for an exercise price of $10.0 million. 

A number of our other brands have previously been sold internationally, and we seek to expand the number of brands sold through our existing international distribution network and continue to identify additional distribution partners for further expansion into other international markets. 

&#32;7 

&#8226; 

Pursuing Strategic Acquisitions 

Acquisitions are an important part of our overall strategy for growing revenue. We have a history of growth through acquisition (see "Our History and Accomplishments" below). In 2016, we acquired DenTek, a privately-held marketer and distributor of specialty oral care products. In 2015, we acquired Insight, including a leading feminine care platform in the United States and Canada anchored by Monistat , the leading North American brand in OTC yeast infection treatment. The acquisition also added brands to the Company's cough &#38; cold, pain relief, ear care and dermatological platforms. Additionally, in 2015, we acquired the Hydralyte &#32;brand in Australia and New Zealand. Hydralyte &#32;is the leading OTC brand in oral rehydration in Australia. In 2014, we acquired Care Pharma, including the Fess &#32;line of cold/allergy and saline nasal health products. Other key brands acquired from Care Pharma include Painstop &#32;analgesic, Rectogesic &#32;for rectal discomfort, and the Fab &#32;line of nutritional supplements. Care Pharma also markets a line of brands for children including Little Allergies , Little Eyes , and Little Coughs . While we believe that there will continue to be a pipeline of acquisition candidates for us to investigate, strategic fit and relative cost are of the utmost importance in our decision to pursue such opportunities. We believe our business model allows us to integrate acquisitions in an efficient manner, while also providing opportunities to realize significant cost savings. However, there is a risk that our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected in the event we (i) do not realize all of the anticipated operating synergies and cost savings from acquisitions, (ii) do not successfully integrate acquisitions or (iii) pay too much for these acquisitions. In the past, we utilized various debt offerings to help us acquire certain brands or businesses. For example, in 2010, we refinanced our long-term debt and significantly improved our liquidity position, debt maturities and covenants, all of which better positioned us to pursue the Blacksmith Brands, Inc. ("Blacksmith") and &#32;Dramamine &#32;acquisitions we consummated that year and potential future acquisition targets. In 2012, we completed an offering of senior notes, entered into new senior secured term loan and revolving credit facilities and ratably secured our existing senior notes with the new term loan facility. We used the net proceeds from the senior notes offering, together with borrowings under the new senior secured term loan facility, to finance the acquisition of the 17 OTC brands acquired from GSK that year, to repay our existing senior secured credit facilities, to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with these transactions and for general corporate purposes. In 2013, we sold one of the acquired GSK Brands, Phazyme , and used the proceeds to repay debt. In 2014, we amended our credit facilities and used the net proceeds to repay existing senior secured credit facilities, to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with Care Pharma transactions and for general corporate purposes. In 2015, we further amended our credit facilities and used the net proceeds to finance the acquisition of Insight and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Insight and Hydralyte &#32;transactions. Additionally, in 2016, we further amended our credit facilities and used the net proceeds to repay an existing senior credit facility and to finance the acquisition of DenTek, including fees and expenses incurred in connection with the DenTek transaction. 

Market Position 

During 2016, approximately 72.1% &#32;of our net revenues were from brands with a number one or number two market position, compared with approximately 73.0% &#32;and 71.5% &#32;during 2015 and 2014, respectively. These brands included Chloraseptic , Clear Eyes , Compound W , &#32;Dramamine, &#32; Efferdent , The Doctor's Brushpicks , BC/Goody's, Beano, Debrox, &#32; Gaviscon, Dermoplast, New-Skin, Fess, Hydralyte, Monistat, Nix, and Comet . 

See &#8220;Major Brands&#8221; above for information regarding market share and ACV calculations. 

Our History and Accomplishments 

We were originally formed in 1996 as a joint venture of Medtech Labs and The Shansby Group (a private equity firm), to acquire certain OTC drug brands from American Home Products. Since 2001, our portfolio of brand name products has expanded from OTC brands to also include household cleaning products. We have added brands to our portfolio principally by acquiring strong and well-recognized brands from larger consumer products and pharmaceutical companies. In February 2004, GTCR Golder Rauner II, LLC (&#8220;GTCR&#8221;), a private equity firm, acquired our business from the owners of Medtech Labs and The Shansby Group. In addition, we acquired the Spic and Span &#32;business in March 2004.

On October 28, 2009, we sold our three shampoo brands - Prell &#32;Shampoo, Denorex &#32;Dandruff Shampoo and Zincon &#32;Dandruff Shampoo. The terms of the sale included an upfront receipt of $8.0 million in cash, with a subsequent receipt of $1.0 million in cash on October 28, 2010. We used the proceeds from the sale to reduce outstanding bank indebtedness. 

In March 2010, we refinanced our outstanding long-term indebtedness through entry into a $150.0 million senior term loan facility due April 1, 2016 (the &#8220;2010 Senior Term Loan&#8221;), and the issuance of $150.0 million in senior notes with an 8.25% interest rate due 2018 (the "2010 Senior Notes"). Proceeds from the new indebtedness were used to retire our senior term loan facility originally due April 1, 2011 and 9.25% senior subordinated notes originally due April 15, 2012. Additionally, our new credit agreement included a $30.0 million revolving credit facility due April 1, 2015. The refinancing and new credit facility improved our liquidity, extended maturities, and improved covenant ratios, all of which better positioned us to pursue strategic acquisitions. 

On September 1, 2010, we sold certain assets related to the Cutex nail polish remover brand for $4.1 million. 

On November 1, 2010, we acquired 100% of the capital stock of Blacksmith for $190.0 million in cash, plus a working capital adjustment of $13.4 million.

As a result of this acquisition, we acquired five OTC brands: Efferdent, Effergrip, PediaCare, Luden's and NasalCrom. In connection with the acquisition of Blacksmith, in November 2010, we (i) executed an Increase Joinder to our existing credit agreement pursuant to which we entered into an incremental term loan in the amount of $115.0 million and increased our revolving credit facility by $10.0 million to $40.0 million; and (ii) issued an additional $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2010 Senior Notes.

&#32;9 

million asset-based revolving credit facility with a five-year maturity (the &#8220;2012 ABL Revolver&#8221;). In September 2012, we utilized a portion of our accordion feature to increase the amount of our borrowing capacity under the 2012 ABL Revolver by $25.0 million to $75.0 million. Additionally, in connection with the entry into the new senior secured credit facilities, we repaid the outstanding balance of and terminated our 2010 Senior Term Loan. 

On October 31, 2012, we divested the Phazyme gas treatment brand, which was a non-core OTC brand that we acquired from GSK in January 2012. We received $21.7 million from the divestiture on October 31, 2012 and the remaining $0.6 million on January 4, 2013. The proceeds were used to repay debt. No significant gain or loss was recorded as a result of the sale. 

On February 21, 2013, we entered into Amendment No. 1 ("Term Loan Amendment No. 1") to the 2012 Term Loan. Term Loan Amendment No. 1 provided for the refinancing of all of our existing Term B Loans with new Term B-1 Loans. The interest rate on the Term B-1 Loans was based, at our option, on a LIBOR rate plus a margin of 2.75% per annum, with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, or an alternate base rate, with a floor of 2.00%, plus a margin. The new Term B-1 Loans will mature on the same date as the Term B Loans' original maturity date. In addition, Term Loan Amendment No. 1 provides us with certain additional capacity to prepay subordinated debt, the 2012 Senior Notes and certain other unsecured indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the credit agreement governing the 2012 Term Loan and the 2012 ABL Revolver. 

On July 1, 2013, we completed the acquisition of Care Pharma, which was funded through a combination of our existing senior secured credit facilities and cash on hand.

Other key brands include Painstop analgesic, Rectogesic &#32;for rectal discomfort, and the Fab &#32;line of nutritional supplements. Care Pharma also markets a line of brands for children including Little Allergies , Little Eyes , &#32; and Little Coughs . The brands acquired are complementary to our OTC Healthcare portfolio.

We may redeem some or all of the 2013 Senior Notes at redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the 2013 Senior Notes.

On September 3, 2014, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of Insight, a marketer and distributor of feminine care and other OTC healthcare products, for $753.2 million in cash. The closing followed the FTC approval of the acquisition and was finalized pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement announced on April 25, 2014. Pursuant to the Insight purchase agreement, the Company acquired 27 OTC brands sold in North America (including related trademarks, contracts and inventory), which extended the Company's portfolio of OTC brands to include a leading feminine care platform in the United States and Canada anchored by Monistat , the leading North American brand in OTC yeast infection treatment. The acquisition also added brands to the Company's cough &#38; cold, pain relief, ear care and dermatological platforms. In connection with the FTC's approval of the Insight acquisition, we sold one of the competing brands that we acquired from Insight on the same day as the Insight closing. Insight is primarily included in our North American OTC Healthcare segment. 

On September 3, 2014, we entered into Amendment No. 2 ("Term Loan Amendment No. 2") to the 2012 Term Loan. Term Loan Amendment No. 2 provides for (i) the creation of a new class of Term B-2 Loans under the 2012 Term Loan (the "Term B-2 Loans") in an aggregate principal amount of $720.0 million, (ii) increased flexibility under the credit agreement governing the 2012 Term Loan and 2012 ABL Revolver, including additional investment, restricted payment and debt incurrence flexibility and financial maintenance covenant relief, and (iii) an interest rate on (x) the Term B-1 Loans that is based, at our option, on a LIBOR rate plus a margin of 3.125% per annum, with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, or an alternate base rate, with a floor of 2.00%, plus a margin, and (y) the Term B-2 Loans that is based, at our option, on a LIBOR rate plus a margin of 3.50% per annum, with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, or an alternate base rate, with a floor of 2.00%, plus a margin (with a margin step-down to 3.25% per annum, based upon achievement of a specified secured net leverage ratio).

&#32;10 

under the credit agreement governing the 2012 Term Loan and 2012 ABL Revolver, including additional investment, restricted payment and debt incurrence flexibility.

The initial applicable margin for borrowings under the 2012 ABL Revolver is 1.75% with respect to LIBOR borrowings and 0.75% with respect to base-rate borrowings. The applicable margin for borrowings under the 2012 ABL Revolver may be increased to 2.00% or 2.25% for LIBOR borrowings and 1.00% or 1.25% for base-rate borrowings, depending on average excess availability under the 2012 ABL Revolver during the prior fiscal quarter. In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the 2012 ABL Revolver, we are required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the 2012 ABL Revolver in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder. The initial commitment fee rate is 0.50% per annum.

We may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the 2012 ABL Revolver at any time without a premium or penalty. 

On February 4, 2016, in anticipation of closing the DenTek acquisition, we entered into a bridge credit agreement. The Bridge Credit Agreement provides for term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $80.0 million (the &#8220;Bridge Term Loan&#8221;), at an applicable interest rate margin equal to (i) for the period beginning on the closing date and ending on the 179th day following the closing date, 4.75% for Eurocurrency rate loans and 3.75% for base rate loans, (ii) for the period from and including the 180th day following the closing date and ending on the 269th day following the closing date, 5.00% for Eurocurrency rate loans and 4.00% for base rate loans, and (iii) for the period from and after the 270th day following the closing date, 5.25% for Eurocurrency rate loans and 4.25% for base rate loans.

DenTek &#32;is the number two brand in the Peg Oral Care market with a 24.5% market share. The DenTek brand is part of the Peg Oral Care Segment, which includes floss picks, dental guards, disposable picks, dental repair and wax, floss threaders, dental picks, and tongue cleaners. 

Household Cleaning Segment 

Our portfolio of Household Cleaning brands includes the Chore Boy, Comet and &#32;Spic and Span &#32;brands. During 2016, the Household Cleaning segment accounted for 11.2% &#32;of our revenues, compared with 12.6% &#32;and 14.7% &#32;in 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

Comet 

Comet &#32;was originally introduced in 1956 and is one of the most widely recognized Household Cleaning brands with an ACV of 98.5% . Comet &#32;is the number one brand with a 38.7% market share in the U.S. Abrasive Tub and Tile Cleaner segment of the Household Cleaning category that includes non-scratch, abrasive powders, creams, and liquids. Comet &#32;products include several varieties of cleaning powders, spray and cream, both abrasive and non-abrasive. 

For additional information concerning our business segments, please refer to Part II, Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Marketing and Sales 

Our marketing strategy is based on the acquisition and the rejuvenation of established consumer brands that possess what we believe to be significant brand value and unrealized potential. Our marketing objective is to increase sales and market share by developing innovative new products and line extensions and executing creative and cost-effective advertising and promotional programs. After we acquire a brand, we implement a brand building strategy that uses the brand&#8217;s existing consumer awareness to maximize sales of current products and provides a vehicle to drive growth through product innovation. This brand building process involves the evaluation of the existing brand name, the development and introduction of innovative new products, and the execution of support programs. Recognizing that financial resources are limited, we allocate our resources to focus on our core brands with the most impactful, consumer-relevant initiatives, which we believe have the greatest opportunities for growth and financial success. Brand priorities vary from year-to-year and generally revolve around new product introductions. 

Customers 

Our senior management team and dedicated sales force strive to maintain long-standing relationships with our top 50 domestic customers. We also contract with third-party sales management enterprises that interface directly with our remaining customers and report directly to members of our sales management team. 

We enjoy broad distribution across each of the major retail channels, including mass merchandisers, drug, food, dollar, convenience and club stores. The following table sets forth the percentage of gross sales across our six major distribution channels during each of the past three years ended March 31:

Includes estimates for some of our wholesale customers that service more than one distribution channel. 

Due to the diversity of our product lines, we believe that each of these channels is important to our business, and we continue to seek opportunities for growth in each channel. 

Our principal customer relationships include Walmart, Walgreens, and CVS. During 2016, 2015, and 2014, Walmart accounted for approximately 20.2% , 18.1% , and 19.5% , respectively, of our gross revenues. We expect that for future periods, our top ten customers, including Walmart, will, in the aggregate, continue to account for a large portion of our sales. 

Our strong customer relationships and product recognition allow us to attempt to capitalize on a number of important strategic opportunities, including (i) minimization of slotting fees, (ii) maximization of new product introductions, (iii) maximization of shelf space prominence, and (iv) minimization of cash collection days. We believe that our emphasis on strong customer relationships, speed and flexibility and leading sales technology capabilities, combined with consistent marketing support programs and ongoing product innovation, will continue to maximize our competitiveness in the increasingly complex retail environment.

Outsourcing and Manufacturing 

In order to maximize our competitiveness and efficiently allocate our resources, third-party manufacturers fulfill our manufacturing needs. We have found that contract manufacturing maximizes our flexibility and responsiveness to industry and consumer trends while minimizing the need for capital expenditures. We select contract manufacturers based on their core competencies and our perception of the best overall value, including factors such as (i) depth of services, (ii) professionalism and integrity of the management team, (iii) manufacturing agility and capacity, (iv) regulatory compliance, and (v) competitive pricing. We also conduct thorough reviews of each potential manufacturer&#8217;s facilities, quality standards, capacity and financial stability. We generally purchase only finished products from our manufacturers. 

&#32;15 

Our primary contract manufacturers provide comprehensive services from product development through the manufacturing of finished goods. They are responsible for such matters as (i) production planning, (ii) product research and development, (iii) procurement, (iv) production, (v) quality testing, and (vi) almost all capital expenditures. In most instances, we provide our contract manufacturers with guidance in the areas of (i) product development, (ii) performance criteria, (iii) regulatory guidance, (iv) sourcing of packaging materials, and (v) monthly master production schedules. This management approach results in minimal capital expenditures and maximizes our cash flow, which allows us to reinvest to support our marketing initiatives, fund brand acquisitions or repay outstanding indebtedness. 

At March 31, 2016, we had relationships with 119 &#32;third-party manufacturers. Of those, we had long-term contracts with 55 &#32;manufacturers that produced items that accounted for approximately 79.9% &#32;of our gross sales for 2016, compared to 44 &#32;manufacturers with long-term contracts that accounted for approximately 82.9% &#32;of our gross sales in 2015. The fact that we do not have long-term contracts with certain manufacturers means that they could cease manufacturing our products at any time and for any reason or initiate arbitrary and costly price increases, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results from operations. 

At March 31, 2016, suppliers for our key brands included GSK, Denison Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Aspen Pharmacare, Olds Products Company, Tower Laboratories Ltd., and Contract Pharmaceuticals Corp. We enter into manufacturing agreements for a majority of our products by sales volume, each of which vary based on the capabilities of the third-party manufacturer and the products being supplied. These agreements explicitly outline the manufacturer&#8217;s obligations and product specifications with respect to the brand or brands being produced. The purchase price of products is subject to change pursuant to the terms of these agreements due to fluctuations in raw material, packaging and labor costs. Other products are manufactured on a purchase order basis, which is generally based on batch sizes and results in no long-term obligations or commitments. 

Warehousing and Distribution 

We receive orders from retailers and/or brokers primarily by electronic data interchange, which automatically enters each order into our computer systems and then routes the order to our distribution center. The distribution center will, in turn, send a confirmation that the order was received, fill the order and ship the order to the customer, while sending a shipment confirmation to us. Upon receipt of the shipment confirmation, we send an invoice to the customer. 

We manage product distribution in the continental United States primarily through one facility located in St. Louis, which is owned and operated by a third-party provider. Our U.S. warehouse provider provides warehouse services including storage, handling and shipping, as well as transportation services, with respect to our full line of products, including (i) complete management services, (ii) claims administration, (iii) proof of delivery, (iv) procurement, (v) report generation, and (vi) automation and freight payment services. 

If our warehouse provider abruptly stopped providing warehousing or transportation services to us, our business operations could suffer a temporary disruption while we engage new service providers. We believe this process could be completed quickly and any resulting temporary disruption would not be likely to have a significant adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. However, a serious disruption, such as a flood or fire, to our distribution center could damage our inventory and could materially impair our ability to distribute our products to customers in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost. We could incur significantly higher costs and experience longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products to our customers during the time required to reopen or replace our distribution center. As a result, any such serious or prolonged disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results from operations. 

Competition 

The business of selling brand name consumer products in the OTC Healthcare and Household Cleaning categories is highly competitive. These markets include numerous national and global manufacturers, distributors, marketers and retailers that actively compete for consumers&#8217; business both in the United States and abroad. In addition, like most companies that market products in these categories, we are experiencing increased competition from &#8220;private label&#8221; products introduced by major retail chains. While we believe that our branded products provide superior quality and benefits, we are unable to predict the extent to which consumers will purchase &#8220;private label&#8221; products as an alternative to branded products. 

Our principal competitors vary by industry category. Competitors in the OTC Healthcare category include: Johnson &#38; Johnson, maker of Visine&#174;, which competes with our Clear Eyes &#32;and Murine &#32;brands; McNeil-PPC (owned by Johnson &#38; Johnson), maker of Children's Tylenol&#174;, and Novartis Consumer Healthcare, maker of Triaminic &#174; , each of which competes with our PediaCare &#32;and Little Remedies &#32;brands; The Procter &#38; Gamble Company, maker of Vicks&#174;, Reckitt Benckiser, maker of Cepacol&#174;, and Kraft Foods, maker of Halls&#174;, each of which competes with our Chloraseptic &#32;and Luden's &#32;brands; and The Procter &#38; Gamble Company, 

&#32;16 

maker of Fixodent&#174;, and GSK, maker of Polident&#174;, each of which competes with our Efferdent &#32;brand. Sunstar America, Inc., maker of the GUM&#174; line of oral care products, competes with our DenTek &#32;and The Doctor's &#32;oral care brands. Top competitors of our acquired GSK Brands categories include: McNeil-PPC (owned by Johnson &#38; Johnson), maker of Tylenol&#174;, Pfizer, maker of Advil&#174;, and Novartis Consumer Healthcare, maker of Excedrin&#174;, each of which competes with our BC, Goody's &#32;and Ecotrin &#32;brands. The Procter &#38; Gamble Company, maker of Metamucil&#174;, competes with our Fiber Choice brand; Novartis Consumer Healthcare, maker of Gas X&#174;, competes with our Beano &#32;brand; and GSK, maker of Tums&#174;, competes with our Gaviscon &#32;and Tagamet &#32;brands. 

Competitors in the Household Cleaning category include: Henkel AG &#38; Co., maker of Soft Scrub&#174;, Colgate-Palmolive Company, maker of Ajax&#174; Cleanser, and The Clorox Company, maker of Tilex&#174;, each of which competes with our Comet &#32;brand. Additionally, Clorox&#8217;s Pine Sol&#174; and The Procter &#38; Gamble Company&#8217;s Mr. Clean&#174; compete with our Spic and Span &#32;brand, while 3M Company, maker of &#160; Scotch-Brite &#174;, &#32;O-Cel-O &#174; &#32;and Dobie&#174; brands, and Clorox&#8217;s SOS&#174; compete with our Chore Boy &#32;brand. 

We compete on the basis of numerous factors, including brand recognition, product quality, performance, value to customers, price, and product availability at the retail level. Advertising, promotion, merchandising and packaging, the timing of new product introductions, and line extensions also have a significant impact on customers&#8217; buying decisions and, as a result, on our sales. The structure and quality of our sales force, as well as sell-through of our products, affect in-store position, wall display space and inventory levels in retail outlets. If we are unable to maintain the inventory levels and in-store positioning of our products in retail stores, our sales and operating results would be adversely affected. Our markets are also highly sensitive to the introduction of new products, which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market. An increase in the amount of new product introductions and the levels of advertising spending by our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our results from operations. 

Many of the competitors noted above are larger and have substantially greater research and development and financial resources than we do, and may therefore have the ability to spend more aggressively and consistently on research and development, advertising and marketing, and to respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions. See &#8220;Competitive Strengths&#8221; above for additional information regarding our competitive strengths and Part I, Item 1A &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; below for additional information regarding competition in our industry. 

&#160; 

Regulation 

Product Regulation 

The formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, importation, sale and storage of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various U.S. federal agencies, including the FDA, FTC, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (&#8220;CPSC&#8221;), and the Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;), and various agencies of the states, localities and foreign countries in which our products are manufactured, distributed and sold. Our Regulatory Team is guided by a senior member of management and staffed by individuals with appropriate legal and regulatory experience. Our Regulatory and Operations teams work closely with our third-party manufacturers on quality-related matters, while we monitor their compliance with FDA and foreign regulations and perform periodic audits to ensure compliance. This continual evaluation process is designed to ensure that our manufacturing processes and products are of the highest quality and in compliance with known regulatory requirements. If the FDA or a foreign governmental authority chooses to audit a particular manufacturing facility, we require the third-party manufacturer to notify us immediately and update us on the progress of the audit as it proceeds. If we or our manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could become subject to significant claims or penalties or be required to discontinue the sale of the non-compliant product, which could have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition and results from operations. These circumstances occur from time to time. In addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant additional compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results from operations. 

Most of our U.S. OTC drug products are regulated pursuant to the FDA&#8217;s monograph system. The monographs set out the active ingredients and labeling indications that are permitted for certain broad categories of U.S. OTC drug products. When the FDA has finalized a particular monograph, it has concluded that a properly labeled product formulation is generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded. A tentative final monograph indicates that the FDA has not made a final determination about products in a category to establish safety and efficacy for a product and its uses. However, unless there is a serious safety or efficacy issue, the FDA typically will exercise enforcement discretion and permit companies to sell products conforming to a tentative final monograph until the final monograph is published. Products that comply with either final or tentative final monograph standards do not require pre-market approval from the FDA. 

Certain of our U.S. OTC drug products are New Drug Application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;) or Abbreviated New Drug Application (&#8220;ANDA&#8221;) products and are manufactured and labeled in accordance with a FDA-approved submission. These products are subject to reporting requirements as set forth in FDA regulations. 

&#32;17 

Certain of our U.S. OTC Healthcare products are medical devices regulated by the FDA through a system which usually involves pre-market clearance. During the review process, the FDA makes an affirmative determination as to the sufficiency of the label directions, cautions and warnings for the medical devices in question. 

In accordance with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (&#8220;FDC Act&#8221;) and FDA regulations, we and our third-party manufacturers of U.S. products must also comply with the FDA&#8217;s current Good Manufacturing Practices (&#8220;GMPs&#8221;). The FDA inspects our facilities and those of our third-party manufacturers periodically to determine that both we and our third-party manufacturers are complying with GMPs. 

A number of our products are regulated by the CPSC under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (the &#8220;FHSA&#8221;), the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 (the &#8220;PPPA&#8221;) and the Consumer Products Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (the &#8220;CPSIA&#8221;). Certain of our household products are considered to be hazardous substances under the FHSA and therefore require specific cautionary warnings to be included in their labeling for such products to be legally marketed. In addition, a small number of our products are subject to regulation under the PPPA and can only be legally marketed if they are dispensed in child-resistant packaging or labeled for use in households where there are no children. The CPSIA requires us to make available to our customers certificates stating that we are in compliance with any applicable regulation administered by the CPSC. 

Nix &#32;spray and certain Household Cleaning products are considered pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (&#8220;FIFRA&#8221;). Generally speaking, any substance intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest is considered to be a pesticide under FIFRA. We market and distribute certain household products under our Comet &#32;and Spic and Span &#32;brands that make antibacterial and/or disinfectant claims governed by FIFRA. Due to the antibacterial and/or disinfectant claims on certain of the Comet &#32;and Spic and Span &#32;products and the lice killing claims on Nix &#32;spray, such products are considered to be pesticides under FIFRA and are required to be registered with the EPA and contain certain disclosures on the product labels. In addition, the contract manufacturers from which we source these products must be registered with the EPA. Our EPA registered products are also subject to state regulations and the rules and regulations of the various jurisdictions where these products are sold. 

Our international business is also subject to product regulations by local regulatory authorities in the various regions these businesses operate, including regulations regarding manufacturing, labeling, distribution, sale and storage. 

Other Regulations 

We are also subject to a variety of other regulations in various foreign markets, including regulations pertaining to import/export regulations and antitrust issues. To the extent we decide to commence or expand operations in additional countries, we may be required to obtain an approval, license or certification from the country&#8217;s ministry of health or comparable agency. We must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that may vary from country to country. Government regulations in both our domestic and international markets can delay or prevent the introduction, or require the reformulation or withdrawal, of some of our products. Our failure to comply with these regulations can also result in a product being removed from sale in a particular market, either temporarily or permanently. In addition, we are subject to FTC and state regulations, as well as foreign regulations, relating to our product claims and advertising. If we fail to comply with these regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions and the imposition of penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results from operations. 

Intellectual Property 

We own a number of trademark registrations and applications in the United States, Canada and other foreign countries. The following are some of the most important registered trademarks we own in the United States and/or Canada: Chloraseptic, Chore Boy, Cinch&#174;, Clear Eyes, Comet, Compound W, Dermoplast, Dramamine, Efferdent, Effergrip, Freeze Off, Little Remedies, Luden's, Murine, NasalCrom, New-Skin, Spic and Span, The Doctor&#8217;s Brushpicks, DenTek, The Doctor&#8217;s NightGuard, Wartner, &#32; BC , Goody's, Ecotrin, Beano , Gaviscon , Tagamet, &#32; Debrox, &#32; Gly-Oxide, Monistat, e.p.t and &#32;Nix. 

Our trademarks and trade names are how we convey that the products we sell are &#8220;brand name&#8221; products. Our ownership of these trademarks and trade names is very important to our business, as it allows us to compete based on the value and goodwill associated with these marks. We may also license others to use these marks. Additionally, we own or license patents on innovative and proprietary technology. The patents evidence the unique nature of our products, provide us with exclusivity, and afford us protection from the encroachment of others. None of the patents that we own or license, however, is material to us on a consolidated basis. Enforcing our rights, or the rights of any of our licensors, represented by these trademarks, trade names and patents is critical to our business but is expensive. If we are not able to effectively enforce our rights, others may be able to dilute our trademarks, trade names and patents and diminish the value associated with our brands and technologies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results from operations. 

&#32;18 

We do not own all of the intellectual property rights applicable to our products. In those cases where our third-party manufacturers own patents that protect our products, we are dependent on them as a source of supply for our products. Unless other non-infringing technologies are available, we must continue to purchase patented products from our suppliers who sell patented products to us. In addition, we rely on our suppliers for their enforcement of their intellectual property rights against infringing products. 

We have licensed to an international consumer packaged goods company the right to use the Comet, Spic and Span &#32;and Chlorinol&#174; &#32;trademarks in the commercial/institutional/industrial business throughout the world (excluding Russia and specified Eastern European countries). We have also transferred to the licensee the Comet &#32;and Chlorinol &#32;trademarks in Russia and specified Eastern European countries. These agreements were amended in December 2014 to allow the licensee to obtain the trademarks in certain specified Eastern European countries for $10.0 million. The amended agreement expires December 31, 2025, and includes an option (which we expect the licensee will elect to exercise such option) for the licensee to buy out the remaining commercial/institutional/industrial business at any time after July 1, 2016 for an exercise price of $10.0 million. 

Seasonality 

The first quarter of our fiscal year typically has the lowest level of revenue due to the seasonal nature of certain of our brands relative to the summer and winter months. In addition, the first quarter generally is the least profitable quarter due to the increased advertising and promotional spending to support those brands with a summer selling season, such as Clear Eyes &#32;products, Compound W , Wartner &#32;and New-Skin . The level of advertising and promotional campaigns in the third quarter influences sales of our cough/cold products, such as Chloraseptic, &#32; Little Remedies, Luden's &#32;and PediaCare, during the fourth quarter cough &#38; cold winter months. Additionally, the fourth quarter typically has the lowest level of advertising and promotional spending as a percent of revenue. 

Employees 

We employed approximately 259 full time individuals at March 31, 2016. None of our employees is a party to a collective bargaining agreement. Management believes that our relations with our employees are good. 

Backlog Orders 

We define backlog as orders with requested delivery dates prior to March 31, 2016 that were not shipped as of March 31, 2016. We had no significant backlog orders at March 31, 2016 or 2015.
