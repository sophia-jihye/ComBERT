 Item 1. Business &#160; 

Overview 

&#160;

We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of novel cancer immunotherapy products designed to harness the power of a patient's own immune system to eradicate cancer cells. Our lead program is an adoptive cell therapy utilizing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), which are T cells derived from patients&#8217; tumors, for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. We are also pursuing the development of TIL for other solid tumor cancer indications. In February 2016, we announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed our Investigational New Drug (IND) application to conduct clinical studies using our TIL therapy in cervical and head and neck cancers, we plan to initiate clinical trials in at least one of these indications during 2016.

&#160;

A patient's immune system, particularly their TIL, plays an important role in identifying and killing cancer cells. TIL consist of a heterogeneous population of T cells that can recognize a wide variety of cancer-specific mutations and can overcome tumor escape mechanisms. TIL therapy involves growing a patient's TIL in special culture conditions outside the patient's body, or ex vivo, and then infusing the T cells back into the patient in combination with interleukin-2 (IL-2). By taking TIL away from the immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment in the patient, the T cells can rapidly proliferate. Billions of TIL, when infused back into the patient, are better able to search out and potentially eradicate the tumor.

&#160;

During the second half of 2015, we opened enrollment in a Phase 2 clinical trial of our lead product candidate, LN-144, for the treatment of refractory metastatic melanoma. This single-arm study is for patients with metastatic melanoma whose disease has progressed following treatment with at least one systemic therapy. The trial opened for enrollment during the second half of 2015 and will be conducted at up to ten sites. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and feasibility of our autologous TIL infusion (LN-144). The trial&#8217;s primary endpoints include safety and feasibility of LN-144 production using our central manufacturing process. Secondary outcome measures include an additional feasibility measure of number of patients successfully infused with LN-144 and the best overall response rate.

&#160;

In September 2015, Dr. Steven Rosenberg, M.D., Ph.D., Chief of the Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and a recognized pioneer in immuno-oncology and adoptive cell therapy using TIL, presented updated data from a Phase 2 clinical trial of TIL therapy in metastatic melanoma at the American Association for Cancer Research Inaugural International Cancer Immunotherapy Conference. Data was presented from a 101 patient, Phase 2 clinical trial conducted at the NCI. In the trial, patients with advanced metastatic melanoma were equally divided in two groups. Both groups were treated according to standard TIL protocol using chemo-ablation, with the second group also receiving total body irradiation. 54% of the patients treated with TIL therapy achieved an objective response. An objective response occurs when there is a complete remission or a partial remission of the tumor. A complete remission requires a complete disappearance of all detectable evidence of disease, and a partial remission typically requires at least approximately 50% regression of measurable disease without new sites of disease. Out of the 101 patients, 24 (24%) had experienced a complete remission and 23 of the 24 (96%) showed durability of this response at 30 to 47 months following treatment. Median follow-up time was approximately 35 months. Overall survival (OS) was approximately 80% at 12 months, and median OS had not yet been achieved. Median progression-free survival was approximately 10 months, and 35% of patients were without disease progression at 4 years.

&#160;

In further support of our internal research and clinical development activities, we have a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as represented by the NCI, through which we are funding the research and development of TIL-based product candidates for the treatment of advanced solid tumors. Pursuant to the CRADA, we fund TIL research and clinical trials that are being conducted by Dr. Steven Rosenberg. This five-year CRADA expires in August 2016 unless the parties agree to extend it. We anticipate that we will begin discussions to renew the agreement with the NCI during the first half of 2016.

&#160;

We have a worldwide, exclusive patent license from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for intellectual property to develop, manufacture and commercialize TIL therapy for the treatment of melanoma, which was amended in 2015 to include the exclusive license of this intellectual property for the treatment of lung cancer, HPV-associated cancers, breast cancer, and bladder cancer. We also have an exclusive license from the NIH for intellectual property relating to a TIL-based therapy for use in melanoma in which TIL that express various inhibitory receptors such as 4-1BB (also known as CD137), PD-1, TIM-3 and LAG-3 are selected and expanded for infusion into the patient. TIL that express these proteins are associated with higher tumor reactivity than other TIL populations, so fewer cells may be needed to be therapeutically effective.

&#160;

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

During 2015, we received orphan drug designation for LN-144 in the United States to treat metastatic melanoma. This designation provides seven years of market exclusivity in the United States, subject to certain limited exceptions. However, the orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review or approval process.

&#160;

We are pursuing refractory metastatic melanoma as our first target indication because of the promising initial NCI results and the commercial opportunity inherent in the significant unmet need of this patient population. Melanoma is a common type of skin cancer, accounting for approximately 74,000 patients diagnosed and 9,900 deaths each year in the United States according to the American Cancer Society&#8217;s Cancer Estimated 2015 Facts and Figures. According to the NCI&#8217;s Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program, about 4-7% of patients with melanoma have metastatic disease. Patients with relapsed/refractory metastatic melanoma following treatment under the current standards of care have a particularly dire prognosis with very few curative treatment options.

&#160;

In addition to the research and development being conducted under the CRADA, in 2014 we established our own internal research and development capabilities in Tampa, Florida, near the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer &#38; Research Institute (Moffitt) on the campus of the University of South Florida, to explore the next-generation of TIL technology and new product candidates, as well as generate new intellectual property.

&#160; 

Company History 

&#160;

We filed our original Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Nevada on September 17, 2007. Until March 2010, we were an inactive company known as Freight Management Corp. On March 15, 2010, we changed our name to Genesis Biopharma, Inc., and in 2011 we commenced our current business. In May 2013 we completed a restructuring of our outstanding debt and equity securities (the &#8220;Restructuring&#8221;) and raised $1.25 million through the sale of our common stock. As part of the Restructuring, we converted $7.2 million of senior secured promissory notes, $1.7 million of bridge promissory notes, and $0.3 million in other outstanding debt into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $1.00 per share. In connection with, and shortly after the Restructuring, we replaced our Chief Executive Officer and most of our directors. On July 24, 2013, we acquired Lion Biotechnologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation. On September 26, 2013, we amended and restated our Articles of Incorporation to, among other things, change our name to Lion Biotechnologies, Inc., effect a 1-for-100 reverse stock split (pro-rata reduction of outstanding shares) of our common stock, increase (after the reverse stock split) the number of our authorized number of shares of common stock to 150,000,000 shares, and authorize the issuance of 50,000,000 shares of &#8220;blank check&#8221; preferred stock, $0.001 par value per share.

&#160;

Our principal executive offices are located at 112 West 34 th Street, 18 th Floor, New York, New York 10120, and our telephone number at that address is (212) 946-4856. Our website is located at www.lionbio.com. Information on our website is not, and should not be considered, part of this Annual Report.

&#160;

Recent Developments 

&#160;

On December 21, 2015 we announced a collaboration to conduct clinical and preclinical research in immuno-oncology with MedImmune. Lion will fund and conduct two Phase 2 clinical trials combining MedImmune&#8217;s investigational PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab with TIL for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma and head and neck cancer.

&#160;

On December 31, 2015, we filed an IND application with the FDA seeking authorization to initiate a company-sponsored, multicenter Phase 2 study of LN-145 for the treatment of cervical cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

&#160;

On February 1, 2016 we announced the allowance of our IND by the FDA to begin clinical trials in cervical cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

&#160;

On February 4, 2016 we announced the hiring of Dr. Steven Fischkoff as our Chief Medical Officer.

&#160;

Strategy 

&#160;

Our goal is to be a leader in the development and commercialization of cell-based immunotherapies to treat solid tumors. We are developing a portfolio of TIL-based product candidates with the potential to meaningfully improve survival and quality of life for cancer patients. Key elements of our strategy include:

&#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Expedite clinical development, regulatory approval, and commercialization of our lead product candidate 

&#160; 

Based on results from NCI-sponsored clinical trials, we plan to advance our lead product candidate, LN-144, for the treatment of patients with refractory metastatic melanoma. We filed an IND with the FDA in December 2014 to initiate a company-sponsored Phase 2 single-arm, multicenter clinical trial of LN-144 in patients with refractory metastatic melanoma. We began enrollment of this study in the second half of 2015.

&#160;

If data from this company-sponsored Phase 2 trial are consistent with previous results from the NCI, we will initiate a multicenter, registration trial. Assuming the results from the registration trial are positive, we will discuss with the FDA the filing of a Biologic License Application (BLA) for approval of LN-144 as a treatment for patients with refractory metastatic melanoma. The FDA may grant accelerated approval for product candidates for serious conditions that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint, including an objective response rate, because such response rate is considered reasonably likely to predict a real clinical benefit of longer life. We believe our accelerated approval strategy may be warranted given the limited options for patients with refractory metastatic melanoma. However, even if the FDA grants accelerated approval, confirmatory trials may still be required by the FDA.

&#160; 

Continue collaboration with our partners, and increase our internal research and development activities, to improve and develop adoptive cell therapy technologies 

&#160;

Since September 2014, we have hired 12 positions within our research and development group in addition to opening our R&#38;D facility in Tampa, Florida. We anticipate further hiring in 2016 in support of expanding our research activities. In addition, our Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (&#8220;CRADA&#8221;) with the NCI offers us the opportunity to identify technologies for development based on human proof-of-concept data, which significantly reduces the risk in our product portfolio. In collaboration with the NCI, we are exploring the treatment of additional solid tumor indications, including cervical, head and neck, lung, bladder, and breast cancers. In early 2016, we received the allowance of our IND in head and neck cancer and cervical cancer. The INDs are based on human proof-of-concept results generated by the NCI under the CRADA. Our CRADA with the NCI expires in 2016 but may be extended for an additional five years. We intend to work with the NCI to further identify future product candidates, including products based on additional novel immunotherapy technology. Our goal is to exclusively license and develop, and obtain regulatory marketing approval for TIL-based technologies to treat a variety of solid cancers based on data from NCI-sponsored clinical trials that we are funding under the CRADA.

&#160; 

Establish commercialization capabilities of current and future pipeline products 

&#160; 

We continue to invest in improving the process and efficiency of manufacturing our product candidates. We plan to use contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) to supply our TIL-based products for our clinical trials in the near term. CMOs limit the amount of upfront capital investment; however, we may establish our own manufacturing facilities in the future for better margins and rapid implementation of innovative changes. We intend to carefully manage our cost structure, and reduce the long-term cost of manufacturing our products, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to reduce our manufacturing costs to commercially attractive levels.

&#160;

Immune system 

&#160;

The immune system recognizes danger signals and responds to threats at a cellular level. The most significant components of the cellular aspect of the adaptive immune response are T cells (or T lymphocytes), so called because they generally mature in the thymus. T cells can be distinguished from other white blood cells by T cell receptors present on their cell surface. These receptors contribute to tumor surveillance by helping T cells recognize infected cells as well as cancerous cells. T cells are involved in both sensing and killing infected or cancerous cells, as well as coordinating the activation of other cells in an immune response.

&#160;

Although the immune system is designed to identify foreign or abnormal proteins expressed on tumor cells, this process is often defective, or not operating optimally, in cancer patients. The defective process sometimes occurs when the cancer cells closely resemble healthy cells and go unnoticed or if tumors lose their protein expression. Additionally, cancer cells employ a number of mechanisms to escape immune detection to suppress the effect of the immune response. Some tumors also encourage the production of regulatory T cells that prevent cytotoxic T cells from attacking the cancer.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Cancer immunotherapy 

&#160;

Despite the progress that has been made over the past several decades, effective treatment of cancer, especially solid tumors, continues to be challenging. Some reasons solid tumors are so difficult to treat are: (i) in many solid tumors, multiple genes (as many as hundreds of genes) are mutated, and solid tumors are heterogeneous, (ii) it is not always clear which particular mutations are critical, and (iii) tumors can adapt and find a way to evade treatments that target a single mutation. In addition, the tumor can suppress the patient&#8217;s natural immune response. When T cells with cancer-specific receptors are absent, present in low numbers, of poor quality or rendered inactive by suppressive mechanisms employed by tumor tissue, the cancer can grow and spread to various organs. In addition, standard of care treatments for cancer can be deleterious to T cells' ability to kill cancer.

&#160;

We believe that adoptive cell therapy, with the use of human cells as therapeutic entities to reengage the immune system, will be the next significant advancement in the treatment of cancer. These cellular therapies may avoid the long-term side effects associated with current treatments and have the potential to be effective regardless of the type of previous treatments patients have experienced. We believe TIL therapy in particular has the potential to treat solid tumors by increasing the effectiveness and number of a patient's cancer-specific T cells.

&#160; 

Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes 

&#160;

Adoptive cell therapy with TIL involves (1) harvesting T cells from a patient's tumor, (2) culturing and expanding the number of TIL, and (3) infusing the functional TIL back into the patient followed by treatment with IL-2. TIL are a heterogeneous population of T cells that can recognize and kill cancer cells. Currently, the TIL manufacturing process that we are developing takes approximately five to six weeks from receipt of the patient's tumor to infusion of the TIL back into the patient. We intend to treat patients with a single infusion of TIL after they receive a short chemotherapy lymphodepletion regimen, which is intended to improve the survival and proliferative capacity of the newly infused T cells. After infusion, the TIL can proliferate inside a patient and potentially infiltrate the tumor microenvironment to eliminate large numbers of cancer cells. TIL can overcome several mechanisms of tumor escape to which endogenous T cells may be susceptible.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Clinical results with TIL in metastatic melanoma 

&#160;

To date, hundreds of metastatic melanoma patients have already been treated with TIL therapy at different hospitals in the US, Europe, Canada, and Israel. Clinical responses have been relatively consistent: approximately half of the melanoma patients treated with TIL have an objective response (i.e. tumor regression of 50% or more), and approximately 10-24 percent of patients have a complete response with no evidence of disease remaining after only one administration). Many patients respond to TIL therapy despite experiencing tumor progression after previously being treated with other therapies.

&#160;

In September 2015, Dr. Steven Rosenberg, presented updated data from a Phase 2 clinical trial of Til therapy in metastatic melanoma at the American Association for Cancer Research Inaugural International Cancer Immunotherapy Conference. Data was presented from a 101-patient, Phase 2 clinical trial conducted at the NCI. In this trial, patients with advanced metastatic melanoma were equally divided in two groups. Both groups were treated according to standard TIL protocol using chemo-ablation, with the second group also receiving total body irradiation. 54% of the patients treated with TIL therapy achieved an objective response. An objective response occurs when there is a complete remission or a partial remission of the tumor. A complete remission requires a complete disappearance of all detectable evidence of disease, and a partial remission typically requires at least approximately 50% regression of measurable disease without new sites of disease. Out of the 101 patients, 24 (24%) had experienced a complete remission and 23 of the 24 patients (96%) showed durability of this response at 30 to 47 months following treatment. Median follow-up time was approximately 35 months. Overall survival (OS) was approximately 80% at 12 months, and median OS had not yet been achieved. Median progression-free survival was approximately 10 months, and 35% of patients were without disease progression at 4 years. The chart below shows the overall response rate at 54 months as of October 1, 2015 including the results of those patients receiving total body irradiation (TBI) and those that didn&#8217;t.

Survival of Patients with Metastatic Melanoma Treated with Autologous 

Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes and IL-2

&#160;

In a publication in Clinical Cancer Research in July 2011, data was presented from 93 patients with metastatic melanoma who were treated at the NCI with TIL therapy (after a lymphodepletion regimen of either chemotherapy alone or with two different doses of radiation) followed by IL-2. Of these patients, 20 out of 93 (22%) achieved a complete tumor regression, and 32 (34%) patients achieved a partial remission for a total overall response rate of 56%, 19 of the 20 complete response patients were reported to have ongoing complete responses beyond three years. The 5-year survival rate of 29% for all 93 patients was similar regardless of prior treatment, with the possible exception of the 5-year survival rate of 44% for the 11 patients who progressed after receiving prior anti-CTLA4 treatment.

&#160;

&#160; Product pipeline 

&#160;

We are developing a portfolio of TIL-based products for the treatment of solid tumors. Our lead pipeline candidate, LN-144, is an adoptive cell therapy using TIL to treat patients with refractory metastatic melanoma. In addition to LN-144, we intend to develop additional TIL-based pipeline products to treat a variety solid tumors, as well as next-generation TIL therapies that are more potent and less costly to manufacture. Under our CRADA, we are providing research and development funding to the NCI for the development of TIL therapies for a variety of solid tumor indications, including cervical, head and neck, bladder, breast, and lung cancers. Depending on the data developed from these efforts, we expect to expand our product development efforts to develop TIL products for one or more of these other indications. In addition, at our research and development facility in Tampa, Florida, we are developing and evaluating a variety of technologies that can potentially improve the growth and potency of TIL.

&#160;

LN-144 

&#160;

We are developing LN-144 to treat metastatic melanoma. Melanoma is a common type of skin cancer, accounting for approximately 76,800 patients diagnosed and 10,130 deaths each year in the United States according to the American Cancer Society, Cancer Facts and Figures estimates for 2015. Patients with relapsed/refractory metastatic melanoma following treatment under the current standards of care have a particularly dire prognosis with very few curative treatment options.

&#160;

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has recently updated its recommendations for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Initial therapy can include checkpoint inhibitors either alone or in combination (ipilimumab, nivolumab, pembrolimumab), targeted therapies for patients with BRAF mutations (dabrafenib/trametinib, vemurafenib/cobimetinib combinations or single agents) or a clinical trial. For patients not responding or progressing and having an adequate clinical status, agents selected from the previous list but of a different therapeutic class can be used as well as high dose IL-2 or a clinical trial. Patients who do not respond to the current second-line therapies have very few treatment options and typically have a very poor prognosis. 

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

LN-145 

&#160;

We are developing LN-145 to treat cervical and head and neck cancers. In December 2015, we filed an IND application with the FDA to conduct clinical trials of LN-145 in these cancers, and in February, 2016 we announced that the IND was allowed thereby permitting us to begin clinical trials in these indications with our product. According to the American Cancer Society&#8217;s Cancer Facts and Figures estimates for 2015, it is estimated that approximately 12,900 women are diagnosed in the United States every year with cervical cancer. If cervical cancer has spread to surrounding tissues or organs and/or the regional lymph nodes, the five-year survival rate is 57%. If the cancer has spread to a distant part of the body, the five-year survival rate is 16%. Head and neck cancer accounts for about 3% of all cancers in the United States. This year, an estimated 59,300 people (43,400 men and 15,900 women) will develop head and neck cancer. It is estimated that 12,300 deaths (8,900 men and 3,400 women) will occur in 2016.

&#160;

Safety 

&#160;

Overall, toxicities or adverse events during TIL therapy have almost entirely been associated with the either the lymphodepletion regimen or the high-dose IL-2 therapy given after TIL infusion. Few adverse events have been documented following the TIL infusion itself, with Grade 3 or higher events rarely found. Severe and life threatening toxicities due to TIL therapy occur mostly in the first week after cell infusion but generally resolve within a few weeks. To date, some patients have experienced vitiligo and uveitis, but there has been no other evidence of off-target effects associated with TIL therapy.

&#160;

Early toxicities related specifically to the infusion of TIL (those which are seen immediately following the cell infusion and prior to IL-2 administration) are generally mild and include fevers, chills, headache, and malaise. Toxicities which occur following administration of IL-2 but are thought to be related to the cells include immune mediated events such as vitiligo, transient uveitis, hearing loss, and vestibular dysfunction. The use of the non-myeloablative lymphodepletion regimen prior to cell administration increases the toxicity of this treatment as profound myelosuppression occurs in all patients.

&#160;

The standard approach to the administration of high-dose IL-2 in all studies is to continue dosing until patients can no longer tolerate treatment. The most commonly seen grade 4 events are pulmonary and renal impairment, and mental status changes. These toxicities may sometimes require intubation for protection of the patient&#8217;s airway. Although these patients require significant supportive measures during this period, all toxicities are reversible and the overwhelming majority of patients have suffered no long term sequelae following this treatment regimen. However, fatal complications are possible and it is therefore only appropriate to carry out this experimental treatment in the context of life threatening metastatic cancer.

&#160;

Development strategy 

&#160;

In February 2015, the FDA allowed an IND to initiate our company-sponsored Phase 2, open-label, single-arm multicenter clinical trial to treat 20 patients with LN-144 for refractory metastatic melanoma. Patients with refractory disease are those who have not responded to other, non-TIL treatments. The trial&#8217;s primary endpoints include safety, and feasibility of LN-144 production using our central manufacturing process. Secondary outcome measures include an additional feasibility measure of number of patients successfully infused with LN-144 and the best overall response rate. If results are consistent with prior results at the NCI, we intend to initiate a larger trial for regulatory approval. The design of this larger trial has yet to be confirmed and will depend on discussions with the FDA and additional clinical data. At the end of 2015, we announced a collaboration to conduct clinical and preclinical research in immuno-oncology with MedImmune. Lion will fund and conduct two Phase 2a clinical trials combining MedImmune&#8217;s investigational PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab with LN-144 for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma, and LN-145 for head and neck cancer. These trials are expected to begin in 2016.

&#160;

Additionally, at the end of 2015, we filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the FDA to conduct clinical trials of LN-145 in the treatment of cervical cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In early 2016, the FDA allowed our IND application and we anticipate that we will begin enrolling a trial for at least one of these indications during 2016.

&#160;

In addition to our company-sponsored and NCI-sponsored clinical trials, Moffitt is conducting a trial to evaluate TIL therapy in combination with ipilimumab or nivolumab in patients with metastatic melanoma.

&#160;

Other TIL-based Product Candidates 

&#160;

Under our CRADA with the NCI, we are providing research and development and clinical funding for the development of TIL therapy for a variety of solid tumor indications, including cervical, head and neck, bladder, breast, and lung cancers. Some of the work being conducted by the NCI includes a clinical trial involving TIL therapy to treat advanced human papilloma virus (HPV)-positive cervical cancer. Data from this trial was published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in April 2015. Out of 9 cervical cancer patients treated with HPV-TIL, two experienced complete remissions reported as ongoing at 22 and 15 months, respectively. Another patient experienced a three-month partial remission. Additionally, the NCI has an ongoing trial to treat patients using TIL within lung cancer; only a couple patients have been treated so far. Depending on results from the research and development and clinical trials conducted at the NCI, we will pursue the development and regulatory approval of TIL therapy for additional indications. 

&#160; 

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Selected TIL 

&#160;

The NCI also has a clinical trial ongoing to evaluate TIL selected for CD137 (also known as 4-1BB) expression to treat patients with metastatic melanoma. The NCI is working on a process to select TIL that express PD-1. This next-generation TIL technology supports more potent and efficient TIL production by selecting for TIL that express various inhibitory receptors, including 4-1BB, PD-1, TIM-3 and/or LAG-3. TIL that express these proteins are associated with higher tumor reactivity, so potentially fewer of the enriched cells are needed to be therapeutically effective. The technology has the potential to reduce the time and cost of manufacturing.

&#160;

Process development/manufacturing 

&#160;

Our manufacturing and processing of TIL-based product candidates is based on the NCI&#8217;s original manufacturing and processing of TIL, which we have modified so that it can be reproduced in a Good Manufacturing Process (cGMP) environment. We believe we have streamlined and improved the NCI&#8217;s original process to be able to produce TIL in a cGMP facility.

&#160;

Because it is critical to rapidly treat patients with highly aggressive cancers, we are implementing in our company-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial, a manufacturing process for LN-144 that takes approximately five to six weeks from receipt of the patient&#8217;s tumor to infusion of the TIL back to the patient. The processing of LN-144 begins with the collection of the patient&#8217;s tumor, which is then sent to a central processing facility, where the T cells are isolated. These cells are stimulated to proliferate, then propagated in cell culture flasks until sufficient cells are available for infusion back into the patient. The TIL is then washed at the cell processing site and shipped back to the clinical center where they can be administered to the patient. In preparation for administration of the TIL, the patient undergoes a short chemotherapy lymphodepletion regimen, which is intended to improve the survival and proliferative capacity of the newly infused T cells. The following diagram illustrates our proposed TIL manufacturing process.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We have entered into Manufacturing Services Agreements with Lonza Walkersville, Inc. (Lonza) and WuXi Apptech (WuXi) pursuant to which they have agreed to manufacture, package, ship and handle quality assurance and quality control of certain clinical trials for our TIL products. The production line for LN-144 is established at Lonza and is providing product for our Phase 2 trial in metastatic melanoma. We expect that the TIL production line at WuXi to be available to produce TIL product by the end of 2016. Cell processing activities will be conducted at both companies under current good manufacturing processes, or cGMP, using qualified equipment and materials. We believe all materials and components utilized in the production of the final TIL product are readily available from qualified suppliers. We expect to rely on Lonza and Wuxi to meet anticipated clinical trial demands. In the future, we may rely on them or other third parties, or develop our own manufacturing capabilities for the manufacturing and processing of TIL-based product candidates for our clinical trials. To meet projected needs for commercial sale quantities, we may develop our own commercial manufacturing facility to supply and process products. Developing our own manufacturing capabilities may require more costs than we anticipate or result in significant delays. If we are unable to develop our own manufacturing capabilities, we will rely on contract manufacturers, including both current and alternate suppliers, to ensure sufficient capacity is available for commercial purposes.

&#160;

&#160;

Commercialization plan 

&#160;

We currently have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities and have limited experience as a company in marketing products. As we progress our clinical trials for our leading product candidates, we intend to further assess the costs and benefits associated with building our own sales and commercialization capabilities.

&#160;

In the U.S., there are approximately 76,800 patients diagnosed with melanoma each year. About 4-7% of patients with melanoma have metastatic disease. If LN-144 is approved, we expect to commercialize the product in the U.S. with a focused specialty sales force targeting the top 50 hospitals and clinics that have experience in treating patients with IL-2. We believe we can address physicians who treat metastatic melanoma with a direct specialty sales force.

&#160;

Additionally, we are developing LN-145 to treat cervical and head and neck cancers. It is estimated that approximately 13,000 women are diagnosed in the U.S. every year with cervical cancer. If cervical cancer has spread to surrounding tissues or organs and/or the regional lymph nodes, the five-year survival rate is 57%. If the cancer has spread to a distant part of the body, the five-year survival rate is 16%. Head and neck cancer accounts for about 3% of all cancers in the U.S. This year, an estimated 59,000 people (43,000 men and 16,000 women) will develop head and neck cancer in this country. It is estimated that 12,000 deaths (9,000 men and 3,000 women) will occur in 2016 from this disease.

&#160;

Outside the US, we have not yet defined our regulatory and commercial strategy for our TIL products. Our commercial strategy for markets outside the US may include the use of strategic partners, distributors, a contract sales force or the establishment of our own commercial infrastructure. We plan to further evaluate these alternatives as we approach approval for one of our product candidates.

&#160;

As additional product candidates advance through our pipeline, our commercial plans may change. Clinical data, size of the development programs, size of the target market, size of a commercial infrastructure, intellectual property protection and manufacturing needs may all influence our U.S., Europe and rest-of-world strategies.

&#160;

Intellectual property 

&#160; 

Intellectual property is of importance in our field and in biotechnology generally. We seek to protect and enhance proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business by seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We plan also to rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations, data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available. To achieve this objective, a strategic focus for us has been to identify and license key patents that provide protection and serve as an optimal platform to enhance our intellectual property and technology base.

&#160;

We have conducted an extensive freedom-to-operate (FTO) analysis of the current patent landscape with respect to our lead product candidate, and based on the analysis, we believe that we have the FTO for TIL therapy. However, the area of patent and other intellectual property rights in biotechnology is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties.

&#160;

Research, development and license agreements 

&#160; 

Currently, our research and development is conducted with the NIH under the CRADA and at our own internal research and development laboratory in Tampa, Florida, near the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer &#38; Research Institute (Moffitt) on the campus of the University of South Florida. See Part II&#8212;Item 7&#8212;&#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; of this report for additional detail regarding our research and development activities.

&#160;

National Institutes of Health and the National Cancer Institute Cooperative Research and Development Agreement 

&#160; 

Effective August 5, 2011, we signed a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the National Institutes of Health and the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Under the terms of the five-year cooperative research and development agreement, we have been working with Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg, to develop adoptive cell immunotherapies that are designed to destroy metastatic melanoma cells using a patient&#8217;s tumor infiltrating lymphocytes.

&#160;

On January 22, 2015, we entered into an amendment to the CRADA to include four new indications. As amended, in addition to metastatic melanoma, the CRADA now also includes the development of TIL therapy for the treatment of patients with bladder, lung, triple-negative breast, and HPV-associated cancers. Under the amendment, the NCI also has agreed to provide us with samples of all tumors covered by the amendment for performing studies related to improving TIL selection and/or TIL scale-up production and process development.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Each party to the CRADA individually owns all inventions, data and materials produced solely by its employees in the course of performing the activities under the CRADA. The parties jointly own any inventions and materials that are produced by employees of both parties in the course of performing activities under the CRADA. Subject to certain conditions, this collaboration provides us with the first option to negotiate commercialization licenses from the NIH to intellectual property relating to TIL-based product candidates conceived or first reduced to practice in performance of the CRADA research plan. This includes the right to negotiate a license to intellectual property related to TIL-based product candidates that are being tested in multiple clinical trials that we are funding under the CRADA. We may exercise this right by providing written notice after either (1) we receive notice that a patent application covering an invention has been filed, or (2) the date on which we file a patent application for an invention. We then have ten months to negotiate the license with the NIH. These time periods may be extended by the U.S. Public Health Service upon good cause. Pursuant to the terms of the CRADA, we are currently required to make quarterly payments of $500,000 to the NCI for support of research activities. To the extent we license patent rights relating to a TIL-based product candidate, we will be responsible for all patent-related expenses and fees, past and future, relating to the TIL-based product candidate. In addition, we will be required to supply certain test articles, including TIL, grown and processed under cGMP conditions, suitable for use in clinical trials, where we hold the IND for such clinical trial. The CRADA has a five-year term expiring on August 5, 2016. Although there can be no assurance, we anticipate that we will renew the agreement on similar terms. The CRADA may be terminated at any time by mutual written consent. We or NCI may unilaterally terminate the CRADA for any reason or for no reason at any time by providing written notice at least 60 days before the desired termination date.

&#160;

Development and Manufacture TIL 

&#160;

Effective October 5, 2011, we entered into a Patent License Agreement with the National Institutes of Health, an agency of the United States Public Health Service within the Department of Health and Human Services (&#8220;NIH&#8221;), which License Agreement was subsequently amended on February 9, 2015 and October 2, 2015. Pursuant to the License Agreement as amended, NIH granted to us an exclusive worldwide right and license to develop and manufacture certain proprietary autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocyte adoptive cell therapy products for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, bladder, lung, breast and HPV-associated cancers, including cervical and head and neck. The License Agreement requires us to pay royalties based on a percentage of net sales (which percentage is in the mid-single digits and subject to certain annual minimum royalty payments), a percentage of revenues from sublicensing arrangements, and lump sum benchmark royalty payments on the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones for each of the various indications and other direct costs incurred by NIH pursuant to the agreement.

&#160;

Exclusive Patent License Agreement 

&#160; 

On February 10, 2015, we entered into an exclusive Patent License Agreement with the NIH under which we received an exclusive, world-wide license to the NIH&#8217;s rights in and to two patent-pending technologies related to methods for improving tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes for adoptive cell therapy. The licensed technologies relate to the more potent and efficient production of TIL from melanoma tumors by selecting for T-cell populations that express various inhibitory receptors. Unless terminated sooner, the license shall remain in effect until the last licensed patent right expires.

&#160;

In consideration for the exclusive rights granted under the exclusive Patent License Agreement, we agreed to pay the NIH a non-refundable upfront licensing fee which was recognized as research and development expense during the year ended December 31, 2015. We also agreed to pay customary royalties based on a percentage of net sales (which percentage is in the mid-single digits), a percentage of revenues from sublicensing arrangements, and lump sum benchmark payments upon the successful completion of our first Phase 2 clinical study, the successful completion of our first Phase 3 clinical study, the receipt of the first FDA approval or foreign equivalent for a licensed product or process resulting from the licensed technologies, the first commercial sale of a licensed product or process in the United States, and the first commercial sale of a licensed product or process in any foreign country.

&#160;

The following is a list of process and method patents and patent applications that we have licensed from the NIH under the NIH License Agreement:

The NCI patents first begin to expire in 2023, with the last of these patents, which broadly claims culturing and administering TIL, expiring in 2029.

&#160;

H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center Research Collaboration Agreement 

&#160;

In September 2014, we entered into a two year research collaboration agreement with the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Inc (&#8220;Moffitt&#8221;). to jointly engage in transitional research and development of adoptive tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte cell therapy with improved anti-tumor properties and process. Total payments by us under the agreement approximate $1.5 million.

&#160; 

Exclusive License Agreement 

&#160;

On July 21, 2014, the Company entered into an Exclusive License Agreement (the &#8220;Moffitt License Agreement&#8221;), effective as of June 28, 2014, with the Moffitt under which we received an exclusive, world-wide license to Moffitt&#8217;s rights in and to two patent-pending technologies related to methods for improving tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes for adoptive cell therapy. Unless earlier terminated, the term of the license extends until the earlier of the expiration of the last patent related to the licensed technology or 20 years after the effective date of the license agreement.

&#160;

Pursuant to the Moffitt License Agreement, we paid an upfront licensing fee which was recognized as research and development expense during 2014. A patent issuance fee will also be payable under the Moffitt License Agreement, upon the issuance of the first U.S. patent covering the subject technology. In addition, we agreed to pay milestone license fees upon completion of specified milestones, customary royalties based on a specified percentage of net sales (which percentage is in the low single digits) and sublicensing payments, as applicable, and annual minimum royalties beginning with the first sale of products based on the licensed technologies, which minimum royalties will be credited against the percentage royalty payments otherwise payable in that year. We will also be responsible for all costs associated with the preparation, filing, maintenance and prosecution of the patent applications and patents covered by the Moffitt License Agreement related to the treatment of any cancers in the United States, Europe and Japan and in other countries selected that Moffitt and we agree to.

&#160;

Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same. We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect.

&#160;

We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.

Competition 

&#160;

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries put significant resources in developing novel and proprietary therapies for the treatment of cancer. We compete with many different sources in the space of immunotherapy, including large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, as well as companies developing novel targeted therapies for cancer. Universities and public and private research institutions in the U.S. and Europe are also potential competitors. For example, a Phase 3 study comparing TIL to standard ipilimumab in patients with metastatic melanoma is currently being conducted in Europe by the Netherlands Cancer Institute, the Copenhagen County Herlev University Hospital, and the University of Manchester. While these universities and public and private research institutions primarily have educational objectives, they may develop proprietary technologies that lead to other FDA approved therapies or that secure patent protection that we may need for the development of our technologies and products. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs and therapies enter the market and advanced technologies become available.

&#160;

Due to their promising clinical therapeutic effect in clinical exploratory trials, we anticipate substantial direct competition from other organizations developing advanced T-cell therapies. In particular, we expect to compete with therapies with genetically engineered T cells rendered reactive against tumor-associated antigens prior to their administration to patients. Genetically engineered T cells are being pursued by several companies, including Adaptimmune, Celgene (in collaboration with bluebird bio), Kite Pharma, Juno Therapeutics, Novartis and others.

&#160;

While other types of cancer immunotherapies may potentially be used in combination with TIL, such as checkpoint blockers, to enhance efficacy, we also expect substantial direct competition from other types of immunotherapies. We face competition from immunotherapy treatments offered by companies such as Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers, Merck, and Roche. Immunotherapy is also being pursued by several biotechnology companies as well as by large-cap pharmaceutical companies. We cannot predict whether other types of immunotherapies may be enhanced and show greater efficacy and may have direct and substantial competition from such immunotherapies in the future.

&#160;

Many potential competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance and may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.

&#160;

Government regulations 

&#160;

The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.

&#160;

The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

&#160;

&#183; completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s current Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulation; &#160;

&#183; submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made; &#160;

&#183; approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is begun; &#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose; &#160;

&#183; preparation of and submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials; &#160;

&#183; satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable; &#160;

&#183; a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review; &#160;

&#183; satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product&#8217;s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigations to assess compliance with Good Clinical Practices; and &#160;

&#183; FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States, which must be updated annually when significant changes are made. &#160;

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a new product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.

&#160;

Our current LN-144 and LN-145 product candidates do not involve genetically-engineered cell, but our future product may. When a trial using genetically engineered cells is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding for recombinant DNA research, prior to the submission of an IND to the FDA, a protocol and related documentation is submitted to and the study is registered with the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities, or OBA, pursuant to the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. Compliance with the NIH Guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving NIH funds for research involving recombinant DNA, and many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The NIH is responsible for convening the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC, a federal advisory committee, that discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific, safety, or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings. The OBA will notify the FDA of the RAC&#8217;s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a protocol. RAC proceedings and reports are posted to the OBA web site and may be accessed by the public. If the FDA allows the IND to proceed, but the RAC decides that full public review of the protocol is warranted, the FDA will request at the completion of its IND review that sponsors delay initiation of the protocol until after completion of the RAC review process.

&#160;

Human immunotherapy products are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the trial period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the trials in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of immunotherapy products, or that the data generated in these trials will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval.

&#160;

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.

&#160;

&#183; Phase I- The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. &#160;

&#183; Phase II- The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase II clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase III clinical trials. &#160;

&#183; Phase III- The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. &#160;

&#183; Phase IV- In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase IV studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA. &#160;

Phase I, Phase II and Phase III testing may not be completed successfully within a specified period, if at all, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

&#160;

BLA Submission and Review by the FDA 

&#160; 

Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product&#8217;s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial User Fee to the FDA, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. A waiver of user fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.

&#160;

Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA&#8217;s goal is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The review process is often significantly extended if the FDA requests additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product&#8217;s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.

&#160;

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate the FDA&#8217;s review and approval of new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. For a fast track product, the FDA may consider sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if relevant criteria are met. A fast track designated product candidate may also qualify for priority review, under which the FDA sets the target date for FDA action on the BLA at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted when there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of 10 months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.

&#160;

Under the accelerated approval program, the FDA may approve a BLA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the biologic&#8217;s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit.

&#160;

In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was enacted and signed into law in 2012, established the new breakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Sponsors may request the FDA to designate a breakthrough therapy at the time of or any time after the submission of an IND, but ideally before an end-of-phase II meeting with FDA. If the FDA designates a breakthrough therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the therapy; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and considering alternative clinical trial designs when scientifically appropriate, which may result in smaller trials or more efficient trials that require less time to complete and may minimize the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment. Breakthrough designation also allows the sponsor to file sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis.

&#160;

Fast Track designation, priority review and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.

&#160; 

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Orphan Drugs 

&#160; 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identify of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.

&#160;

If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee. However, the orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review or approval process. 

&#160;

A designated orphan drug many not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.

&#160;

In 2015, we received orphan drug status for LN-144 in the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma. We plan to seek orphan drug designation for some or all of our other product candidates in specific orphan indications in which there is a medically plausible basis for the use of these products.

&#160;

Post-Approval Requirements 

&#160; 

Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may, among other things, halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution, or withdraw approval of the BLA.

&#160;

We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical quantities of our product candidates, and may rely in the future on third parties for the production of commercial quantities. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing.

&#160;

&#160; 15 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

&#160;

&#183; restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; &#160;

&#183; fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies; &#160;

&#183; refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; &#160;

&#183; product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or &#160;

&#183; injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. &#160;

The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses.

&#160;

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 

&#160;

Our sales, promotion, medical education and other activities following product approval will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to FDA, including potentially the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services and state and local governments. Our promotional and scientific/educational programs must comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the False Claims Act, the Veterans Health Care Act, physician payment transparency laws, privacy laws, security laws, and additional state laws similar to the foregoing.

&#160;

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, the offer, receipt, or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of patients or the use of products or services that would be paid for in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced price items and services. Many states have similar laws that apply to their state health care programs as well as private payors.

&#160;

The False Claims Act, or FCA, imposes liability on persons who, among other things, present or cause to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal health care program. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons submitting claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, that are for services not provided as claimed, or for services that are not medically necessary. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the FCA can result in significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the FCA, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.

&#160;

In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposed new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments or other transfers of value made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for &#8220;knowing failures&#8221;), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians and other healthcare professionals.

&#160;

&#160; 16 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA&#8217;s privacy and security standards directly applicable to &#8220;business associates,&#8221; defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney&#8217;s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect.

&#160;

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.

&#160;

Also, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, future distributors, partners, collaborators or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.

&#160;

Coverage and Reimbursement 

&#160; 

Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the availability of third-party coverage and reimbursement. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Although we currently believe that third-party payors will provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, these third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive clinical studies to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of our products. The product candidates that we develop may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Moreover, a payor&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.

&#160; 

Healthcare Reform 

&#160; 

The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.

&#160;

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, starting in 2013, which will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our product candidates, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations.

&#160;

Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs.

&#160; 

&#160; 17 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Foreign Regulation 

&#160; 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to develop or sell any products outside of the United States. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.

&#160;

In the EU, member states require both regulatory clearances by the national competent authority and a favorable ethics committee opinion prior to the commencement of a clinical trial. Under the EU regulatory systems, marketing authorization applications may be submitted under either a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. It is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes. Because our products are produced in that way, we would be subject to the centralized process. Under the centralized procedure, pharmaceutical companies submit a single marketing authorization application to the EMA. Once granted by the European Commission, a centralized marketing authorization is valid in all EU member states, as well as the EEA countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. By law, a company can only start to market a medicine once it has received a marketing authorization.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had 20 employees, all of whom are full-time, six of whom hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees, 14 of whom were engaged in research and development activities and 6 of whom were engaged in business development, finance, or administrative support. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
