Overview 

&#160;

We were incorporated as a Nevada corporation on April 4, 2006.

&#160;

Corporate History and Prior Business 

&#160;

Effective April 10, 2013, the Company changed its name from Buckingham Exploration Inc. to Tierra Grande Resources Inc. On August 9, 2010, the Company incorporated 0887717 B.C. Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary in British Columbia, Canada. On February 28, 2013, the Company acquired a 100% interest in Tierra Grande Resources, S.A.C. ("Tierra"), a company incorporated in Peru, in consideration for $10.

&#160;

Prior to the Merger, our strategy had been to identify, acquire and advance mining assets that present near term cash-flow with the emphasis on creating early cash flow to enable the Company to consider other projects.

&#160;

In July 2013, we entered into a Letter of Intent to acquire the Buldibuyo Gold Project in Peru, South America. We subsequently entered into an updated Letter of Intent to acquire the project in May 2014. It was our intention to acquire 100% of the gold project, which had produced high grade ore in the past, and had engaged in some due diligence to qualify expectations and timelines. However, despite the execution of the Letter of Intent and numerous attempts to accommodate the vendors, the vendors failed to deliver essential information to us required to conduct a thorough technical and legal due diligence on the project and associated holding companies and, accordingly, we terminated negotiations to acquire the project in July 2014.

&#160;

&#160; 3 

&#160;

The Company continued to review what we believed to be opportunities with potential in Peru through our strategic alliance with ExploAndes S.A.C. ("ExploAndes"). ExploAndes is a leading firm of geology consultants and project logistics managers located in Peru assisting in the identification, assessment and advancement of projects in South America. ExploAndes has a proven track record of delivering professional services to the South American mining industry from mineral project review and assessment to project management.

&#160;

The Company also continued to review what we believed to be opportunities with potential in Australia through our strategic alliance with Mining Plus Pty Ltd ("Mining Plus"), a leading firm of mining and geoscience consultants with offices in Australia, Canada and Peru that assist in the identification, assessment and advancement of mining projects.

&#160;

Given the Company&#8217;s then financial condition and its focus in Peru and Australia, its interests in the Dome, Byng and Tramp claims in Canada were not renewed. See our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2014 for more information regarding our prior business.

&#160;

Agreement and Plan of Merger 

&#160;

We entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), on April 13, 2015 with VNUE, Inc., a company incorporated pursuant to the laws of the State of Washington ("VNUE"), and TGRI Merger Corp., a Nevada corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("Merger Sub"). 

&#160;

On May 29, 2015, Vnue, Inc. (formerly Tierra Grande Resources Inc.) ("TGRI"), closed the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), initially entered into on April 13, 2015 with Vnue Washington and all of the stockholders of Vnue Washington.

&#160;

Upon closing of the Merger Agreement, a total of 507,629,872 shares of TGRI common stock were issued as follows: (i) all shares of Vnue Washington stock of any class or series issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Merger Agreement were automatically converted into and exchanged for an aggregate of 477,815,488 fully paid and non-assessable shares of TGRI common stock; and (ii) an aggregate of 29,814,384 shares of TGRI common stock were issued to Matheau J. W. Stout, Esq. as payment for services performed prior to and in connection with the Merger. The number of TGRI common shares issued to Vnue Washington's stockholders for the acquisition of all shares of Vnue Washington represented approximately 79.0% of the issued and outstanding common stock immediately after the closing of the Merger Agreement. The board of directors and the members of the management of TGRI resigned and the board of directors and the member of the management of Vnue Washington became the board of directors and the member of the management of the combined entities upon closing of the Merger Agreement.

&#160;

As a result of the controlling financial interest of the former stockholders of Vnue Washington, for financial statement reporting purposes, the merger between TGRI and Vnue Washington was treated as a reverse acquisition, with Vnue Washington deemed the accounting acquirer and TGRI deemed the accounting acquiree under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Section 805-10-55 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. The reverse acquisition is deemed a capital transaction in substance whereas the assets and liabilities of Vnue Washington (the accounting acquirer) are carried forward to TGRI (the legal acquirer and the reporting entity) at their carrying value before the combination and the equity structure (the number and type of equity interests issued) of Vnue Washington is being retroactively restated using the exchange ratio established in the Merger Agreement to reflect the number of shares of TGRI issued to effectuate the acquisition. The number of common shares issued and outstanding and the amount recognized as issued equity interests in the consolidated financial statements is determined by adding the number of common shares deemed issued and the issued equity interests of Vnue Washington immediately prior to the business combination to the unredeemed shares and the fair value of TGRI determined in accordance with the guidance in ASC Section 805-40-55 applicable to business combinations, i.e. the equity structure (the number and type of equity interests issued) in the consolidated financial statements immediately post the combination reflects the equity structure of TGRI, including the equity interests the legal parent issued to effect the combination.

&#160;

A copy of the Merger Agreement was attached as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company&#8217;s 8-K filed on April 14, 2015. The description of the Merger Agreement herein is qualified by the terms of the full text of the agreement attached thereto and the terms thereof are incorporated herein by reference.

Overview of our Current Business 

&#160;

Through VNUE, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, we now carry on business as a live entertainment music technology company which brings bands and fans together by capturing professional quality audio and video recordings of live performances and delivers the experience of a venue to your home and hand.

&#160;

By streamlining the processes of curation, clearing, capturing, distribution and monetization of music performances, VNUE manages and simplifies the complexities of the music ecosystem. 

&#160;

VNUE produces and captures rich content through its Front of House mobile application and provides world-wide distribution and monetization of live concerts and other events through a suite of mobile, web administration applications, allowing an artist to seamlessly deliver and sell their live performances directly to the fans who attend their shows. 

&#160;

While VNUE will primarily be used in live music venues, we are also branching into many other entertainment experiences such as comedy, plays, musicals, university lectures, professional demonstrations and panel discussions, as well as action sports and religious events.

&#160;

VNUE's business model is based on the business to consumer VNUE software application, now in beta testing, as well as business to business monetization of our back end rights clearing system software, which is currently in development with a projected beta some time during the first quarter 2017.

&#160;

We are a relatively new company and to date we have received no revenues from our operations. VNUE, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, only recently commenced operations and we have undertaken only organizational activities and software application development. Our independent auditors have raised substantial doubts as to our ability to continue as a going concern without significant additional financing. Accordingly, for the foreseeable future, we will continue to be dependent on additional debt and equity financing in order to maintain our operations and continue with our development activities.

&#160;

Acquisitions will be pursued where the Directors consider that there is clear value through the addition of expertise, customers, monetization potential or geographic footprint.

&#160;

Our principal offices are located at 104 W. 29th Street, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10001. Our telephone number is 857-777-6190. The live music and entertainment space is constantly searching for new monetization outlets; VNUE has a solution that melds content and technology in almost any venue in the world. This befits not only artist, labels, publishers and live venues but the fan.

&#160;

The History of VNUE 

&#160;

VNUE was founded in August of 2013 by Matthew Carona and Louis Mann with the vision of creating a collective network of connected venues that empower and assist bands, artist, and entertainers to monetize their performance (audio &#38; video) in the venue using mobile technologies. VNUE has developed its business and technology in tandem to enter into deals with venues, artists and labels across the United States using this initial launch strategy. The collective venue network effect, whereby each deal makes the offer more compelling to other potential customers, has been a key driver of VNUE&#8217;s growth to date. The initial focus of the business in early 2014 as a YouTube certified company, to create a Multi-Channel Network (MCN) specifically focused on live streaming and monetization of content through the google display network. VNUE&#8217;s first customer being the HipHopGods, a collective organization that manages hip-hop, rap, and emerging artists. Their initiative was to monetize all content across the digital and social landscape and create live streams through all HHG YouTube channels. Through VNUE&#8217;s current platform, network and services, HHG is working on unlocking new revenue streams. Through VNUE&#8217;s artist dashboard artists and publishers can simplify the processes of curation, clearing, capturing, distribution and monetization in venues and across the digital landscape.

&#160;

In 2014, VNUE acquired Lively LLC a Seattle based music technology company and direct-to-fan mobile platform that brings artists, fans and brands together by capturing the live performance. As a result of the acquisition, VNUE has grown its platform, expanded into enabled venues and enhanced its platform offering to approve the monetization model and further evangelize the creation of the collective network of connected venues that empower artists to create content and monetize it.

&#160;

&#160;

Markets and Opportunity 

&#160;

It is estimated that there are over 400,000 Indie bands performing in the US domestic market alone, and while a handful of them will get produced under a label, even less will be big enough to attempt to utilize today&#8217;s current methods to capture and deliver live performance audio from a given show. Currently artist, bands and performers are missing a simple capture and immediate sell tool kit to deliver high quality audio and video to their fans for each of their live shows.

&#160;

VNUE&#8217;s goal first and foremost is to empower artists - not only in serving their fans, but generating a monetary footprint, which can foster the continued creation of their art.

&#160;

VNUE intends to strategically align an economically viable in-house digital solution during a golden era of live music by creating a platform and connected network that is extremely complex and resource-intensive. Through a suite of applications and with a dashboard centered at the heart of the software platform, a connected network of partners, labels, publishers, right management, artist, bands and venues and a range of advanced 3rd party distributors is created. VNUE allows distribution of content to all types of digital and social focused sites as well as within its own sandbox, with a range of revenue models and centralized reporting that the artists, labels and publishers get to keep. By using the VNUE platform, artists are allowed to create, market and distribute their shows while creating new revenue streams from digital sources. Fans are able to connect with their favorite performers in a new way, discover new performances and listen to and watch their live performances on their mobile devices, computer, gaming consoles, OTT services and connected home televisions.

&#160;

Serving multiple customers on one platform enables VNUE to cost-effectively invest significant amounts in innovation to drive continuous product iterations that evolve as digital technology evolves.

&#160;

Monetization and Business Model 

&#160;

In today&#8217;s social media world, fans want to be able to immediately share with their friends the fact they were at a concert and how great the performance was that they just attended. Fans do not want to wait for a post-tour, live show CD to be produced from some other show on the tour months after the fact. They want the performance they witnessed and they want it now. VNUE intends to provide the solution.

&#160;

Artists, music industry executives, record labels, music publishers and live performance venues will access VNUE&#8217;s solution as a service, through which they are able to benefit from a range of different revenue models to optimize the value of their live and on-demand content across a majority of digital ecosystems. The Company&#8217;s primary revenue model is to take a share of the revenue from sales of concert performances both audio and video or audio separately. In addition, the revenue stream can also include an advertising or sponsorship component that was integrated into tours. This revenue share aligns business outcomes for all parties and means that costs are primarily baked into the software and delivery agent. Typical revenue shares are expected to range from 15-60 percent and vary based on the level of service allocated to each artist, label, music publisher, and performance venue and the scale of the business opportunity. Secondary revenue streams include fees for storage, usage, licensing and software upgrades (design or social advertising distribution). VNUE&#8217;s revenue share is reported as net revenue (i.e. gross transaction revenues minus any revenue share due to third parties).

&#160;

As a software-focused business, VNUE can take advantage of a single technology platform to continuously acquire users at low marginal cost leveraging artist promotion, in venue marketing and mobile notifications. Further automation and self-service tools are intended to allow VNUE to provide more advanced services to the industry and artist without adding significantly to the cost base or headcount.

&#160;

VNUE intends to deliver a technology suite to accompany the publisher that allows them to source and then generate a wide swath of reports down to granular level in venue streams and conversions. VNUE looks to commercialize the in venue sales components that is currently missing and expand these efforts globally and embed live and on-demand content from the VNUE audience network efficiently and cost-effectively. These features, such as its real time audio sweating tools, are designed to significantly reduce the manual effort required to display music content and, therefore, increase the efficiency of content distribution and the revenue yield per performance sold.

&#160;

&#160;

Products, Services and Intellectual Property 

&#160;

The company&#8217;s cloud-based software platform, contains four major pieces of intellectual property, based on a full stack Amazon Web Services deployment on which we support our mobile app, our Cross Platform Desktop Player, our VNUE Front of House (FOH) (for capturing soundboard audio), and the Artist Admin Portal for digital rights clearing and management of all artists, shows, and content. This technology is based on current languages and technologies and has been designed to be easily deployed and maintained. Currently, our software is being held as a proprietary trade secret and there are no current intentions to formally file documents with the United State Patent and Trademark Office; however, we may do so in the future.

&#160;

VNUE&#8217;s Audio Manager is called Front of House. Sound Engineers at a music venue can use the Front of House application to capture performances for a band on any given night and immediately distribute digitally to patrons. The VNUE Front of House (FOH) is a mobile audio capture/upload tool that allows the user to capture a stereo feed from a live performance, split it into individual tracks, and upload m4a files of each track directly to the VNUE server for distribution through the VNUE Platform (Web, Mac, mobile applications). In addition, VNUE software associates the newly created live recording with its master track ID, automating publishing while the fans are still in the venue. Additionally, the system has an automated backend process anchored into a separate dashboard to handle the clearing and publishing aspects associated with the audio/video distribution and sale.

&#160;

The Venue Artist Admin portal, an enterprise level content management system with administration features, allows VNUE to oversee all content and copyright clearances for artists, venues, labels and publishers. Each artist, label and publisher will receive a custom dashboard for their respective industry need.

&#160;

Using VNUE&#8217;s suite of consumer focused products fans can relive a life-changing show from the night before, or catch up on their favorite band&#8217;s recent show on tour across the world. Shortly after a show&#8217;s conclusion, it is available for purchase on VNUE&#8217;s web, mac and mobile applications. In addition, 24 hours post show the audio and or video will also be syndicated for sale across our distribution network for all fans to enjoy.

&#160;

Moments after the show is done, the Front of House compiles the file for sale at the venue. All of a sudden your phone buzzes with a notification from VNUE, telling you the venue you&#8217;re still standing in, is now and exclusively offering the audio or video for a price determined before the show.

&#160;

VNUE partners with artists to record and quickly deliver live shows to fans in studio-quality audio and video. Content is purchased and downloaded in the app moments after the show so fans can stay connected to the band even when they aren't looking up.

&#160;

VNUE Artist Admin 

&#160;

Our Venue Artist Admin suite works this way: an artist signs up on www.vnue.com, uploads their tracks for the next show and then uses the FOH application for Audience Point of Sale for their Audio or Video recorded show. That is our definition of a "VNUE Enabled Artist". Our simple audio options let artists easily connect with their fans without losing quality. Using our Front of House software and a stereo audio interface (ex. Apogee Duet), artist can capture their live shows at any venue. The shows are then cleared, managed, and distributed through the VNUE Audience Platform and Artist Admin.

&#160;

VNUE Admin 

&#160;

VNUE Admin is a collective network of connected Venues. Enabled with VNUE Front of House Technology, Customized Audience Admin Account and a content publishing hub made up of HD cameras and location based software to collect various points of consumer related data prior, during and post the performance. VNUE believes this is the definitive technology and product for live events, venues and music festivals.

&#160;

Enabled Venues 

&#160;

The sound engineer or designated management at the venue will have access to a customized web administration system to align their bookings, artists, and revenue from in venue sales. We call these Venues, Enabled. VNUE partners directly with venues to give them the tools they need to record live shows. We invest upfront in audio and video capture equipment or sync with current video services at venues. An on-site promotional partnership with the venue encourages app downloads at the show for new members and repeat customers. The result is a cost effective customer acquisition model for Artists as well as VNUE.

&#160;

&#160;

The VNUE Proposition 

&#160;

VNUE provides an enterprise level solution to its partners through a software enabled service. The VNUE approach is focused on high quality content digital production and acquiring rights prior to the performance. VNUE seeks to distribute back to publishers and work with licensing to increase revenue and build a long tail value proposition for every performance captured. VNUE provides customers with audience network information and support for distribution of content to all types of destination sites including content owner sites, platforms and the business network of music publishers, streaming music services and "over the top" devices. 

&#160;

Management believes its enterprise level solution drives the following benefits to customers:

&#160;

* VNUE Super Admin &#8211; Proprietary Rights management software that enables granular control of content distribution, including by geography, personality types and publishers. &#160;

&#160;

* Long Term Investment &#8211; VNUE primarily takes a share of customers&#8217; revenue, with VNUE taking the majority of its fees when the revenue is delivered. &#160;

&#160;

* iOS Focused&#8211; VNUE&#8217;s software enables customers to take advantage of enhance for iOS features, that greatly increase the probability of purchase. &#160;

&#160;

* Flexible Revenue Models &#8211; Labels, Venues, and Artists work with us to adapt their deal based on different revenue models including licensed, ad-funded, and direct to consumer or sponsorship. &#160;

&#160;

* Keep the Data &#8211; Performance data is collated from the FOH, Mobile Sandbox, Super Admin and Artist Admin into one dashboard. Financial data can be downloaded anytime for any reason. Full transparency of VNUE data is extremely important. &#160;

&#160;

* VNUE Audience reach &#8211; VNUE&#8217;s distribution to a pre-connected network of publishers enables access to potentially larger audiences. 

&#160;

License Agreement with Universal Music Corp. 

&#160;

On November 2, 2015, the Company entered into a License Agreement with Universal Music Corp. ("Universal"). The License Agreement is effective September 8, 2015, and has a term of Two (2) Years from the Effective Date. Under the terms of the License Agreement, Universal is granting to VNUE a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable license to create and distribute content using certain Universal compositions, more specified in the Grant of Right&#8217;s section of the License Agreement.

&#160;

The Company will then market and sell this content via the VNUE Service at certain agreed upon price points more specifically described in the Business Model and Price Points Section of the License Agreement, and the Company shall pay Universal royalties for each sale of the content as specified in the Royalty Rates section of the License Agreement.

&#160;

In accordance with the Minimum Guarantee provision of the License Agreement, the Company was required to pay Universal a minimum first year fee of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000), which is due within 10 days of execution and a second year minimum fee of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000), which is due upon the commencement of the second year of the Term. The Company paid the minimum first year fee of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) to Universal on November 10, 2015.

&#160;

Now that the Company has paid the minimum first year fee to Universal, the Company&#8217;s plan is to continue raising capital through the sales of its common stock in order to complete the development of its VNUE Service. Once development of the VNUE Service is complete, the Company plans to concentrate on the marketing and sales of content created under the Licensing Agreement with Universal, as well as identifying strategic opportunities with other music industry leaders.

&#160;

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

A number of musicstreaming services exist, but these services are not packaging the audio for a fan that is currently at the performance to purchase and enjoy immediately after the show. In addition, they are not providing services on a cost effective automated basis necessary to provide high quality audio recordings that is cost effective enough to be utilized by artists to cover all their individual shows. Our main competition is a small group, which includes set.FM, LoveLive, SoundHalo, and nugs.net. There are some competitors that do post show production audio through a very manual and delayed process that is not available to the fans for days if not weeks after the show, and their process is so costly that the artists have to pick and choose certain shows to cover. Others have attempted to capture live audio at shows and burn the show to a CD for distribution at the show, but again, this is a very costly and manual process that does not produce enough CDs fast enough at a given show to meet the demand. We believe the CD process does not scale effectively, and cannot efficiently cover every show in a tour. Nor does the CD process appear to have the capability to cover thousands of bands at once as every show requires a significant amount of equipment and manpower deployed at each show. Additionally, the idea of delivery media on a CD is antiquated and we believe the ability to deliver media on mobile devices is key to capturing today&#8217;s market audience. In addition, antiquated capture and delivery methods have an additional difficulty in that there is a complex back end process of clearing publishing and royalty rights which is difficult for the average band to navigate in order to produce and deliver live show audio to their fans. VNUE&#8217;s acquisition of the Lively software provides the technology for a comprehensive solution that addresses these concerns in one automated solution. 

&#160;

However, there can be no assurance that even if we are successful, we will be able to compete effectively with the other companies in our industry. As we are a relatively small company, we face the same problems as other small companies in any industry, such as lack of available funds, established distribution channels or an established customer base. Our competitors may be substantially larger and better funded than us, and have significantly longer histories of operation and development than us. In addition, they may be able to provide more competitive products than we can and generally be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in legislation and regulations relating to the industry. Additionally, our competitors may devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products or services than we do. Increased competition could also result in loss of key personnel, reduced margins or loss of market share, any of which could harm our business.

&#160;

Key Business Strengths 

&#160;

Management believes that the key factors that will contribute to VNUE&#8217;s success are:

&#160;

1. The Connected Venue Network Pre-connected Network &#8211; VNUE has a large and growing pre-connected network of partners &#8211; over 750 content owners and over 6,500 publishers. Content owners can quickly access this network of publishers who may want their content and publishers can access a wide range of premium content across the Business&#8217; industry verticals. &#160;

&#160;

2. VNUE Audience Innovation &#8211; VNUE has a team of approximately 10 people involved in R&#38;D, tasked with continually upgrading and enhancing the software product to better serve customers&#8217; evolving needs. Upgrades are easy to deploy due to the platform&#8217;s modular design &#8211; it has been constructed as a service orientated cloud-based architecture for maximum scalability. &#160;

&#160;

3. Advanced Services &#8211; VNUE&#8217;s specialist teams offer a range of advanced services including audience development, metadata and search engine optimization, premium advertising and sponsorship sales, live streaming event support and premium support for enterprise customers. VNUE Studios leverages a creative network of content producers, talent, publishers and brands to identify opportunities for the creation of the best live programming. &#160;

&#160;

4. Business Model Aligned to the Customer Interests &#8211; VNUE&#8217;s primary revenue model is to take a share of those revenues due to the customer for use of its software and services as well as approved license to package performances within our products. Aligning VNUE success with the success of its customers greatly helps the artist VNUE&#8217;s strategy is not focused on production in-house, or acquiring rights (therefore it does not actively seek to compete with content owners), nor does it own B2C sites (therefore it does not actively seek to compete with publishers). &#160;

&#160;

5. Track Record of Delivering for Key Reference Customers &#8211; Due to the proposition described above, capabilities and customer benefits, VNUE has signed up a range of established customers. The Directors believe that a track record of recruiting and delivering for established customers will support further business development activities. 

&#160;

&#160;

We are subject to the reporting and other requirements of the Exchange Act and we intend to furnish our shareholders annual reports containing financial statements audited by our independent registered public accounting firm and to make available quarterly reports containing unaudited financial statements for each of the first three quarters of each year. We file Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Current Reports on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission in order to meet our timely and continuous disclosure requirements. We may also file additional documents with the Commission if they become necessary in the course of our company&#8217;s operations.

&#160;

The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The address of that site is www.sec.gov.

&#160;

Patents, Trademarks, Franchises, Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts 

&#160;

As stated above we have no current plans for any registrations such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements or labor contracts. We will assess the need for any copyright, trademark or patent applications on an ongoing basis.

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

We spent $550,262 on research and development activities during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily related to the development of our proprietary software and we anticipate that we will incur additional expenses on research and development over the next 12 months. Our planned expenditures on our operations are summarized under the section of this annual report entitled "Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations". &#160;
