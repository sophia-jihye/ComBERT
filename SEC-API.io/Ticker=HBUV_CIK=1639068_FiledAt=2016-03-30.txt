 Item 1. Description of Business. 

&#160; 

Organization 

&#160; 

We were incorporated in the State of Delaware as a for-profit company on March 2, 2015 and established a fiscal year end of December 31. On March 4, 2015, we filed a Certificate of Correction to the Certificate of Incorporation to correct our name to Hubilu Venture Corporation from Hubilu Venture Corp. On March 5, 2015, our incorporator adopted our bylaws and appointed our sole director. We were formed to provide consulting and advisory services to real estate professionals and investors to assist them in finding properties and evaluating them for purchase or leasing. We are not a real estate brokerage firm and do not engage in real estate brokerage activities. Our services are limited to research and analysis of real estate properties and advising clients on the best use of their real estate assets. We are also considering raising funds to invest in real estate assets. 

&#160; 

On March 5, 2015, we issued 25,000,000 shares of our common stock, valued at $0.001 per share, to our founder, David Behrend for $75,000 in cash or $0.003 per share. On April 30, 2015, Mr. Behrend transferred his shares to Jacaranda Investments, Inc., a Wyoming corporation, which he owns 100% of, in exchange for 30,000 shares of Jacaranda&#8217;s common shares. From April 7, 2015 to May 7, 2015, we sold and issued 235,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.10 per share for $23,500 to 40 accredited investors. On May 4, 2015, we issued 191,500 shares of our common stock, valued by our sole director at $0.10 per share, or $19,150, to 12 individuals for services rendered to us. Six of these individuals had already purchased shares of our common stock at the price of $0.10 per share. Presently, we estimate our monthly burn rate is approximately $4,500 per month, which consists of general and administrative expenses and professional fees. We believe that our present capital is insufficient to cover our monthly burn rate for the next 12 months. We believe that we will require approximately $55,000 in either cash or our common stock to accomplish the goals set out in our plan of operation, which we intend for fund from the recent sale of our common stock as well as advances from our majority shareholder, which has orally agreed to advance our working capital, if necessary. We also intend to use our common stock to accomplish these goals in order to conserve our cash if we are able to negotiate the payment for services with our shares. To the extent we are unable to accomplish our goals with the issuance of common stock for services and products, then we use our capital or we will borrow funds from our majority shareholder, which has orally agreed to advance us the necessary working capital. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares in this offering. See &#8220;Use of Proceeds.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Our principal business, executive and registered statutory office is located at 205 South Beverly Drive, Suite 205, Beverly Hills, CA 90212 and our telephone number is (310) 308-7887 and email contact is info@hubilu.com . Our URL address is www.hubilu.com .

&#160; 

Business 

&#160; 

We are a startup enterprise that commenced operations in March 5, 2015, and, until June 2015, was limited to organizational and business development activities. In June 2015, we entered into our first consulting agreement with a client. We are real estate advisory and consulting company that assists real estate investor professionals, as well as established companies, with advisory and consulting services focused on providing research, analysis and acquisition opportunities to them. Our mission is to assist investors and professionals in the early stage analysis of market opportunities and the evaluation of properties prior to them committing capital for the purchase or the leasing of real estate properties. We intend to focus our initial marketing efforts in the commercial markets; however, we will also look at residential and income producing markets. We intend to use the Internet as well as the services of independent sales consultants to market our services to investors and professionals in Southern California with our initial efforts focused in Beverly Hills and Los Angeles. We have had limited operations and have limited financial resources. Our auditors indicated in their report on our financial statements (the &#8220;Report&#8221;) that &#8220;the Company&#8217;s lack of business operations and early losses raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.&#8221; Our operations from March 5, 2015 to June 2015 have been devoted primarily to start-up, development and operational activities, which include: 

&#160; 

&#160; 1. Formation of the Company; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2. Development of our business plan; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 3. Evaluating various target real estate professionals and investors to market our services; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 4. Research on marketing channels/strategies for our services; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 5. Secured our website domain www.hubilu.com and beginning the development of our initial online website; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 6. Research on services and the pricing of our services. &#160; 

Commencing in June 2015, we engaged our first client, 112 South Eucalyptus Avenue, LLC, to assist it in evaluating the best use of its property. We are also in negotiations with Camden Realty Group, a real estate brokerage firm, to provide consulting services to it and to have it provide brokerage services to our clients. 

&#160; 

We intend to provide services to target investors and professionals with the mission to assist them in investment and property evaluation strategies and provide hands-on support to reduce evaluation time and resources and increase the speed for them to determine whether to proceed with a real estate lease or investment. Besides general property evaluation services, we intend to offer services to assist the principals with property development ideas and investment structure. 

&#160; 

Our goal is to assist investors by providing them with the property opportunities, analysis and guidance to enhance their ability to purchase or lease real estate. We are not real estate brokers and do not intend to offer brokerage services. We intend to initially target buyers of properties and property owners in Southern California. 

&#160; 

Market Opportunity 

&#160; 

We believe the real estate consulting and advisory industries are sectors of the U.S. economy, which have seen increased activity since interest rates are at their current levels. We believe that an attractive opportunity exists for a public company focused on assisting real estate investors and users in evaluating real estate opportunities and we intend to provide services. We intend to initially focus on the commercial real estate market. 

&#160; 

The total value of U.S. commercial real estate assets was estimated to be $12 trillion at the end of 2012. Property sales in the commercial real estate sector for properties priced at $1 million and above reached over $340 billion, or approximately 37,000 transactions, in 2012. This was a 41% increase in dollar volume and 32% increase in the number of transactions over 2011, following a 32% increase in dollar volume and an 18% increase in the number of transactions over 2010. 

&#160; 

Historically, the U.S. commercial real estate industry has tended to be cyclical. The commercial real estate market experienced a significant downturn from the 2007 peak to a trough in 2009, representing the most severe downturn in property sales since at least 1990. Since 2009, commercial property sales for transactions of $1 million and above have increased by 97% and dollar volume has increased by 235%. Such property sales in 2012, however, were still 16% below the 2007 peak in number of transactions and 32% below the peak in dollar volume. This cyclical upturn has been, and we believe will continue to be, primarily driven by attractive yields, improving property fundamentals and the availability and cost of financing. 

&#160; 

Attractive Yields . According to Real Capital Analytics, average commercial real estate yields (capitalization rates) for the four major property types currently range from 4.0% to 7.0%, which compare favorably to alternative investments such as stocks and bonds. We believe these attractive yields are a key driver of improving capital inflows for commercial real estate investments. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Improving Property Fundamentals. Property fundamentals have improved since 2009, with multifamily properties in particular experiencing a strong recovery. We expect further increases in occupancy and rental rates in all four primary commercial real estate sectors of multifamily, retail, office and industrial properties. 

&#160; 

Availability and Cost of Financing . The availability and low cost of debt financing has been a significant contributor to the recent improvement in the U.S. capital markets and the U.S. commercial real estate market. Low interest rates and improved access to capital are key factors fueling investment sales activity. 

&#160; 

We analyze and intend to segment the commercial real estate market into three major segments by investment size and focus primarily on the private client segment: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Private client segment: properties with prices under $10 million; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Hybrid segment: properties with prices equal to or greater than $10 million and less than $20 million; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Institutional segment: properties with prices of $20 million and above. &#160; 

We intend to focus our business on the private client segment, as we believe it represents the largest and most active market segment in the commercial real estate investment industry. We believe private clients, many of whom are individuals and partnerships, are impacted by life or partnership changes that often override market and macroeconomic conditions. Due to these personal and partnership drivers, we believe properties in this segment exhibit a high turnover rate. We believe private clients often take advantage of rising prices to dispose of assets, refinance, acquire and/or exchange assets into new opportunities. The attractive financial results for property investment provide the opportunity for redeployment of capital, which supports a high number of sales transactions. Additionally, the private client segment is highly fragmented with a large number of buyers, sellers and properties in different geographic regions and sectors. We believe it is also the most underserved market segment and intend to offer our consulting services to private clients. We believe our competition will come from brokerage firms, consulting departments of accounting and consulting firms and other real estate advisory firms. 

&#160; 

Our Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Our goal is to consult with real estate investors and professionals, as well as companies, by providing consulting and advisory services, which will allow the investors to focus on their core businesses. We believe that by consulting with investors prior to retaining a broker, we will generate client loyalty while we add value for our potential clients. The following are key elements of our strategy: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Guide our clients through the challenges of early analysis. We intend to help provide our clients with the research and analysis to minimize their time to evaluate properties. We believe that our services will reduce time, costs and accelerate the time to enable the client to purchase or lease real estate without the pressure of commission sales professionals. We believe that we can advise them by providing strategic guidance, access to local market intelligence and opportunities that may not exist through traditional listing services. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Apply a structured consulting process to our clients. Web-based technology is becoming increasingly capital-efficient, and our model is optimized to leverage this trend through the use of the Internet and various online research tools. By advising clients in the earliest stages of their evaluation of potential investments, we believe that we will allow them to achieve desired returns without the sales pressure or commissions associated with typical real estate transactions. We intend to use web-based applications to enable us to assist our clients. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Consult to diverse, innovative and dynamic clients. We believe that the low capital requirements to consult with our target clients, coupled with the various timelines of real estate investors, enable us to spread our resources across a wide spectrum of clients. Some clients will be interested in leasing while others will be interested in purchasing or pursuing joint ventures. By diversifying our target clients, we believe we will mitigate risk and enhance the value of our services to our clients. &#160; 

We intend to provide consulting and advisory services to our clients for fee-based compensation. We will negotiate our fees on a case-by-case basis and intend to offer hourly rates and flat fees for our services. 

&#160; 

We will provide a variety of services to client companies, including the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Analysis of current trends and transactions; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Consulting on structure and financing including corporate formation services; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Investment analysis of properties; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Marketing, branding and public relations with respect to leasing and branding; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Formulating operating strategies for the properties; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Formulating other strategies designed to maximize property values, including tenant analysis; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Relocation services; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Introductions to potential joint venture partners; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Assisting in financial modeling. &#160; 

We intend to derive income from our clients for the performance of these services. 

&#160; 

Since March 2, 2015 (our inception) to December 31, 2015, we generated $2,500 revenues and have a net loss of $92,755. In June 2015, our first client retained us. We anticipate that we will generate revenues as we secure additional clients in the next twelve months. We believe that we have insufficient working capital to continue our operations for the next 12 months; however, our majority shareholder has orally agreed to advance us our necessary working capital, if necessary. We currently have two officers and a sole director. These individuals allocate time and personal resources to us on a part-time basis and devote approximately 10 hours per week to us. 

&#160; 

As of the date of this Report, we have 25,426,500 shares of $0.001 par value common stock issued and outstanding, which is owned by 47 shareholders. We do not have any shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding. The aggregate market value of our common stock based on the offering price of $0.12 per share is $3,051,180. Our stockholders&#8217; equity as of our most recent audit, which is December 31, 2015, is $24,895.

&#160;

&#160; 

We intend to assist our clients to optimize the impact of their financial decisions and property evaluation efforts. By optimizing this service, we will help facilitate the rapid dissemination of high impact and high quality information. 

&#160; 

The following are some of the marketing and communications services we intend to offer to our potential clients: 

&#160;

&#160; 

Financing Strategy 

&#160; 

Our ability to increase our revenues and market our services will dependent on additional outside financing, advances from our majority shareholder and reinvesting our profits. Primary responsibility for the overall planning and management of our services will rest with our management. For each service we plan to offer, management will need to assess the market and our needs to offer such consulting or advisory services at cost-effective prices to real estate investors and users. All decisions will be subject to budgetary restrictions and our business control. We cannot provide any guarantee that we will be able to ever offer services on cost-effect terms. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The real estate advisory and consulting services industry is highly competitive. We compete with a variety of companies, many of which have greater financial and other resources than us, or are subsidiaries or divisions of larger organizations. In particular, the industry is characterized by a small number of large, dominant organizations that perform this service, such as real estate brokerage firms, accounting firms, law firms, consultants as well as many companies that have greater financial and other resources than us. 

&#160; 

The major competitive factors in our business are the timeliness and quality of service, the quality of work product the clients desire and price. Our ability to compete effectively in providing customer service and quality services depends primarily on the level of training of our future staff, the utilization of computer software and equipment and the ability to deliver our services in an effective and timely manner. We believe we will compete effectively in all of these areas. 

&#160; 

Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, managerial, marketing and other resources than we do and they may compete more effectively than we can. If our competitors offer services at lower prices than we do, we may have to lower the prices we charge, which will adversely affect our results of operations. Furthermore, many of our competitors are able to obtain more experienced employees than we can.
