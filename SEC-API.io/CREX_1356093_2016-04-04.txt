&#160; 

Our Company 

&#160; 

Creative Realities, Inc. is a Minnesota corporation that provides innovative digital marketing technology solutions to retailers, brand marketers, venue-operators, enterprises, non-profits and other organizations throughout the United States and a growing number of international markets. Our technology and solutions include: digital merchandising systems, interactive digital shopping assistants and kiosks, mobile digital marketing platforms, digital wayfinding platforms, digital menu board systems, dynamic signage, and other digital marketing technologies. We enable our clients&#8217; engagement with consumers by using combinations of our technology and solutions that interact with mobile, social media, point-of-sale, wireless networks and web-based platforms. We have expertise in a broad range of existing and emerging digital marketing technologies, as well as the following related aspects of our business: content, network management, and connected device software and firmware platforms; customized software service layers; hardware platforms; digital media workflows; and proprietary processes and automation tools. We believe we are one of the world&#8217;s leading digital marketing technology companies focused on helping retailers and brands use the latest technologies to create better shopping experiences. 

&#160; 

Our main operations are conducted directly through Creative Realities, Inc., and under our wholly owned subsidiaries Creative Realities, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Broadcast International, Inc., a Nevada corporation, Wireless Ronin Technologies Canada, Inc., and ConeXus World Global, LLC, a Kentucky limited liability company. 

&#160; 

We seek to generate revenue in this business by:

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; consulting with our customers to determine the technologies and solutions required to achieve their specific goals, strategies and objectives; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; designing our customers&#8217; digital marketing experiences, content and interfaces; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; engineering the systems architecture delivering the digital marketing experiences we design &#8211; both software and hardware &#8211; and integrating those systems into a customized, reliable and effective digital marketing experience; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; managing the efficient, timely and cost-effective deployment of our digital marketing technology solutions for our customers; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; delivering and updating the content of our digital marketing technology solutions using a suite of advanced media, content and network management software products; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; maintaining our customers&#8217; digital marketing technology solutions by: providing content production and related services; creating additional software-based features and functionality; hosting the solutions; monitoring solution service levels; and responding to and/or managing remote or onsite field service maintenance, troubleshooting and support calls. &#160; 

We seek to generate revenue through these activities through: bundled-solution sales; service fees for consulting, experience design, content development and production, software development, engineering, implementation, and field services; software license fees; and maintenance and support services related to our software, managed systems and solutions. 

&#160; 

Our digital marketing technology solutions have application in a wide variety of industries. The industries in which we sell our solutions are established and include hospitality, branded retail, automotive, food service and retail healthcare, but the planning, development, implementation and maintenance of technology-enabled experiences involving combinations of digital marketing technologies is relatively new and evolving. Moreover, a number of participants in these industries have only recently started considering or expanding the adoption of these types of technologies, solutions and experiences as part of their overall marketing strategies. As a result, we remain an early stage company without an established history of profitability. 

&#160; 

We believe that the adoption and evolution of digital marketing technology solutions will increase substantially in years to come both in the industries on which we currently focus and in others. We also believe that adoption of our solutions depends upon not only the services and solutions that we provide, but also depends heavily upon the cost of hardware used to process and display content on them. While the costs of hardware configurations and software media players have historically decreased and we believe they will continue to do so at an accelerating rate, flat panel displays and players typically constitute a large portion of the expenditure customers make relative to the entire cost of implementing a digital marketing system implementation and can be a barrier to customer deployment. As a result, we believe that the broader adoption of digital marketing technology solutions is likely to increase, although we cannot predict the rate at which such adoption will occur. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Another key component of our business strategy, especially given the evolving industry dynamics in which we operate, is to acquire and integrate other operating companies in the industry in conjunction with pursuing our organic growth objectives. We believe that the selective acquisition and successful integration of certain companies will accelerate our growth; enable us to aggregate multiple customer bases onto a single business and technology platform; provide us with greater operating scale; enable us to leverage a common set of processes, tools, and cost efficiencies; and ultimately result in higher operating profitability and cash flow from operations. Our management team is actively pursuing and evaluating alternative acquisition opportunities on an ongoing basis. Our management team and Board of Directors have broad experience with the execution, integration and financing of acquisitions. We believe that, based on the foregoing and other factors, the Company can successfully serve as a consolidator of multiple business and technology platforms serving similar markets. 

&#160; 

Our company sells products and services primarily throughout North America. 

&#160; 

Corporate Organization 

&#160; 

Our principal offices are located at 22 Audrey Place, Fairfield, New Jersey 07004, and our telephone number at that office is (973) 244-9911. 

&#160; 

The legal entity that is the registrant was originally incorporated and organized as a Minnesota corporation under the name Wireless Ronin Technologies, Inc. in March 2003. Our business initially focused on the provision of expertised digital media marketing solutions to customers, including digital signage, interactive kiosks, mobile, social media and web-based media solutions. As indicated below under the &#8220;Recent Acquisitions&#8221; caption, we acquired the assets and business of Broadcast International, Inc., a Utah corporation and public registrant, through a merger transaction that was effective as of August 1, 2014. Then on August 20, 2014, we consummated a merger transaction with Creative Realities, LLC, a privately owned Delaware limited liability company, in which we issued a majority of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. In that merger transaction, we acquired the interactive marketing technology business of Creative Realities that we currently operate. Shortly after that merger, we changed our corporate name from Wireless Ronin Technologies, Inc. to &#8220;Creative Realities, Inc.&#8221; On October 15, 2015, we acquired the assets and business of ConeXus World Global, LLC, a privately owned Kentucky limited liability company for which we issued preferred and common stock. In that merger transaction, we acquired the systems integration and marketing technology business of ConeXus World that we currently operate. 

&#160; 

Our fiscal year ends December 31. Neither us nor any of our predecessors have been in bankruptcy, receivership or any similar proceeding. Our corporate structure, including our principal operating subsidiaries, is as follows:

As of the date of this filing, Broadcast International, Inc. does not conduct any operations.

Recent Acquisitions 

&#160; 

Acquisition of ConeXus World Global 

&#160; 

On October 15, 2015, we completed the acquisition of ConeXus World Global, LLC for 2,080,000 shares of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, and the conversion of $823 of ConeXus World Global debt into (i) 2,639,258 shares of our common stock, and (ii) $150 in principal amount of our convertible debt. As a result of the merger transaction, ConeXus World Global, LLC is now our wholly owned operating subsidiary. The merger was completed by the filing of articles of merger with the Kentucky Secretary of State. ConeXus World Global LLC does not include the operations of ConeXus World EMEA BVBA based on the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization. It is not probable that this Belgian affiliate of ConeXus World Global will be acquired by the Company as part of this transaction.

&#160;

The debtholders and members of ConeXus received a total of 1,664,000 shares of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $1.00, and 16,000,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.01. In accordance with the terms of the amendment to the agreement and plan of merger and reorganization, an additional 416,000 shares of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock and 4,000,000 shares of common stock, collectively referred to as holdback shares, shall be issued immediately upon the reorganization of the capital structure of a Belgian affiliate of ConeXus, as discussed below. 

&#160;

The agreement and plan of merger and reorganization contemplates an ownership matter among the former ConeXus security holders involving an erroneously documented ownership situation related to the Belgian affiliate, with the resolution of such matter, including the reorganization of the Belgian affiliate, subject to the agreement of the Company. Effective February 8, 2016, the Company has extended the period from March 31, 2016 to June 30, 2016 for the ConeXus security holders to resolve such ownership matter, including the reorganization of the Belgian affiliate. The Company believes that the reorganization of the Belgian affiliate is not probable and as such no liability has been recorded for these additional shares, the consideration has not been included in the purchase price allocation and the financial results of the Belgian affiliate have not been included in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Belgian affiliate is not currently nor is it expected to be under the common control ownership or a variable interest entity of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company is involved in discussions and the early stages of negotiations with the Belgian affiliate to pursue the potential acquisition of such affiliate in a separate transaction, independent of the ConeXus World Global, LLC Plan of Merger and Reorganization described herein. 

&#160; 

Acquisition of Creative Realities 

&#160; 

On August 20, 2014, we completed the merger contemplated by the Creative Realities Merger Agreement, thereby acquiring the business of Creative Realities. At the effective time of the merger and pursuant to the Creative Realities Merger Agreement, Slipstream Funding, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and then the sole member of Creative Realities, received shares of our common stock equivalent to approximately 59.2% of common stock issued and outstanding after the merger, calculated on a modified fully diluted basis, together with a warrant to purchase an additional number of common shares equal to 1.5% of our common stock outstanding immediately after the merger, again calculated on a modified fully diluted basis. In each case, &#8220;modified fully basis&#8221; means inclusion of all shares of outstanding common stock together with common stock issuable upon exercise or conversion of outstanding securities, other than the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (see above) and certain shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants and options having an exercise price agreed by the parties to have been significantly out of the money. 

&#160; 

Creative Realities, LLC was the &#8220;accounting acquirer&#8221; in the merger transaction, while Wireless Ronin Technologies (the registrant) was the &#8220;legal acquirer,&#8221; and therefore the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition. Creative Realities, LLC was determined to be the accounting acquirer since its former shareholder has majority control of the common stock, is the largest shareholder, and has the majority members of the board of directors and of the executive officers. In accordance with reverse acquisition accounting, the historical financial statements of the registrant will become those of Creative Realities, with the financial results of Wireless Ronin Technologies included only beginning with the merger date. Effective September 15, 2014, Wireless Ronin Technologies, Inc. changed its name to Creative Realities, Inc. 

&#160; 

Acquisition of Broadcast International 

&#160; 

On March 5, 2014, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization with Broadcast Acquisition Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, and Broadcast International, Inc., which was later amended on April 11, 2014 (as amended, the &#8220;Broadcast Merger Agreement&#8221;). We completed the merger on August 1, 2014, and thereupon acquired the business and assets of Broadcast International. As a result of the merger, each share of common stock of Broadcast International, including securities convertible or exercisable into shares of Broadcast International common stock, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the close of business on August 1, 2014 was converted into the right to receive .00535594 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of our common stock, resulting in our issuance of an aggregate of 7,093,273 shares of common stock to the former security holders of Broadcast International.

As used throughout this report, the &#8220;Company&#8221; generally refers to the registrant (Creative Realities, Inc., formerly known as Wireless Ronin Technologies, Inc.), unless the context otherwise indicates or requires. Use of the first person &#8220;we&#8221; refers to the Company or, if the context so requires, to the historical business of Creative Realities or the registrant itself, in each case prior to the consummation of the August 20, 2014 merger transaction.

Financing Arrangements 

&#160; 

Factoring Agreement 

&#160; 

On October 15, 2015, Creative Realities, Inc., together with its subsidiary entities Creative Realities, LLC, ConeXus World Global, LLC, and Broadcast International, Inc., entered into a Factoring Agreement with Allied Affiliated Funding, L.P. Under the Factoring Agreement, Allied Affiliated Funding, or &#8220;Allied,&#8221; will from time to time purchase approved receivables from the Company and its subsidiaries up to a maximum amount of $3.0 million. Upon receipt of any advance under the Factoring Agreement, the Company and its subsidiaries will have sold and assigned all of their rights in such receivables and all proceeds thereof to Allied. The purchase price for receivables bought and sold under the Factoring Agreement is equal to their face amount less a 1.10% base discount. Added to the base discount is an additional .037% discount from the face value of a receivable for each day beyond 30 days that the receivable remains unpaid by the account debtor. The base discount is subject to adjustment in the event of changes in the prime lending rate as published by The Wall Street Journal. Allied will provide advances under the Factoring Agreement net of an applicable reserve amount, as specified in the agreement. The obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries under the Factoring Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. Allied has the right under the Factoring Agreement to require the Company to repurchase any receivable earlier sold for a purchase price equal to the face value of the receivable. The Factoring Agreement has an initial term of one year, subject to potential one-year renewals thereafter, unless earlier terminated (or not renewed) in accordance with the agreement. The Company may terminate the Factoring Agreement at any time prior to the expiration of the initial term (or a renewal period) upon payment to Allied of an early termination fee equal to $37.5. 

&#160; 

Common Stock 

&#160; 

In December 2015, we entered into an Exchange Agreement with an accredited investor who held a warrant, dated February 18, 2015, for the purchase of up to 1,515,152 shares of our common stock. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, we issued 975,000 shares of our common stock to the investor in exchange for the investor&#8217;s surrender of the warrant. 

&#160; 

Secured Promissory Notes 

&#160; 

On December 28, 2015, we offered and sold to certain accredited investors, or &#8220;Investors,&#8221; secured promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1,250 and five-year warrants to purchase up to 2,232,143 shares of Creative Realities&#8217; common stock at a per-share price of $0.28 (subject to adjustment), all pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement. Our principal subsidiaries &#8212; Creative Realities, LLC, Wireless Ronin Technologies Canada, Inc., and Conexus World Global, LLC &#8212; were also parties to the Securities Purchase Agreement and are co-makers of the secured convertible promissory notes. Obligations under the secured convertible promissory notes are secured by a grant of collateral security in all of the tangible assets of the co-makers pursuant to the terms of an Amended and Restated Security Agreement.

&#160; 

The secured promissory notes bear interest at the annual rate of 14% (12% payable in cash and 2% payable in the form of additional principal) with an initial maturity date of April 15, 2017, which may be extended at the sole discretion of each Investor to October 15, 2017. At any time prior to the maturity date, the Investors may convert the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest into Creative Realities&#8217; common stock at a conversion price currently equal to $0.28 per-share (subject to adjustment). 

&#160; 

In connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement, we and the Investors entered into Registration Rights Agreements requiring Creative Realities to file an initial registration statement, on or prior to February 11, 2016, under the Securities Act of 1933 to register the resale of the shares of its common stock issuable upon conversion of the secured notes and upon exercise of the warrants, and to subsequently use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933. The initial registration statement was filed on February 11, 2016.

&#160; 

On October 26, 2015, Creative Realities, Inc. entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an accredited investor under which it offered and sold a secured convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $300 together with a five-year warrant to purchase up to 535,714 shares of common stock at a per-share price of $0.28, in a private placement exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933. Our principal subsidiaries &#8212; Creative Realities, LLC, Wireless Ronin Technologies Canada, Inc., and Conexus World Global, LLC &#8212; were also parties to the Securities Purchase Agreement and are co-makers of the secured convertible promissory note. Obligations under the secured convertible promissory note are secured by a grant of collateral security in all of the personal property of the co-makers pursuant to the terms of a security agreement. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The secured convertible promissory note bears interest at the rate of 14% per annum. Of this amount, 12% per annum is payable monthly in cash, and the remaining 2% per annum is payable in the form an additional principal through increases in the principal amount of the note. Upon the consummation of a change in control transaction of the company or a default, interest on the secured convertible promissory note will increase to the rate of 17% per annum. The secured convertible promissory note matures on April 15, 2017, unless the holder of a note elects to extend the maturity date for an additional six-month period, in which case such note will mature on October 15, 2017. At any time prior to the maturity date, the holder of a promissory note may convert the outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest into our common stock at a conversion rate of $0.28 per share, subject to adjustment. We may not prepay the secured convertible promissory note prior to the maturity date. The secured convertible promissory note contains other customary terms. In connection with the offer and sale of the above-described secured convertible promissory note, we paid commissions to a placement agent aggregating $15. In connection with the June 23, 2015 and the May 20, 2015 financing transactions described below, we entered into extension agreements to extend the maturity date of those notes to April 15, 2017. See June 23, 2015 and May 20, 2015 below. 

&#160; 

On October 15, 2015, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an accredited investor under which it offered and sold a $500 14% interest secured convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $500 together with an immediately exercisable five-year warrant to purchase up to 892,857 shares of common stock at a per-share price of $0.28, in a private placement exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933. The interest is payable 12% in cash and 2% as additional principal amount to the note. In connection with the offer and sale of the above-described secured convertible promissory note, we paid commissions to a placement agent aggregating $25. 

&#160;

&#160; 

On June 23, 2015, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an accredited investor under which it offered and sold a secured $400 14% interest convertible promissory note with an immediately exercisable five-year warrant to purchase up to 640,000 shares of common stock at a per-share price of $0.30, in a private placement exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933. The interest is payable 12% in cash and 2% as additional principal amount to the note. In connection with the offer and sale of the October 26, 2015 secured convertible promissory note, we entered into extension agreements with the holders of this secured convertible promissory to primarily extend the maturity date to April 15, 2017 in exchange for 75,000 shares of common stock valued at $16. This change is accounted for as a modification of the debt. The $16.5 is recognized as additional debt discount that will be amortized over the remaining life of the debt. 

&#160; 

On May 20, 2015, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an accredited investor under which it offered and sold a secured $465 14% interest convertible promissory note with a five-year warrant immediately exercisable to purchase up to 762,295 shares of common stock at a per-share price of $0.30, in a private placement exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933. This secured convertible promissory note together with accrued but unpaid interest and a 25% conversion premium was converted into a $585 - 14% convertible promissory note, maturing on August 18, 2016, with new five-year warrants to purchase up to 935,210 shares of common stock at a price of $0.30 per share, in a private placement exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933. The interest is payable 12% in cash and 2% as additional principal amount to the note. In connection with the offer and sale of the October 26, 2015 secured convertible promissory note, we entered into extension agreements with the holders of this secured convertible promissory to primarily extend the maturity date to April 15, 2017 in exchange for 109,688 shares of common stock valued at $24. This change is accounted for as a modification of the debt. The $24 is recognized as additional debt discount that will be amortized over the remaining life of the debt.

&#160; 

Preferred Stock 

&#160; 

On October 15, 2015, we issued 1,664,000 shares of Series A-1 Convertible Preferred Stock at $1.00 per share as part of the consideration for the acquisition of Conexus World Global, LLC. 

&#160; 

On August 18, 2014, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with institutional and accredited investors pursuant to which we offered and sold an aggregate of 5,190,000 shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock at $1.00 per share, and issued five-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 6,487,000 shares of common stock at a per-share price as adjusted of $0.37, in a private placement exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933. 

&#160; 

The preferred stock entitles its holders to a 6% dividend, payable semi-annually in cash or in kind. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company issued an aggregate of 345,794 and 112,448 shares of preferred stock in satisfaction of its semi-annual dividend obligation for 2015 and 2014, respectively.

&#160;

Subject to certain conditions, we may call and redeem the preferred stock after three years. During such time as a majority of the preferred stock sold remains outstanding, holders will have the right to elect a member to our Board of Directors. The preferred stock has full-ratchet price protection in the event that we issue common stock below the conversion price, as adjusted, subject to certain customary exceptions. The warrants issued to purchasers of the preferred stock contain weighted-average price protection in the event that we issue common stock below the exercise price, as adjusted, again subject to certain customary exceptions. In the Securities Purchase Agreement, we granted purchasers of the preferred stock certain registration rights pertaining to the common shares they may receive upon conversion of their preferred stock and upon exercise of their warrants. 

&#160; 

Changes in Management and Board of Directors 

&#160; 

On October 15, 2015, Richard Mills was appointed to our Board of Directors. Mr. Mills also became our Chief Executive Officer. As a result of this appointment, Mr. John Walpuck is no longer our Interim Chief Executive Officer, but retained his titles of Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer. In connection with the appointment of Richard Mills as the Chief Executive Officer, we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Mills. Under the employment agreement, Mr. Mills will serve as Chief Executive Officer for a two-year term, which automatically renews for additional one-year periods unless either we or Mr. Mills elects not to extend the term. The agreement provides for an initial annual base salary of $270, subject to annual increases but generally not subject to decreases, and includes provisions for the right to receive up to 4,951,557 performance shares of common stock in connection with a series of performance-based requirements. These performance shares are included as part of the purchase price of ConeXus. Under the agreement, Mr. Mills is eligible to participate in performance-based cash bonus or equity award plans for our senior executives. Mr. Mills will participate in our employee benefit plans, policies, programs, perquisites and arrangements to the extent he meets applicable eligibility requirements. 

&#160; 

In November 2015, Patrick O&#8217;Brien was appointed to our Board of Directors. 

&#160; 

On August 20, 2014, our directors Steve Birke, Scott Koller and Howard Liszt resigned their positions on our Board of Directors, and Messrs. Paul Price, Alec Machiels and David Bell were appointed by the board to fill the vacancies created by those resignations. At the time of their resignations, Messrs. Birke and Liszt each served on the board&#8217;s audit and compensation committees. On the same date, Mr. Scott Koller resigned his position as our Chief Executive Officer but retained the title of President, and Mr. Paul Price was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer. On September 30, 2014, we delivered Mr. Koller a written notice of termination, which termination was effective December 4, 2014. On March 9, 2015, Kent Lillemoe resigned his position on our Board of Directors. On April 13, 2015, the Board of Directors and Paul Price agreed to terminate Mr. Price's employment agreement with the Company without cause. Such termination was effective immediately and effected the immediate removal of Mr. Price from his position as a member of the Board of Directors. Also on April 13, 2015, the Board of Directors appointed John Walpuck as Creative Realities' interim Chief Executive Officer. 

&#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

We believe that our existing business model is highly scalable and can be expanded successfully as we continue to grow organically and integrate our recent merger transactions, strengthen our operational practices and procedures, further streamline our administrative office functions, and continue to capitalize on various marketing programs and activities. 

&#160; 

Industry Background 

&#160; 

Over approximately the past 18-24 months, we believe certain digital marketing technology industry trends are creating the opportunity for retailers, brands, venue-operators, enterprises, non-profits and other organizations to create innovative shopping, marketing, and informational experiences for their customers and other stakeholders in various venues worldwide. These trends include: (i) the expectations of technology-savvy consumers; (ii) addressing on-line competitors by improving physical experiences (iii) accelerating decline in the cost of hardware configurations (primarily flat panel displays) and software media players; (ii) the continued evolution of mobile, social, software and hardware technologies, applications and tools; (iii) the increasing sophistication of social networking platforms; (iv) increasingly complex customer requirements related to their specific digital marketing technology and solution objectives; and (v) customers challenging service providers with the delivery of a satisfactory consumer experience with the traditional pressure on reducing installation and ongoing operating costs. 

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

As a result, a growing number of retailers, brands, venue-operators and other organizations have identified the need and opportunity to implement increasingly cost-effective and &#8220;sales-lifting&#8221; digital marketing, and interactive experiences to market to their customers. These include creating unique and customized experiences for targeted, timely offerings and relevant promotions; improving engagement resulting in increased sales; and increasing shopping basket size. We believe our clients consider capitalizing on these industry trends to be increasingly critical to any successful &#8220;store of the future&#8221; retail and brand sales environment, especially where sales staff turnover is high, training outcomes are inconsistent and product knowledge is low. 

&#160; 

Companies are accomplishing their strategies by implementing various digital marketing technology solutions, which: are implemented in multiple forms and types of configurations and locations; attempt to achieve any of a broad range of individual or combination of objectives; contain various levels of targeting; have the ability to instantly manage single or multiple locations remotely from a customer&#8217;s desktop or other connected device at each location; and are built to deliver or contain a standard or customized experience unique to and within the customer&#8217;s environment.

Our Markets 

&#160; 

We currently market and sell our marketing technology solutions through our direct sales force and word-of-mouth referrals from existing customers. Select strategic partnerships and lead generation programs also drive business to the Company through targeted business development initiatives. We market to companies that seek digital marketing solutions across multiple connected devices and who specifically seek or could benefit from enhancements to the customer experience offered in their stores, venues, brands or organizations. 

&#160; 

Our digital marketing technology solutions have application in a wide variety of industries. The industries in which we sell our solutions are established and include of hospitality, branded retail, automotive, food service and retail healthcare, but the planning, development, implementation and maintenance of technology-enabled experiences is relatively new and evolving. Moreover, a number of participants in these industries have only recently started considering or expanding the adoption of these types of technologies, solutions and experiences as part of their overall marketing strategies.

Seasonality 

&#160; 

A portion of our customer activity is influenced by seasonal effects related to traditional end of calendar year peak retail sales periods and other factors that arise from our target customer base. Nevertheless, our revenues can be materially affected by the launch of new markets, the timing of production rollouts, and other factors, any of which have the ability to reduce or outweigh certain seasonal effects. 

&#160; 

Effect of General Economic Conditions on our Business 

&#160; 

We believe that demand for our services will increase in part as a result of recovering retail-related real estate investments and new construction and the recent economic recovery in general. These general economic improvements generally make it easier for our customers to justify decisions to invest in digital marketing technology solutions. 

&#160; 

Regulation 

&#160; 

We are subject to regulation by various federal and state governmental agencies. Such regulation includes radio frequency emission regulatory activities of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, the consumer protection laws of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, product safety regulatory activities of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, and environmental regulation in areas in which we conduct business. Some of the hardware components that we supply to customers may contain hazardous or regulated substances, such as lead. A number of U.S. states have adopted or are considering &#8220;takeback&#8221; bills addressing the disposal of electronic waste, including CRT style and flat panel monitors and computers. Electronic waste legislation is developing. Some of the bills passed or under consideration may impose on us, or on our customers or suppliers, requirements for disposal of systems we sell and the payment of additional fees to pay costs of disposal and recycling. Presently, we do not believe that any such legislation or proposed legislation will have a materially adverse impact on our business. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

While we believe there is presently no direct competitor with the comprehensive offering of technologies, solutions and services we provide to our customers, there are individual competitors who offer pieces of our solution stack. These include digital signage software companies such as Stratacache, Four Winds Interactive, and ComQi; marketing services companies such as Sapient Nitro or digital signage systems integrators such as Convergent. Some of these competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do and may be able to respond more rapidly than we can to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. We believe that our sales and business development capabilities, network operations center capabilities, our comprehensive offering of digital marketing technology solutions, brand awareness, focus, and proprietary processes are the primary factors affecting our competitive position.
