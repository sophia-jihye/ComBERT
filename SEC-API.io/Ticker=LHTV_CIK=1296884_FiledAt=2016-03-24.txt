 ITEM 1. BUSINESS:

General Description of Business 

&#160; 

Structure 

&#160; 

The Lightstone REIT is a Maryland corporation, formed on June 8, 2004 and subsequently qualified as a real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;) during year ending December 31, 2006. The Lightstone REIT was formed primarily for the purpose of engaging in the business of investing in and owning commercial and residential real estate properties located throughout the United States.

&#160;

The Lightstone REIT is structured as an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, (&#8220;UPREIT&#8221;), and substantially all of its current and future business is and will be conducted through Lightstone Value Plus REIT, L.P. (the &#8220;Operating Partnership&#8221;), a Delaware limited partnership formed on July 12, 2004. The Lightstone REIT as the general partner, held a 98% interest in the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2015 (See Noncontrolling Interests below for discussion of other owners of the Operating Partnership).

&#160;

The Lightstone REIT and the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the &#8220;Company&#8221; and the use of &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or similar pronouns in this annual report refers to the Lightstone REIT, its Operating Partnership or the Company as required by the context in which such pronoun is used. 

&#160;

The Lightstone REIT is managed by Lightstone Value Plus REIT, LLC (the &#8220;Advisor&#8221;), an affiliate of The Lightstone Group (the &#8220;Sponsor&#8221;), under the terms and conditions of an advisory agreement. The Sponsor and Advisor are majority owned and controlled by David Lichtenstein, the Chairman of our Board of Directors and its Chief Executive Officer.

&#160;

We own and manage a diversified (by geographical location and by type and size of property) portfolio of commercial and residential properties located throughout the United States. We have acquired fee interests in multi-tenant, community, power and lifestyle shopping centers, and in malls located in highly trafficked retail corridors, high-barrier to entry markets, and sub-markets with constraints on the amount of additional property supply. Additionally, we have acquired fee interests in lodging properties located near major transportation arteries in urban and suburban areas; multi-tenant industrial properties located near major transportation arteries and distribution corridors; and market-rate, middle market multi-family residential properties at a discount to replacement cost.

We operate within four operating segments which are our Retail Segment, Multi-Family Residential Segment, Industrial Segment and Hospitality Segment. The Unallocated amounts include our investments in real estate companies which are not wholly owned as well as our corporate operations. As of December 31, 2015, on a collective basis, we (i) wholly or majority owned and consolidated the operating results and financial condition of 3 retail properties containing a total of approximately 0.7 million square feet of gross leasable area (&#8220;GLA&#8221;), 14 industrial properties containing a total of approximately 1.0 million square feet of GLA, 5 multi-family residential properties containing a total of 1,216 units, and 1 hotel hospitality property containing 363 rooms. All of our properties are located within the United States. As of December 31, 2015, the retail properties, the industrial properties and the multi-family residential properties were 90%, 62% and 96% occupied based on a weighted-average basis, respectively. The hospitality property&#8217;s average revenue per available room was $79 and occupancy was 62% for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Additionally, we account for our 2.5% membership interest in the Joint Venture under the cost method and as of December 31, 2015, its carrying value of $1.5 million is included in investment in related parties on the consolidated balance sheets. 

&#160;

Primary Investment Objectives 

&#160;

Our primary investment objectives are:

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Capital appreciation; and &#160;

&#183; Income without subjecting principal to undue risk. &#160;

Acquisition and Investment Policies 

&#160;

We have, to date, acquired residential and commercial properties principally, all of which are located in the continental United States and made real estate-related investments. Our acquisitions include both portfolios and individual properties. Our current commercial holdings consist of retail (primarily multi-tenant shopping centers), lodging and industrial properties and our residential properties are principally comprised of &#8217;&#8216;Class B&#8217;&#8217; multi-family complexes. Additionally, we have made certain preferred equity investments in related parties.

&#160;

We may acquire the following types of real estate interests:

&#160;

&#183; Fee interests in market-rate, middle market multifamily properties at a discount to replacement cost located either in emerging markets or near major metropolitan areas. We will attempt to identify those sub-markets with job growth opportunities and demand demographics which support potential long-term value appreciation for multifamily properties. &#160;

&#183; Fee interests in well-located, multi-tenant, community, power and lifestyle shopping centers and malls located in highly trafficked retail corridors, in selected high-barrier to entry markets and submarkets. We will attempt to identify those sub-markets with constraints on the amount of additional property supply will make future competition less likely. &#160;

&#183; Fee interests in improved, multi-tenant, industrial properties located near major transportation arteries and distribution corridors with limited management responsibilities. &#160;

&#183; Fee interests in improved, multi-tenant, office properties located near major transportation arteries in urban and suburban areas. &#160;

&#183; Fee interests in lodging properties located near major transportation arteries in urban and suburban areas. &#160;

All of the properties are owned by subsidiary limited partnerships or limited liability companies. These subsidiaries are single-purpose entities that we created to own a single property, and each have no assets other than the property it owns. These entities represent a useful means of shielding our Operating Partnership from liability under state laws and will make the underlying properties easier to transfer. However, tax law disregards single-member LLCs and so it will be as if the Operating Partnership owns the underlying properties for tax purposes. Use of single-purpose entities in this manner is customary for REITs. Our independent directors are not required to approve all transactions involving the creation of subsidiary limited liability companies and limited partnerships that we use for investment in properties on our behalf. These subsidiary arrangements are intended to ensure that no environmental or other liabilities associated with any particular property can be attributed against other properties that the Operating Partnership or we will own. The limited liability aspect of a subsidiary&#8217;s form will shield parent and affiliated (but not subsidiary) companies, including the Operating Partnership and us, from liability assessed against it. No additional fees are imposed upon the REIT by the subsidiary companies&#8217; managers and these subsidiaries are not affected our stockholders&#8217; voting rights.

&#160;

We have not and do not intend to make significant investments in single family residential properties; leisure home sites; farms; ranches; timberlands; unimproved properties not intended to be developed; or mining properties.

&#160;

Not more than 10% of our total assets may be invested in unimproved real property. For purposes of this paragraph, &#8220;unimproved real properties&#8221; does not include properties acquired for the purpose of producing rental or other operating income, properties under construction and properties for which development or construction is planned within one year. Additionally, we do not invest in contracts for the sale of real estate unless in recordable form and appropriately recorded.

&#160;

Although we are not limited as to the geographic area where we may conduct our operations, we have invested and will continue to invest in properties located near the existing operations of our Sponsor, in order to achieve economies of scale where possible.

&#160;

Financing Strategy and Policies 

&#160;

We utilize leverage when acquiring our properties. The number of different properties we acquire are affected by numerous factors, including, the amount of funds available to us. When interest rates on mortgage loans are high or financing is otherwise unavailable on terms that are satisfactory to us, we may purchase certain properties for cash with the intention of obtaining a mortgage loan for a portion of the purchase price at a later time. We intend to limit our aggregate long-term permanent borrowings to 75% of the aggregate fair market value of all properties unless any excess borrowing is approved by a majority of the independent directors and is disclosed to our stockholders.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our charter provides that the aggregate amount of borrowing, both secured and unsecured, may not exceed 300% of net assets in the absence of a satisfactory showing that a higher level is appropriate, the approval of our Board of Directors and disclosure to stockholders. Net assets means our total assets, other than intangibles, at cost before deducting depreciation or other non-cash reserves less our total liabilities, calculated at least quarterly on a basis consistently applied. Any excess in borrowing over such 300% of net assets level must be approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to our stockholders in our next quarterly report to stockholders, along with justification for such excess. As of December 31, 2015, our total borrowings represented 66% of net assets.

&#160;

We have financed our property acquisitions through a variety of means, including but not limited to individual non-recourse mortgages and through the exchange of an interest in the property for limited partnership units of the Operating Partnership. Generally, though not exclusively, we intend to seek to finance our investments with debt which will be on a non-recourse basis. However, we may, secure recourse financing or provide a guarantee to lenders, if we believe this may result in more favorable terms. We had $247.3 million in outstanding debt obligations as of December 31, 2015.

&#160;

Distribution Objectives 

&#160;

U.S. federal income tax law requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP) determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. In order to continue to qualify for REIT status, we may be required to make distributions in excess of cash available.

&#160;

Distributions are at the discretion of the Board of Directors. We commenced quarterly distributions beginning February 1, 2006. We have generally paid such distributions through a combination of cash proceeds from sale our common stock, as well as cash from operations and through issuance of common shares from our distribution reinvestment program (&#8220;DRIP&#8221;). We may continue to pay such distributions from borrowings if we have not generated sufficient cash flow from our operations to fund such distributions. Our ability to pay regular distributions and the size of these distributions will depend upon a variety of factors. For example, our borrowing policy permits us to incur short-term indebtedness, having a maturity of two years or less, and we may have to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a REIT. We cannot assure that regular distributions will continue to be made or that we will maintain any particular level of distribution that we have established or may establish.

&#160;

We are an accrual basis taxpayer, and as such our REIT taxable income could be higher than the cash available to us. We may therefore borrow to make distributions, which could reduce the cash available to us, in order to distribute 90% of REIT taxable income as a condition to our election to be taxed as a REIT. These distributions made with borrowed funds may constitute a return of capital to stockholders. &#8220;Return of capital&#8221; refers to distributions to investors in excess of net income. To the extent that distributions to stockholders exceed earnings and profits, such amounts constitute a return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes, although such distributions might not reduce stockholders&#8217; aggregate invested capital. Because our earnings and profits are reduced for deprecation and other non-cash items, it is likely that a portion of each distribution will constitute a tax deferred return of capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

&#160;

Beginning February 1, 2006, our Board of Directors declared quarterly distributions in the amount of $0.0019178 per share per day payable to stockholders of record at the close of business each day during the applicable period. The annualized rate declared was equal to 7%, which represents the annualized rate of return on an investment of $10.00 per share attributable to these daily amounts, if paid for each day for a 365 day period (the &#8220;Annualized Rate&#8221;). Subsequently, our Board of Directors has declared regular quarterly distributions at the Annualized Rate, with the exception of the three-month period ended June 30, 2010. The distributions for the three-month period ended June 30, 2010 were at an aggregate annualized rate of 8% based upon a share price of $10.00. Through December 31, 2015, we have paid aggregate distributions in the amount of $163.2 million, which includes cash distributions paid to stockholders and common stock issued under our DRIP.

&#160;

Total distributions declared during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $18.1 million, $18.1 million and $19.8 million, respectively.

&#160;

On March 22, 2016, our Board of Directors declared the quarterly distribution for the three-month period ended March 31, 2016 in the amount of $0.0019178 per share per day payable to stockholders of record on the close of business on the last day of the quarter, which is payable on April 15, 2016.

&#160; 

DRIP, Share Repurchase Program and Tender Offers 

&#160;

Our DRIP provided our stockholders with an opportunity to purchase additional shares of our common stock at a discount by reinvesting distributions. On January 19, 2015, the Board of Directors suspended the Company&#8217;s DRIP effective April 15, 2015. For so long as the DRIP remains suspended, all future distributions will be in the form of cash.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our share repurchase program may provide our stockholders with limited, interim liquidity by enabling them to sell their shares back to us, subject to restrictions. From our inception through December 31, 2014 we redeemed approximately 2.8 million common shares at an average price per share of $9.29 per share. During 2015, we redeemed approximately 0.3 million common shares or 100% of redemption requests received during the period, at an average price per share of $10.00 per share.

&#160;

On February 14, 2013, our Board of Directors approved an increase to the price for all purchases under our share repurchase program from $9.00 to $10.00 per share. Previously the purchase price was $9.00 per share, except in the case of the death of the stockholder, whereby the purchase price per common share was the lesser of the actual amount paid by the stockholder to acquire the shares or $10.00 per share.

&#160;

Our Board of Directors, at its sole discretion, has the power to terminate the share repurchase program after the end of the offering period, change the price per share under the share repurchase program or reduce the number of shares purchased under the program, if it determines that the funds allocated to the share repurchase program are needed for other purposes, such as the acquisition, maintenance or repair of properties, or for use in making a declared distribution. A determination by our Board of Directors to eliminate or reduce the share repurchase program requires the unanimous affirmative vote of the independent directors.

&#160;

Tender Offer 

&#160;

2013 Offer 

&#160;

We commenced a tender offer on May 1, 2013, pursuant to which we offered to acquire up to 4.7 million shares of our common stock (the &#8220;Shares&#8221;) from the holders (&#8220;Holders&#8221;) of the shares at a purchase price equal to $10.60 per share, in cash, less any applicable withholding taxes and without interest, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in an offer to purchase and in the related letter of transmittal, (which together, as amended, constitute the &#8220;2013 Offer&#8221;). 

&#160;

On August 6, 2013, we completed the 2013 Offer repurchasing from the Holders approximately 4.7 million Shares for approximately $50.0 million. The 2013 Offer expired on July 15, 2013 and all payments for the shares repurchased were subsequently distributed to the Holders. A total of approximately 5.0 million shares of our common stock were properly tendered and not withdrawn, of which we purchased approximately 4.7 million shares , in accordance with the proration provisions of the 2013 Offer, from tendering stockholders at a price of $10.60 per share, or an aggregate amount of approximately $50.0 million.

&#160;

Tax Status 

&#160;

We elected to be taxed as a REIT in conjunction with the filing of our 2005 U.S. federal income tax return. If we remain qualified as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our net taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. To maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. If we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT in any subsequent year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, our income for that year will be taxed at regular corporate rates, and we may be precluded from qualifying for treatment as a REIT for the four-year period following our failure to qualify as a REIT. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no material uncertain income tax positions and our net operating loss carry forward was $12.7 million, for which we have recorded a full valuation allowance. Additionally, even if we qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and property and to U.S. federal income taxes and excise taxes on our undistributed income.

&#160;

To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we engage in certain activities such as providing real estate-related services through wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiaries (&#8220;TRSs&#8221;). As such, we are subject to U.S. federal and state income and franchise taxes from these activities.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The retail, lodging, office, industrial and residential real estate markets are highly competitive. We compete in all of our markets with other owners and operators of retail, lodging, office, industrial and residential real estate. The continued development of new retail, lodging, office, industrial and residential properties has intensified the competition among owners and operators of these types of real estate in many market areas in which we intend to operate. We compete based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property&#8217;s design to prospective tenants&#8217; needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. The number of competing properties in a particular market could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on the operating expenses of certain of our properties.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition, we compete with other entities engaged in real estate investment activities to locate suitable properties to acquire and to locate tenants and purchasers for our properties. These competitors include other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, lenders, governmental bodies and other entities. There are other REITs with asset acquisition objectives similar to ours that may be organized in the future. Some of these competitors, including larger REITs, have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we have and generally may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of tenants. In addition, these same entities seek financing through similar channels to those sought by us. Therefore, we compete for institutional investors in a market where funds for real estate investment may decrease.

&#160;

Competition from these and other third party real estate investors may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us. It may also result in higher prices, lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our borrowing costs, making it more difficult for us to acquire new investments on attractive terms.

&#160;

We believe that our Sponsor&#8217;s experience, coupled with our financing, professionalism, diversity of properties and reputation in the industry enable us to compete with the other real estate investment companies.

&#160;

Because we are organized as an UPREIT, we are well positioned within the industries in which we intend to operate to offer existing property owners the opportunity to contribute their properties to us in tax-deferred transactions using our operating partnership units as transactional currency. As a result, we have a competitive advantage over most of our competitors that are structured as traditional REITs and non-REITs in pursuing acquisitions with tax-sensitive sellers.

&#160;

Environmental 

&#160;

As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest, or on properties that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

We do not have employees. We entered into an advisory agreement with our Advisor on April 22, 2005, pursuant to which our Advisor supervises and manages our day-to-day operations and selects our real estate and real estate related investments, subject to oversight by our Board of Directors. We pay our Advisor fees for services related to the investment and management of our assets, and we reimburse our Advisor for certain expenses incurred on our behalf.

&#160;
