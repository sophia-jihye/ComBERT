 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

We are a medical technology company that uses our proprietary iFit Image-to-Implant technology platform to develop, manufacture and sell joint replacement implants that are individually sized and shaped, which we refer to as customized, to fit each patient's unique anatomy. The worldwide market for joint replacement products is approximately $15 billion annually and growing, and we believe our iFit technology platform is applicable to all major joints in this market. We believe we are the only company offering a broad line of customized knee implants designed to restore the natural shape of a patient's knee. We have sold a total of more than 40,000 knee implants in the United States and Europe. In clinical studies, iTotal CR, our cruciate-retaining total knee replacement implant and best-selling product, demonstrated superior clinical outcomes, including better function and greater patient satisfaction compared to traditional, off-the-shelf implants. In February 2015, we initiated the limited launch of iTotal PS, our posterior-stabilized total knee replacement implant which addresses the largest segment of the knee replacement market, and we initiated the broad commercial launch of the iTotal PS in March 2016. 

Our iFit technology platform comprises three key elements: 

&#8226; 

iFit Design , our proprietary algorithms and computer software that we use to design customized implants and associated single-use, patient-specific instrumentation, which we refer to as iJigs, based on a computed tomography, or CT, scan of the patient and to prepare a surgical plan customized for the patient that we call iView. 

&#9642; 

iFit Printing , a three-dimensional, or 3D, printing technology that we use to manufacture iJigs and are in the process of extending to manufacture certain components of our customized knee replacement implants. 

&#8226; 

iFit Just-in-Time Delivery , our just-in-time manufacturing and delivery capabilities. 

We believe our iFit technology platform enables a scalable business model that greatly lowers our inventory requirements, reduces the amount of working capital required to support our operations and allows us to launch new products and product improvements more rapidly, as compared to manufacturers of traditional implants. 

Manufacturers of traditional knee replacement implants offer products with a limited range of sizes and geometries, which we refer to as off-the-shelf implants. Off-the-shelf implants are not designed to restore a particular patient's unique anatomy. Our summary of one study indicates that approximately one in five patients who receives an off-the-shelf total knee replacement is not satisfied with the results. See "&#8212;Industry background&#8212;Knee implants" for a description of our summary of this study. 

Based on clinical data developed independently by orthopedic surgeons comparing our iTotal CR to off-the-shelf total knee replacement implants, as well as our own research and the common approach we employ in the design and manufacture of our products, we believe that our customized knee replacement implants offer significant benefits to the patient, the surgeon and the hospital that are not afforded by off-the-shelf implants. 

&#8226; 

For the patient. We believe that our individualized approach offers better clinical outcomes when compared to off-the-shelf implants based on the following measures: 

&#9642; 

Better fit . We design our customized knee implants to restore the patient's own native anatomy. As a result, we believe that our implants fit better. 

&#9642; 

Faster recovery . We believe an individual fit requires less bone and soft tissue removal by the surgeon, thereby shortening recovery times. 

&#8226; 

Better function . We design our customized knee implants to follow the particular shape and contour of the patient's knee. As a result, we believe our implants offer an increased potential for a knee that moves more naturally and is more stable. 

&#9642; 

Greater patient satisfaction . We believe our implants offer patients greater overall satisfaction with the results of their knee replacement. 

&#8226; 

For the surgeon. We believe that the combination of the use of our iJigs with our customized knee replacement implants enables a more accurate, reproducible and simplified surgical procedure by reducing the number of required steps and increasing the precision of the placement of the implant. Our summary of a retrospective study of 200 knee replacement surgeries published in 2014 in the peer-reviewed Journal of Arthroplasty , or the 2014 JOA Study, indicates that our iTotal CR implant was 1.8 times more likely to be in 

the desired alignment range after surgery than an off-the-shelf implant. At the time this study was conducted, one of the authors of this study was a paid consultant to us. 

&#8226; 

For the hospital. We believe that our customized knee replacement implants and iFit technology platform provide a better economic outcome for hospitals by: 

&#8226; 

improving patient recovery times, reducing blood loss and reducing adverse event rates at discharge; 

&#9642; 

reducing the costs associated with managing and sterilizing large numbers of reusable instruments; and 

&#9642; 

improving turnaround times with the potential for more procedures to be completed within the same amount of time and for the hospital to generate additional revenue. 

As of February 29, 2016, we own or exclusively in-license a total of approximately 500 issued patents and pending patent applications that cover customized implants and patient-specific instrumentation, or PSI, for all major joints and other elements of our iFit technology platform. Our intellectual property portfolio includes 131 issued United States patents, 64 patents issued in countries outside the United States, and 313 patent applications worldwide. We believe that our patent portfolio provides a significant barrier to entry. On February 29, 2016, we filed a lawsuit against Smith &#38; Nephew, Inc., or Smith &#38; Nephew, in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts Eastern Division. The lawsuit alleges that Smith &#38; Nephew&#8217;s Visionaire&#174; patient-specific instrumentation, as well as the implants systems used in conjunction with the Visionaire instrumentation, infringe eight of our patents and requests monetary damages for willful infringement and a permanent injunction. 

Our knee replacement products have been cleared by the U. S. Food and Drig Administration, or FDA, under the premarket notification process of Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and have received certification to CE Mark. We market our products to orthopedic surgeons, hospitals, hospital networks, ambulatory surgery centers and other medical facilities, and patients. We use direct sales representatives, independent sales representatives and distributors to market and sell our products in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and other markets. 

We introduced our iUni and iDuo partial knee replacement products in 2007 and our iTotal CR in 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , we generated revenue of $63 million &#32;from product sales, representing a 30% &#32;increase over the prior year. 

Industry background 

Market opportunity 

Joint replacement for treatment of osteoarthritis 

Osteoarthritis is the principal condition that leads to joint replacement surgery. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of the cartilage that protects and cushions key joints in the body, including the knees, hips and shoulders. This causes the bones in the affected joint to rub against each other, which can result in significant and chronic joint pain, stiffness, swelling, numbness, loss of flexibility and loss of motor function. The pain of osteoarthritis, even during the early stages of the disease, can be overwhelming for patients and can have significant physical, psychological, quality of life and financial implications. 

An estimated 27 million people in the United States and 630 million people worldwide suffer from osteoarthritis. Compelling demographic trends, such as the growing population of aging yet active individuals and rising rates of obesity, are expected to be key drivers in the continued growth of osteoarthritis occurrence. The National Institutes of Health, or NIH, projects that by 2030, approximately 70 million people in the United States will be 65 years or older and will be at high risk of developing osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is more common in adults over the age of 50, but the condition and precursors of the condition can be observed much earlier. 

For moderate to advanced cases of osteoarthritis, a surgical procedure may be required to replace the damaged joint. During this joint replacement, or arthroplasty, procedure, a surgeon removes the damaged bone in the affected joint and inserts an implant as a replacement. The joint implant may replace all of the principal components of the joint, in which case the procedure is referred to as a total joint replacement, or may replace only a portion of the joint, in which case the procedure is referred to as a partial joint replacement. According to data from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, or AAOS, most patients who undergo primary total knee arthroplasty, or TKA, and primary total hip arthroplasty, or THA, are aged 50 to 80 years old. However, our summary of presentations made at the 2014 annual meeting of the AAOS indicates that increased use of these procedures in 

patients between 45 and 64 years old has fueled recent growth in the TKA and THA markets. Based on these trends, we expect patient demand for total joint replacements will continue to increase. 

Joint replacement market 

According to the Orthopaedic Industry Annual Report published in March 2015 by Orthoworld Inc., or the 2014 Orthoworld Report, worldwide sales of joint replacement products, including replacements for knees, hips, shoulders, elbows, wrists, ankles and digits outside of trauma, exceeded $15.4 billion in 2014 and are expected to grow to approximately $18 billion by the end of 2020. The 2014 Orthoworld Report estimated that worldwide sales of knee replacement products totaled approximately $7.5 billion in 2014. According to the Orthopaedic Industry Annual Report published in May 2014 by Orthoworld Inc., or the 2013 Orthoworld Report, 2013 estimated sales of knee replacement products in the United States represented approximately 56% of total estimated worldwide sales of such products. 

According to the industry report U.S. Market for Large Bone and Joint Orthopedic Devices published in February 2014 by iData Research, or the iData Report, primary total knee replacement implants and partial knee replacement implants accounted for approximately 83% of the 2013 knee replacement market by revenue in the United States. The remaining 17% of the knee replacement market is for follow up procedures known as revision surgeries and patient-specific instruments. According to the iData Report, in 2013, of the primary total knee replacement market in the United States, posterior-stabilized procedures represented approximately 72% by revenue and cruciate-retaining procedures represented approximately 28% by revenue. The decision to perform a posterior-stabilized or cruciate-retaining total knee replacement is usually a matter of a surgeon's preferred surgical technique. 

In 2014, according to the 2014 Orthoworld Report, worldwide sales of hip replacement products totaled approximately $6.3 billion. According to the 2013 Orthoworld Report, 2013 estimated sales of hip replacement products in the United States represented approximately 54% of total estimated worldwide sales of such products. According to the iData Report, primary total hip replacement implants accounted for approximately 69% by revenue of the 2013 hip replacement market in the United States. 

The market for joint replacements extends beyond knee and hip replacements. For example, the treatment of osteoarthritis in the extremities, including the shoulder, elbow, wrist and digit, may involve the replacement of the affected joint. According to the 2014 Orthoworld Report, the worldwide extremities joint replacement market was estimated at $1.6 billion in 2014. 

Knee implants 

Knee replacement implants typically have four principal components: 

&#8226; 

a metal femoral component that is placed over the end of the femur, which is the bone extending from the hip to the knee; 

&#8226; 

a metal tibial component that is placed over the end of the tibia, which is the bone extending from the knee to the ankle; 

&#8226; 

a plastic spacer typically made of polyethylene that is attached to the tibial component and is the surface across which the femoral component glides; and 

&#8226; 

a plastic button typically made of polyethylene to resurface the knee cap, or patella. 

The tibial and femoral components are attached to the patient's bone using acrylic cement. The surfaces where the metal components meet are referred to as articular surfaces. 

Clinical shortcomings of off-the-shelf knee implants 

Knees vary in size and shape; no two knees are the same. In a traditional knee replacement procedure, the surgeon must choose an off-the-shelf implant with a size and shape that the surgeon thinks will work best for the patient. However, off-the-shelf implants are not customized to fit an individual patient's knee, and during a knee replacement procedure, the surgeon has to fit the patient's soft tissue, bones and cartilage to the fixed dimensions of the implant through an iterative process of sizing and positioning. This typically entails removing bone and shaping the residual bone to the implant. Surgeons often have to make compromises on implant fit, rotation and alignment because the surgeons are limited by the size and shape of the implant. These compromises can cause residual pain and functional limitations after surgery, which we believe contribute to patient dissatisfaction. We reviewed a study of 1,703 patients published in 2009 in the peer-reviewed journal Clinical Orthopaedics and 

Related Research &#32;where patient satisfaction was determined by combining patients who answered very dissatisfied, dissatisfied or neutral into one group and patients who answered satisfied or very satisfied into a second group. Our summary of the study indicates that approximately one in five patients who receive an off-the-shelf implant is not satisfied with his or her total knee replacement. 

We believe that the typical compromises surgeons must make with off-the-shelf implants can affect patient outcomes in the following important ways: 

&#8226; 

Improper implant fit . The femoral or tibial component of an off-the-shelf implant frequently protrudes beyond the edge of the bone, which is referred to as overhang. Overhang of three millimeters or greater is associated with an almost two fold increased risk of pain at two years after total knee replacement. Our summary of a study of 437 total knee replacements performed by a single surgeon with off-the-shelf implants published in 2010 in the peer-reviewed Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery &#32;indicates that 68% of women and 40% of men had femoral overhang of three millimeters or more. An off-the-shelf implant also may not fully cover the femur or the tibia, referred to as undersizing. Femoral and tibial undersizing may be associated with increased blood loss during surgery and an increased risk of osteolysis, or resorption and loss of bone, which may lead to costly transfusions and tibial implant loosening and failure. 

The graphic below depicts femoral overhang, femoral undersizing, tibial overhang and tibial undersizing with an off-the-shelf knee implant: 

&#8226; 

Component malrotation . The placement of the femoral or tibial component of an off-the-shelf implant frequently is not aligned, or is malrotated, with the proper rotational axis of the patient's knee. Our summary of a 2010 study published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery British &#32;indicates that 56% of painful total knee replacements were found to have significant rotational errors of the femoral and/or tibial components. In addition, our summary of a study of 28 total knee replacements with off-the-shelf implants published in 2001 in Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research &#32;indicates that patients with improper component rotation were found to be five times more likely to experience knee pain than a control group of patients. 

&#160; 

In order to achieve proper tibial rotation, there are often tradeoffs among proper sizing, coverage and placement with off-the-shelf implants. The graphic below depicts proper rotation and malrotation of the tibial component: 

&#8226; 

Unnatural movement and feeling . The femoral component of an off-the-shelf implant has a fixed geometry that typically does not match the patient's natural curvatures, or "J" curves, of the surfaces of the condyles, which are the rounded lobes at the end of the femur. The femoral component of an off-the-shelf implant also does not match the inside, referred to as medial, or outside, referred to as lateral, joint lines. As a result, the implant may force the patient's knee into an unnatural motion that interferes with the normal functioning of the patient's ligaments. This frequently results in abnormal forward sliding of the femur during knee bend and up-and-down rocking, or lift off, of the condyles. Our summary of a study of 253 patients at least one year after total knee replacement with an off-the-shelf implant published in 2006 in Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research &#32;indicates that dissatisfied patients reported that their knee did not feel normal at more than twice the rate of satisfied patients. In addition, our summary of an abstract presented at the 2014 International Congress for Joint Reconstruction Pan-Pacific Orthopedic Congress, or 2014 ICJR Pan-Pacific Congress, indicates that five of nine patients with off-the-shelf knee replacements implanted by the same surgeon experienced abnormal lift-off of their femoral condyles during a deep knee bend. We provided financial support for this study. At the time this study was conducted, one of the authors of this study also was a paid consultant to us. 

The graphic below depicts abnormal femoral lift-off, one of the potential unnatural movements, in a knee replacement with an off-the-shelf implant. 

Other challenges associated with off-the-shelf implants 

In addition to the residual pain and functional limitations suffered by patients, we believe procedures using off-the-shelf knee implants present several intra-operative and economic challenges for surgeons and hospitals, including: 

&#8226; 

For the surgeon . The surgical procedure is complex. Pre-operatively, the surgeon typically compares a two dimensional outline of the implant with the patient's x-ray images. This process provides only a rough estimate of the fit of the implant to the patient. Intra-operatively, the surgeon must perform repetitive and time-consuming cutting of tissue and fitting of trial implants. We believe that in many cases, the surgical procedure with an off-the-shelf knee implant involves more than 10 major steps and more than 100 sub-steps. 

&#8226; 

For the hospital . We estimate that a total knee replacement procedure using an off-the-shelf implant requires approximately five to 10 costly double-tiered, sterilized instrument trays. Hospitals often store these trays from multiple manufacturers, occupying valuable space. Generally, the implant manufacturer provides these instruments to the hospital free of charge. However, the hospital must pay the cost of cleaning, sterilizing and storing the instruments between each surgical procedure. In addition, if instruments are not properly prepared, they are a potential source of costly infections. Many insurers and third-party payors, including Medicare, require the hospital to bear the costs of infections occurring within 90 days following a surgical procedure. 

Recent efforts to improve traditional knee replacement surgery 

In an effort to overcome some of the shortcomings associated with off-the-shelf implants, manufacturers have focused on improving traditional knee replacement procedures. We believe, however, that these efforts do not fully address the needs of patients, surgeons and hospitals: 

&#8226; 

Patient-specific instrumentation, or PSI . Many manufacturers offer patient-specific instrumentation for use with their off-the-shelf implants. While this approach has the potential to reduce the number of trays and the quantity of instruments hospitals must manage, the patient still receives an off-the-shelf implant with the limitations described above. 

&#8226; 

Robotic assistance . Some manufacturers offer robotic systems for use in planning and executing some types of knee replacement surgeries. These robotic systems are expensive to purchase and maintain. In addition, the patient still receives an off-the-shelf implant with the limitations described above. 

&#8226; 

Increased range of sizes . Some manufacturers offer a greater range of sizes for their off-the-shelf implants, including gender-specific implants. Generally, however, these implants are limited by a fixed shape and size that do not conform to the unique geometry of each patient. As a result, these implants also are subject to the limitations described above. 

The ConforMIS Solution: One Patient, One Implant 

No two joints are the same; accordingly, we believe no two implants should be the same. We believe our customized joint replacement products and proprietary technology create an opportunity to disrupt the large, existing market for off-the-shelf orthopedic implants. Our summary of a survey of 356 orthopedic surgeons conducted by iData Research during the 2014 annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons indicates that approximately 47% of respondents claimed to see a benefit to using custom implants. 

We use our proprietary iFit Image-to-Implant technology platform to design and manufacture customized knee implants that are precisely sized and shaped to fit the unique three-dimensional curvatures of each patient's knee, as well as associated customized, single-use patient-specific instrumentation, which we refer to as iJigs. We believe our proprietary iFit technology platform is applicable to all major joints. 

iFit Image-to-Implant technology platform 

Our iFit technology platform comprises three key elements: 

&#8226; 

iFit Design , our proprietary algorithms and computer software that we use to design customized implants and associated iJigs based on a CT scan of the patient and to prepare a surgical plan customized for the patient that we call iView. 

&#8226; 

iFit Printing , a 3D printing technology that we use to manufacture iJigs and are in the process of extending to manufacture certain components of our customized knee replacement implants. 

&#8226; 

iFit Just-in-Time Delivery , our just-in-time manufacturing and delivery capabilities. We manufacture the customized replacement joint and iJigs to order and do not maintain significant inventory of finished products. We deliver the customized knee replacement implant and iJigs to the hospital in advance of the scheduled arthroplasty procedure. 

We believe our iFit technology platform enables a scalable business model that greatly lowers our inventory requirements, reduces the amount of working capital required to support our operations and allows us to launch new products and product improvements more rapidly, as compared to manufacturers of off-the-shelf implants. 

Our customized implant procedure 

The principal steps involved in the application of our iFit technology platform to the delivery of a customized knee implant to the hospital and surgical plan to the surgeon include: 

&#160; 

CT scan 

The surgeon orders a standard diagnostic CT scan of the patient's knee, along with a few CT images of the hip and ankle. The CT scan is then sent to ConforMIS. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Recreating the knee using three-dimensional modeling 

We use our proprietary algorithms and computer software to map the articular surfaces of the knee joint, define the areas of disease and convert the imaging data into a three-dimensional model of the knee. Our software is designed to correct for deformities caused by osteoarthritis and to digitally recreate the biomechanical axes of the patient's knee, which is important in determining proper rotation and alignment of the implant. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Personalizing the implant 

Our engineers use computer-aided design, or CAD, software to design the customized implant and iJigs that will precisely match the three-dimensional model of the patient's knee. We are able to model the implant contact surfaces and maximize contact area for each patient with the goal of reducing polyethylene wear, a common reason for implant failure. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Development of patient-specific surgical plan 

For each patient, we generate and provide the surgeon with iView, which allows the surgeon to visualize all preoperative planning information, including surgical steps, measurements and orientations. We make iView available to the surgeon electronically in advance of the procedure and include iView in a single package with our customized implant and iJigs. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Just-in-time delivery to hospital 

We deliver the patient's customized knee implant and iJigs to the hospital in advance of the surgery. We are able to deliver our products within six weeks in the United States and seven weeks internationally of the date of our receipt of an order, which includes a CT scan and an implant request form from the surgeon. 

Key benefits of our customized products 

We use our iFit technology platform to develop customized joint replacement systems and single-use surgical instruments. Based on clinical data developed independently by orthopedic surgeons comparing our iTotal CR to off-the-shelf total knee replacement implants, as well as our own research and the common approach we employ in the design and manufacture of all of our products, we believe that our customized knee replacement implants offer significant benefits to the patient, the surgeon and the hospital that are not afforded by off-the-shelf implants. 

&#8226; 

For the patient. We believe that our individualized approach offers better clinical outcomes when compared to off-the-shelf implants based on the following measures: 

&#9642; 

Better fit . Using our proprietary algorithms and computer software, we design our customized knee implants to restore the patient's own native anatomy, avoid femoral and tibial overhang and undersizing and provide proper tibial component rotation. As a result, we believe that our implants fit better, which is important to minimize pain and maintain the integrity of the implant. 

&#9642; 

Faster recovery . We believe an individual fit requires less bone and soft tissue removal by the surgeon, resulting in less bleeding and swelling within the knee and shortened recovery times. Our summary of a study of 132 total knee replacements presented at the 2013 Annual Meeting of the British Association for Surgery of the Knee, or the 2013 BASK Study, indicates that the use of our iTotal CR resulted in a statistically significant reduction in bone resections (p&#60;0.001), thereby preserving more of the patient's bone, and required statistically significantly fewer soft tissue cuts (p=0.046) than an off-the-shelf implant. We determine statistical significance based on a widely used, conventional statistical method that establishes the p-value of observed results. Typically, a p-value of 0.05 or less represents statistical significance, meaning that there is less than a one-in-20 likelihood that the observed results occurred by chance. The investigator who conducted this study was a paid consultant to us and a member of our scientific advisory board at the time this study was conducted. 

&#9642; 

Better function . We design our customized implants to match the patient's natural "J" curves, corrected for deformities caused by osteoarthritis, preserve the patient's medial and lateral joint lines, and minimize up-and-down rocking and lift-off of the patient's condyles during normal knee movement. As a result, we believe that our implants have the potential to offer a more stable, natural feeling knee with normal kinematic pattern and function. Our summary of an abstract presenting ConforMIS-sponsored research at the 2014 ICJR Pan-Pacific Congress indicates that 10 of 11 patients studied with an iTotal CR as compared to only five of nine patients studied with off-the-shelf knee replacements showed a normal motion pattern for the lateral condyle during a deep knee bend. All procedures were performed by the same surgeon. This differential between the two groups was observed despite the apparent success of the implant procedure in all 20 patients based on a commonly used scoring system. We provided financial support for this study. One of the authors of this study also were paid consultants to us, and one of them was a member of our scientific advisory board at the time this study was conducted. 

&#9642; 

Greater patient satisfaction . We believe our customized implants offer patients greater overall satisfaction with the results of their knee replacement. Our summary of a retrospective study of 70 patients who had undergone total knee replacement presented at the 2015 International Congress for Joint Reconstruction World Arthroplasty Congress, or 2015 ICJR World Arthroplasty Congress, indicates that the self-reported patient satisfaction score was statistically significantly higher in patients who had received our iTotal CR (p=0.04) than in a control group of patients who had received an off-the-shelf knee implant. 

&#9642; 

Earlier intervention . We believe that patients who undergo knee replacement with one of our products typically retain more of their bone during the surgical procedure, as compared to patients who undergo knee replacement using an off-the-shelf implant. The more bone that is preserved, the more likely the patient will have sufficient bone available if a revision surgery is necessary. As a result, patients may undergo knee replacement surgery at an earlier age. 

&#8226; 

For the surgeon. We believe that our iFit technology platform offers an improved surgical procedure and greater efficiencies for surgeons when compared to knee replacements with off-the-shelf implants based on the following measures: 

&#9642; 

Improved &#32; surgical procedure . We believe that the combination of the use of our iJigs with our customized knee implants enable a more accurate, reproducible and simplified surgical procedure by reducing the number of steps and increasing the precision of implant alignment. In our procedure, the surgeon makes a predetermined number of cuts that are specifically tailored to each patient and designed to result in a precise fit without the need for repetitive cutting of tissue and fitting of trial implants associated with an off-the-shelf knee replacement. Our summary of the 2014 JOA Study indicates that our iTotal CR implants were 1.8 times more likely to be in the desired alignment range after surgery than an off-the-shelf implant. 

&#9642; 

Bone preservation . We believe our knee implants result in the preservation of more bone for several reasons: 

&#9642; 

We use our iFit technology platform to design each of the bone cuts required to fit our customized implants so as to minimize bone resection and maximize bone preservation for the individual patient. 

&#9642; 

Our femoral component is fitted using six cuts of the femur as compared to the five cuts typically used with off-the-shelf implants. We reviewed an abstract presented at the 2012 Annual Meeting of the British Association for Surgery of the Knee, which studied stress and fatigue in a six-cut femoral implant model that was thinner than a five-cut model by an average of two millimeters. The six-cut implant model displayed substantially lower maximum stress than a five-cut model at a known high-stress location. Two of the authors of this study are our employees, and two of the authors of this study are paid consultants to us. Based in part on this data, we believe our six-cut implants can be thinner than off-the-shelf implants without sacrificing implant strength. We believe a thinner implant requires the surgeon to remove less bone during implantation. 

&#9642; 

Our summary of the 2013 BASK Study indicates that the average total of all bone resection measurements for total knee replacement surgeries done using our iTotal CR was 27% less (p&#60;0.001) than the average total for surgeries done using an off-the-shelf implant. 

As a result, we believe our implants may appeal particularly to surgeons who treat young, active patients. The surgeons might otherwise recommend postponing surgery out of fear that the patient will not be eligible for a revision surgery if one becomes necessary. 

&#9642; 

Fewer post-operative issues . We believe our customized knee implants reduce the number of post-operative issues. Our review of a retrospective study of 248 patients who had undergone a total knee replacement, as presented in an abstract and further updated by a poster presented at the the 2015 ICJR World Arthroplasty Congress, or the 2015 TKA Study, indicates that patients who received an iTotal CR had significantly lower transfusion rates (p=0.005) and adverse event rates at discharge (p=0.003) than patients who received an off-the-shelf total knee replacement implant. We provided financial support for this study. At the time this study was conducted, one of the authors of this study also was a paid consultant to us. 

&#9642; 

Greater efficiency . Because of the simplified surgical procedure used with our products, we believe total operating room time is reduced when implanting an iTotal CR as compared to an off-the-shelf implant. Our summary of the results of a retrospective study of 70 patients who had undergone total knee replacement presented at the 2014 German Congress for Orthopedics and Trauma Surgery indicates that average overall operating room time was statistically significantly reduced (p=0.028) for the group of patients who received an iTotal CR in comparison with patients who received an off-the-shelf knee replacement. We believe surgeons can use these time savings to increase their productivity. 

&#8226; 

For the hospital. We believe that our customized implants and iFit technology platform provide a better economic outcome for hospitals through: 

&#9642; 

Improved implant and instrument management and reduced sterilization costs . As a result of our just-in-time delivery model, we ship our knee implants and iJigs to the hospital or other medical facility in advance of the procedure, greatly reducing the need to store implants and instruments in the hospital. In addition, we estimate that a total knee replacement procedure using an off-the-shelf implant requires approximately five to 10 double-tiered, instrument trays, which must be cleaned, sterilized and stored between procedures at significant cost to the hospital. A knee replacement procedure using our iTotal CR product requires only one tray of reusable instruments. As a result of our just-in-time delivery approach and the reduction in the requirements for reusable instruments in procedures using our products compared to an off-the-shelf implant, we believe our products meaningfully reduce a hospital's instrument cleaning, sterilizing and storage costs. 

&#9642; 

Improved productivity in the OR . We believe that the iJigs we provide with our implants eliminate many of the intraoperative sizing steps and reduce the number of positioning steps necessary with an off-the-shelf product. In addition, our approach of delivering a single-package with pre-sterilized, single-use instruments allows for a more streamlined and efficient operating room through quick and easy set up and tear down. As a result, we believe that knee replacements with our customized total knee implants can improve turnaround times with the potential for more procedures to be completed within the same amount of time and for hospitals to generate additional revenue. 

&#9642; 

Shorter stays . We believe that our customized total knee replacements may shorten hospital stays. Our summary of the results of the 2015 TKA Study indicates that a statistically significantly greater percentage of patients who underwent total knee replacement were discharged in fewer than three days following surgery (p=0.037) in the iTotal CR group (42%) than in the off-the-shelf group (30%). 

&#9642; 

Fewer adverse events . Many insurers and third-party payors, including Medicare, require the hospital to bear the cost of treating infections and post-operative adverse events if they occur within 90 days following the implant procedure. If instruments are not properly prepared prior to surgery, they are a potential source of costly infections. The lower number of instruments used with our knee implants reduces the possibility of a contaminated instrument. Our summary of the results of the 2015 TKA Study indicates that use of our iTotal CR statistically significantly reduced blood transfusion rates (p=0.005) and adverse event rates at discharge (p=0.003) as compared to an off-the-shelf knee implant. Our review of unpublished research sponsored by us also leads us to believe that use of our iTotal CR is associated with lower adverse event rates during the 90-day period following surgery. The reduction in adverse events observed during the 90-day period following surgery is meaningful because hospitals may not be reimbursed for additional post-operative follow up care during this period. 

Our strategy 

Our objective is for our customized implants to become the standard of care for orthopedic joint replacement surgery. We believe that our iFit Image-to-Implant technology platform will enable us to offer a wide variety of customized joint replacement implants with superior performance that offer key clinical and economic benefits over off-the-shelf implants. Key elements of our strategy to achieve our objective are to: 

&#8226; 

Broaden our product portfolio by launching additional customized orthopedic implants. While our initial focus has been on the knee implant market, we believe our iFit technology platform is applicable to customized implants for all major joints in the body and multiple implant subcategories within each joint. In February 2015, we initiated the limited launch of iTotal PS, our posterior-stabilized total knee replacement implant, to address the largest segment of the knee replacement market, and we initiated the broad commercial launch of iTotal PS in March 2016. In addition, we submitted an application for 510(k) clearance of iTotal Hip, our first customized hip replacement implant, with the FDA in 2015. We also may seek to apply our iFit technology platform to develop additional product opportunities in the knee and hip replacement markets and other orthopedic markets in the longer-term, including shoulder, other extremities, spine and ligament reconstruction. 

&#8226; 

Expand our sales efforts to drive adoption of our products. We systematically analyze market opportunities by considering factors such as the number of orthopedic surgeons, procedure volumes, pricing and reimbursement. We often seek to penetrate these markets by establishing relationships with influential surgeons who perform a high-volume of joint replacement procedures. We work with these surgeons to educate other surgeons. Our goal is to achieve a minimum ten percent market share in these markets. 

&#8226; 

Establish the clinical and economic benefits of our products and technologies. We believe our customized knee implant products offer important clinical and economic benefits to patients, surgeons and hospitals. Potential benefits include better function, less bone resection, less blood loss, greater patient satisfaction, reduced length of stay and lower adverse event rates. These potential economic benefits for hospitals also include reduced procedure times and reduced instrument management, cleaning and sterilization costs. We believe that our iFit technology platform will allow us to offer products for other joints that also afford important clinical and economic benefits. We have designed and sponsored studies that support these clinical and economic data. We will continue to establish these potential benefits through the design and sponsoring of studies to increase our available clinical and economic data. 

&#8226; 

Expand our digitally driven, just-in-time manufacturing processes. We have built state of the art manufacturing processes, including proprietary software and 3D printing capabilities. We are continuing to invest in these processes as we believe they provide us important competitive advantages, including: 

&#9642; 

large-scale production of customized implants; 

&#9642; 

shorter product design and development time frames; 

&#9642; 

continuous improvement of our products without making obsolete a large inventory of implants and instruments, in contrast to manufacturers of off-the-shelf implants; and 

&#9642; 

expansion of gross margins through the ongoing vertical integration of our digital manufacturing processes. 

&#8226; 

Enhance our patent portfolio and continue to exploit our patent position. As of February 29, 2016, we own or exclusively in-license a total of approximately 500 issued patents and pending patent applications that cover customized implants and PSI for all major joints and other elements of our iFit technology platform. On February 29, 2016, we filed a lawsuit against Smith &#38; Nephew, Inc. (&#8220;Smith &#38; Nephew&#8221;) in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts Eastern Division. The lawsuit alleges that Smith &#38; Nephew&#8217;s Visionaire&#174; patient-specific instrumentation, as well as the implants systems used in conjunction with the Visionaire instrumentation, infringe eight of our patents, and requests monetary damages for willful infringement and a permanent injunction. 

Our products 

Knee replacement products 

We offer a broad line of primary knee replacement implants, both partial and total, that we customize to fit each particular patient. Surgeons use our family of customized knee implants to treat mild to severe osteoarthritis of the knee. All of our knee replacement products have been cleared by the FDA under the premarket notification process of Section 510(k) of the FDCA and have received certification to CE Mark. We deliver our customized knee replacement implants and iJigs, together with iView, to the hospital in a single pre-sterilized package in advance of the scheduled arthroplasty procedure. 

The following is an overview of each of our knee replacement implant products: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

iTotal CR is the only cruciate-retaining, customized total knee replacement system on the market designed to restore the natural shape of a patient's knee. We introduced the iTotal CR in May 2011 and launched new generations in each of 2012, 2013 and 2015. The iTotal CR includes a femoral implant, a tibial tray, and dual medial and lateral polyethylene inserts, which serve as a cushion between the femoral and tibial components, all of which are individually made for the particular patient, together with a polyethylene patella designed to work with our customized components. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The iTotal PS is the only posterior cruciate ligament substituting, or posterior-stabilized, customized total knee replacement product on the market designed to restore the natural shape of a patient's knee. We initiated a limited launch of the iTotal PS in the United States in February 2015, and we initiated the broad commercial launch of iTotal PS in March &#160; 2016. The iTotal PS includes a femoral implant with a metal cam, a tibial tray, and a single polyethylene insert, which includes a plastic spine, all of which are individually made for the particular patient, together with a polyethylene patella designed to work with our customized components. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The iDuo is the only customized bicompartmental knee replacement system on the market. The iDuo is considered a bicruciate-retaining knee replacement because the surgeon may retain both the anterior cruciate ligaments, or ACL, and posterior cruciate ligaments, or PCL. We first launched the iDuo in December 2007 and have launched new generations of the product in each of 2010 and 2012. The iDuo includes a femoral implant, a tibial tray and a single polyethylene insert, all of which are individually made for the particular patient, together with a polyethylene patella designed to work with our customized components.

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The iUni is the only customized unicompartmental knee replacement product on the market for treatment of the medial or lateral compartment of the knee. The iUni is considered a bicruciate-retaining knee replacement because the surgeon retains both the ACL and PCL. We first launched the iUni in June 2007 and launched new generations of the product in each of 2009 and 2012. The iUni includes a femoral implant, a tibial tray and a single polyethylene insert, all of which are individually made for the particular patient. 

&#160; 

Hip replacement product candidate 

iTotal Hip 

We are currently developing our iTotal Hip to provide a customized total hip replacement implant. We submitted an application for 510(k) clearance of iTotal Hip with the FDA in 2015. We cannot predict if or when we will receive clearance or initiate the commercial launch of iTotal Hip. We expect that iTotal Hip will be our next product introduction after iTotal PS. We believe the introduction of iTotal Hip will provide synergies with our existing line of customized knee implants because most surgeons who perform knee replacements also perform hip replacements. Thus, we expect that iTotal Hip will complement our existing product line, customer base, sales force and distribution channels. 

Problems with off-the-shelf hip implants. As with the knee, no two hips are the same. They vary in size and shape. As is the case for knee replacements, off-the shelf hip replacement implants are offered in a limited number of standard shapes and sizes. The key clinical challenges and complications with off-the-shelf total hip replacements are: 

&#8226; 

Implant dislocation . Hip implant dislocation occurs when the head of the femoral component dislodges from the hip socket component, which is referred to as the acetabular component, or hip cup. This can result from one or more of the following: 

&#9642; 

an inappropriate angle between the stem and the neck of the femoral component, referred to as neck angle; 

&#9642; 

improper neck length; 

&#9642; 

an inappropriate forward angle, referred to as anteversion, of the neck; and 

&#9642; 

improper placement of the hip cup, which can include an incorrect forward angle. 

&#8226; 

Leg length discrepancy . Leg length discrepancy occurs when one leg of the patient is longer than the other post-surgery. This can result from a neck angle or femoral component length that is substantially different from the patient's native anatomy or from incorrect placement of the femoral component. Leg length discrepancy can lead to pain and muscle fatigue and is a frequent cause of patient complaints. 

Manufacturers of off-the-shelf hip implants attempted to address these shortcomings by developing modular hip systems consisting of a large number of neck components with different neck angles, lengths and anteversion paired with off-the-shelf stems and femoral head components. The surgeon would select a modular neck during surgery that best fit the patient's anatomy. Following their introduction, these modular hips initially were widely used. However, there was a high failure rate because the implants had a tendency to break at the modular connection between the stem and the neck and corrode because of the additional metal-to-metal connection between the neck and the stem. As a result, usage of modular hips has declined dramatically. 

Off-the-shelf hip implants require a large number of trays of reusable instruments with the same instrument management challenges and costs of cleaning and sterilization associated with off-the-shelf knee implants. In addition, orthopedic surgery using off-the-shelf hip implants is characterized by a difficult surgical technique and can suffer from a lack of reproducibility in component placement. 

The ConforMIS hip replacement solution. We are developing our iTotal Hip using our iFit technology platform. Our iTotal Hip will be customized to the individual patient and designed to address the limitations of off-the-shelf hip implants. We are designing our iTotal Hip to consist of the following components: 

&#8226; 

a femoral component made of a single metal piece, or monoblock, that incorporates both stem and neck, which includes a customized neck angle and length designed to match the patient's native anatomy, along with a standard head; 

&#8226; 

a hip cup along with a polyethylene acetabular liner; and 

&#8226; 

a set of single-use, patient-specific acetabular and femoral iJigs for placement of the acetabular and femoral components with the proper anteversion to both the femur and the hip cup. 

We believe that our customized iTotal Hip monoblock femoral component has the same strength as the femoral component of a standard monoblock, or non-modular, off-the-shelf hip implant while at the same time addressing the variability of patients' femoral neck shapes. We believe that the customized nature of our implant will appeal to many surgeons who used modular hips in the past. In addition, we believe the combination of our 

customized implant paired with patient-specific iJigs and patient-specific placement of the acetabular cup and the femoral component will help address the problems of hip dislocation and leg length discrepancy associated with off-the-shelf implants. 

Because our iTotal Hip is based on our iFit technology platform, we are designing it to take advantage of our proprietary design software, 3D printing technology and a just-in-time single package delivery system, just as we do with our customized knee implants. 

Our proprietary iJigs 

Our iJigs are customized, single-use, patient-specific instrumentation. The iJigs we deliver with our joint replacement products include the guides and instruments the surgeon requires to remove the bone and soft tissue necessary to fit our customized implant to the patient. We believe that providing our iJigs with our customized knee implants enable a more accurate, reproducible and simplified surgical procedure by reducing the number of steps and increasing the precision of the alignment. 

In an off-the-shelf procedure, the surgeon must have large numbers of reusable instruments available because the surgeon does not know in advance which bone cuts and other tissue removal will be necessary to prepare the patient to receive the off-the-shelf implant. As a result, a knee replacement procedure performed using our customized implants and iJigs requires only one tray of reusable instruments, which we provide to the hospital, as compared to a knee replacement procedure using an off-the-shelf implant, which requires approximately five to 10 double-tiered, reusable instrument trays, which the off-the-shelf manufacturer provides to the hospital. We provide our implants with a full set of iJigs in a single package. Our iJigs arrive sterile and are discarded after use. 

The graphic below depicts our single package delivery systems for our iJigs and knee replacement products: 

Clinical studies 

In evaluating the clinical and economic benefits of our customized knee implants, we consider results obtained from studies sponsored by us, conducted by orthopedic surgeons who are paid consultants to us and conducted independently by orthopedic surgeons, including studies that compare our customized knee implants with off-the-shelf knee implants. As of February 29, 2016 , there were 8 peer-reviewed journal articles and 26 abstracts either presented or accepted for presentation at conferences reporting on the results of clinical studies of our customized knee implants. Of the published or presented studies known to us that compared our knee replacement product to an off-the-shelf product, most reported either that the performance of our knee replacement product was superior to an off-the-shelf product on the reported measures or that there were no statistically significant differences detected between the performance of our knee replacement product and an off-the-shelf knee replacement product on those measures. 

The following provides our summary of the findings of several of these studies that relate to our iTotal CR product and that we considered in forming our views as to the clinical and economic benefits of our customized knee implants. 

Lower adverse event rates and faster hospital discharge. We reviewed a retrospective study of 248 patients who had undergone a total knee replacement, 126 of whom received an iTotal CR and 122 of whom received a posterior cruciate-retaining off-the-shelf knee replacement as submitted in an abstract along with an updated poster presented at the 2015 ICJR World Arthroplasty Congress. Our summary of the principal findings of the study is as follows: 

&#8226; 

patients in the iTotal CR group showed statistically significantly lower blood transfusion rates (p=0.005) and adverse event rates at discharge (p=0.003) as compared to patients in the off-the-shelf implant group; 

&#8226; 

risk-adjusted odds ratios indicated that patients in the off-the-shelf implant group were 4.6 times more likely to experience a blood transfusion and 4.4 times more likely to have an adverse event at discharge than patients in the iTotal CR group; 

&#8226; 

a statistically significantly greater percentage (p=0.037) of patients in the iTotal CR group (42%) were discharged in fewer than three days following surgery than patients in the off-the-shelf group (30%); 

&#8226; 

when discharge disposition was analyzed, a statistically significantly lower percentage (p&#60;0.01) of patients in the iTotal CR group were discharged to acute care facilities as compared to patients in the off-the-shelf implant group; and 

&#8226; 

there was a greater than $800 total cost of care savings per patient in the iTotal CR group compared to patients in the off-the-shelf implant group after including the estimated average cost of the pre-operative CT scan for patients in the iTotal CR group, primarily due to the assumed savings resulting from the more favorable discharge disposition of patients in the iTotal CR group compared to patients in the off-the-shelf implant group. 

We provided financial support for this study. At the time this study was conducted, one of the authors of this study was a paid consultant to us. 

Improved clinical outcomes and greater patient satisfaction. We reviewed a presentation from the 2015 ICJR World Arthroplasty Congress that described an investigator-initiated, matched-pair, retrospective study of 35 patients who had undergone total knee replacement with an iTotal CR and 35 patients who had undergone total knee replacement with an off-the-shelf knee implant. Two surgeons performed these TKAs. For each matched pair, the same surgeon performed the iTotal CR and off-the-shelf procedure. Our summary of the principal findings of the study is as follows: 

&#8226; 

patients in the iTotal CR group had statistically significantly faster recovery times (p&#60;0.001) than patients in the off-the-shelf implant group as measured by the average time to complete specified functional activities, such as walking and climbing stairs; 

&#8226; 

patients in the iTotal CR group suffered statistically significantly less blood loss than patients in the off-the-shelf implant group, as measured by the differences in average drop in blood hemoglobin at one day (p&#60;0.001), five days (p=0.002) and ten days (p=0.03) post-procedure; 

&#8226; 

the average self-reported satisfaction score of patients in the iTotal CR group was 94.3%, compared to 74.2% for the group of patients in the off-the-shelf group, and this difference was statistically significant (p=0.04); and 

&#8226; 

the average KOOS, or Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, of patients in the iTotal CR group was 83.0%, compared to 73.7% for the group of patients in the off-the-shelf group, and this difference was statistically significant (p=0.037). KOOS is a validated, self-administered testing instrument used to assess patient outcomes. 

This study was conducted by independent orthopedic surgeons. 

We also reviewed a presentation from the 2015 International Congress for Joint Reconstruction, or 2015 ICJR Pan-Pacific Congress. For this study, researchers at seven U.S. centers performed an interim analysis using a variety of tests of 295 patients, 166 of whom received an iTotal CR knee replacement and 129 of whom received an off-the-shelf implant. Using a validated functional test known as the Aggregated Locomotor Function test, or ALF Test, patients with ConforMIS iTotal CR knee replacements showed a statistically significantly better ALF score than a comparable group of patients who had undergone surgery with off-the-shelf implants (p=0.04). The ALF Test consists of blinded operators assessing patients' ability to perform various activities of daily living, including walking, standing from a chair and climbing stairs. Additionally, patients in this study completed the 2011 New Knee Society Scoring System, or KSS, questionnaire. KSS is a commonly used surgeon-assessed weighted score, the objective component of which measures factors such as range of motion, alignment, and stability, which are important for regaining functional abilities. Utilizing an odds ratio analytic, the objective KSS score showed that patients with 

iTotal CR knee replacements were 1.7 times more likely to obtain an excellent or good objective KSS score compared to off-the-shelf patients and that off-the-shelf patients were 2.6 times more likely to achieve a poor objective KSS score than iTotal patients. 

Favorable adverse event rate and outcomes. We reviewed an abstract presented at the 2015 ICJR Pan-Pacific Congress that described a multi-center, prospective study of adverse event rates and outcome scores of 252 patients who had undergone total knee replacement with an iTotal CR. Our summary of the principal findings of the study is as follows: 

&#8226; 

the adverse event rate, which included manipulations under anesthesia, or MUA, a procedure used post-operatively to adjust a knee replacement implant to improve its function, transfusions and revisions rates, compared favorably to the adverse event rates reported in separate multi-center studies published on off-the-shelf implants; 

&#8226; 

the cumulative rate of MUA was 3.57%, which compared favorably to the 4.6% rate of MUA reported in a separate study of off-the-shelf implants; 

&#8226; 

range of motion was slightly reduced from baseline at six weeks post-operatively, but significantly improved from baseline at six months (p&#60;0.001) and one year (p=0.001) post-operatively; 

&#8226; 

patients demonstrated statistically significant improvements from baseline scores (p&#60;0.05) on the KOOS and on the objective, function and satisfaction portions of KSS (p&#60;0.05), by the six-week time-point, with continued improvement reported at the one-year follow up visit. 

We provided financial support for this study. All of the authors of this study are paid consultants to us or have been paid by us for specified services. 

More accurate alignment. We reviewed a paper published in 2014 in the Journal of Arthroplasty &#32;that described an investigator-initiated, retrospective study of 200 patients who had undergone total knee replacements, 100 of whom received an iTotal CR implant and 100 of whom received an off-the-shelf implant. The same surgeon performed all 200 implant procedures, and all of the iTotal CR and off-the-shelf implants had been performed consecutively. Our summary of the principal findings of the study is as follows: 

&#8226; 

our iJigs provided a statistically significant improvement in mechanical axis alignment (p&#60;0.002) and positioning of the front of the femoral component (p=0.032) compared to the process used in an off-the-shelf total knee replacement; 

&#8226; 

patients in the iTotal CR group were 1.8 times more likely to have proper mechanical alignment as compared to patients in the off-the-shelf group; and 

&#8226; 

there was no difference seen on the measure of rotation of the tibial component. 

This study was conducted by five independent authors and one surgeon who was a paid consultant to us at the time this study was conducted. 

A more stable knee implant without abnormal lift off. We reviewed the presentation of an abstract from the 2015 ICJR Pan-Pacific Congress that described a study of 38 patients who had undergone total knee replacement, 24 of whom received an iTotal CR implant and fourteen of whom received an off-the-shelf knee implant. The same surgeon performed all 38 implant procedures. All patients had been assessed following the procedure using the Knee Society Knee Score. Our summary of the principal findings of the study follows. All of the patients had objective Knee Society Knee Score scores greater than 90 out of a maximum score of 100, which is an indication of a clinically successful knee replacement. Patients who had received an iTotal CR showed a post-operative kinematic pattern more typical to that of a normal knee when asked to perform a deep knee bend and chair-rise. Patients with off-the-shelf implants experienced greater variability in their kinematic patterns, differing from the typical kinematic patterns of the normal knee. Thirty-five percent of patients with an off-the-shelf implant experienced abnormal lift off in early to mid-flexion (less than 60&#8304;), during deep knee bending, while patients with an iTotal CR showed no lift off (p&#60;0.008) in this flexion range. We provided financial support for this study. At the time the study was conducted, one of the authors of this study was a paid consultant to us. 

&#160; 

Improved function with a more normal kinematic pattern. &#160; We reviewed the presentation of an abstract from the 2015 ICJR Pan-Pacific Congress that described a study of 63 patients who had undergone a total knee replacement, 15 of whom received an iTotal CR implant and 24 of whom received an off-the-shelf knee implant from one manufacturer, and 25 of whom received an off-the-shelf knee implant from a second manufacturer. The same surgeon performed all 63 implant procedures. Our summary of the principal findings of the study follows. Patients who received an iTotal CR achieved more normal-like kinematic patterns. During both a deep knee bend and a chair-rise, patients with an iTotal CR achieved more normal motion of their lateral condyle. Twenty-four percent of the patients implanted with the off-the-shelf knee from one manufacturer and 48% of patients implanted with the off-the-shelf knee from the other manufacturer experienced an anterior slide of their lateral condyle during deep knee bend, which is the opposite of normal knee kinematics, while only 7% of iTotal patients exhibited such anterior slide. All iTotal patients were able to achieve a minimum of 90 degrees of weight-bearing flexion, as compared to 75% and 76% respectively for the two off-the-shelf implant brands. Due to the sample size, the results from this study were not statistically significant. We provided financial support for this study. At the time this study was conducted, one of the authors of this study was a paid consultant to us. 

Sales and marketing 

We market and sell our products in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, Austria, Ireland, Switzerland,Singapore and Hong Kong. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Consolidated results of operations&#8212;Revenue" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of product revenue by geography. We market our products to orthopedic surgeons, hospitals and other medical facilities, including ambulatory surgery centers, and patients. We use direct sales representatives, independent sales representatives and distributors to market and sell our products in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and other markets. We expect to expand the size of our sales and marketing capabilities by entering into additional distribution or direct sales arrangements in key territories. 

We offer technical and product focused training programs for our direct sales, independent sales and distributor representatives. We have designed these programs to provide the entire sales force with technical expertise and product knowledge so they may more effectively represent and market our products to surgeons, hospitals and other medical facilities. We believe we offer a simplified surgical technique with the use of our products that may reduce the need for our representatives to spend time in the operating room during a procedure when compared to the representatives of off-the-shelf implant manufacturers. This potentially will allow our sales representatives to spend more time on new customer growth opportunities. 

We believe surgeons appreciate the clinical and economic benefits, including increased patient satisfaction, operating room efficiencies and lower adverse event rates, that we believe our products offer. We believe hospitals focus on the economic benefits that we believe are associated with our products, such as fewer instrument trays to manage, clean and sterilize, reduced operating room time, faster operating room set up and breakdown time and lower adverse event rates. We believe patients are interested in returning to daily activities quickly and are attracted to our customized approach. We employ direct-to-consumer marketing, primarily through patient testimonials, social media, search engine marketing, and print, online, radio and television news reports. 

In the United States, we use a database of surgeons, hospitals and procedure volumes to determine which geographical regions are most commercially attractive. Globally, we look for markets with a high volume of total knee replacements, favorable reimbursement characteristics and an historical openness to advanced technologies. 

We work with orthopedic surgeons, including select key opinion leaders, affiliated with leading medical centers in the United States and Germany. We refer to the medical centers at which these surgeons practice as ConforMIS Centers of Excellence, or COE. We work with the COE surgeons on technical training and surgeon education. We plan to selectively add COEs on an ongoing basis. 

As part of our targeted regional commercial strategy, we identify metropolitan statistical areas, or MSAs, in the United States, in which--based on knee replacement procedure volume, surgeon density, prevailing average selling price for a knee replacement, and other factors--we believe we can become a top-three orthopedic implant supplier, as measured by knee replacement procedure volume. We work to significantly increase our sales in these markets by focusing on high-volume, influential surgeons who use our products. We create a tailored direct marketing strategy to increase consumer awareness in these markets. We believe we have achieved a greater than 10% share by volume of procedures in a number of these markets. &#32; At the end of 2014, we had achieved at least 10% market share of all primary knee replacements performed in 14 MSAs in the United States. We had increased the number of MSAs in which we have at least 10% market share of all primary knee replacements to 22 by the end of 2015. 

Further, we intend to market our products to hospitals participating in the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Model, or CJR, implemented by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The CJR program is intended to push hospitals to manage post-acute care costs by establishing a target episode of care prices for each hospital participant which includes payment for all related services received by Medicare beneficiaries through 90 days post-operatively. Hospitals would continue to be paid as they are now, however, on a yearly basis Medicare will reconcile actual prices against the target prices under CJR and participating hospitals will either keep savings or owe Medicare for price overages. Since publication of the proposed rule in July 2015, we have signed new contracts that allow us access to more than 50 additional hospitals that will participate in the CJR program. We plan to add more hospitals that are involved with the CJR program and we are adding participation in the Medicare CJR as a criterion for our targeted regional marketing strategy. 

Research and development &#32; 

Our internal research and development efforts are focused on continued innovation to develop customized implants for the knee and hip and to assess the application of our iFit technology platform to other major joints in the body. 

In our research and development activities, we actively work on: 

&#8226; new product development; 

&#8226; enhancements of existing products and software; 

&#8226; 

improvements in our iFit technology platform to further advance production efficiency and decrease the production time from receipt of an order to delivery of our product; and 

&#8226; 

advancements of our iFit technology platform that will enable us to provide our customized products to a larger customer base, which we refer to as mass customization. 

Our team of 39 full-time research and development employees has extensive experience in biomechanical engineering, manufacturing engineering and software engineering and development. A significant portion of our research and development activities involves the development of proprietary algorithms and computer software that underpins our entire iFit technology platform. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, company-sponsored research and development expenses were $17 million , $15 million &#32;and $14 million , respectively. 

When we develop a new product or seek to improve our existing products, our team of biomechanical and software engineers typically collaborates closely with experienced orthopedic surgeons and other independent scientists. After we complete the development of a new product or an improvement to an existing product, we seek regulatory clearance before introducing the product into patients. 

Manufacturing 

We conduct our manufacturing activities in state-of-the-art design and manufacturing facilities in Bedford and Wilmington, Massachusetts. We completed the transfer of operations that were previously conducted in a facility in Burlington, Massachusetts, to our Wilmington facility in August 2015. 

We produce all of our CAD designs in-house and use them to direct all of our product manufacturing efforts. We manufacture all of our patient-specific instruments, or iJigs, in our facilities. We also make the majority of the tibial components used in our implants at our facilities. We outsource the production of the remainder of the tibial components and the manufacture of femoral and other implant components to third-party suppliers. The femoral components of our implants are cast in metal and finished. Our suppliers make our customized implant components using the CAD designs we supply. 

We have established a diverse, approved supplier base that is skilled in medical device manufacturing. Our suppliers are primarily based in the United States. We do not have any long-term supply arrangements and purchase our supplies on a purchase order basis. We maintain a dual source capability for our purchased implant components in an effort to ensure supply reliability, flexibility and cost competitiveness. For certain raw materials, including the powders used for our 3D printing, we rely on sole source providers who service large portions of the markets for these materials. 

In the future, if and as the volume of our product sales increases, we expect to take the following steps in connection with our manufacturing activities: 

&#8226; 

increase the production of certain components of our products that we manufacture in-house, which we believe we can manufacture at a lower unit cost than vendors we currently use; 

&#8226; 

applying our 3D printing technology to select metal components of our products, which we believe can lower our unit costs compared to our current manufacturing methods; 

&#8226; 

develop new versions of our software used in the design of our customized joint replacement implants, which we believe will reduce costs associated with the design process; and 

&#8226; 

obtain more favorable pricing of certain components of our products manufactured for us by third parties. 

We also plan to explore other opportunities to reduce our manufacturing costs. 

iFit 3D printing 

We believe that 3D printing is especially suited for production of our individually designed implants and instruments. We focus on 3D printing as a key element of our manufacturing because we believe it enables fast, cost-effective, and scalable processes that will deliver high quality implants and instruments customized to fit the unique anatomy of each patient. As a result, 3D printing plays a key and increasing role in our manufacturing operations. 

We currently apply our iFit 3D printing technology to manufacture iJigs using computer-controlled lasers that melt polymer powders into a solid on a layer-by-layer basis until the entire part is completed. The process of melting powders into a solid is called sintering. We use selective laser sintering, or SLS, with approved polymer powders to manufacture plastic components for our iJigs. 

We have received FDA clearance to apply our iFit 3D printing technology to manufacture the metal femoral implant component for our iTotal CR using direct metal laser sintering, or DMLS, using raw material that meets or exceeds the ASTM F-75 specification for chemical content and mechanical properties. ASTM F-75 is the accepted material standard for knee replacement femoral components. We are currently in the process of integrating DMLS into our manufacturing process, and plan to employ the technology selectively in a manner that complements our existing processes and reduces manufacturing costs. 

Quality assurance 

We apply a variety of automated and manual quality controls to our iJigs, implant components and other instruments we supply to ensure that our products conform to their specifications. Members of our quality department also inspect our devices at various steps during the manufacturing cycle to facilitate compliance with specifications. Our quality department periodically audits our suppliers to ensure conformity with our specifications and with our policies and procedures for our devices. On August 31, 2015, we announced a voluntary recall of specific serial numbers of patient-specific instrumentation for our iUni, iDuo, iTotal CR and iTotal PS knee replacement product systems. The recalled products were manufactured and distributed from our Wilmington manufacturing facility between July 18, 2015 and August 28, 2015. We isolated the root cause to a step in our ethylene oxide sterilization process conducted by a vendor. We have since completed final testing and implemented corrective actions, and we resumed normal production in October 2015. 

We and our suppliers are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under its Quality System Regulations, or QSR. The QSR provide that manufacturers must establish and follow quality systems consistent with the QSR framework to ensure that their products consistently meet applicable requirements and specifications. In accordance with the QSR framework, we have validated or verified the processes used in the manufacturing and testing of our devices. Our Bedford and Wilmington manufacturing facilities are FDA registered, and we believe they are compliant with the FDA's QSR. We have also received certification from the British Standards Institution, or BSI, a Notified Body to the International Standards Organization of our quality system. Certification by a Notified Body is a necessary element of obtaining CE Marking in the EU. We are subject to periodic, announced and unannounced inspections by BSI, the FDA, and other governmental agencies. We continue to monitor our quality system and management efforts in order to maintain our overall level of compliance. See "&#8212;Regulatory requirements" below. 

Intellectual property 

Protection of our intellectual property is an important priority for our company. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary rights for our products and technology, to operate without infringing the 

proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our intellectual property position by, among other things, filing U.S. and certain foreign patent applications related to our products and technology where patent protection is available. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 

We typically seek patents on inventions relating to customized implants and iJigs, and on their methods of manufacture. We generally file patent applications in the United States, the major markets in the EU, and in select other commercially important countries. We typically rely on trade secret protection for our proprietary algorithms that we use to design customized implants and iJigs. 

Patent rights 

As of February 29, 2016 &#32;we owned or exclusively in-licensed 195 issued patents around the world, including 131 patents issued in the United States and 64 foreign patents. 

&#8226; 

With respect to the patents that we own relating primarily to our customized joint replacement implants, the first nonprovisional application was filed in 2002 claiming priority to a provisional application filed in 2001 and is expected to expire in 2022 and the other patents are expected to expire between 2022 and 2030. 

&#8226; 

With respect to the patents that we own relating primarily to our patient-specific instrumentation, the first nonprovisional application was filed in 2002 claiming priority to a provisional application filed in 2001 and is expected to expire in 2022 and the other patents are expected to expire between 2022 and 2031. 

&#8226; 

With respect to the patents that we own relating primarily to our iFit technology platform, the first nonprovisional application was filed in 2002 claiming priority to a provisional application filed in 2001 and is expected to expire in 2022 and the other patents are expected to expire between 2022 and 2032. 

&#8226; 

With respect to the patents that we exclusively in-license, the first nonprovisional application was filed in 2000 claiming priority to a provisional application filed in 1998 and is expected to expire in 2019 and the other patents are expected to expire between 2019 and 2021. 

As of February 29, 2016 , we owned or exclusively in-licensed 313 patent applications, including 109 patent applications pending in the United States and 204 foreign patent applications. 

&#8226; 

With respect to the patent applications that we own relating primarily to our customized joint replacement implants, patient-specific instrumentation, and our iFit technology, the first were filed in 2001 and if patents issue on these applications, they would be expected to expire in 2022 and if patents issued on the other patent applications, such patents would be expected to expire between 2023 and 2035. 

&#8226; 

With respect to the patent applications that we exclusively in-license, the first was filed in 1998 and if a patent issues on this application, it would be expected to expire in 2019. If patents issue on the other patent applications, such patents would be expected to expire between 2019 and 2026. 

Our patent portfolio covers a range of subject matter, including: 

&#8226; 

customized articular implants for the knee, hip, spine, shoulder, ankle and extremities; 

&#8226; 

customized instrumentation including for joint replacement and ligament reconstruction; 

&#8226; 

imaging technology; 

&#8226; 

3D printing technology for implants and instruments; 

&#8226; 

methods of designing customized implants and instruments; and 

&#8226; 

methods of manufacturing customized implants and instruments. 

Licenses from others 

We are a party to several agreements under which we have licensed rights in certain patents, patent applications and other intellectual property. We enter into these agreements to augment our proprietary intellectual property portfolio. The licensed intellectual property covers some of the products that we are researching, developing and commercializing and some of the technologies that we use. These licenses impose certain license fee, royalty payment and diligence obligations on us. We expect to continue to enter into these types of license agreements in the future. We do not believe that any of these licenses are material to our business. 

Patent litigation 

The medical device industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. Patent litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain. Any claim relating to infringement of patents that is successfully asserted against us may require us to pay substantial damages. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. 

Our business success will depend in part on our not infringing the intellectual property rights of others, including patents issued to our competitors and potential competitors. If our products are found to infringe the patents of others, our development, manufacture and sale of such potential products could be severely restricted or prohibited. In addition, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies. Because of the importance of our patent portfolio to our business, we may lose market share to our competitors if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights. 

On October 21, 2015, a complaint for patent infringement was filed against us in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware by Orthopedic Innovations, Inc., which the complaint states is a subsidiary of Wi-LAN Technologies Inc. The complaint alleges that our iUni G2 and iDuo G2 partial knee replacement surgical techniques infringe one or more claims of United States Patent No. 6,575,980. The plaintiff seeks damages, including for willful infringement, attorney&#8217;s fees, costs and a permanent injunction. We believe that none of our products or services infringes the plaintiff&#8217;s patent. The plaintiff served the complaint on February 17, 2016. We intend to deny liability and to defend ourselves vigorously. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful. An adverse resolution of the lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are presently unable to predict the outcome of the lawsuit or to reasonably estimate a range of potential losses, if any, related to the lawsuit . 

On February 29, 2016, we filed a lawsuit against Smith &#38; Nephew, Inc. (&#8220;Smith &#38; Nephew&#8221;) in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts Eastern Division. The lawsuit alleges that Smith &#38; Nephew&#8217;s Visionaire&#174; patient-specific instrumentation, as well as the implants systems used in conjunction with the Visionaire instrumentation, infringe eight of our patents, and requests monetary damages for willful infringement and a permanent injunction. We are presently unable to predict the outcome of the lawsuit and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this litigation. We may also be subject to counterclaims including, but not limited to allegations that the asserted patents are not infringed, are invalid, and or are unenforceable. 

Licenses to others 

In September 2013, we filed suit in the U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts against Wright Medical Technology, Inc., or Wright Technology, a wholly owned subsidiary of Wright Medical Group, Inc., or Wright Group. We refer to Wright Technology and Wright Group collectively as Wright Medical. The lawsuit alleged that Wright Technology's PROPHECY&#174; knee and ankle systems infringe four of our patents. In January 2014, Wright Group transferred its orthopedic reconstruction division to Micro-Port Orthopedics, Inc., or MicroPort, a wholly owned subsidiary of MicroPort Scientific Corporation. In February 2014, we filed an amended complaint, naming MicroPort as an additional defendant, and alleging infringement by both defendants of an additional patent. We settled this lawsuit against Wright Medical and MicroPort in April 2015. As part of the settlement, we granted to MicroPort and Wright Medical the licenses described below. We believe that MicroPort and Wright Medical also entered into a separate indemnification agreement related to the licensed products transferred to MicroPort in January 2014. 

License agreement with MicroPort 

In April 2015, we entered into a worldwide license agreement with MicroPort. Under the terms of this license agreement, we granted a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive license to MicroPort to use patient specific instrument technology covered by our patents and patent applications with off-the-shelf implants in the knee. This license does not extend to patient-specific implants. This license agreement provides for the payment to us of a fixed royalty at a high single to low double digit percentage of net sales on patient specific instruments and associated implant components in the knee, including MicroPort's Prophecy patient specific instruments used with its Advance and Evolution implant components. This license agreement also provided for a single lump-sum payment by MicroPort to us of low-single digit millions of dollars upon entering into the license agreement, which has been paid. This license agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last to expire of our patents and patent applications licensed to MicroPort, which currently is expected to occur in 2029. 

License agreement with Wright Medical 

In April 2015, we entered into a non-exclusive, fully paid up, worldwide license agreement with Wright Medical. Under the terms of this license agreement, we granted a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive license to Wright Medical to use patient-specific instrument technology covered by our patents and patent applications with off-the-shelf implants in the foot and ankle. This license does not extend to patient-specific implants. This license agreement provided for a single lump-sum payment by Wright Medical to us of mid-single digit millions of dollars upon entering into the license agreement, which has been paid. This license agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last to expire of the patents and patent applications licensed to Wright Medical, which currently is expected to occur in &#32; 2031. 

Trademarks 

As of February 29, 2016 , we have filed 130 trademark registrations in the United States and in other major markets worldwide, including the following marks: ConforMIS, iFit, iTotal, iDuo, and iUni. We have &#32; 43 &#32; trademark applications pending in the United States and in other major markets worldwide. 

Competition 

The joint replacement industry is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and sensitive to the introduction of new products or other market activities of industry participants. We face competition from many different sources, including major medical device companies. 

We compete with several large, well-known companies that dominate the market for orthopedic products, principally Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc., or Zimmer Biomet, DePuy Synthes, Inc., or DePuy, a Johnson &#38; Johnson company, Smith &#38; Nephew, Inc., or Smith &#38; Nephew, Stryker Corporation, or Stryker, and MicroPort. These competitors have significantly greater financial resources, larger sales forces and networks of distributors, a greater number of established relationships, some of which may be exclusive, with key orthopedic surgeons, hospitals and third-party payors, and greater experience in research and development, manufacturing, obtaining regulatory clearances and marketing approved products than we do. These companies also compete with us in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, the development of our products and recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, engineering and management personnel. 

We also compete with numerous other companies that are developing and marketing competitive joint replacement products, as well as companies exploring alternatives to joint replacement such as biologic cartilage repair systems. 

We believe that the principal factors on which we compete with others in our market include: 

&#8226; 

the ability to introduce innovative products that are differentiated from competitors' offerings and represent an improvement over currently available products; 

&#8226; 

the ease of use of the products and the quality of training, services and clinical support provided to surgeons and hospitals; 

&#8226; 

the safety and efficacy of products and procedures, as demonstrated in published studies and other clinical reports; 

&#8226; 

the ability to anticipate and meet customers' needs and commercialize new products in a timely manner; 

&#8226; 

acceptance and adoption of products by patients, physicians and hospitals; and 

&#8226; 

the price of products and cost effectiveness of the procedure and availability and rate of third-party reimbursement. 

The prices that we charge our customers for our products vary from customer to customer based on such factors as the volume of product being purchased, geographic region, reimbursement environment and competitive factors. We believe that our current pricing for our products generally is within the same range as that of our principal competitors. 

Regulatory requirements 

Our products are medical devices that are subject to extensive regulation by government authorities in the United States and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the EU. These governmental authorities regulate the marketing and distribution of medical devices in their respective geographies. The regulations cover the entire life cycle of the product, including the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, packaging, storage, labeling, advertising and promotion of the devices. In addition, post-approval monitoring and reporting, as 

well as import and export of medical devices, are subject to regulatory requirements. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 

Review, approval and clearance of medical devices in the United States 

Medical devices in the United States are strictly regulated by the FDA. Under the FDCA a medical device is defined as an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part or accessory, which is, among other things: intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals; or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of any of its primary intended purposes. 

Unless an exemption applies, a new medical device may not be marketed in the United States unless it has been cleared by the FDA through filing of a 510(k) premarket notification, or 510(k), or approved by the FDA pursuant to a premarket approval application, or PMA. The information that must be submitted to the FDA in order to obtain clearance or approval to market a new medical device varies depending on how the medical device is classified by the FDA. Medical devices are classified into one of three classes depending on the level of control necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Class I devices have the lowest level or risk associated with them, and are subject to general controls, including labeling, premarket notification and adherence to the QSR. Class II devices are subject to general controls and special controls, including performance standards. Class III devices, which have the highest level of risk associated with them, are subject to most of the aforementioned requirements as well as to premarket approval. Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempt from the 510(k) requirement, although manufacturers of these devices are still subject to registration, listing, labeling and QSR requirements. 

To date, we have used exclusively the 510(k) premarket notification process to obtain regulatory clearance from the FDA for the marketing and sale of our joint replacement products in the United States. All of our currently marketed products are Class II devices marketed pursuant to 510(k) clearances. We expect that our iTotal Hip product will be classified as a Class II device. We submitted an application for 510(k) clearance of iTotal Hip in 2015. We cannot predict if or when we will receive clearance or initiate the commercial launch of iTotal Hip. We expect that iTotal Hip will be our next new product introduction after iTotal PS. 

510(k) premarket notification 

A 510(k) is a premarket submission made to the FDA to demonstrate that the proposed device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective (i.e., substantially equivalent) to another legally marketed device, or predicate device, that did not require premarket approval. In evaluating a 510(k), the FDA will determine whether the device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and (a) has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device, or (b) has different technological characteristics, and (1) the data supporting substantial equivalence contains information, including appropriate clinical or scientific data, if deemed necessary by the FDA, that demonstrates that the device is as safe and as effective as a legally marketed device, and (2) does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate device. Most 510(k)s do not require clinical data for clearance, but the FDA may request such data. 

The FDA seeks to review and act on a 510(k) within 90 days of submission, but it may take longer if the agency finds that it requires more information to review the 510(k). If the FDA concludes that a new device is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the new device will be classified in Class III and the manufacturer will be required to submit a PMA to market the product. With the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or the FDASIA, a de novo pathway is directly available for certain low to moderate risk devices that do not qualify for the 510(k) pathway due to the absence of a predicate device. 

Modifications to a 510(k)-cleared medical device may require the submission of another 510(k) or a PMA if the changes could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or constitute a major change in the intended use of the device. Modifications to a 510(k)-cleared device frequently require the submission of a traditional 510(k), but modifications meeting certain conditions may be candidates for FDA review under a Special 510(k). If a device modification requires the submission of a 510(k), but the modification does not affect the intended use of the device or alter the fundamental technology of the device, then summary information that results from the design control 

process associated with the cleared device can serve as the basis for clearing the application. A Special 510(k) allows a manufacturer to declare conformance to design controls without providing new data. When the modification involves a change in material, the nature of the "new" material will determine whether a traditional or Special 510(k) is necessary. 

Premarket approval application 

The PMA process for approval to market a medical device is more complex, costly and time consuming than the 510(k) clearance procedure. A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical, manufacturing, control and labeling information, that demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After a PMA is submitted, the FDA has 45 days to determine whether it is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the PMA is complete, the FDA will file the PMA. The FDA is subject to performance goal review times for PMAs and may issue a decision letter as a first action on a PMA within 180 days of filing, but if it has questions, it will likely issue a first major deficiency letter within 150 days of filing. It may also refer the PMA to an FDA advisory panel for additional review, and will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the QSR, either of which could extend the 180-day response target. In addition, the FDA may request additional information or request the performance of additional clinical trials before it will reconsider the approval of the PMA or as a condition of approval, in which case the trials must be completed after the PMA is approved. 

If the FDA's evaluations of both the PMA and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter authorizing commercial marketing or an approvable letter that usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval. If the FDA's evaluations are not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The agency may determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed while the trials are conducted and the data acquired are submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Even with additional trials, the FDA may not approve the PMA application. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and nonclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years, and the process can be expensive and uncertain. Moreover, even if the FDA approves a PMA, the agency can impose post-approval conditions that it believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. After approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement may be required for a modification to the device, its labeling or its manufacturing process. None of our products are currently approved under a PMA approval. 

Investigational device exemption 

A clinical trial is typically required for a PMA and, in a small percentage of cases, the FDA may require a clinical study in support of a 510(k) submission. A manufacturer that wishes to conduct a clinical study involving the device is subject to the FDA's Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulation. The IDE regulation distinguishes between significant and nonsignificant risk device studies and the procedures for obtaining approval to begin the study differ accordingly. Also, some types of studies are exempt from the IDE regulations. A significant risk device presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. Significant risk devices are devices that are substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or in preventing impairment to human health. Studies of devices that pose a significant risk require both FDA approval and an approval of an independent institutional review board, or IRB, prior to initiation of a clinical study. Nonsignificant risk devices are devices that do not pose a significant risk to the human subjects. A nonsignificant risk device study requires only IRB approval prior to initiation of a clinical study. 

An IDE application is considered approved 30 days after it has been received by the FDA, unless the FDA otherwise informs the sponsor prior to 30 calendar days from the date of receipt, that the IDE is approved, approved with conditions, or disapproved. The clinical trial must be conducted in accordance with applicable regulations, including but not limited to the FDA's IDE regulations and current good clinical practices. A clinical trial may be suspended by the FDA, the IRB or the sponsor at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to the study participants outweigh the benefits of participation in the trial. 

To date, none of our submissions to the FDA have required the submission of clinical data. However, we have conducted and continue to conduct numerous post-market studies aimed at demonstrating the benefits of our customized knee replacement systems as compared to traditional off-the-shelf systems. 

Post-marketing restrictions and enforcement 

After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: compliance with the QSR; labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved or "off-label" uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; and medical device reporting obligations, which require that manufacturers investigate and report to the FDA adverse events, including deaths, or serious injuries that may have been or were caused by a medical device and malfunctions in the device that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. 

The failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: warning letters; fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; recall or seizure of our products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusal to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals of new products; withdrawal of 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals; and criminal prosecution. To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, medical device manufacturers are subject to market surveillance and periodic, pre-scheduled and unannounced inspections by the FDA, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors. 

Review and approval of medical devices in the EU 

The European Union, or EU, consists of 28 member states and has a coordinated system for the authorization of medical devices. The EU Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC, as amended) sets out the basic regulatory framework for medical devices in the European Union. In the EU our medical devices must comply with the Essential Requirements in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive, which we refer to as the Essential Requirements. Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the Certificate of Conformity mark, or CE Mark, to our medical devices, without which they cannot be marketed or sold in the European Economic Area, or EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the Essential Requirements we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile), where the manufacturer can issue a CE Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the Essential Requirements, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a third-party organization designated by competent authorities of an EU country to conduct conformity assessments, which is referred to as a Notified Body. The Notified Body would typically audit and examine products' technical file and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of the devices before issuing a CE Certificate of Conformity demonstrating compliance with the relevant Essential Requirements. 

To date, we have used the CE Marking process to satisfy the conformity standards required to market and sell our joint replacement products in the EU. The Notified Body that has conducted conformity assessments with respect to our joint replacement products is the BSI. 

Medical device manufacturers must carry out a clinical evaluation of their medical devices to demonstrate conformity with the relevant Essential Requirements. This clinical evaluation is part of the product's technical file. A clinical evaluation includes an assessment of whether a medical device's performance is in accordance with its intended use, that the known and foreseeable risks linked to the use of the device under normal conditions are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended purpose. The clinical evaluation conducted by the manufacturer must also address any clinical claims, the adequacy of the device labeling and information (particularly claims, contraindications, precautions and warnings) and the suitability of related instructions for use. This assessment must be based on clinical data, which can be obtained from clinical studies conducted on the devices being assessed, scientific literature from similar devices whose equivalence with the assessed device can be demonstrated or both clinical studies and scientific literature. 

With respect to implantable devices or devices classified as Class III in the EU, the manufacturer must conduct clinical studies to obtain the required clinical data, unless reliance on existing clinical data from similar devices can be justified. As part of the conformity assessment process, depending on the type of devices, the Notified Body will review the manufacturer's clinical evaluation process, assess the clinical evaluation data of a representative sample of the devices' subcategory or generic group, or assess all the clinical evaluation data, verify the manufacturer's assessment of that data and assess the validity of the clinical evaluation report and the conclusions drawn by the manufacturer. The conduct of clinical studies to obtain clinical data that might be required as part of the described clinical evaluation process can be expensive and time-consuming. To date, we have not been required to conduct any of these clinical studies to obtain clinical data as part of the clinical evaluation process. 

Even after we receive a CE Certificate of Conformity enabling us to affix the CE Mark on a product and to sell our product in the EEA countries, a Notified Body or a competent authority may require post-marketing studies of 

our product. Failure to comply with such requirements in a timely manner could result in the withdrawal of our CE Certificate of Conformity and the recall or withdrawal of our product from the market in the EU, which would prevent us from generating revenue from sales of that product in the EEA. Moreover, each CE Certificate of Conformity is valid for a maximum of five years, but more commonly three years. Our current CE Certificates of Conformity are valid through August 5, 2016 for our iTotal CR product, February 12, 2017 for our iUni product, June 11, 2019 for our iDuo product and March 5, 2020 for our iTotal PS product. At the end of each period of validity we are required to apply to the Notified Body for a renewal of the CE Certificate of Conformity. There may be delays in the renewal of the CE Certificate of Conformity or the Notified Body may require modifications to our products or to the related Technical Files before it agrees to issue the new CE Certificate of Conformity. 

In addition, we must inform the Notified Body that carried out the conformity assessment of the medical devices we market or sell in the EEA of any planned substantial changes to our devices that could affect compliance with the Essential Requirements or the devices' intended purpose. The Notified Body will then assess the changes and verify whether they affect the products' conformity with the Essential Requirements or the conditions for the use of the devices. If the assessment is favorable, the Notified Body will issue a new CE Certificate of Conformity or an addendum to the existing CE Certificate of Conformity attesting compliance with the Essential Requirements. If it is not, we may not be able to continue to market and sell the product in the EEA. 

On September 26, 2012, the European Commission adopted a package of legislative proposals designed to replace the existing regulatory framework for medical devices in the EU. These proposals provide for a revision of the current regulatory framework for medical devices in the EU to strengthen patient safety, transparency and product traceability. The proposals, for instance, include reinforced rules governing clinical evaluation throughout the life of the device, improved traceability of devices in the supply chain, including a phased and risk-based introduction of unique device identification, or UDI, improved market surveillance and vigilance, as well as better co-ordination between national regulators, increased powers for Notified Bodies to undertake unannounced inspections and strengthened supervision of Notified Bodies by member states. The European Commission's proposals may undergo significant amendments as they are reviewed by the European Council and European Parliament as part of the EU legislative process. If and when adopted, the proposed new legislation may prevent or delay the EU approval or clearance of our products under development or may impact our ability to modify our currently EU approved or cleared products on a timely basis and impose additional costs relating to clinical evaluation, vigilance and product traceability. 

Marketing and sales considerations in the EU 

In the EU, medical devices may be promoted only for the intended purpose for which the devices have been CE Marked. Failure to comply with this requirement could lead to the imposition of penalties by the competent authorities of the EU Member States. The penalties could include warnings, orders to discontinue the promotion of the medical device, seizure of the promotional materials and fines. Promotional materials must also comply with various laws and codes of conduct developed by medical device industry bodies in the EU governing promotional claims, comparative advertising, advertising of medical devices reimbursed by the national health insurance systems and advertising to the general public. 

Product vigilance and post-approval monitoring in the EU 

Additionally, all manufacturers placing medical devices into the market in the EU are legally bound to report any serious or potentially serious incidents involving devices they produce or sell to the competent authority in whose jurisdiction the incident occurred. In the EU, manufacturers must comply with the EU Medical Device Vigilance System. Under this system, incidents must be reported to the relevant authorities of the EU countries, and manufacturers are required to take field safety corrective actions, or FSCAs, to reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of a medical device that is already placed on the market. See "Risk Factors&#8212;Risks related to regulatory approval&#8212;If our products, or malfunction of our products, cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions." 

Third-party reimbursement 

In the United States and most other major joint implant markets, third-party payors, including government health programs, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, reimburse hospitals and other medical facilities an aggregate amount for all elements of a joint replacement procedure, including operating room time, patient care and the joint replacement product. As a result, our products generally are not reimbursed 

separately, but instead are subject to the limits imposed by third-party payors on the coverage and reimbursement of procedures that utilize our products. 

Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of such procedures involving the use of our products cleared by the FDA and approved by other government authorities will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States, such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a particular procedure may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the procedure once coverage is approved. Third party payors may limit coverage to particular procedures on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved procedures involving the use of our products for a particular indication. 

In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. In many foreign markets, pricing of medical devices is subject to governmental control. In the United States, there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to limit payments by governmental payors for medical devices, and the procedures in which medical devices are used. While we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and profitability. 

Healthcare laws and regulations 

Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and selection of medical devices for patients. Arrangements with third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following: 

&#8226; 

the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; 

&#8226; 

the federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, and provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; 

&#8226; 

the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 

&#8226; 

HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 

&#8226; 

the federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; 

&#8226; 

the federal transparency requirements under the Health Care Reform Law will require manufacturers of devices, drugs and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests; and 

&#8226; 

analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. 

State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
