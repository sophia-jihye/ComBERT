 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General 

Stanley Black &#38; Decker, Inc. ("the Company") was founded in 1843 by Fredrick T. Stanley and incorporated in Connecticut in 1852. In March 2010, the Company completed a merger ("the Merger") with The Black &#38; Decker Corporation (&#8220;Black &#38; Decker&#8221;), a company founded by S. Duncan Black and Alonzo G. Decker and incorporated in Maryland in 1910. At that time, the Company changed its name from The Stanley Works ("Stanley") to Stanley Black &#38; Decker, Inc. The Company is a diversified global provider of hand tools, power tools and related accessories, mechanical access solutions (i.e. automatic doors and commercial locking systems), electronic security and monitoring systems, healthcare solutions, engineered fastening systems and products and services for various industrial applications, with 2015 &#32;consolidated annual revenues of $11.2 billion . The Company is continuing to pursue a growth and acquisition strategy that involves industry, geographic and customer diversification to foster sustainable revenue, earnings and cash flow growth. The Company is focused on growing organically, including increasing its presence in emerging markets, with a goal of generating greater than 20% of annual revenues from those markets, and leveraging the Stanley Fulfillment System, a now expanded program focused on upgrading innovation and digital capabilities while maintaining commercial and supply chain excellence, and funding required investments through functional transformation. In regards to acquisitions in the near-term, the Company intends to pursue targets that consolidate the tool industry and expand the Industrial platform in Engineered Fastening and Infrastructure. The Company remains focused on improving the operating results of the Security business and plans to reevaluate its recovery progress and strategic fit by the second half of 2016. In 2015 , approximately 53% of the Company&#8217;s annual revenues were generated in the United States, with the remainder largely from Europe ( 22% ), emerging markets (16%) and Canada (5%). 

Execution of the Company's strategy has resulted in approximately $6.2 billion of acquisitions since 2002 (excluding the Black &#38; Decker merger) and increased brand investment, enabled by cash flow generation and increased debt capacity. The acquisitions of Infastech in February 2013 and Jiangsu Guoqiang Tools Co., Ltd. ("GQ") in May 2013 exemplify this strategy. Infastech is a global manufacturer and distributor of specialty engineered fastening technology based in Hong Kong. The acquisition of Infastech added to the Company's strong positioning in specialty engineered fastening, an industry with solid growth prospects particularly in the global electronics, industrial and automotive end markets, and further expanded the Company's global footprint with its strong concentration in fast-growing emerging markets. GQ is the #3 mid-price-point power tool manufacturer in China and complements the Company's existing power tools product offerings in the Tools &#38; Storage segment. In addition to these acquisitions, in December 2012, the Company sold its Hardware &#38; Home Improvement business ("HHI"), including the residential portion of Tong Lung, to Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. ("Spectrum") for approximately $1.4 billion in cash. The purchase and sale agreement stipulated that the sale occur in a First and Second Closing. The First Closing, which excluded the residential portion of the Tong Lung business, occurred on December 17, 2012 while the Second Closing, in which the residential portion of the Tong Lung business was sold, occurred on April 8, 2013. The Company also divested several smaller businesses in recent years that did not fit into its long-term strategic objectives. The operating results of these divested businesses have been reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note E, Acquisitions, and &#32;Note T, Discontinued Operations , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#32;in Item 8 &#32;for further discussion. 

At January 2, 2016 , the Company employed approximately 51,250 people worldwide. The Company&#8217;s principal executive office is located at 1000 Stanley Drive, New Britain, Connecticut 06053 and its telephone number is (860) 225-5111. 

Description of the Business 

During the first quarter of 2015, the Company combined the Construction &#38; Do-It-Yourself ("CDIY") business with certain complementary elements of the Industrial and Automotive Repair ("IAR") and Healthcare businesses (formerly part of the Industrial and Security segments, respectively) to form one Tools &#38; Storage business. As a result, the Company recast segment financial information for prior periods to align with this change in organizational structure. There was no impact to the consolidated financial statements of the Company as a result of this change. 

The Company&#8217;s operations are classified into three reportable business segments, which also represent its operating segments: Tools &#38; Storage, Security and Industrial. All segments have significant international operations and are exposed to translational and transactional impacts from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 

Additional information regarding the Company&#8217;s business segments and geographic areas is incorporated herein by reference to the material captioned &#8220; Business Segment Results &#8221; in Item 7 &#32;and Note P, Business Segments and Geographic Areas , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#32;in Item 8 . 

Tools &#38; Storage 

The Tools &#38; Storage segment is comprised of the Power Tools and Hand Tools &#38; Storage businesses. The segment sells its products to professional end users, distributors, retail consumers and industrial customers in a wide variety of industries and geographies. The majority of sales are distributed through retailers, including home centers, mass merchants, hardware stores, and retail lumber yards, as well as third-party distributors and a direct sales force. Annual revenues in the Tools &#38; Storage segment were $7.1 billion &#32;in 2015 , representing 64% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s total revenues. 

The Power Tools business includes professional products, consumer products, and power tool accessories. Professional products include professional grade corded and cordless electric power tools and equipment including drills, impact wrenches and drivers, grinders, saws, routers and sanders, as well as pneumatic tools and fasteners including nail guns, nails, staplers and staples, concrete and masonry anchors. Consumer products include corded and cordless electric power tools sold primarily under the BLACK+DECKER brand, lawn and garden products, including hedge trimmers, string trimmers, lawn mowers, edgers and related accessories, and home products such as hand-held vacuums, paint tools and cleaning appliances. Power tool accessories include drill bits, router bits, abrasives and saw blades. 

The Hand Tools &#38; Storage business sells measuring, leveling and layout tools, planes, hammers, demolition tools, knives, saws, chisels and industrial and automotive tools. Storage products include tool boxes, sawhorses, medical cabinets and engineered storage solution products. 

Security 

The Security segment is comprised of the Convergent Security Solutions ("CSS") and Mechanical Access Solutions ("MAS") businesses. Annual revenues in the Security segment were $2.1 billion &#32;in 2015 , representing 19% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s total revenues. 

The CSS business designs, supplies and installs electronic security systems and provides electronic security services, including alarm monitoring, video surveillance, fire alarm monitoring, systems integration and system maintenance. Purchasers of these systems typically contract for ongoing security systems monitoring and maintenance at the time of initial equipment installation. The business also sells healthcare solutions, which include asset tracking solutions, infant protection, pediatric protection, patient protection, wander management, fall management, and emergency call products. The CSS business sells to consumers, retailers, educational, financial and healthcare institutions, as well as commercial, governmental and industrial customers. Products are sold predominantly on a direct sales basis. 

The MAS business sells and installs automatic doors, commercial hardware, locking mechanisms, electronic keyless entry systems, keying systems, tubular and mortise door locksets. MAS sells to commercial customers primarily through independent distribution channels. 

Industrial 

The Industrial segment is comprised of the Engineered Fastening and Infrastructure businesses. Annual revenues in the Industrial segment were $1.9 billion &#32;in 2015 , representing 17% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s total revenues. 

The Engineered Fastening business primarily sells engineered fastening products and systems designed for specific applications. The product lines include stud welding systems, blind rivets and tools, blind inserts and tools, drawn arc weld studs, engineered plastic and mechanical fasteners, self-piercing riveting systems and precision nut running systems, micro fasteners, and high-strength structural fasteners. The business sells to customers in the automotive, manufacturing, electronics, and aerospace industries, amongst others, and its products are distributed through direct sales forces and, to a lesser extent, third-party distributors. 

The Infrastructure business consists of the Oil &#38; Gas and Hydraulics businesses. The Oil &#38; Gas business sells and rents custom pipe handling, joint welding and coating equipment used in the construction of large and small diameter pipelines, and provides pipeline inspection services. The Hydraulics business sells hydraulic tools and accessories. The Infrastructure businesses sell to the oil and natural gas pipeline industry and other industrial customers. The products and services are primarily distributed through a direct sales force and, to a lesser extent, third-party distributors. 

Other Information 

Competition 

The Company competes on the basis of its reputation for product quality, its well-known brands, its commitment to customer service, strong customer relationships, the breadth of its product lines and its innovative products and customer value propositions. 

The Company encounters active competition in the Tools &#38; Storage and Industrial segments from both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services. Certain large customers offer private label brands (&#8220;house brands&#8221;) that compete across a wider spectrum of the Company&#8217;s Tools &#38; Storage segment product offerings. Competition in the Security segment is generally fragmented via both large international players and regional companies. Competition tends to be based primarily on price, the quality of service and comprehensiveness of the services offered to the customers. 

Major Customers 

A significant portion of the Company&#8217;s Tools &#38; Storage products are sold to home centers and mass merchants in the U.S. and Europe. A consolidation of retailers both in North America and abroad has occurred over time. While this consolidation and the domestic and international expansion of these large retailers has provided the Company with opportunities for growth, the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates a certain degree of exposure to potential sales volume loss. As a result of the Company&#8217;s acquisition strategy, sales to U.S. home centers and mass merchants declined from a high of approximately 40% in 2002, to 15% before the Black &#38; Decker merger. In 2015 , sales to U.S. home centers and mass merchants were 21%. 

Working Capital 

The Company continues to practice the core operating disciplines encompassed by the Stanley Fulfillment System (&#8220;SFS&#8221;). SFS has five core principles that work in concert: sales and operations planning, operational lean, complexity reduction, global supply management, and order-to-cash excellence. The Company develops standardized business processes and system platforms to reduce costs and provide scalability. SFS is instrumental in the reduction of working capital evidenced by the 56% improvement in working capital turns for the Company from 5.9 at the end of 2010 (excluding HHI) to 9.2 at the end of 2015 . The continued efforts to deploy SFS across the entire Company and increase turns have created significant opportunities to generate incremental free cash flow. Going forward, the Company plans to further leverage the core SFS principles to generate ongoing improvements, both in the existing business and future acquisitions, in working capital turns, cycle times, complexity reduction and customer service levels, with a goal of ultimately achieving 10 working capital turns. 

Raw Materials 

The Company&#8217;s products are manufactured using ferrous and non-ferrous metals including, but not limited to steel, zinc, copper, brass, aluminum and nickel as well as resins. The Company also purchases components such as batteries, motors, and electronic components to use in manufacturing and assembly operations along with resin-based molded parts. The raw materials required are procured globally and available from multiple sources at competitive prices. As part of the Company's Enterprise Risk Management, the Company has implemented a supplier risk mitigation strategy in order to identify and address any potential supply disruption associated with commodities, components, finished goods and critical services. The Company does not anticipate difficulties in obtaining supplies for any raw materials or energy used in its production processes. 

Backlog 

Due to short order cycles and rapid inventory turnover primarily in the Company's Tools &#38; Storage segment, backlog is generally not considered a significant indicator of future performance. At February 6, 2016, the Company had approximately $783 million in unfilled orders, which mainly relate to the Engineered Fastening and Security businesses. Substantially all of these orders are reasonably expected to be filled within the current fiscal year. As of January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014, unfilled orders amounted to $888 million and $948 million, respectively. 

Patents and Trademarks 

No business segment is solely dependent, to any significant degree, on patents, licenses, franchises or concessions, and the loss of one or several of these patents, licenses, franchises or concessions would not have a material adverse effect on any of the businesses. The Company owns numerous patents, none of which individually is material to the Company's operations as a whole. These patents expire at various times over the next 20 years. The Company holds licenses, franchises and concessions, none of which individually or in the aggregate are material to the Company's operations as a whole. These licenses, franchises and concessions vary in duration, but generally run from one to 40 years. 

The Company has numerous trademarks that are used in its businesses worldwide. In the Tools &#38; Storage segment, significant trademarks include STANLEY&#174;, BLACK+DECKER&#174;, D E WALT&#174;, Porter-Cable&#174;, BOSTITCH&#174;, FatMax&#174;, Powers&#174;, Guaranteed Tough&#174;, Innerspace&#174;, MAC&#174;, MAC Tools&#174;, Proto&#174;, Vidmar&#174;, Facom&#174;, USAG&#8482;, Lista&#174;, and the yellow &#38; black color scheme for power tools and accessories. Significant trademarks in the Industrial segment include STANLEY&#174;, CRC&#174;, LaBounty&#174;, Dubuis&#174;, AeroScout&#174;, Cribmaster&#174;, Expert&#174;, SIDCHROME&#8482;, POP&#174;, Warren&#174;, GRIPCO&#174;, Avdel&#174;, HeliCoil&#174;, MasterFix&#174;, Tucker&#174;, NPR&#174;, Dodge&#174;, and Spiralock&#174;. The Security segment includes significant trademarks such as STANLEY&#174;, BEST&#174;, Blick&#8482;, HSM&#174;, Sargent &#38; Greenleaf&#174;, S&#38;G&#174;, SONITROL&#174;, Niscayah&#174;, Stanley Access Technologies&#8482;, AeroScout&#174;, Hugs&#174;, WanderGuard&#174;, Roam Alert&#174;, MyCall&#174;, Arial&#174; and Bed-Check&#174;. The terms of these trademarks typically vary from 10 to 20 years, with most trademarks being renewable indefinitely for like terms. 

Environmental Regulations 

The Company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and foreign countries where it has operations. Future laws and regulations are expected to be increasingly stringent and will likely increase the Company&#8217;s expenditures related to environmental matters. 

In the normal course of business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings relating to environmental issues. The Company&#8217;s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In the event that no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely, the minimum loss in the range is accrued. The amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. The liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties. As assessments and remediation progress at individual sites, the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available. As of January 2, 2016 &#32;and January 3, 2015 , the Company had reserves of $170.7 million &#32;and $177.3 million , respectively, for remediation activities associated with Company-owned properties, as well as for Superfund sites, for losses that are probable and estimable. Of the 2015 &#32;amount, $17.1 million &#32;is classified as current and $153.6 million &#32;as long-term, which is expected to be paid over the estimated remediation period. As of January 2, 2016 , the Company has recorded $18.7 million in other assets related to funding by the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and monies received have been placed in trust in accordance with the Consent Decree associated with the West Coast Loading Corporation ("WCLC") proceedings, as further discussed in Note S, Contingencies , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#32;in Item 8 . Accordingly, the Company's cash obligation as of January 2, 2016 &#32;associated with the aforementioned remediation activities is $152.0 million. The range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is $130.4 million &#32;to $260.8 million , which is subject to change in the near term. The Company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns. Liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with policy. 

The amount recorded for identified contingent liabilities is based on estimates. Amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available. Actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the estimates, given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future contingent liability costs, the Company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with these matters in excess of the amounts recorded will have a materially adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Additional information regarding environmental matters is available in Note S, Contingencies , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#32;in Item 8 . 

Employees 

At January 2, 2016 , the Company had approximately 51,250 &#32;employees, 13,533 of whom are employed in the U.S. Approximately 1,022 U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with 29 different local labor unions who are, in turn, affiliated with approximately 6 different international labor unions. The majority of the Company&#8217;s hourly-paid and weekly-paid employees outside the U.S. are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Company&#8217;s labor agreements in the U.S. expire between 2016 and 2020. There have been no significant interruptions of the Company&#8217;s operations in recent years due to labor disputes. The Company believes that its relationship with its employees is good. 

Research and Development Costs 

Research and development costs, which are classified in SG&#38;A, were $188.0 million , $174.6 million &#32;and $170.7 million &#32;for fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively.
