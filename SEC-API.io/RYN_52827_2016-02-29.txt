BUSINESS 

General 

We are a leading timberland real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;) with assets located in some of the most productive softwood timber growing regions in the U.S. and New Zealand. The focus of our business is to invest in timberlands and to actively manage them to provide current income and attractive long-term returns to our shareholders. As of December 31, 2015 , we owned, leased or managed approximately 2.7 million &#32;acres of timberlands located in the U.S. South ( 1.9 million &#32;acres), U.S. Pacific Northwest ( 373,000 &#32;acres) and New Zealand ( 439,000 &#32;gross acres, or 299,000 net plantable acres). In addition, we engage in the trading of logs from New Zealand and Australia to Pacific Rim markets, primarily to support our New Zealand export operations. We have an added focus to maximize the value of our land portfolio by pursuing higher and better use (&#8220;HBU&#8221;) land sales opportunities. 

We originated as the Rainier Pulp &#38; Paper Company founded in Shelton, Washington in 1926. On June 27, 2014, Rayonier completed the tax-free spin-off of its Performance Fibers manufacturing business from its timberland and real estate operations, thereby becoming a &#8220;pure-play&#8221; timberland REIT. 

Under our REIT structure, we are generally not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on our earnings from timber harvest operations and other REIT-qualifying activities contingent upon meeting applicable distribution, income, asset, shareholder and other tests. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the Company is in compliance with all REIT tests. 

Our U.S. timber operations are primarily conducted by our wholly-owned REIT subsidiaries. Our New Zealand timber operations are conducted by Matariki Forest Group, a majority-owned joint venture subsidiary (&#8220;New Zealand JV&#8221;). Our non-REIT qualifying operations, which are subject to corporate-level tax, are held by various taxable REIT subsidiaries. These operations include our log trading business and certain real estate activities, such as the sale and entitlement of development HBU properties. 

Our shares are publicly traded on the NYSE under the symbol RYN. We are a North Carolina corporation with executive offices located at 225 Water Street, Jacksonville, Florida 32202. Our telephone number is (904) 357-9100.

&#32;1 

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe that we distinguish ourselves from other timberland owners and managers through the following competitive strengths: 

&#8226; 

Leading Pure-Play Timberland REIT . We are differentiated from other publicly-traded timberland REITs in that we are invested exclusively in timberlands and real estate and do not own any pulp, paper or wood products manufacturing assets. We are the largest publicly-traded &#8220;pure-play&#8221; timberland REIT, which provides our investors with a focused, large-scale timberland investment alternative without taking on the risks inherent in direct ownership of forest products manufacturing assets. 

&#8226; 

Located in Premier Softwood Growing Regions with Access to Strong Markets . Our geographically diverse timberland holdings are strategically located in core softwood producing regions, including the U.S. South, U.S. Pacific Northwest and New Zealand. Our most significant timberland holdings are strategically located in the U.S. South, in close proximity to a variety of established pulp, paper and wood products manufacturing facilities, which provide a steady source of competitive demand for both pulpwood and higher-value sawtimber products. Our Pacific Northwest and New Zealand timberlands benefit from strong domestic sawmilling markets and are strategically positioned near ports to capitalize on export markets serving the Pacific Rim. 

&#8226; 

Sophisticated Log Marketing Capabilities Serving Various Pacific Rim Markets . We conduct a log trading operation based in New Zealand that serves timberland owners in New Zealand and Australia, providing access to key export markets in China, South Korea and India. This operation provides us with superior market intelligence and economies of scale, both of which add value to our New Zealand timber portfolio. It also provides additional market intelligence that helps our Pacific Northwest export log marketing and contributes to the Company&#8217;s earnings and cash flows, with minimal investment. 

&#8226; 

Attractive Land Portfolio with Higher and Better Use Potential . We own approximately 200,000 acres of timberlands located in the vicinity of Interstate 95 primarily north of Daytona Beach, FL and south of Savannah, GA, some of which may have the potential to transition to higher and better uses over time as market conditions support increased demand. These properties provide us with select opportunities to add value to our portfolio through real estate development activities, which we believe will allow us to periodically sell parcels of such land at favorable valuations relative to timberland values through one of our taxable REIT subsidiaries. 

&#8226; 

Dedicated HBU Platform with Established Track Record. We have a dedicated HBU platform led by an experienced team with an established track record of selling rural and development HBU properties across our U.S. South holdings at strong premiums to timberland values. We maintain a detailed land classification analysis of our portfolio, which allows us to identify the highest-value use of our lands and then capitalize on identified HBU opportunities through strategies uniquely tailored to maximize value, including selectively pursuing land-use entitlements and infrastructure improvements. 

&#8226; 

Advantageous Structure and Capitalization . &#32; Under our REIT structure, we are generally not required to pay federal income taxes on our earnings from timber harvest operations and other REIT-qualifying activities, which allows us to optimize the value of our portfolio in a tax efficient manner. We also maintain a strong credit profile and have an investment grade debt rating. As of December 31, 2015 , our net debt to enterprise value was 22% . We believe that our advantageous REIT structure and conservative capitalization provide us with a competitive cost of capital and significant financial flexibility to pursue growth initiatives relative to other owners, managers and buyers of timberlands. 

Our Strategy 

Our business strategy consists of the following key elements: 

&#8226; 

Manage our Timberlands on a Sustainable Yield Basis for Long-term Results. We generate recurring income and cash flow from the harvest and sale of timber and intend to actively manage our timberlands to maximize net present value over the long term by achieving an optimal balance among biological timber growth, generation of cash flow from harvesting activities, and responsible environmental stewardship. Our harvesting strategy is designed to produce a long-term, sustainable yield, although we may adjust harvest levels periodically to capitalize on then-current economic conditions in our markets. 

&#8226; 

Apply Advanced Silviculture to Increase the Productivity of our Timberlands. We use our forestry expertise and disciplined financial approach to determine the appropriate silviculture programs and investments to maximize returns. This includes re-planting a significant portion of our harvested acres with improved seedlings we have developed through decades of research and cultivation. Over time, we expect these improved seedlings will result in higher volumes per acre and a higher value product mix. 

&#32;2 

&#8226; 

Increase the Size and Quality of our Timberland Holdings through Acquisitions. &#32;We intend to selectively pursue timberland acquisition opportunities that improve the average productivity of our timberland holdings and support cash flow generation from our annual harvesting activities. We expect there will be an ample supply of attractive timberlands available for sale as a result of anticipated sales from a number of Timberland Investment Management Organizations (&#8220;TIMOs&#8221;). This acquisition strategy requires a disciplined approach and rigorous adherence to strategic and financial metrics. Generally, we expect to focus our acquisition efforts on the most commercially desirable timber-producing regions of the U.S. South, the U.S. Pacific Northwest and New Zealand, particularly on timberlands with an age class profile that complements the age class profile of our existing timberland holdings. We acquired 37,000 acres of timberland in 2015, 62,000 acres in 2014, and 17,000 acres in 2013. 

&#8226; 

Optimize our Portfolio Value. &#32;We continuously assess potential alternative uses of our timberlands, as some of our properties may become more valuable for development, residential, recreation or other purposes. We intend to capitalize on such higher-valued uses by opportunistically monetizing HBU properties in our portfolio. While the majority of our HBU sales involve rural and recreational land, we also selectively pursue various land-use entitlements on certain properties for residential, commercial and industrial development in order to fully realize the enhanced long-term value potential of such properties. For selected development properties, we also invest in infrastructure improvements, such as roadways and utilities, to accelerate the marketability and improve the value of such properties. We generally expect that sales of HBU property will comprise approximately 1% of our Southern timberland holdings on an annual basis. 

&#8226; 

Focus on Timberland Operations to Support Cash Flow Generation. &#32;As described above, we rely primarily on annual harvesting activities and ongoing sales of HBU properties to generate cash flow from our timberland holdings. However, we also periodically generate income and cash flow from the sale of non-strategic and/or non-HBU timberlands in particular as we seek to optimize our portfolio by disposing of less desirable properties or to fund capital allocation priorities, including share repurchases, debt repayment or acquisitions. Our strategy is to limit reliance on planned sales of non-HBU timberlands to augment cash flow generation and instead rely primarily on supporting cash flow from the operation, rather than sale, of our timberlands. We believe this strategy will support the sustainability of our harvesting activities over the long term. 

&#8226; 

Promote Best-in-Class Disclosure and Responsible Stewardship. &#32;We intend to be an industry leader in transparent disclosure, particularly relating to our timberland holdings, harvest schedules, inventory and age-class profiles. In addition, we are committed to responsible stewardship and environmentally and economically sustainable forestry. We believe our continued commitment to transparency and the stewardship of our assets and capital will allow us to maintain our timberlands&#8217; productivity, more effectively attract and deploy capital and enhance our reputation as a preferred timber supplier. 

Segment Information 

Rayonier operates in five reportable business segments: Southern Timber, Pacific Northwest Timber, New Zealand Timber, Real Estate and Trading. The Southern Timber, Pacific Northwest Timber and New Zealand Timber segments reflect all activities related to the harvesting of timber and other value-added activities, such as recreational leases, within each respective geography. The New Zealand Timber segment also reflects any land sales that occur within our New Zealand portfolio. Our Real Estate segment reflects all U.S. land sales, which are reported in five sales categories: Improved Development, Unimproved Development, Rural, Non-Strategic / Timberlands, and Large Dispositions. The Trading segment reflects the log trading activities that support our New Zealand operations. 

Discussion of Timber Inventory and Sustainable Yield 

We define gross timber inventory as an estimate of all standing timber volume beyond the specified age at which we commence calculating our timber inventory for inclusion in our inventory tracking systems. The age at which we commence calculating our timber inventory is 10 years for our Southern timberlands, 20 years for our Pacific Northwest timberlands, and 20 years for our New Zealand timberlands. Our estimate of gross timber inventory is based on an inventory system that involves periodic statistical sampling and growth modeling. Periodic adjustments are made on the basis of growth estimates, harvest information, and environmental and operational restrictions. Gross timber inventory includes certain timber that we do not deem to be of a merchantable age as well as certain timber located in restricted, environmentally sensitive or economically inaccessible areas. 

&#32;3 

We define merchantable timber inventory as an estimate of timber volume beyond a specified age that approximates such timber&#8217;s earliest economically harvestable age. Our estimate includes certain timber located in restricted or environmentally sensitive areas based on an estimate of lawfully recoverable volumes from such areas. The estimate does not include volumes in restricted or environmentally sensitive areas that may not be lawfully harvested or volumes located in economically inaccessible areas. The merchantable age ( i.e. , the age at which timber moves from pre-merchantable to merchantable) is 15 years for our Southern timberlands, with the exception of Oklahoma which is 17 years, 35 years for our Pacific Northwest timberlands, and 20 years for radiata pine and 30 years for Douglas-fir in our New Zealand timberlands. Our estimated merchantable timber inventory changes over time as timber is harvested, as pre-merchantable timber transitions to merchantable timber, as existing merchantable timber inventory grows, as we acquire and sell timberland and as we periodically update our statistical sampling and growth and yield models. We estimate our merchantable timber inventory annually for purposes of calculating per unit depletion rates. 

Timber inventory is generally measured and expressed in short green tons (SGT) in our Southern Timberlands, in thousand board feet (MBF) or million board feet (MMBF) in our Pacific Northwest Timberlands, and in cubic meters (m 3 ) in our New Zealand Timberlands. For conversion purposes, one MBF and one m 3 &#32;is equal to approximately 8.0 and 1.13 short green tons, respectively. For comparison purposes, we provide inventory estimates for our Pacific Northwest and New Zealand timberlands in MBF and cubic meters, respectively, as well as in short green tons. 

The following table sets forth the estimated volumes of merchantable timber inventory by location in short green tons as of September 30, 2015 &#32;for the South and Pacific Northwest and as of December 31, 2015 &#32;for New Zealand: &#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

(a) 

For all regions, depletion rate calculations for the upcoming year are based on estimated volumes of merchantable inventory at December 31, 2015 . 

We define sustainable yield as the average harvest level that can be sustained into perpetuity based on our estimates of biological growth and the expected productivity resulting from our reforestation and silvicultural efforts. Our estimated sustainable yield may change over time based on changes in silvicultural techniques and resulting timber yields, changes in environmental laws and restrictions, changes in the statistical sampling and estimates of our merchantable timber inventory, acquisitions and dispositions of timberlands, the expiration or renewal of timberland leases, casualty losses, and other factors. Moreover, our harvest level in any given year may deviate from our estimated sustainable yield due to variations in the age class of our timberlands, the product mix of our harvest ( i.e ., pulpwood versus sawtimber), our deliberate acceleration or deferral of harvest in response to market conditions, our thinning activity (in which we periodically remove some smaller trees from a stand to enhance long-term sawtimber potential of the remaining timber), or other factors. 

We manage our U.S. timberlands in accordance with the requirements of the Sustainable Forestry Initiative &#174; &#32;(&#8220;SFI&#8221;) program. The timberland holdings of the New Zealand JV are certified under the Forest Stewardship Certification &#174; &#32;(&#8220;FSC&#8221;) program. Both programs are a comprehensive system of environmental principles, objectives and performance measures that combines the perpetual growing and harvesting of trees with the protection of wildlife, plants, soil and water quality. Through application of our site-specific silvicultural expertise and financial discipline, we manage timber in a way that is designed to optimize site preparation, tree species selection, competition control, fertilization, timing of thinning and final harvest. We also have a genetic seedling improvement program to enhance the productivity and quality of our timberlands and overall forest health. In addition, non-timber income opportunities associated with our timberlands such as recreational leases, as well as considerations for the future higher and better uses of the land, are integral parts of our site-specific management philosophy. All these activities are designed to maximize value while complying with SFI and FSC requirements. 

&#32;4 

Southern Timber 

As of December 31, 2015 , our Southern timberlands acreage consisted of approximately 1.9 million &#32;acres (including approximately 242,000 &#32;acres of leased lands) located in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. Approximately two-thirds of this land supports intensively managed plantations of predominantly loblolly and slash pine. The other one-third of this land is too wet to support pine plantations, but supports productive natural stands primarily consisting of natural pine and a variety of hardwood species. Rotation ages typically range from 21 to 28 years for pine plantations and from 35 to 60 years for natural stands. Key consumers of our timber include pulp, paper, wood products and biomass facilities. 

We estimate that the gross timber inventory and merchantable timber inventory of our Southern timberlands was 84 million &#32;tons and 66 million &#32;tons, respectively, as of September 30, 2015 . We estimate that the sustainable yield of our Southern timberlands, including both pine and hardwoods, is approximately 5.5 to 5.8 million tons annually. We expect that the average annual harvest volume of our Southern timberlands over the next five years (2016 to 2020) will be generally within this range. For additional information, see Item 1 &#8212; Business &#8212; Discussion of Timber Inventory and Sustainable Yield . 

In 2015, we acquired approximately 29,000 &#32;acres of timberlands in the Southern region. For additional information, see Note 3 &#32;&#8212; Timberland Acquisitions . 

The following table provides a breakdown of our Southern timberlands acreage and timber inventory by product as of September 30, 2015 &#32;(inventory volumes are estimated at December 31 to calculate a depletion rate for the upcoming year):

Pacific Northwest Timber 

As of December 31, 2015 , our Pacific Northwest timberlands consisted of approximately 373,000 &#32;acres located in Oregon and Washington, of which approximately 285,000 &#32;acres were designated as productive acres, meaning land that is capable of growing merchantable timber and where the harvesting of timber is not constrained by physical, environmental or regulatory restrictions. These timberlands primarily comprise second and third rotation western hemlock and Douglas-fir, as well as a small amount of other softwood species, such as western red cedar. A small percentage also consists of natural hardwood stands of predominantly red alder. In the Pacific Northwest, rotation ages typically range from 35 to 50 years. Our product mix in the Pacific Northwest is heavily weighted to sawtimber, which is sold to domestic wood products facilities as well as into export markets primarily serving Pacific Rim markets. 

We estimate that the gross timber inventory and merchantable timber inventory of our Pacific Northwest timberlands was 2,164 MMBF &#32;and 666 MMBF , respectively, as of September 30, 2015 . We estimate that the sustainable yield of our Pacific Northwest timberlands is approximately 165 MMBF (or 1.3 million tons) annually. However, due to historical harvesting in excess of our sustainable yield in this region, we anticipate reducing the harvest level in our Pacific Northwest timberlands to 125 MMBF (or 1.0 million tons) by 2017 and maintaining that level for approximately five years thereafter in order to allow for inventory replenishment and age class smoothing. We expect to gradually reach our long-term sustainable yield of 165 MMBF (or 1.3 million tons) during the course of the next full rotation cycle. We expect that the average annual harvest volume of our Pacific Northwest timberlands over the next five years (2016 to 2020) will be approximately 130 MMBF (or 1.0 million tons). For additional information, see Item 1 &#8212; Business &#8212; Discussion of Timber Inventory and Sustainable Yield . 

In 2015, we acquired approximately 6,000 acres of timberlands in the Pacific Northwest region. For additional information, see Note 3 &#32;&#8212; Timberland Acquisitions . 

&#32;The following table provides a breakdown of our Pacific Northwest timberland acreage and timber inventory by product and age class as of September 30, 2015 &#32;(inventory volumes are estimated at December 31 to calculate a depletion rate for the upcoming year):

New Zealand Timber 

As of December 31, 2015 , our New Zealand timberlands consisted of approximately 439,000 &#32;acres (including approximately 254,000 &#32;acres of leased lands), of which approximately 299,000 &#32;acres (including approximately 164,000 acres of leased lands) were designated as productive or plantation acres, meaning land that is capable of growing merchantable timber and where the harvesting of timber is not constrained by physical, environmental or regulatory restrictions. The leased acres are generally leased through long-term arrangements including Crown Forest Licenses (&#8220;CFLs&#8221;), forestry rights and other leases. Our New Zealand timberlands serve a domestic sawmilling market and also export logs to Pacific Rim markets. 

Our New Zealand timber operations are conducted by Matariki Forestry Group, a joint venture with Phaunos Timber Fund Limited. In April 2013, we acquired an additional 39% interest in the New Zealand JV, bringing our total ownership to 65%. As a result, the New Zealand JV&#8217;s results of operations have been consolidated and comprise the New Zealand Timber segment. The minority owner&#8217;s interest in the New Zealand JV and its earnings are reported as noncontrolling interest in our financial statements. Rayonier&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Rayonier New Zealand Limited (&#8220;RNZ&#8221;), serves as the manager of the New Zealand JV. In August 2015, we announced a recapitalization of the New Zealand JV, which will result in our ownership increasing to approximately 77%. We expect this transaction to close in the first quarter of 2016. For additional information, see Note 7 &#32; &#8212; Joint Venture Investment . 

We estimate that the gross timber inventory and merchantable timber inventory of our New Zealand timberlands were both 13.9 million &#32;cubic meters as of December 31, 2015 . We estimate that the sustainable yield of our New Zealand timberlands is approximately 2 million cubic meters (or 2.3 million tons) annually. We expect that the average annual harvest volume of our New Zealand timberlands over the next five years (2016 to 2020) will be generally in line with our sustainable yield. For additional information, see Item 1 &#8212; Business &#8212; Discussion of Timber Inventory and Sustainable Yield . 

The following table provides a breakdown of our New Zealand timberland acreage and merchantable timber inventory by age class estimated as of December 31, 2015 &#32;(inventory volumes at December 31 are used to calculate a depletion rate for the upcoming year):

Real Estate 

All of our U.S. land sales, including HBU and non-HBU, are reported in our Real Estate segment. We report our Real Estate sales in five categories: Improved Development, Unimproved Development, Rural, Non-Strategic / Timberlands and Large Dispositions. 

The Improved Development category comprises properties sold for development for which Rayonier, through a taxable REIT subsidiary, has invested in site improvements such as infrastructure, roadways, utilities, amenities and/or other improvements designed to enhance marketability and create parcels, pads and/or lots for sale. The Unimproved Development category comprises properties sold for development for which Rayonier has not invested in site improvements such as infrastructure. 

The Rural category comprises properties sold in rural markets to buyers interested in the property for rural residential or recreational use. 

The Non-Strategic / Timberlands category includes: 1) sales of non-core timberlands that do not meet our strategic criteria, 2) sales of core timberlands for which we obtain attractive values, and 3) sales of properties to conservation interests that wish to preserve the land for habitat, public recreation, natural growth, buffer zones or other environmental purposes. 

In the fourth quarter of 2015, we added a fifth sales category entitled &#8220;Large Dispositions.&#8221; This category includes sales of timberland that exceed $20 million in size and do not have any identified HBU premium relative to timberland value. Previously, these sales were reported as Non-Strategic / Timberlands. All prior period amounts have been presented to reflect the revised sales categories. Proceeds from Large Dispositions will generally be used to fund capital allocation priorities, which could include share repurchases, debt repayment or acquisitions. Sales designated as Large Dispositions are excluded from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and CAD. See Item 7 &#8212; Performance and Liquidity &#32; Indicators &#32;for the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and CAD. 

We maintain a detailed land classification analysis for all of our timberland and HBU acres. The vast majority of our HBU properties are managed as timberland and generate cash flow from timber operations prior to their sale or, in the case of Improved Development properties, prior to improvement. 

Trading 

Our Trading segment reflects log trading activities in New Zealand and Australia conducted by our New Zealand JV. Our Trading segment complements the New Zealand Timber segment by providing added market intelligence, increasing the scale of export operations and achieving cost savings that directly benefit the New Zealand Timber segment. 

Trading activities are broadly categorized as either managed export services or procured logs. For managed export services, the New Zealand JV does not take title to the log cargo but arranges sales, shipping and export documentation services for other forest owners for an agreed commission. For procured logs, the New Zealand JV buys logs directly from other forest owners at New Zealand ports and exports them in its own name. Income from this business is generated by achieving a sales margin over the purchase price of the procured logs. The Trading segment generally utilizes a managed export service arrangement for logs sourced from third parties outside of New Zealand, and generally utilizes a procured log arrangement for logs sourced from third parties within New Zealand. For managed export services, Trading segment revenues reflect only the commission earned on the sale. For procured logs sales, Trading segment revenues reflect the full sales price of the logs. 

In 2015 , Trading volume was approximately 1.3 million cubic meters of logs. Approximately 590,000 cubic meters of logs were sourced from outside New Zealand, primarily Australia, of which 90% were undertaken through managed export service arrangements. Approximately 730,000 cubic meters of logs were purchased directly from third parties in New Zealand through procured log arrangements, with 54% purchased from two key suppliers. Approximately 53% of third-party purchases in New Zealand were purchased at spot prices, with the New Zealand JV thereby assuming some price risk on subsequent resale. The remaining 47% were purchased on a fixed margin basis, with the New Zealand JV thereby earning a spread on the resale price irrespective of subsequent price fluctuations. The New Zealand JV generally seeks to mitigate its risk of loss on procured logs by securing export orders prior to or concurrent with its spot purchases of logs. 

&#32;8 

Discontinued Operations and Dispositions 

In June 2014, we completed the tax-free spin-off of our Performance Fibers business. The spin-off resulted in two independent, publicly-traded companies, with the Performance Fibers business being spun off to Rayonier shareholders as a newly formed public company named Rayonier Advanced Materials Inc. ("Rayonier Advanced Materials"). On June 27, 2014, the shareholders of record received one share of Rayonier Advanced Materials common stock for every three common shares of Rayonier held as of the close of business on the record date of June 18, 2014. In March 2013, the Company sold its Wood Products business to International Forest Products Limited for $80 million plus a working capital adjustment. Accordingly, the operating results of the Performance Fibers and Wood Products business segments are reported as discontinued operations in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for all periods presented. Certain administrative and general costs historically allocated to the businesses that remained with Rayonier are reported in continuing operations. 

The December 31, 2014 Consolidated Balance Sheet reports only continuing operations and reflects the contribution of approximately $1.2 billion of assets and corresponding liabilities and equity to Rayonier Advanced Materials in connection with the spin-off of the Performance Fibers business. 

The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for 2014 and 2013 have not been restated to exclude Performance Fibers and Wood Products cash flows. Cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014 also reflect transactions related to the Performance Fibers spin-off, including borrowings to arrange the capital structure prior to the separation, proceeds received upon the spin-off and the use of proceeds to pay down debt and pay a special dividend. 

See Note 21 &#32;&#8212; Discontinued Operations &#32;for additional information regarding the spin-off of the Performance Fibers business and sale of the Wood Products business. 

Foreign Sales and Operations 

Sales from non-U.S. operations originate from our New Zealand Timber and Trading segments and comprised approximately 45% of consolidated 2015 &#32;sales. See Note 4 &#32;&#8212; Segment and Geographical Information &#32;for additional information. 

Competition 

Timber 

Timber markets in our Southern and Pacific Northwest regions are relatively fragmented. In the Southern region, we compete with Weyerhaeuser Company, CatchMark Timber Trust and TIMOs such as Hancock Timber Resource Group, Resource Management Service, Forest Investment Associates and Campbell Global, as well as numerous other large and small privately held timber companies. In the Pacific Northwest region, we compete with Weyerhaeuser Company, Hancock Timber Resource Group, Green Diamond Resource Company, Campbell Global, Port Blakely Tree Farms, Pope Resources, the State of Washington Department of Natural Resources and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In all markets, price is the principal method of competition. 

In New Zealand, there are four major private timberland owners &#8212; Hancock Natural Resources Group, Kaingaroa Timberlands, Matariki Forests (our New Zealand JV) and Ernslaw One. These owners account for approximately 36% of New Zealand planted forests. The New Zealand JV competes with these and other smaller New Zealand timber companies for supply into New Zealand domestic and export markets, predominantly China, South Korea and India. Logs supplied into Asian markets compete with export supply from both Russia and North America. 

Real Estate 

In our Real Estate business, we compete with other owners of entitled and unentitled properties. Each property has unique attributes, but overall quantity of supply and price for residential, commercial, industrial and rural properties in the geographic areas in which we operate are the most significant competitive drivers. 

Trading 

Our log trading operations are based out of New Zealand and performed by our New Zealand JV. The New Zealand market remains very competitive with over 20 entities competing for export log supply at different ports across the country. We are one of the larger log trading companies in the region with access to multiple export ports and a range of different export markets. 

Customers 

In 2015, no individual customer (or group of customers under common control) represented 10% or more of 2015 &#32;consolidated sales. As such, there is not a risk that the loss of one customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 

&#32;9 

Seasonality 

Across all our segments, results are normally not impacted by seasonal changes. However, particularly wet weather in areas of our Southern Timber operations can hinder access for harvesting, thereby temporarily reducing supply in the affected areas and generally strengthening prices. Conversely, extended dry weather in an area tends to suppress prices as timber is more accessible for harvesting. 

Environmental Matters 

See Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors and Note 22 &#32;&#8212; Liabilities for Dispositions and Discontinued Operations . 

Research and Development 

The research and development activities of our timber operations include genetic seedling improvement, growth and yield modeling, and applied silvicultural programs to identify management practices that will improve financial returns from our timberlands. We also contribute to research cooperatives that undertake forestry research and development. 

Employee Relations 

We currently employ approximately 325 people, of which approximately 240 are in the United States. We believe relations with our employees are satisfactory.
