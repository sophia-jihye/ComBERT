BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Our Company &#160; 

&#160; 

We are a customer-centric company that positions itself as a value-added, trusted partner in developing superior image solutions through our lighting, graphics, and technology capabilities. Our products and services include digital signage, screen graphics, and structural graphics capabilities, a wide variety of high quality indoor and outdoor lighting products, lighting control systems, and related professional services including engineering, installation, and project management. We also provide graphics and lighting products on a stand-alone basis. Our company is the leading provider of corporate visual image solutions to the petroleum / convenience store industry. We use this leadership position to penetrate national retailers and multi-site retailers, including quick service and casual restaurants, retail chain stores and automobile dealerships, located primarily in the United States as well as internationally. We seek to expand our market share in the traditional commercial / industrial lighting market by combining our LED product innovation and lighting control solutions utilizing the latest technology along with a strong emphasis on high service levels and market focused solutions. Our solutions are targeted at both renovation and new construction markets. We design and develop most aspects of the solid-state LED lighting, from the electronic circuit board, to the software to drive and control the LEDs, to the structure of the LED product. We also provide a variety of lighting control solutions which allow our customers to reduce energy and maintenance costs. In addition to designing and producing screen graphics and structural graphics, we design and produce most aspects of our digital signage offering where customers are provided a turnkey solution that includes design, software, hardware content development, implementation, service and support. 

&#160; 

We believe that national retailers and other companies in the markets we serve are increasingly seeking single-source suppliers with the project management skills and service expertise necessary to execute a comprehensive visual image program. The integration of our graphics, lighting, and technology coupled with our professional services capabilities allows our customers to outsource to us the development of an entire visual image program from the planning and design stage through installation. Our approach is to combine our lighting products and custom graphics applications utilizing the latest technology along with our professional service capabilities to create complete customer-focused visual image solutions. We also offer our lighting products and graphics elements on a stand-alone basis to service our existing image solutions customers, to establish a presence in a new market or to create a relationship with a new customer. We believe that our ability to combine lighting, graphics, and technology coupled with professional services into a comprehensive visual image solution differentiates us from our competitors who offer only stand-alone products for lighting or graphics and who lack professional services offerings. During the past several years, we have continued to enhance our ability to provide comprehensive corporate visual image solutions by adding additional graphics capabilities such as digital signage and media content management, wireless lighting control systems, new and innovative LED lighting products and professional services through acquisitions and internal development. 

&#160; 

Our focus on product development and innovation creates products that are essential components of our customers&#8217; corporate visual image strategy. Our spending on research and development was $5.5 million in fiscal 2016 and $5.6 million in fiscal 2015, and $8.2 million in fiscal 2014. We develop and manufacture lighting including solid-state LED lighting, lighting control systems, and graphics and distribute them through an extensive multi-channel distribution network that allows us to effectively service our target markets. Representative customers include BP, Chevron Texaco, 7-Eleven, ExxonMobil, Shell, Burger King, Dairy Queen, Taco Bell, Wendy&#8217;s, Best Buy, CVS Caremark, Phillips 66, Target Stores, Wal-Mart Stores, Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Nissan, and Toyota. We service our customers at the corporate, franchise and local levels. 

&#160; 

We also focus on the elimination of non-value added activities throughout our organization through the LSI Business System, a Lean Management System utilizing kaizen events and lean tools to drive continuous improvement in our processes. The LSI Business System improves shareholder value by increasing customer satisfaction and eliminating waste , both of which will improve the bottom line. We are committed to this company-wide initiative through employee education and training with the ultimate goal to make it part of the corporate culture and way of thinking of all employees.

&#160; $ 322,196 &#160; &#160; $ 307,857 &#160; &#160; $ 299,463 &#160; &#160;

&#160;

Lighting Segment &#160; 

&#160; 

Our Lighting Segment manufactures and markets outdoor and indoor lighting and lighting controls for the commercial, industrial and multi-site retail markets including the petroleum / convenience store, quick-service, and automotive markets. Our products are designed and manufactured to provide maximum value and meet the high-quality, competitively-priced product requirements of the markets we serve. We generally avoid specialty or custom-designed, low-volume products for single order opportunities. Our concentration is on our high-volume, standard product lines that meet our customers&#8217; needs. By focusing our product offerings, we achieve significant manufacturing and cost efficiencies. 

&#160; 

Our lighting fixtures, poles and brackets are produced in a variety of designs, styles and finishes. Important functional variations include types of mounting, such as pole, bracket and surface, and the nature of the light requirement, such as interior and exterior down-lighting, wall-wash lighting, canopy lighting, flood-lighting, area lighting and security lighting. Our engineering staff performs photometric analyses and wind load safety studies for all light fixtures and also designs our fixtures and lighting systems. Our lighting products utilize a variety of different light sources, with the primary light source being solid-state LED, along with high-intensity discharge and fluorescent. The major products and services offered within our lighting segment include: exterior area lighting, interior lighting, canopy lighting, landscape lighting, lighting controls, light poles, lighting system design, and photometric layouts. All of our products are designed for performance, reliability, ease of installation and service, as well as attractive appearance. The Company also has a focus on designing lighting system solutions and implementing strategies related to energy savings in substantially all markets served. 

&#160; 

We offer our customers expertise in developing and utilizing high-performance solid-state LED solutions, which when combined with the Company&#8217;s lighting fixture expertise and technology, has the potential to result in a broad spectrum of white light LED fixtures that offer equivalent or improved lighting performance with significant energy and maintenance savings as compared to the present metal halide and fluorescent lighting fixtures. 

&#160; 

Lighting Segment net sales of $226,889,000 in fiscal 2016 increased 3.2% from fiscal 2015 net sales of $219,920,000. The Lighting Segment&#8217;s net sales of light fixtures having solid-state LED technology totaled $155.5 million in fiscal 2016 (68.5% of total lighting net sales), representing a $24.1 million or 18.4% increase from fiscal 2015 net sales of solid-state LED light fixtures of $131.3 million (59.7% of total lighting net sales). There was a reduction in the Company&#8217;s traditional lighting sales (metal halide and fluorescent light sources) from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 as customers converted from traditional lighting to light fixtures having solid-state LED technology . 

&#160; 

Graphics Segment &#160; 

&#160; 

Our Graphics Segment manufactures and sells exterior and interior visual image elements related to signage and graphics, including integrated digital solutions. These products are used in graphics displays and visual image programs in several markets, including the petroleum / convenience store market and multi-site retail operations. Our extensive lighting and graphics expertise, product offering, visual image solution implementation capabilities and other professional services represent significant competitive advantages. We work with corporations and design firms to establish and implement cost effective corporate visual image programs to advance our customer&#8217;s brand. Increasingly, we have become the primary supplier of exterior and interior graphics for our customers. We also offer installation management services for those customers who require the installation of interior or exterior products (utilizing pre-qualified independent subcontractors throughout the United States). 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Our business can be significantly impacted by participation in a customer&#8217;s &#8220;image conversion program,&#8221; especially if it were to involve a &#8220;roll out&#8221; of that new image to a significant number of that customer&#8217;s and its franchisees&#8217; retail sites. The impact to our business can be very positive with growth in net sales and profitability when we are engaged in an image conversion program. This can be followed in subsequent periods by lesser amounts of business or negative comparisons following completion of an image conversion program, unless we are successful in replacing that completed business with participation in new image conversion programs of similar size with one or more customers. An image conversion program can potentially involve any or all of the following improvements, changes or refurbishments at a customer&#8217;s retail site: interior or exterior lighting (see discussion above about our lighting segment), interior or exterior store signage and graphics, and installation of these products in both the prototype and roll out phases of their program. 

&#160; 

The major products and services offered within our Graphics Segment include the following: signage and canopy graphics, pump dispenser graphics, building fascia graphics and ACM systems, decals, interior signage and marketing graphics, aisle markers, wall mural graphics, fleet graphics, prototype program graphics, and digital signage and media content management. Our Company also manages and executes the implementation of large rollout programs. 

&#160; 

Graphics Segment net sales of $77,039,000 in fiscal 2016 increased $12.1 million or 18.7% from fiscal 2015 net sales of $64,895 ,000. The $12.1 million increase in Graphics Segment net sales is primarily the net result of sales to the petroleum / convenience store market ($16.9 million net increase), sales to the national drug store market ($0.8 million decrease), sales to the quick-service restaurant market ($4.0 million net decrease), sales to the banking industry ($0.4 million decrease), sales to the retail grocery market ($1.7 million increase), and changes in volume to several other markets ($1.3 million decrease). The Graphics Segment net sales of graphic identification products that contain solid-state LED light sources and LED lighting for signage totaled $2.7 million in fiscal 2016, representing a $1.3 million increase from fiscal 2015 net sales of $1.4 million . 

&#160; 

Technology Segment &#160; 

&#160; 

Our Technology Segment designs, engineers, and manufactures electronic circuit boards, assemblies, lighting controls and large format solid state LED video displays. Applications for these products include , but are not limited to , OEM, transportation, commercial, industrial, entertainment, sports, and medical markets. This segment also has significant inter-segment sales to the Lighting Segment to support that segment&#8217;s customer sales of solid-state LED lighting and lighting controls . 

&#160; 

Technology Segment net customer sales of $18 ,268,000 in fiscal 2016 decreased 20.6% from fiscal 2015 net sales of $23,001 ,000. The $4.7 million decrease in Technology Segment net sales is primarily the net result of a $2.4 million decrease in sales to the transportation market, a $0.3 million decrease in sales to original equipment manufacturers, a $0.8 million decrease in sales to the medical markets, a $1.3 million decrease in sales to the sports market, and a $0.1 million net increase in sales to various other markets. The decrease in net customer sales is due to the cyclic nature of the markets the Company serves in this segment. While net customer sales decreased, the Technology Segment inter-segment sales increased $6.3 million or 21.5% . The increase in inter-segment sales is the direct result of the Lighting Segment&#8217;s increase in net sales of light fixtures having solid-state LED technology along with light fixtures with integrated controls. The Technology Segment&#8217;s intercompany support of electronic circuit boards and lighting control systems to the Lighting Segment is core to the strategic growth of the Company. The Technology Segment&#8217;s net sales of LED video screens were $0.7 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $2.3 million net sales of video screens in fiscal 2015. 

&#160; 

Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment &#160; 

&#160; 

There was no impairment of the Company&#8217;s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets in fiscal 2016 or 2015. 

&#160; 

Our Competitive Strengths &#160; 

&#160; 

Single Source Comprehensive Visual Image Solution Provider. We believe that we are the only company serving our target markets that combines significant graphics capabilities, lighting products and installation implementation capabilities to create comprehensive image solutions. We believe that our position as a single-source provider creates a competitive advantage over competitors who can only address either the lighting or the graphics component of a customer&#8217;s corporate visual image program. Using our broad visual image solutions capabilities, our customers can maintain complete control over the creation of their visual image programs while avoiding the added complexity of coordinating separate lighting and graphics suppliers and service providers. We can use high technology software to produce computer-generated virtual prototypes of a customer&#8217;s new or improved retail site image. We believe that these capabilities are unique to our target markets and they allow our customers to make educated, cost-effective decisions quickly. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Proven Ability to Penetrate Target Markets. We have grown our business by establishing a leadership position in many of the markets we serve, including petroleum / convenience stores, automobile dealerships and specialty retailers. Although our relationship with our customers may begin with the need for a single product or service, we leverage our broad product and service offering to identify additional products and solutions. We promote the combination of graphics, lighting, and technology, along with image element offerings, and services to create comprehensive solutions for our customers. 

&#160;

Focus on Product Innovation . We believe that our ability to successfully identify, develop and patent new products has allowed us to expand our market opportunity and enhance our market position. Our product innovation initiatives are designed to increase the value of our product offering by addressing the needs of our customers and target markets through retrofit enhancements to existing products or the development of new products. New product development includes developing an expanding portfolio of technology patents related to the design of LED based products. We believe our product innovation process creates value for our customers by producing products that offer energy efficiency, low maintenance requirements and long-term operating performance at competitive prices based upon the latest technologies available. 

&#160;

Strong Relationships with our Customers. We have used our innovative products and high-quality services to develop close, long-standing relationships with a large number of our customers. Many of our customers are recognized among the leaders in their respective markets, including customers such as Wal-Mart, BP, Phillips 66, Exxon Mobil, Carmax, Chevron, CVS Caremark, Stop &#38; Shop, and Burger King. Their use of our products and services raises the visibility of our capabilities and facilitates the acceptance of our products and services in their markets. Within each of these markets, our ability to be a single source provider of image solutions often creates repeat business opportunities through corporate reimaging programs. We have served some of our customers since our inception in 1976. 

&#160;

Well-capitalized Balance Sheet . As part of our long-term operating strategy, we believe the Company maintains a conservative capital structure. With a strong equity base, we are able to preserve operating flexibility in times of industry expansion and contraction. In the current business environment, a strong balance sheet demonstrates financial viability to our existing and targeted customers. In addition, a strong balance sheet enables us to invest in the company through research and development and allows the Company to invest in capital projects that support the Company&#8217;s growth. 

&#160;

Aggressive Use of Our Marketing Center. The capabilities of our Image Center, Innovation Center, Inspiration Center and, I-Zone Marketing Center provide us with a distinct competitive advantage to demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating graphics, lighting, and technology into a complete corporate visual image program. These four centers, which demonstrate the depth and breadth of our product and service offerings, have become an effective component of our sales process. 

&#160;

Maintain our Vertically Integrated Business Model. We consider our Company to be a vertically integrated manufacturer rather than just a product assembler. We focus on developing lighting and graphics products coupled with technology, and outsource certain non-core processes and product components as necessary. 

&#160; 

Commitment to Continuous Improvement . We are committed to a philosophy of continuous improvement through the LSI&#8217;s Business System which is a Lean Management System utilizing Kaizen events and lean tools to identify and eliminate waste and increase customer satisfaction with the ultimate goal to improve shareholder value. 

&#160;

Sales, Marketing and Customers &#160; 

&#160;

Sales: Our lighting products including lighting controls, are sold primarily throughout the United States, but also in Canada, Australia, and Latin America (about 5.9% of consolidated net sales are outside the United States) using a combination of regional sales managers and independent sales representatives exclusively serving primarily the commercial / industrial market along with several of the other markets we serve. Although in some cases we sell directly to national accounts, more frequently we are designated as a preferred vendor for product sales to customer-owned as well as franchised, licensed and dealer operations. Our graphics products, which in many instances are program-driven, are sold primarily through our own sales force. Our marketing approach and means of distribution vary by product line and by type of market. 

&#160;

Sales are developed through a wide variety of contacts such as, but not limited to, national retail marketers, branded product companies, franchise and dealer operations. In addition, sales are also achieved through recommendations from local architects, engineers, petroleum and electrical distributors and contractors. The Company utilizes the latest technology to track sales leads and customer quotes with the ultimate goals to turn these into orders from our customers. Our sales are partially seasonal as installation of outdoor lighting and graphic systems in the northern states decreases during the winter months. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Marketing: The capabilities of our Image Center, Innovation Center, Inspiration Center, and iZone Marketing Center are important parts of our sales process. These four centers, unique within the lighting and graphics industry, are facilities that can produce a computer-generated virtual prototype of a customer&#8217;s facility on a large screen through the combination of high technology software and audio/visual presentation. The i-Zone marketing center is a digitally controlled facility containing a large solid-state LED video screen and several displays that showcase our LED technology and LED products. With these capabilities, our customers can instantly explore a wide variety of lighting and graphics alternatives to develop consistent day and nighttime images. These centers give our customers more options, greater control, and more effective time utilization in the development of lighting, graphics and visual image solutions, all with much less expense than traditional prototyping. In addition to being cost and time effective for our customers, we believe that the capabilities of these marketing centers capabilities result in the best solution for our customers&#8217; needs. 

&#160;

The Image and iZone marketing centers also contain comprehensive indoor and outdoor product display areas that allow our customers to see many of our products and services in one setting. This aids our customers in making quick and effective lighting and graphic design decisions through hands-on product demonstrations and side-by-side comparisons. More importantly, these capabilities allow us to expand our customer&#8217;s interest from just a single product into other products and solutions. We believe that the capabilities of these centers have further enhanced our position as a highly qualified outsourcing partner capable of guiding a customer through image alternatives utilizing our lighting and graphics products and services. We believe this capability distinguishes us from our competitors and will become increasingly beneficial in attracting additional customers. 

&#160; 

In addition to the capabilities of our Image Center, Innovation Center, Inspiration Center, and iZone Marketing Center, the Company markets its products and service capabilities to end users in multiple channels through a broad spectrum of marketing and promotional methods, including direct customer contact, trade shows, on-site training, print advertising in industry publications, product brochures and other literature, as well as the internet and social media. 

&#160;

Manufacturing and Operations &#160; 

&#160;

We design, engineer and manufacture substantially all of our lighting and graphics products through a vertically integrated business model. By emphasizing high-volume production of standard product lines, we achieve significant manufacturing efficiencies. We periodically invest in new machinery and equipment utilizing the latest technology in order to leverage the manufacturing efficiencies gained from our high-volume production. When appropriate, we utilize alliances with domestic and international vendors to outsource certain products and components. LED products and related software are engineered, designed and final-assembled by the Company, while a portion of the manufacturing has been performed by select qualified vendors. We are not dependent on any one supplier for any of our component parts. 

&#160;

The principal raw materials and purchased components used in the manufacturing of our products are steel, aluminum, castings, fabrications, LEDs, power supplies, powder paint, steel and aluminum poles, wire harnesses, acrylic and glass lenses, inks, various graphics substrates such as foam board and vinyls, and digital screens. We source these materials and components from a variety of suppliers. Although an interruption of these supplies and components could disrupt our operations, we believe generally that alternative sources of supply exist and could be readily arranged. We strive to reduce price volatility in our purchases of raw materials and components through annual contracts with strategic suppliers. Our Lighting operations generally carry a certain level of sub-assemblies in inventory and relatively small amounts of finished goods inventory, except for certain products that are stocked to meet quick delivery requirements. Most often, lighting products are made to order and shipped shortly after they are manufactured. Our Graphics operations manufacture custom graphics products for customers who require us to stock certain amounts of finished goods in exchange for their commitment to that inventory. In some Graphics programs, customers also give us a cash advance for the inventory that we stock for them. The Company&#8217;s operations dealing with LED products generally carry LED and LED component inventory due to longer lead times. Our Technology Segment operations purchase electronic components from multiple suppliers and manufacture custom electronic circuit boards and lighting control systems. Most products are made to order and, as a result, these operations do not carry very many finished goods. 

&#160;

We currently operate out of ten manufacturing facilities and two sales/service/technology facilities in eight U.S. states. 

&#160;

&#160;

- 5 -

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Our Lighting Business operations received ISO 9001:2015 Certification thru ANAB (Cert# 5369-Eagle Registrations Inc.), with plans to seek additional certifications in future years. Our manufacturing operations are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental protection and occupational health and safety. We do not expect to incur material capital expenditures with regard to these matters and believe our facilities are in compliance with such regulations. 

&#160;

C ompetition 

&#160;

We experience strong competition in all segments of our business, and in all markets served by our product lines. Although we have many competitors, some of which have greater financial and other resources, we do not compete with the same companies across our entire product and service offerings. We believe product quality and performance, price, customer service, prompt delivery, and reputation to be important competitive factors. We also have several product and process patents which have been obtained in the normal course of business which provide a competitive advantage in the marketplace. 

&#160;

Additional Information &#160; 

&#160;

Our sales are partially seasonal as installation of outdoor lighting and graphic systems in the northern states lessens during the harshest winter months. We had a backlog of orders, which we believe to be firm, of $29.1 million and $33.8 million at June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. All orders are expected to be shippable or installed within twelve months. 

&#160;

We have 1,292 full-time employees and 186 agency employees as of June 30, 2016. We offer a comprehensive compensation and benefits program to most employees, including competitive wages, a cash-based incentive plan that is based upon the achievement of the Company&#8217;s business plan goals, a profit-sharing plan and retirement plan, and a 401(k) savings plan, a nonqualified deferred compensation plan (for certain employees), an equity compensation plan, and medical and dental insurance.
