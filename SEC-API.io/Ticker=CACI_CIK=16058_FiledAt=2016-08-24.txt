With revenue for the year ended June 30, 2016 (FY2016) of $3.7 billion, we serve customers in the U.S. federal government and commercial markets, primarily throughout North America and internationally on behalf of U.S. customers, as well as in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and the Netherlands. As a result of our diverse capabilities and customer mission understanding, many of our customer relationships have existed for over 20 years.

Our proven solutions and services and strong record of program delivery have enabled us to compete for and secure new customers and new contracts, win repeat business, and build and maintain long-term customer relationships. We seek competitive business opportunities and have built our operations to support major programs through a market-focused business development organization.

Our primary customers are agencies and departments of the U.S. government. Our information solutions and services support national security missions and government modernization/transformation for intelligence, defense, and federal civilian customers. The demand for our solutions and services, in large measure, is created by the increasingly complex network, systems, and information environments in which governments and businesses operate, and by the need to stay current with emerging technology while increasing productivity, enhancing security, and, ultimately, improving performance.

&#160;

International Operations 

Our international operations are conducted primarily through our operating subsidiaries in Europe, CACI Limited and CACI BV, and account for substantially all revenue generated from international customers and 66.1 percent of our commercial revenue. Headquartered in London, our international operations provide a diverse mix of IT services and proprietary data and software products, serving commercial and government customers throughout the U.K., continental Europe and around the world. The organization operates in three addressable markets: marketing solutions, social services and network services.

Competition

We operate in a highly competitive industry that includes many firms, some of which are larger in size and have greater financial resources than we do. We obtain much of our business on the basis of proposals submitted in response to requests from potential and current customers, who may also receive proposals from other firms. Additionally, we face indirect competition from certain government agencies that perform services for themselves similar to those marketed by us. We know of no single competitor that is dominant in our fields of technology. We have a relatively small share of the available worldwide market for our solutions and services and intend to achieve growth and increase market share both organically and through strategic acquisitions.

Strengths and Strategy

We offer substantially our entire range of solutions and services and proprietary products to defense, intelligence and civilian agencies of the U.S. government. Our work for U.S. government agencies may combine a wide range of skills drawn from our solutions, services and product offerings. We also contract through our international operations to supply solutions, services and/or products to governments of other nations. As with other government contractors, our business is subject to government customer funding decisions and actions that are beyond our control.

Although we are a supplier of proprietary computer-based technology products and marketing systems products, we are not primarily focused on being a software product developer-distributor (see discussion following under &#8220;Patents, Trademarks, Trade Secrets and Licenses&#8221;).

Our international commercial customer base consists primarily of large enterprises in the U.K. This market is the primary target of our proprietary marketing systems software, and database products and consultancy services. Commercial bids are frequently negotiated as to terms and conditions for schedule, specifications, delivery and payment.

In order to effectively perform on our existing customer contracts and secure new customer contracts within the U.S. government, we must maintain expert knowledge of agency policies, operations and challenges. We combine this comprehensive knowledge with significant expertise in the design, integration, development and implementation of advanced information solutions and services. This capability provides us with opportunities either to compete directly for, or to support other bidders in competition for multi-million dollar and multi-year award contracts from the U.S. government.

We have strategic business relationships with a number of companies associated with the information technology industry. These strategic partners have business objectives compatible with ours and offer products and services that complement ours. We intend to continue development of these kinds of relationships wherever they support our growth objectives.

Our marketing and new business development is conducted by many of our officers and managers including the Chief Executive Officer, executive officers, vice presidents and division managers. We employ marketing professionals who identify and qualify major contract opportunities, primarily in the federal government market.

Much of our business is won through submission of formal competitive bids. Government and commercial customers typically base their decisions regarding contract awards on their assessment of the quality of past performance, responsiveness to proposal requirements, price, and other factors. The terms, conditions and form of contract of government bids, however, are in most cases specified by the customer. In situations in which the customer-imposed contract type and/or terms appear to expose us to inappropriate risk or do not offer us a sufficient financial return, we may seek alternate arrangements or opt not to bid for the work. Essentially all contracts with the U.S. government, and many contracts with other government entities, permit the government customer to terminate the contract at any time for the convenience of the government or for default by the contractor. Although we operate under the risk that such terminations may occur and have a material impact on operations, such terminations have been rare and, generally, have not materially affected operations.

&#160;

Our contracts and subcon tracts are composed of a wide range of contract types, including firm fixed-price, cost reimbursement, time-and-materials (T&#38;M), indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) and government wide acquisition contracts (known as GWACS) such as General Servi ces Administration (GSA) schedule contracts. By company policy, significant fixed-price contracts require the approval of at least two of our senior officers. 

At any one time, we may have over two thousand separate active contracts and/or task orders. In FY2016, the top ten revenue-producing contracts, many of which consist of many task orders, accounted for 29.6 percent of our revenue, or $1.1 billion.

In FY2016, 93.5 percent of our revenue came from U.S. government prime contracts or subcontracts consisting of 65.1 percent from DoD contracts and 28.4 percent from U.S. government civilian agency customers.

Industry Trends

The federal government is a large and sophisticated user of information technology. The nation&#8217;s expenditures on military, homeland security, and intelligence operations are substantially larger than those of any of its allies or adversaries.

The Budget Control Act of 2011 (the BCA) established limits on discretionary spending, reducing planned defense spending by a minimum of $487 billion over a 10 year period that began at the end of the government&#8217;s Fiscal Year 2012. In addition, the BCA included a sequester mechanism that imposed additional defense cuts of $500 billion, or approximately 9 percent over nine years starting in the government&#8217;s Fiscal Year 2013 if the Congress did not identify a means to reduce the U.S. deficit by $1.2 trillion. Because these means were not identified, the sequester mechanism took effect in March 2013. 

Since the beginning of sequestration in March 2013, there have been three laws enacted that have extended the automatic direct spending reductions beyond the government&#8217;s FY2021. &#160; As a result of the agreement to end a shutdown of the U.S. Government in October 2013, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (BBA 2013), signed into law in December 2013, revised the amount of discretionary spending to be sequestered for the government&#8217;s FY2014 and FY2015, and included an extension of the sequestration process applied by the BCA to the government&#8217;s FY2022 and FY2023. In February 2014, as part of an act to exempt from the BCA the retirement pay of members and former members of the Armed Forces under the age of 62 before the start of 2014, the sequestration process was extended to the government&#8217;s FY2024. At the end of October 2015, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 2015) was signed into law, increasing the defense and non-defense discretionary spending caps as enacted by the BCA by $25 billion each in the government&#8217;s FY2016 and $15 billion each in the government&#8217;s FY2017. This law further extended the automatic direct spending reductions from the government&#8217;s FY2024 through FY2025. If there are no changes to at least the discretionary spending levels set by the BCA for the government&#8217;s FY2018, full sequestration of defense and non-defense spending will return on October 1, 2017.

In light of the BCA, the provisions of the BBA 2015, and deficit reduction pressures, discretionary spending by the federal government continues to be constrained and is expected to be so at least through the government&#8217;s FY2025. Even with the reduced amount of sequestration for the government&#8217;s Fiscal Year 2016, we experienced the impact of sequestration on contracts and task orders we hold and delays in the awarding of contracts on which we have bid. We expect this trend to continue into the government&#8217;s Fiscal Year 2017, beginning on October 1, 2016.

The sequester mechanism, if left unmodified beyond the government&#8217;s Fiscal Year 2017, along with other pressures on government spending, are negatively impacting our business and could have further negative impacts on us in the future. We may experience disruption of existing programs, delays in contract awards, and other actions, including partial or complete contract terminations.

During our FY2016, we continued to take steps to make sure our cost structure is in line with our expectations of future business opportunities, given the challenging environment for companies in our industry. We believe we are well positioned to win new business in the market areas we focus on, where the government is expected to continue to spend while constrained by sequestration.

&#160;

We believe that the following trends will impact the federal government&#8217;s future spending on the types of services we provide: 

&#9679; 

Market Opportunities

&#160;

&#8211; 

Government Wide Market Opportunities &#8211; As federal government agencies seek to make spending reductions, opportunities to achieve cost reductions through improved operational efficiency will receive higher priority. Many IT initiatives emerging in both DoD and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directed programs for civilian agencies are based on infrastructure consolidation and cost effective upgrades. These initiatives include infrastructure modernization, adoption of innovative commercial applications, and increased use of commercially provided infrastructure.

We continue to expect to see a steady stream of funding for transformational activities that yield results in a shorter timeframe to maximize investments with more stable and predictable information system outcomes. As the amount of data and information grows, and persistent threats to our national security continue, the demands for applications will grow as well, putting a higher value on faster and more efficient/effective technologies. We expect this demand to result in an increasing need for rapid deployment of cyber solutions, cloud computing, mobile applications, and data analytics. An additional area of cyber emphasis is the security of the supply chain. While technology provides part of the answer, the integration of processes and personnel using forward-looking systems and sound architectures is more likely to provide cost savings and performance efficiencies.

&#160;

&#8211; 

National Security Market Opportunities 

&#160;

&#167; 

Counterterrorism, counter proliferation, cyber security, and counterintelligence are at the immediate forefront of U.S. security concerns and they are all inextricably linked. Additionally, man-made and natural disasters are routinely addressed by applying the military and civilian resources of the U.S. 

&#160;

&#167; 

The world is increasingly interconnected and interdependent. Instability can arise quickly and spread rapidly beyond borders. This phenomenon is readily apparent in events in the Pacific Rim, the Middle East and North Africa. As the U.S. reduces its conventional defense forces, as expected, the need for intelligence and surveillance of potential adversaries of all types will continue or grow. 

&#160;

&#167; 

It is likely that the Middle East will continue to be unstable for the foreseeable future. In addition to this, a strategic shift toward Asia-Pacific is being executed to address rising issues in this area of the globe. This shift will create opportunities as well as threats as the contractor community adapts to the changing needs of Defense, Intelligence, Homeland Security, State, and U.S. partners. 

&#160;

&#167; 

Russian aggression in the Baltics and continued instability in North Korea will likely influence defense posture and intelligence requirements. It is likely that there will be changing needs relative to these areas as well in the near-future. 

&#160;

&#167; 

Funding to support the use of military and intelligence assets, particularly special operating forces, to combat these threats is expected to remain stable or increase slightly. 

&#160;

&#167; 

Logistics and force protection operations will continue. We anticipate a continuing need to re-set and modernize equipment and infrastructure. 

&#160;

&#8211; 

Non-Security Market Opportunities 

&#160;

&#167; 

The intersection of law enforcement and intelligence is expected to continue to create opportunities supporting the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, and State. 

&#9679; 

As budgets are revised to better support system upgrades and enhanced services for the non-combat warfighter, increasing competitive pressures from large, platform-centric aerospace firms and traditional original equipment manufacturing companies are anticipated. Non-traditional players have entered the market and have established positions related to such areas as cloud computing, cyber, satellite operations, business systems and healthcare IT.

&#9679; 

As companies strive to expand by increasing market share, there is increasing competition for acquisition candidates. Niche players in cyber, healthcare and data analytics are in particularly high demand.

&#9679; 

The government has mandated changes to the manner in which it purchases goods and services. The aspects of this mandate that are most relevant to us are as follows:

&#160;

&#8211; 

The use of time and material and sole-source contracts is now greatly reduced. The use of award fees is diminishing. In addition, more scrutiny is being placed on the amount of fee bid on cost reimbursable type contracts.

&#160;

&#8211; 

Multiple award contract vehicles are being used at an increasing rate. Bidding and winning these types of contracts does not assure that revenue will follow since task-order based work solicited under the vehicle is also competed.

&#160;

&#160;

&#8211; 

T he increased engagement by competition advocates maximizes the use of multiple-source, continuously competitive contracts. &#160;

&#160;

&#8211; 

Fees for subcontract management are being limited to reflect actual value provided, i.e., risk assumed by prime and continuous subcontractor risk reduction.

&#160;

&#8211; 

In many cases, periods of performance on task orders are being limited to two years and periods for contracts are being limited to four years.

&#160;

&#8211; 

Size thresholds for small business have been revised upward so as to include businesses that currently exceed revenue thresholds.

&#160;

&#8211; 

The government&#8217;s management of cash may slow the timing of payment of our invoices.

Recent Acquisitions

During the past three fiscal years, we completed a total of seven acquisitions, including:

&#160;

&#9679; 

On March 1, 2016, CACI Limited acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Stream:20 Limited and was integrated into the international operating segment. Stream:20 Limited provides digital marketing and digital transformation consultancy services to commercial companies working in a variety of sectors.

&#160;

&#9679; 

On March 1, 2016, CACI Limited acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Purple Secure Systems Limited and was integrated into the international operating segment. Purple Secure Systems Limited is a provider of agile systems and software for national security, defense and government organizations.

&#160;

&#9679; 

On February 1, 2016, the Company acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of L-3 National Security Solutions, Inc. and L-3 Data Tactics Corporation (together, &#8220;NSS&#8221;). NSS is a prime mission partner to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), U.S. government intelligence agencies, and U.S. federal civilian agencies. The acquisition will expand CACI&#8217;s opportunities in many of our key market areas and expand our current customer base.

&#160;

&#9679; 

On December 4, 2015, the Company acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of a business in the United States which provides security technology services and was integrated into the domestic operating segment.

&#160;

&#9679; 

On July 1, 2015, CACI Limited acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Rockshore Group Ltd (Rockshore) and was integrated into the international operating segment. Rockshore uses its expertise in data aggregation, event processing, and business logic integration to provide real-time event processing and situational awareness to the telecom, aviation, and rail sectors.

&#160;

&#9679; 

The April 1, 2015 acquisition of LTC Engineering Associates, Inc., a provider of highly specialized technical engineering solutions and services to the intelligence and DoD communities in the areas of software engineering, cybersecurity, signals intelligence, communications intelligence, and digital signals processing.

&#160;

&#9679; 

The November 15, 2013 acquisition of Six3 Systems, Inc. (Six3), a provider of highly specialized support to the national security community in the areas of cyber and signals intelligence; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; and intelligence operations.

Seasonal Nature of Business

Our business in general is not seasonal, although the summer and holiday seasons affect our revenue because of the impact of holidays and vacations on our labor and on product and service sales by our international operations. Variations in our business also may occur at the expiration of major contracts until such contracts are renewed or new business is obtained.

The U.S. government&#8217;s fiscal year ends on September 30 of each year. It is not uncommon for government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the weeks before the end of a fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended funds. Moreover, in years when the U.S. government does not complete the budget process for the next fiscal year before the end of September, government operations whose appropriations legislation has not been signed into law are funded under a continuing resolution that authorizes them to continue to operate but traditionally does not authorize new spending initiatives.

&#160;

CACI Employment and Benefits 

Our employees are our most valuable resource. We are in continuing competition for highly skilled professionals in virtually all of our business areas. The success and growth of our business is significantly correlated with our ability to recruit, train, promote and retain high quality people at all levels of the organization. For these reasons, we endeavor to maintain competitive salary structures, incentive compensation programs, fringe benefits, opportunities for growth, and individual recognition and award programs. Fringe benefits are generally consistent across our subsidiaries, and include paid vacations, sick leave and holidays; medical, dental, disability and life insurance; tuition reimbursement for job-related education and training; and other benefits under various retirement savings and stock purchase plans. 

We have published policies that set high standards for the conduct of our business. We require all of our employees, independent contractors working on customer engagements, officers, and directors annually to execute and affirm to the code of ethics applicable to their activities. In addition, we require annual ethics and compliance training for all of our employees to provide them with the knowledge necessary to maintain our high standards of ethics and compliance.

Patents, Trademarks, Trade Secrets and Licenses

Generally, our solutions and services are not substantially dependent upon obtaining or maintaining intellectual property protections, although our operations make use of such protections and benefit from them as discriminators in competition. We own a limited number of patents and claim copyright, trademark and other proprietary rights in a variety of intellectual property, including each of our proprietary computer software and data products and the related documentation. We also maintain a number of trade secrets that contribute to our success and competitive distinction and endeavor to accord such trade secrets protection adequate to ensure their continuing availability to us.

Our proprietary information is protected through a combination of contractual arrangements with our employees and third parties and intellectual property laws. From time to time, we are required to assert our rights against former employees or other third parties who attempt to misappropriate our proprietary and confidential information. Although we are not materially dependent on the protection of our intellectual property, we take such matters seriously and pursue claims against such individuals to the extent necessary to adequately protect our rights.

As a systems integrator, it is important that we maintain access to software, data and other products supplied by third parties and we continue to enter into agreements that give us the right to distribute and receive income from third party software, data and other products that serve our customers. The durations of such agreements are negotiated and vary according to the terms of the agreements.

Backlog

During the fourth quarter of FY2016, in conjunction with preparing for the new accounting standard ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , we have reviewed our backlog processes and definitions, and reviewed both our funded and unfunded backlog balances. As part of that review, we have reduced our backlog associated with a number of programs and changed our reporting process going forward. In a number of cases, we received awards or funding, but due to changes in government priorities and programs, we never realized the full value of those awards, and the period of performance for them had lapsed. Given the low likelihood of us realizing revenue in these instances, we decreased our unfunded backlog by $2.1 billion and funded backlog by $400.0 million. At the end of June, our total backlog inclusive of these one-time adjustments was $11.0 billion, and our funded backlog was $2.3 billion, inclusive of these adjustments. Total backlog increased by $1.4 billion, a 14.7 percent increase from June 30, 2015 of $9.6 billion. We presently anticipate, based on current revenue projections, that the majority of the funded backlog as of June 30, 2016 will result in revenue during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017. 

Our backlog represents the aggregate contract revenue we have the potential to earn over the remaining life of our contracts. Funded backlog is based upon amounts appropriated by a customer for payment for goods and services and as the U.S. government operates under annual appropriations, agencies of the U.S. government generally fund contracts on an incremental basis. As a result, the majority of our estimated remaining contract value is not funded backlog. The process used to compile remaining contract values are based on the underlying contract documents. There is no assurance that all funded or potential contract value will result in realized revenue. Funded and unfunded backlog is subject to change from execution of new contracts, contract modifications or extensions, associated purchase orders not being placed, government deobligations, contract completions as periods of performance expire, or early terminations.
