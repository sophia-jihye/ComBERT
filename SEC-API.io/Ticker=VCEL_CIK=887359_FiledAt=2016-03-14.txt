General Information 

&#160; 

Vericel Corporation is a leader in developing patient-specific expanded cellular therapies for use in the treatment of patients with severe diseases and conditions. We market two autologous cell therapy products in the United States: Carticel&#174; (autologous cultured chondrocytes), an autologous chondrocyte implant for the treatment of cartilage defects in the knee, and Epicel&#174; (cultured epidermal autografts), a permanent skin replacement for the treatment of patients with deep-dermal or full-thickness burns comprising greater than or equal to 30 percent of total body surface area (TBSA). We are also developing MACI&#8482;, a third-generation autologous chondrocyte implant for the treatment of cartilage defects in the knee, and ixmyelocel-T, a patient-specific multicellular therapy for the treatment of advanced heart failure due to ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). 

&#160; 

The following table summarizes our product portfolio and product candidate pipeline: 

&#160; 

Acquisition of Sanofi&#8217;s CTRM Business 

&#160; 

On May 30, 2014, we completed the acquisition of the Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine (CTRM) business of Sanofi, a French soci&#233;t&#233; anonyme &#160;(Sanofi), certain assets, including all of the outstanding equity interests of Genzyme Biosurgery ApS (now known as Vericel Denmark ApS), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sanofi, and over 250 patents and patent applications of Sanofi and certain of its subsidiaries, and assumed certain liabilities for purposes of acquiring the portion of the CTRM business, which researches, develops, manufactures, markets and sells Carticel, MACI and Epicel. 

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

Our objective is to become the leading cell therapy and regenerative medicine company by developing, manufacturing and marketing best-in-class therapies for patients with significant unmet medical needs that require the repair and regeneration of damaged tissues and organs. 

&#160; 

To achieve this objective, we intend to: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Fully integrate the acquired commercial stage CTRM business and improve efficiencies to reduce redundancies and related costs, as well as take advantage of complementary technology platforms; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Increase the operating income from the U.S. Carticel and Epicel business and become profitable without raising additional equity capital unless required for additional strategic transactions or other events; 

&#8226; 

Lower the manufacturing costs for Carticel through an improved ratio of Carticel unit sales to biopsies as well as other efficiencies; 

&#8226; 

Assess and capitalize on opportunities to increase revenue from Carticel and Epicel in the U.S.; 

&#8226; 

Develop and execute on a regulatory strategy for the approval of MACI in the U.S.; 

&#8226; 

Expand Epicel usage in the severely burned patient segment by increasing sales and marketing resources; 

&#8226; 

Capitalize on our recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to label Epicel for use in pediatric patients and the related determination from the FDA that Epicel meets the criteria to be sold for profit; and 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Initiate and complete our pivotal phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of the orphan indication, advanced heart failure due to ischemic DCM, and evaluate potential strategic collaborations. 

&#160; 

Our Products 

&#160; 

We believe that our acquired CTRM business has been a pioneer in the development and commercialization of autologous cell therapies. The CTRM portfolio includes three autologous cell therapy products: Carticel (autologous cultured chondrocytes), a first-generation product for autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) currently marketed in the U.S., Epicel (cultured epidermal autografts), a permanent skin replacement for full thickness burns in adults and pediatrics with greater than or equal to 30% of TBSA, also currently marketed in the U.S, and MACI (matrix-applied characterized autologous cultured chondrocytes), a third-generation ACI product approved in Europe and for which a Biologics License Application (BLA) is under review by the FDA. Our product candidate portfolio also includes ixmyelocel-T, a patient-specific multicellular therapy currently in development for the treatment of advanced heart failure due to ischemic DCM. 

&#160; 

Background of Cartilage Defects 

&#160; 

Damage to cartilage in the knee can occur from acute trauma or repetitive trauma from playing sports, exercising, working or performing everyday activities. When damaged, cartilage in the knee does not usually heal on its own. If left untreated, cartilage defects can progress and lead to degenerative joint disease, osteoarthritis and potentially require total knee replacement, a poor option for younger and more active patients. 

&#160; 

For patients diagnosed with cartilage defects, there are several treatment options, including arthroscopic debridement/chondroplasty, marrow stimulation techniques such as microfracture, a minimally invasive procedure that can be performed during the initial arthroscopic procedure, osteochondral autografts for smaller cartilage injuries, allografts, and autologous chondrocyte implants for larger injuries. 

&#160; 

Carticel 

&#160; 

Carticel, a first-generation ACI product for the treatment and repair of cartilage defects in the knee, is the first and currently the only FDA-approved autologous cartilage repair product. Carticel is indicated for the repair of symptomatic cartilage defects of the femoral condyle (medial, lateral or trochlea) caused by acute or repetitive trauma, in patients who have had an inadequate response to a prior arthroscopic or other surgical repair procedure such as debridement (the removal of damaged or defective cartilage), microfracture (the creation of tiny fractures in the bone to encourage new cartilage development, drilling/abrasion arthroplasty), or osteochondral allograft/autograft (transferring cartilage from one joint to another). Carticel received a BLA approval in 1997 and is currently marketed in the U.S. It is generally used on patients with larger lesions (greater than 3 cm 2 ). 

Carticel is implanted by orthopedic surgeons after obtaining a cartilage biopsy during an initial arthroscopic procedure. The patient&#8217;s chondrocytes, which are the cells that produce cartilage, are isolated and expanded in a manufacturing process compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). During a second surgical procedure, the cells are implanted in the cartilage defect under a sutured periosteal flap, where they produce new hyaline cartilage. The therapeutic advantage of this approach 

relative to other approaches, such as microfracture, is that the autologous chondrocytes produce the hyaline cartilage that is naturally present in the knee, rather than fibrous cartilage which lacks durability and the wear characteristics of hyaline cartilage. 

&#160; 

The Study of the Treatment of Articular Repair (STAR) was designed to determine the safety and efficacy of Carticel in patients who had an inadequate response to a prior cartilage repair procedure. Completed in 2005, this FDA post-approval commitment was a four-year, prospective, multicenter study of 154 patients at 29 participating sites. In a clinically challenging population comprised of patients who suffered moderate-to-large chondral defects and who failed at least one prior surgical cartilage repair treatment, Carticel demonstrated long-term durability up to four years and statistically significant and clinically meaningful reductions in pain and improvement in function. 

&#160; 

Market Opportunity for Carticel 

&#160; 

In the U.S. annually, there are approximately 1 million arthroscopic procedures and more than 250,000 cartilage surgical procedures. In addition, approximately 50,000 have full thickness defects greater than 2 cm 2 . Patients seek retreatment for the repair of larger, symptomatic femoral condyle cartilage defects caused by acute or repetitive trauma. In our experience, patients are often frustrated by recurring symptoms, as they tend to be young, active and motivated to return to a high level of activity. 

&#160; 

Typical initial cartilage surgical procedures include chondroplasty (debridement) and/or microfracture. These two procedures account for 98% of all cartilage surgical procedures. Although initial microfracture results demonstrate pain score improvement generally, only patients with Class 1, or the smallest, defects do not experience deterioration after 18 months. Patients seeking retreatment account for about 2.5% of the cartilage surgical repair market and often receive either allograft, autograft or ACI. Treatment with Carticel provides an opportunity to replace the damaged cartilage with native hyaline cartilage. 

&#160; 

In the U.S., the orthopedic physician target audience is very concentrated, with 60% of the current Carticel business originating from approximately 110 physicians. Our target audience is a group of physicians who self-identify as or have the formal specialty of sports medicine physicians. We believe this target audience is approximately 450 physicians. We currently have a 21 person field force calling on these sports-injury targeted orthopedic physician audience. Most private payers have a medical policy that allows treatment with Carticel. The 15 largest payers have a formal medical policy for Carticel, representing 132 million covered lives. 

&#160; 

In the year ended December 31, 2015 , approximately 1,050 Carticel implants were performed, which generated net revenues of approximately $35.2 million . Carticel revenue is subject to seasonal fluctuations with stronger sales occurring in the fourth quarter and second quarter due to a number of factors including insurance copay limits and the time of year patients prefer to start rehabilitation. Over the last five years, the percentage of annual sales by quarter has ranged as follows: first quarter, 20% to 24%; second quarter, 24% to 26%; third quarter, 21% to 23%; and fourth quarter, 29% to 33%. 

&#160; 

Epicel 

&#160; 

Epicel (cultured epidermal autografts) is a permanent skin replacement for full thickness burns greater than or equal to 30% of TBSA. Epicel is currently the only FDA-approved autologous epidermal product available for large total surface area burns. Currently, fewer than 100 patients are treated with Epicel in the U.S. each year. In the year ended December 31, 2015 , net revenues were $15.2 million &#32;for Epicel. 

&#160; 

Epicel is produced by isolating and expanding keratinocytes, which are the predominant cell type in the epidermis or outer layer of the skin, obtained from a small biopsy of a patient&#8217;s healthy skin. Epicel is an important treatment option for patients with severe burns because these patients are generally understood to need a keratinocyte-based epithelium and there is very little skin, which is the only other source of keratinocyte-based epithelium, available for autografts for these patients. 

&#160; 

Epicel is a cell-based product that is regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) under medical device authorities. Epicel was designated as a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD) in 1998 and a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) application for the product was submitted in 1999. HUDs are devices that are intended for diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 4,000 individuals annually in the United States. Under an HDE approval, a HUD cannot be sold for an amount that exceeds the cost of research and development, fabrication and distribution unless certain conditions are met. 

A HUD is eligible to be sold for profit after receiving HDE approval if the device meets the following eligibility criteria: 

&#8226; 

The device is intended for the treatment or diagnosis of a disease or condition that occurs in pediatric patients or in a pediatric subpopulation, and such device is labeled for use in pediatric patients or in a pediatric subpopulation in which the disease or condition occurs; or 

&#8226; 

The device is intended for the treatment or diagnosis of a disease or condition that does not occur in pediatric patients or that occurs in pediatric patients in such numbers that the development of the device for such patients is impossible, highly impracticable or unsafe. 

If the FDA determines that a HUD meets the eligibility criteria, the HUD is permitted to be sold for profit as long as the number of devices distributed in any calendar year does not exceed the annual distribution number (ADN). The ADN is defined as the number of devices reasonably needed to treat, diagnose or cure a population of 4,000 individuals per year in the United States. The holder of the HDE must immediately notify FDA if the number of devices distributed during a calendar year exceeds the ADN. 

&#160; 

On February 18, 2016, the FDA approved our HDE supplement to revise the labeled indications of use to specifically include pediatric patients and to add pediatric labeling. The revised product label also now specifies that the probable benefit of Epicel, mainly related to survival, was demonstrated in two Epicel clinical experience databases and a physician-sponsored study comparing outcomes in patients with massive burns treated with Epicel relative to the standard care. Due to the change in the label to include use in pediatric patients, Epicel is no longer subject to the HDE profit restrictions. In conjunction with meeting the pediatric eligibility criteria, the FDA has determined that the ADN for Epicel is 360,400 devices. 

&#160; 

Market Opportunity for Epicel 

&#160; 

Each year in the U.S., more than 40,000 people are hospitalized for burns. More than 2,000 of these patients are treated for burns covering more than 30% of their TBSA, the labeled indication for Epicel. Of these patients, approximately 100 patients were treated with Epicel in 2015. Currently, the mortality rate for this group is approximately 34%, partially due to the lack of healthy tissue from which to harvest autografts. Although age can vary, the typical Epicel patient is young and has suffered full thickness burns due to occupational, household or auto accidents, trash burning with gasoline, inappropriate use of space heaters or carelessness with flammable materials. Many of the most severely burned patients are medivac transported to one of the 128 specialized burn centers across the U.S. While the average acute care hospital has less than 3 admissions for burns annually, these specialized burn centers average over 200 admissions per year. 

Relative to clinical need, we believe Epicel is underutilized due to lack of consistent promotional effort and burn center support. We expect Epicel&#8217;s utility to grow as commercial and regulatory efforts are appropriately dedicated to the product and providers. In 2014, a single sales representative supported Epicel in 2014, and in 2015, we expanded our Epicel sales force to four. 

Epicel revenue is subject to seasonal fluctuations mostly associated with the use of heating elements during the colder months, with stronger sales occurring in the winter months of the first and fourth quarters, and weaker sales occurring in the hot summer months of the third quarter. However, in any single year, this trend can be absent due to the extreme variability inherent with Epicel&#8217;s low patient volume of approximately 100 patients per year. Over the last five years, the percentage of annual sales by quarter has ranged as follows: first quarter, 27%; second quarter, 25%; third quarter, 20%; and fourth quarter, 28%. The variability between the same quarters in consecutive years has been as high as 10% of the annual volume. While the number of patients treated per year remains low, we expect these large swings in revenue in some quarters to continue. 

&#160; 

MACI 

&#160; 

MACI, is a third-generation ACI product for the treatment of focal chondral cartilage defects in the knee. MACI received marketing authorization in Europe in June 2013 by meeting the requirements of the Advanced Therapy and Medicinal Product (ATMP) guidelines based on the results of the SUMMIT trial in which MACI was manufactured at, and supplied from, the Cambridge, Massachusetts site. MACI has been commercially available in the EU since 1998. As part of the June 2014 restructuring, we temporarily suspended the marketing of MACI as of September 2014 primarily due to low utilization and an unfavorable pricing environment. The timing and strategy for a possible reintroduction in select EU countries have not yet been determined. We believe that MACI has significant revenue potential in the U.S., if approved and reimbursed. On March 4, 2016, the FDA accepted the company&#8217;s BLA seeking approval to market MACI as an autologous cellular treatment for symptomatic cartilage defects of the knee. The FDA provided a PDUFA (Prescription Drug User Fee Act) goal date of January 3, 2017. In addition, the FDA communicated that it is not currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application. 

&#160; 

Similar to Carticel, during an initial surgical procedure, a surgeon obtains a biopsy of healthy cartilage from the patient and the chondrocytes are isolated, expanded and uniformly seeded onto a bioabsorbable Type I/III collagen membrane to form the autologous implantation. MACI is manufactured in a cGMP manufacturing facility. Unlike Carticel, MACI is implanted during a mini-arthrotomy in which the implant is trimmed to the size of the defect and fixed in the defect with fibrin glue and without sutures. 

&#160; 

The pivotal clinical trial supporting MACI registration in Europe, Superiority of MACI Implant to Microfracture Treatment (SUMMIT), was completed in 2012. Analysis of this 144 patient superiority study demonstrated that there is a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the co-primary endpoint of pain and function for those patients treated with a MACI implant compared to microfracture which was the current standard of care. 

&#160; 

MACI was obtained via the acquisition by Genzyme Corporation, a subsidiary of Sanofi, of Verigen AG (Verigen) in 2005. As part of its acquisition of Verigen, Genzyme Corporation agreed to make cash payments to Verigen upon the achievement of developmental milestones relating to regulatory and commercialization of MACI in the United States. In connection with our acquisition of the CTRM business, we agreed that if we further developed MACI in the U.S., we would be obligated to pay these milestone payments. In the third quarter of 2014, at the request of the Company, Sanofi entered into a settlement agreement with the former shareholders of Verigen whereby these shareholders agreed to discharge all obligations related to these MACI milestone payments in exchange for a one-time cash payment of &#8364;2.5 million (approximately $3.2 million). We accrued the liability in the third quarter of 2014 and paid the amount in full in October 2014. This agreement was reached in full settlement of any and all potential obligations to Verigen related to future MACI developmental milestones. 

&#160; 

Market Opportunity for MACI 

&#160; 

MACI, if introduced in the U.S., should both replace Carticel and expand the market since we believe MACI shares the advantages of Carticel, while being less invasive, shortening procedure time, eliminating the need for a periosteal harvest and having a lower frequency of subsequent surgical interventions. 

&#160; 

Marrow Donation 

&#160; 

In December 2015, we ceased operations at our bone marrow collection center located in San Diego, California (operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary Marrow Donation, LLC). 

&#160; 

Ixmyelocel-T Technology Platform 

&#160; 

In 2015, our preapproval stage portfolio also included ixmyelocel-T, a unique patient-specific multicellular therapy derived from an adult patient&#8217;s own bone marrow, which utilized our proprietary, highly automated and scalable manufacturing system. Our proprietary cell manufacturing process significantly expands the mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and M2-like anti-inflammatory macrophages in the patient&#8217;s bone marrow mononuclear cells while retaining many of the hematopoietic cells. These cell types are known to regulate the immune response and play a key role in tissue repair and regeneration by resolving pathologic inflammation, promoting angiogenesis, and remodeling ischemic tissue. We believe the novelty and advantage of using ixmyelocel-T is the expansion of a unique combination of cell populations, including MSCS and M2-like macrophages, which secrete a distinct combination of angiogenic and regenerative factors, and possess the ability to remain anti-inflammatory in the face of inflammatory challenge. 

&#160; 

MSCs and M2-like macrophages have a wide range of biological activities that promote repair and regeneration of damaged tissues through the paracrine effects of their secreted factors, as well as their direct cell activities. These cells produce high levels of potent anti-inflammatory and angiogenic factors, as well as factors involved in extracellular matrix remodeling. These cells also have direct activities such as phagocytosis of cellular debris and apoptotic cells, which control the inflammatory response, uptake of LDL and removal of cholesterol, and remodeling of extracellular matrix. 

&#160; 

The following illustration summarizes the multiple biological activities of ixmyelocel-T that promote repair and regeneration of ischemic tissue: 

Studies examining the impact of ixmyelocel-T on human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro &#32;demonstrate the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors, enhanced migration of endothelial cells following injury, increased endothelial cell proliferation, and branch formation. Treatment with ixmyelocel-T in a rat model of hind limb ischemia in vivo &#32;resulted in significantly increased blood flow perfusion and capillary density, gene expression and plasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine. Our studies demonstrate that ixmyelocel-T brings to bear a dynamic combination of angiogenic and anti-inflammatory effects, which facilitate ischemic tissue repair. 

&#160; 

Ixmyelocel-T has several features that we believe are primarily responsible for success in treating adult patients with severe ischemic cardiovascular diseases such as advanced heart failure due to ischemic DCM: 

&#8226; 

Patient-specific (autologous) &#32; &#8212; We start with the patient&#8217;s own cells, which are accepted by the patient&#8217;s immune system, allowing the cells to integrate into existing functional tissues. We believe that this characteristic of our therapy eliminates both the risk of rejection and the need to use immunosuppressive therapy pre- or post-therapy. Our data also suggests that ixmyelocel-T may provide the potential for long-term engraftment and tissue repair. 

&#8226; 

Expanded &#32; &#8212; We begin with a small amount of bone marrow from the patient (up to 60 ml) and significantly expand the number of certain cell types, primarily MSCs and M2-like anti-inflammatory macrophages, to a substantially greater number than are present in the patient&#8217;s own bone marrow (up to 200 times the number of certain cell types compared with the starting bone marrow). 

&#8226; 

Multicellular &#32; &#8212; We believe the multiple cell types in ixmyelocel-T, which are normally found in bone marrow but in smaller quantities, possess the key functions required for reducing chronic inflammation and promoting angiogenesis and tissue repair. By reducing inflammation, we believe that ixmyelocel-T provides the ideal conditions to allow for the growth of new tissue and blood vessels. 

&#8226; 

Minimally invasive &#32; &#8212; Our procedure for collecting bone marrow can be performed in an out-patient setting and takes approximately 15 minutes. Administration of ixmyelocel-T for the treatment of advanced heart failure due to ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy is performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory using a cell injection catheter system in a one-time procedure. Bone marrow and bone marrow-derived therapies have been used safely and efficaciously in medicine for over three decades. Ixmyelocel-T leverages this body of scientific study and medical experience, and appears well tolerated in over 200 patients treated to date. 

&#160; 

Ixmyelocel-T Clinical Development Programs 

&#160; 

Our clinical development program is focused on addressing severe, chronic ischemic cardiovascular disease, an area of high unmet medical need. We have completed our Phase 1/2 clinical trials in DCM, and on March 10, 2016 we announced that our Phase 2b ixCELL-DCM study, which is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial for patients with advanced heart failure due to ischemic DCM, had met its primary endpoint of reduction in clinical cardiac events and that ixmyelocel-T has comparable incidence of adverse events, including serious adverse events, relative to patients in the placebo group. 

Ixmyelocel-T has been granted a U.S. Orphan Drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of DCM. We also have an ixmyelocel-T investigator-initiated clinical study for the treatment of craniofacial reconstruction, for which we expect results by the first half of 2016, and we have conducted clinical studies for the treatment of CLI. 

&#160; 

Heart Failure Due to Dilated Cardiomyopathy 

&#160; 

Heart failure represents a significant unmet medical need and a growing public health problem. The American Heart Association reports that there are approximately six million patients currently suffering from heart failure in the United States and an estimated 550,000 new cases in the U.S. each year. Current medical costs to treat these patients exceed $25 billion and this is expected to more than triple to nearly $80 billion by 2030 as a result of a growing patient population and the high cost of the limited treatment alternatives for advanced heart failure patients, as described below. 

&#160; 

DCM is a leading cause of heart failure and of heart transplantation in the United States. DCM is a disease characterized by weakening of the heart muscle, thinning of the heart walls, enlargement of the heart chambers, and the inability to sufficiently pump blood throughout the body. Patients with DCM typically present with symptoms of congestive heart failure, including limitations in physical activity and shortness of breath. Ischemic DCM is associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and prior heart attacks and is the most common form of dilated cardiomyopathy. Patient prognosis depends on the stage and cause of the disease, but is typically characterized by a very poor quality of life and a high mortality rate. 

&#160; 

Current treatments for ischemic DCM patients that are refractory to further medical therapy such as prescription drugs, devices, and/or further revascularization procedures including bypass surgery and angioplasty, are limited to heart transplantation and placement of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). There are less than 2,500 heart transplantations in the United States each year. Many refractory DCM patients are not eligible for heart transplantation and transplants are extremely expensive at an estimated cost of approximately $1 million. LVADs are also expensive at an estimated cost of over $175,000 and have a mortality rate of 50% at two years. 

&#160; 

We believe that the refractory ischemic DCM market represents a substantial market opportunity for ixmyelocel-T. These refractory ischemic DCM patients are currently the target patient population for our clinical development of ixmyelocel-T. The estimated incidence of DCM is 148 cases per 100,000 persons, or 444,000 patients. The more severe or refractory (NYHA Class III/IV) ischemic DCM patient population is difficult to estimate, but we believe it to be approximately one third of the overall DCM population. Ixmyelocel-T has been granted a U.S. Orphan Drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of DCM, which we believe provides the potential for an efficient and cost-effective path to approval for ixmyelocel-T in this heart failure indication. 

&#160; 

We have conducted two Phase 2a multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical studies in patients with ischemic DCM and nonischemic DCM investigating surgical (IMPACT-DCM) and catheter-based (Catheter-DCM) delivery of ixmyelocel-T. Sixty-one patients were randomized, and of those, 59 received treatment in the phase 2a studies. We reported 12-month data for the surgical IMPACT-DCM study at the Heart Failure Society of America meeting in September 2011 and final 12-month results from the Catheter-DCM study at the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) 2012 Scientific Sessions. The results have also been published in the journal Circulation Research in August of 2014. Results from these studies demonstrated that ixmyelocel-T was well-tolerated in patients with DCM. In the Catheter-DCM study and post-surgery in the IMPACT-DCM study, the incidence of adverse events was comparable between the ixmyelocel-T groups and the control groups. 

&#160; 

While these exploratory Phase 2a studies were not powered for determining differences in efficacy between treatment groups, there were consistent trends of clinically meaningful improvement in clinical endpoints observed in the ischemic DCM groups in both studies. In these studies, fewer ischemic patients treated with ixmyelocel-T experienced a MACE during follow up compared to control patients, representing greater than 50% reduction in the number of patients having a MACE event. A similar benefit was not seen in the non-ischemic patients. Heart failure exacerbation was the most common MACE. In the combined ischemic DCM groups across both studies, MACE were experienced by a lower percentage of ixmyelocel T-treated patients compared to control patients, representing greater than 50% reduction in the number of patients having a MACE event. Likewise, patients in the combined ischemic DCM groups that were treated with ixmyelocel-T had a reduction in the average number of MACE events per patient. MACE is the recommended endpoint (mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations) in Phase 3 heart failure studies as stated in the FDA 2009 Somatic Cell Therapy for Cardiac Diseases Draft Guidance. Consistent positive trends also were observed in several secondary efficacy measures in the ischemic DCM groups. The majority of ixmyelocel-T-treated patients with ischemic DCM, but not control patients, had statistically significant improvement in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class that was sustained over the 12 months following treatment. Improvement in NYHA Class is considered clinically meaningful. Additionally, a higher percentage of ixmyelocel T-treated ischemic DCM patients showed a clinically meaningful improvement in self-reported quality of life and a statistically significant increase in six-minute walk distance compared to the ischemic DCM control patients. Since the initiation of the trial, 28 clinical trial sites have treated 114 patients. 

We completed enrolling and treating patients in our completed Phase 2b ixCELL-DCM study in February, 2015. Patients were followed for 12 months for the primary efficacy endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events, defined as all-cause deaths, all-cause hospitalizations, and unplanned outpatient or emergency department visits for IV treatment of acute worsening heart failure. On March 10, 2016, we announced the trial had met its primary endpoint of reduction in clinical cardiac events and that the incidence of adverse events, including serious adverse events, in patients treated with ixmyelocel-T was no greater than in patients in the placebo group. Patients are now being followed for an additional 12 months for safety. Because the trial met the primary endpoint, patients who had been assigned to the placebo group or randomized to ixmyelocel-T in the double-blind portion of the trial but did not receive ixmyelocel-T will be offered the option to receive treatment. 

&#160; 

Production 

&#160; 

Cell Manufacturing and Cell Production Components 

&#160; 

Our cell-manufacturing facility is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is used for U.S. manufacturing and distribution of Carticel, Epicel manufacturing and worldwide distribution and also manufactured MACI for the SUMMIT study conducted for approval in Europe and for a small number of MACI implants following suspension of sales in the EU. The Cambridge facility also houses our research and development function, which is responsible for process development, release assay development, and technology transfers between sites and departments. 

&#160; 

We also operate a centralized cell manufacturing facility in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The facility supports the current open label extension of the ixCELL-DCM clinical trial being conducted in the United States and Canada and we believe it has sufficient capacity, with minor modifications, to supply our Phase 3 trial and limited initial commercialization requirements. To treat a significant portion of the United States ischemic DCM patient population we will need to establish and operate larger commercial-scale cell manufacturing facilities. We have reached agreement with the FDA on Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control (CMC) which was completed as part of the Special Protocol Assessment process with the FDA for the Phase 3 REVIVE clinical trial. 

&#160; 

Our ixmyelocel-T patient-specific multicellular therapies are manufactured using our proprietary Aastrom Replicell System (ARS) cell manufacturing system. Our manufacturing process is conducted in a highly-automated, fully-closed and rigorously controlled system. Our system is modular and thus both highly scalable and reproducible and is located in a 5,000-square-foot centralized manufacturing facility in Ann Arbor, Michigan. We believe the ARS based production is conducted under cGMP requirements of the FDA and has a current annual capacity to treat up to 1,500 patients. Upon approval we can scale-up to meet demand simply by adding additional ARS modules into existing and new clean rooms. 

&#160; 

We have established relationships with various third parties who manufacture and/or supply certain components, equipment, disposable devices and other materials used in our cell manufacturing process to develop our cell products, as well as our final assemblies, component parts, subassemblies and associated spare parts used in the instrumentation platform of our cell production system. 

&#160; 

In October 2010, we entered into a contract manufacturing and supply agreement (Supply Agreement) with ATEK Medical, LLC (ATEK) for the manufacture of our proprietary cell cassette for use in our manufacturing process. In November 2011, ATEK was purchased by Vention Medical, Inc. (Vention) and currently operates as a division of Vention. There were no changes to the terms of the Supply Agreement as a result of this purchase. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the terms of the Supply Agreement, we have granted Vention the exclusive right to manufacture our proprietary cell cassette, which includes assembly, labeling, packaging and sterilization. Vention is responsible for obtaining all of our approved components pertaining to the cassettes and we are obligated to order and purchase the cassettes from Vention on an agreed upon schedule and in agreed upon quantities. In addition, we provided Vention with reasonable engineering support to initiate and ramp up manufacturing of the cassettes and expect to supply all manufacturing equipment. We are in the process of renegotiating a longer term supply agreement with Vention. 

&#160; 

Research &#38; Development 

&#160; 

The bulk of our ongoing research and development activities are focused on exploring methods that improve our ability to efficiently manufacture high quality cell therapy products for patients. We have performed an in depth analysis of the cell culture processes used in the manufacture of Epicel, Carticel, and ixmyelocel-T, and have identified several areas for their potential betterment. Therefore, our research and development program is focused on the many facets of process development for all of our products including, but not limited to, tissue procurement and processing, cell culture surface and media modification, and other process efficiencies. 

&#160; 

The bulk of our ongoing research is based on ixmyelocel-T, our unique multicellular product produced from a patient&#8217;s bone marrow using our proprietary manufacturing system. We have demonstrated in the laboratory that the cells in our therapy are capable of multiple biological activities thought to play a critical role in repairing diseased and damaged tissues. These activities include aspects of tissue remodeling, promotion of angiogenesis and resolution of inflammation. In addition to these properties demonstrated in vitro , we have also shown that the therapy increases blood perfusion in both rat and mouse models of CLI. We have conducted preclinical studies designed to further characterize the mechanism of action of our product in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases as well as explore other potential disease states which may benefit from the use of ixmyelocel-T. 

&#160; 

In addition, our proprietary cell manufacturing system has demonstrated the capability to produce other types of cells. In the future, we may continue to explore the application of our manufacturing technology for the production of other cell types where there are potential opportunities to collaborate in the development of new cell therapies. 

&#160; 

Patents and Proprietary Rights 

&#160; 

Our success depends in part on our ability, and the ability of our licensors, to obtain patent protection for our products and processes. 

&#160; 

As part of the acquired CTRM business, we acquired a multinational intellectual property estate. The intellectual property estate includes patents and patent applications directed to chondrocyte implants and related technologies. Although we do not own any patents or patent applications relating to Epicel, many of the processes and techniques are trade secrets and would be difficult to replicate without significant investment and time. We do own issued patents directed to the combinations of chondrocytes and collagen membranes used in MACI, which are scheduled to expire in August of 2016 in the U.S. and in August of 2017 abroad. When these patents expire, our opportunity to establish or maintain product revenue could be substantially reduced or eliminated. See &#8220; Risk Factors - Risks Related to Intellectual Property &#8221; below for additional information. In certain foreign countries, selected patent rights covering Carticel are scheduled to expire in 2022. 

&#160; 

We also own a broadly filed trademark portfolio with registrations for Carticel, MACI, and Epicel. 

&#160; 

The processes and technologies related to ixmyelocel-T include 3 issued United States patents. These patents are material patents that protect our cellular therapy. 

Certain patent equivalents to the United States patents have also been issued in other jurisdictions including Australia, Japan, and Canada, and under the European Patent Convention. Our most significant patent that protects the composition of the cellular therapy directly, &#8220;Mixed cell populations for tissue repair and separation technique for cell processing&#8221; (U.S. Patent 7,871,605), was issued in January 2011 and will expire in 2029. A divisional application of 7,871,605 (U.S. Patent 8,158,122) for administration of this composition to patients was issued in April 2012 and will expire in 2027. A second divisional application of 7,871,605 (U.S. Patent 8,394,631) directed to the methods of manufacture of our cell compositions was issued in March 2013 and will expire in 2027. In addition, we have 2 pending United States patent applications and equivalent applications in certain other countries claiming other aspects of our cell products and manufacturing processes. We own all of these patents, Patents that protected our automated bioreactor device and culture system expired in 2015, but we will continue to rely on trade secrets and un-patentable know-how. 

&#160; 

In 2007, the use of ixmyelocel-T for the treatment of DCM received an Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA, which provides seven years of market exclusivity, should ixmyelocel-T receive FDA approval for this indication. The validity and breadth of claims in medical technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, may be highly uncertain. No assurance can be given that any patents based on pending patent applications or any future patent applications by us, or our licensors, will be issued, that the scope of any patent protection will exclude competitors or provide competitive advantages to us, that any of the patents that have been or may be issued to us or our licensors will be held valid if subsequently challenged or that others will not claim rights in or ownership of the patents and other proprietary rights held or licensed by us. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that others have not developed or will not develop similar products, duplicate any of our products or design around any patents that have been or may be issued to us or our licensors. Since patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until they are published 18 months after filing, we also cannot be certain that others did not first file applications for inventions covered by our and our licensors&#8217; pending patent applications, nor can we be certain that we will not infringe any patents that may be issued to others on such applications. 

&#160; 

We rely on certain licenses granted by a number of third parties, including Sanofi and the University of Michigan for certain patent rights. If we breach such agreements or otherwise fail to comply with such agreements, or if such agreements expire or are otherwise terminated, we may lose our rights in such patents. 

&#160; 

We also rely on trade secrets and un-patentable know-how that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, contractors, manufacturers, outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual&#8217;s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific limited circumstances. We also require signed confidentiality or material transfer agreements from any company that is to receive our confidential information. In the case of employees, consultants and contractors, the agreements generally provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as the exclusive property of Vericel. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets or un-patentable know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. 

&#160; 

Our success will also depend in part on our ability to develop additional commercially viable products without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We do not believe any of our approved products or our currently contemplated products or processes infringe any existing valid issued patent. However, the results of patent litigation are unpredictable, and no assurance can be given that patents do not exist or could not be filed which would have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products or maintain our competitive position with respect to our products. If our technology components, designs, products, processes or other subject matter are claimed under other existing United States or foreign patents, or are otherwise protected by third-party proprietary rights, we may be subject to infringement actions. In such event, we may challenge the validity of such patents or other proprietary rights or we may be required to obtain licenses from such companies in order to develop, manufacture or market our products. There can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain such licenses or that such licenses, if available, could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, the failure either to develop a commercially viable alternative or obtain such licenses could result in delays in marketing our proposed products or the inability to proceed with the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are required to defend ourselves against charges of patent infringement or to protect our proprietary rights against third parties, substantial costs will be incurred regardless of whether we are successful. Such proceedings are typically protracted with no certainty of success. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and force us to curtail or cease our development and sale of our products and processes. 

&#160; 

Certain of our licensors&#8217; research has been funded in part by the Department of Commerce and by a Small Business Innovation Research Grant obtained from the Department of Health and Human Services. As a result of such funding, the United States government has certain rights in the technology developed with such funding. These rights include a non-exclusive, fully paid-up, worldwide license under such inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition, the United States government has the right to require us to grant an exclusive license under any of such inventions to a third party if the United States government determines that: (i) adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize such inventions; (ii) such action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs; or (iii) such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations. Additionally, under the federal Bayh-Dole Act, a party which acquires an exclusive license for an invention that was partially funded by a federal research grant is subject to the following government rights: (i) products using the invention which are sold in the United States are to be manufactured substantially in the United States, unless a waiver is obtained; (ii) the government may force the granting of a license to a third party who will make and sell the needed product if the licensee does not pursue reasonable commercialization of a needed product using the invention; and (iii) the United States government may use the invention for its own needs. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

Both our marketed and development stage products are specialty products with focused physician and institutional call points. The U.S. Carticel commercial organization is comprised of approximately 28 employees, including Cell Therapy Specialists and Regional Sales Directors. The target audience is a small (well under 1,000) set of sports medicine orthopedic surgeons. We expect to utilize the same sales force for MACI. 

&#160; 

Reimbursement coverage for Carticel is widespread. The 15 largest payers, representing approximately 98% of commercial lives, have a formal medical policy that allows treatment with Carticel within labeled indications. These 15 plans represent approximately 132 million covered lives and include the top five national plans&#8212;WellPoint, United Healthcare, Aetna, CIGNA and Humana. 

&#160; 

US Bioservices Corporation (USB) is the exclusive distributor of Carticel in the United States. USB purchases and takes title to Carticel upon shipment of the product. USB works with the payers on behalf of patients and surgeons to ensure medical coverage and to obtain reimbursement for Carticel implantation procedures. We retain all responsibility for shipment of the product to the 

surgical suite and may have certain indemnification obligations to USB. By mid-year 2016 we expect to improve our distributor model through an extensive request for proposal process, which includes USB. 

&#160; 

Sales of Epicel are supported by four Cell Therapy Specialists. This represents an expansion over past support levels. Since there are approximately 128 specialized burn centers in the U.S. increasing coverage to the majority of the target audience should be feasible with only a small number of incremental Cell Therapy Specialists. 

&#160; 

If and when ixmyelocel-T is approved, we anticipate augmenting our existing sales and marketing organization to cover the expanded physician audience. The target physician population will likely be heart failure specialists and interventional cardiologists in secondary and tertiary cardiac facilities, a specialty audience which can be covered by a modest sized sales force. However, we intend to explore other options, including partnerships, to help minimize costs and increase penetration if and when the product is commercialized. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Our research and development activities and the manufacturing and marketing of our products are subject to the laws and regulations of governmental authorities in the United States and other countries in which our products will be marketed. Specifically, in the United States, the FDA regulates drugs, biologics and medical devices and requires new product approvals or clearances to assure safety and effectiveness of these products. Governments in other countries have similar requirements for testing and marketing. In the United States, in addition to meeting FDA regulations, we are also subject to other federal laws, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the Environmental Protection Act, as well as certain state laws. 

&#160; 

While some human cell or tissue products that are intended for implantation, transplantation, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient are regulated as human cell, tissue, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps) and do not require the FDA&#8217;s premarket review, if these cell or tissue products do not meet the FDA&#8217;s requirements for regulation as an HCT/P they require premarket review and a marketing authorization. The type of marketing authorization required depends on how the product is regulated by the FDA. With the exception of Epicel (a medical device), our cell products are regulated as biological products that require an approved BLA to be marketed in the U.S. Commercial production of these products needs to occur in FDA-registered facilities in compliance with cGMP requirements for biologics. Epicel is a humanitarian use medical device that has an approved HDE application. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Process 

&#160; 

The FDA regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) and the Public Health Service Act, and their implementing regulations. Obtaining approval of a BLA for new biological products is a lengthy process leading from development of a new product through preclinical and clinical testing. This process takes a number of years and the expenditure of significant resources. There can be no assurance that our product candidates will ultimately receive approval. 

&#160; 

The FFDCA and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern the research, testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record-keeping, approval, distribution, use, adverse event reporting, advertising and promotion of our products. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in civil penalties, recall, injunction or seizure of products, refusal of the government to approve our product approval applications or to allow us to enter into government supply contracts, withdrawal of previously approved applications and criminal prosecution. 

&#160; 

Product Approval 

&#160; 

In order to obtain FDA license, or approval of, a new biological product, sponsors must submit proof of safety, purity and potency, or effectiveness. In most cases, such proof entails extensive nonclinical, also known as preclinical studies in animal models and well-controlled clinical trials in human subjects. The testing, preparation of necessary applications and processing of those applications by the FDA is expensive, may take several years to complete and could have an uncertain outcome. The FDA regulatory review and approval process is complex and can result in request for additional data, increase development cost, time to market delays, or preclude us from bringing to market new products. The FDA may also require post-marketing studies and risk-management plans as condition to approval. These requirements will add to the cost of regulatory compliance and the cost to sell our products, due to complex distribution and restricted commercial operations. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with applicable regulations is not maintained or if safety issues are identified during routine safety monitoring following commercialization. For patented technologies, product development and the regulatory review/ approval process can materially reduce the period during which we will have the exclusive right to exploit such technologies. Regulatory exclusivity may offer some additional protection. 

Adequate and well-controlled clinical studies are required by the FDA for approval of a BLA. To conduct a clinical trial the study sponsor is required to submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application including the study protocol prior to commencing human clinical trials. The submission must be supported by data, typically including the results of nonclinical, manufacturing and laboratory testing. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), and GMP requirements. Long term nonclinical testing, such as animal reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, is conducted if warranted and is submitted to the IND to support a future BLA. Following the initial submission of the IND, the FDA has 30 days to review the application and raise safety and other clinical trial issues. If questions or objections are not raised within that period, the clinical trial may commence according to the investigational protocol submitted to the FDA and following Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals for each of the clinical sites where the study will be conducted. Protocol amendments need to be submitted and approved by FDA prior to implementation. We have submitted several INDs for our cell products, and we have conducted clinical trials under these INDs. 

Carticel, MACI and ixmyelocel-T are regulated by the FDA as biologics. For products that are regulated as biologics, the FDA requires: (i) nonclinical animal testing to establish a starting dose for initiation of clinical trials in humans; (ii) submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective prior to the initiation of human clinical trials; (iii) adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency, or effectiveness, of the product for its intended use; (iv) submission to the FDA of a BLA; and (v) review and approval of the BLA as well as pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility by the FDA. 

For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Phase 1&#8212;The biological product is initially tested for safety and tolerability. In the case of biological products and those for severe or life-threatening diseases, the initial human testing is generally conducted in patients. These trials may also provide early evidence on effectiveness. 

&#8226; 

Phase 2&#8212;These trials are conducted in a limited number of subjects in the target population to determine a safe and effective dosage to evaluate in Phase 3 and to identify possibly related adverse effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 

&#8226; 

Phase 3&#8212;Phase 3 trials are undertaken to provide evidence of clinical efficacy and to further evaluate dosage, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. Phase 3 studies are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the product has been obtained, and are intended to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and labeling. 

&#160; 

Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials may be required by the FDA as a condition of approval and are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. The FDA has express statutory authority to require post-market clinical trials to address safety issues. All of these trials must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practice (GCP) requirements in order protect the health and safety of human subjects and for the data to be considered reliable for regulatory purposes. 

&#160; 

During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the IND. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events; any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects; or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor&#8217;s initial receipt of the information. 

&#160; 

Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully or within any specified period, or at all. Regulatory authorities, a data safety monitoring board or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 

&#160; 

Our ongoing and planned clinical trials for our product candidates may not begin or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial; 

&#8226; 

Reaching agreement with third-party clinical trial sites and their subsequent performance in conducting accurate and reliable trials on a timely basis; 

&#8226; 

Obtaining IRB approval to conduct a trial at a prospective site; 

&#8226; 

Recruiting patients to participate in a trial; and 

&#8226; 

Obtaining supply of the biological product. 

&#160; 

Typically, if a biological product is intended to treat a chronic disease, safety and efficacy data must be gathered over an extended period of time, which can range from six months to three years or more. Success in early stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. 

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with the use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency, and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

After completion of the required clinical testing, a BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA review and approval of the BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The BLA must include the results of all nonclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the quality and manufacture of the product, including, chemistry, manufacture, and controls, to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency, or efficacy, of the product based on these results. The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most BLAs is subject to an application user fee, as well as annual product and establishment user fees, which may total several million dollars and are increased annually. 

The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency&#8217;s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of BLAs. Most such applications for standard review biologics are reviewed within ten months from the date the application is accepted for filing. Although FDA often meets its user fee performance goals, the FDA can extend these timelines as warranted. FDA review goals are to review 90 percent of BLA&#8217;s within 10 months. The FDA usually refers applications for novel biologics, or biologics which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee-typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts-for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one, or more, clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it verifies that compliance with requirements for cGMP is satisfactory and the BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the biologic is safe, pure and potent, or effective, for the intended use. 

For certain products, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with the Good Tissue Practices (GTPs). These are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products (HCT/Ps), which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. To assure GMP, GTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control. 

After the FDA evaluates the BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter means that the BLA will not be approved in its present form and generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission. Complete responses may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval 

letter. The FDA&#8217;s regulations provide that the agency will review such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. The FDA approval is never guaranteed, and the FDA may refuse to approve a BLA if the regulatory requirements are not satisfied. 

An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. The approval for a biologic may be significantly more limited than requested in the application, including limitations on the specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. The FDA may also require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, as a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to help ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (ETASU). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS or use of a companion diagnostic with a biologic can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the biologic. Moreover, product approval may require, as a condition of approval, substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the biologic&#8217;s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 

Under current requirements, facilities manufacturing biological products for commercial distribution must be registered with the FDA. To accomplish this, an establishment registration must be filed with the FDA. In addition to the preclinical studies and clinical trials, the BLA includes a description of the facilities, equipment and personnel involved in the manufacturing process. A biologics license, which is the product&#8217;s approval, is granted on the basis of inspections of the applicant&#8217;s facilities in which the primary focus is on compliance with cGMP and the ability to consistently manufacture the product in the facility in accordance with the BLA. If the FDA finds the results of the inspection unsatisfactory, it may decline to approve the BLA, resulting in a delay in production of products. 

Humanitarian Device Exemption 

&#160; 

Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either a substantial equivalence determination under a premarket notification submission pursuant to Section 510(k) of the FFDCA, or an approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). The FDA provides an incentive for the development of certain devices intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects or is manifested in fewer than 4,000 individuals in the United States per year. These devices receive a HUD designation and may be eligible for marketing approval under an HDE application. An HDE application is a premarket approval application that seeks an HDE from the effectiveness requirement that would otherwise apply to the application. FDA approval of an HDE application authorizes the applicant to market the device. 

&#160; 

To obtain approval for a HUD, an HDE application is submitted to the FDA. An HDE application is similar in both form and content to a PMA application in that the applicant must demonstrate a reasonable assurance of safety, but in an HDE application, the applicant seeks an exemption from the PMA requirement of demonstrating a reasonable assurance of effectiveness. An HDE application is not required to contain the results of scientifically valid clinical investigations demonstrating that the device is effective for its intended purpose. The application, however, must contain sufficient information for the FDA to determine that the device does not pose an unreasonable or significant risk of illness or injury, and that the probable benefit to health outweighs the risk of injury or illness from its use, taking into account the probable risks and benefits of currently available devices or alternative forms of treatment. Additionally, the applicant must demonstrate that no comparable devices are available to treat or diagnose the disease or condition, and that they could not otherwise bring the device to market. 

&#160; 

Except in certain circumstances, HUDs approved under an HDE cannot be sold for an amount that exceeds the costs of research and development, fabrication, and distribution of the device (i.e., for profit). Under the current HDE provision, as amended by FDASIA, a device is eligible to be sold for profit after receiving HDE approval if the device is intended for the treatment or diagnosis of a disease or condition that occurs in pediatric patients or in a pediatric subpopulation, and such device is labeled for use in pediatric patients or in a pediatric subpopulation in which the disease or condition occurs; or is intended for the treatment or diagnosis of a disease or condition that does not occur in pediatric patients or that occurs in pediatric patients in such numbers that the development of the device for such patients is impossible, highly impracticable, or unsafe. If the FDA makes a determination that a HUD meets the eligibility criteria, the HUD is permitted to be sold for profit after receiving HDE approval as long as the number of devices distributed in any calendar year does not exceed the ADN for the device. The holder of the HDE must immediately notify the FDA if the number of devices distributed during a calendar year exceeds the ADN. The ADN is determined by the FDA when the agency approves the original HDE application; or when the agency approves an HDE supplement for an HDE approved before the enactment of FDASIA if the HDE holder seeks a determination for the HUD in an HDE supplement based upon the profit-making eligibility criteria, and the FDA determines that the HUD meets the eligibility criteria. 

&#160; 

Regulation of Combination Products in the United States 

Certain products may be comprised of components that would normally be regulated under different types of regulatory authorities and frequently by different centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. Specifically, under regulations issued by the FDA, a combination product may be: 

&#8226; 

A product comprised of two or more regulated components that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity; 

&#8226; 

Two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products; 

&#8226; 

A drug, or device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, or device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or 

&#8226; 

Any investigational drug, or device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect. 

Under the FFDCA, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. That determination is based on the &#8220;primary mode of action&#8221; of the combination product. Thus, if the primary mode of action of a device-biologic combination product is attributable to the biologic product, the FDA center responsible for premarket review of the biologic product would have primary jurisdiction for the combination product. The FDA has also established an Office of Combination Products to address issues surrounding combination products and provide more certainty to the regulatory review process. That office serves as a focal point for combination product issues for agency reviewers and industry. It is also responsible for developing guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products, and for assignment of the FDA center that has primary jurisdiction for review of combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute. 

FDA Post-Approval Requirements 

&#160; 

Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products and devices continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to manufacture or supply certain components, equipment, disposable devices and other materials used in our manufacturing process for any products that we commercialize or may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP and other FDA regulatory requirements. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, monitoring and reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, periodic reporting requirements and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. Similarly, there are a number of post-marketing requirements for devices, including medical device reporting regulations that require manufacturers to report to the FDA if a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and corrections and removal reporting regulations that require manufacturers to report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may present a risk to health. Additionally, devices must comply with the cGMP requirements that are set forth in the FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulation (QSR). 

&#160; 

After a BLA is approved, the biological product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer&#8217;s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. After approval of biologics, manufacturers must 

address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval. 

&#160; 

Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, by us or our suppliers, may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, license revocation, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 

&#160; 

&#32;Biological product and medical device manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products and devices are required to register their facilities with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval, with certain exceptions. 

&#160; 

U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 

&#160; 

&#32;Depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Patent term restoration can compensate for time lost during product development and the regulatory review process by returning up to five years of patent life for a patent that covers a new product or its use. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#8217;s approval date. The period of patent term restoration is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND (falling after issuance of the patent) and the submission date of a BLA, plus the time between the submission date of the BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The application for patent term extension is subject to approval by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, in consultation with the FDA. 

&#160; 

A patent term extension is only available when the FDA approves a biological product for the first time. We believe MACI and the manner in which it is manufactured have not been previously approved by the FDA. However, we cannot be certain that the PTO and the FDA will agree with our analysis or will grant a patent term extension. 

&#160; 

A biological product can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued &#8220;Written Request&#8221; for such a study. 

Biosimilars 

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the Affordable Care Act, includes the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. That Act created an approval pathway authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. Biosimilars are biological products which are &#8220;highly similar&#8221; to a previously approved biologic product or &#8220;reference product&#8221; and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency as shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical study or studies. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the agency must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biosimilar and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation, which are still being worked out by the FDA. A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. 

&#160; 

Pediatric Research Equity Act 

&#160; 

Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or BLA supplement must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective, for a new product, new indication or dosage form. The intent of PREA is to compel sponsors whose products have pediatric applicability to study those products in pediatric populations, rather than ignoring pediatric indications for adult indications that could be more economically desirable. FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. By its terms, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted, unless the FDA issues regulations saying otherwise. Because the FDA has not issued any such regulations, submission of a pediatric assessment is not required for an application to market a product for an orphan-designated indication, and waivers are not needed at this time. However, if only one indication for a product has orphan designation, a pediatric assessment may still be required for any applications to market that same product for the non-orphan indication(s). 

&#160; 

Advertising and Promotion 

&#160; 

Once an FDA-regulated product is approved, the product will be subject to continuing post-approval regulatory requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics and devices including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising and promotional activities involving the internet. The agency also prohibits the off-label promotion of biologics and devices, and provides guidance on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities to ensure that these activities are not promotional. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in significant penalties, including the issuance of warning letters directing a company to correct deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA, and federal and state civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions. 

Biologics and devices may be marketed only for the approved or cleared indications and may only make claims for the product that are covered by the approval or clearance. For BLAs, changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. A BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing BLA supplements as it does in reviewing BLAs. Similarly, changes to approved or cleared devices may require FDA&#8217;s premarket review. 

While doctors are free to prescribe any product approved by the FDA for any use, a company can only make claims relating to safety and effectiveness of a biological product or device that are consistent with the FDA approval or clearance, and the company is allowed to actively market and promote a biological product or device only for the particular use and treatment approved or cleared by the FDA. In addition, any claims we make for our products in advertising or promotion must be appropriately balanced with important safety information and otherwise be adequately substantiated. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, injunctions and potential civil and criminal penalties. 

Orphan Drug 

&#160; 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition&#8212;generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales of such drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the biologic and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not necessarily convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular product to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical &#32; superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity, which would most likely run concurrently with the exclusivity, if any, received from the time of first licensure of a reference product, does not prevent the FDA from approving a different biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee. 

&#160; 

The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) added Section 529 to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Pursuant to that provision, FDA will award priority review vouchers to sponsors of rare pediatric disease product 

applications that meet certain criteria after approval of the application. The priority review voucher may be used by the sponsor or sold/transferred to another. 

Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws 

&#160; 

In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of biological products and devices are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, and other federal, state and local government agencies. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute, as amended, the False Claims Act, as amended, the privacy regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 

&#160; 

As noted above, in the United States, we are subject to complex laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare &#8220;fraud and abuse,&#8221; including, but not limited to, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, and other state and federal laws and regulations. The Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person, including a biological product manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or order of an item for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any insurer, not just federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Due to the breadth of these federal and state anti-kickback laws and the potential for additional legal or regulatory change in this area, it is possible that our future sales and marketing practices and/or our future relationships with physicians might be challenged under anti-kickback laws, which could harm us. Because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we plan to develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal controls to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which we will or may become subject. 

&#160; 

The federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including biological products, that are false or fraudulent. Although we would not submit claims directly to payers, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to &#8220;cause&#8221; the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under the federal False Claims Act in connection with their off-label promotion of drugs. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. If the government were to allege that we were, or convict us of, violating these false claims laws, we could be subject to a substantial fine and may suffer a decline in our stock price. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the federal False Claims Act and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act. 

&#160; 

There are also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. In addition, a provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, referred to as the Sunshine Act, requires biological product manufacturers to track and report to the federal government certain payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals made in the previous calendar year. These laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities. 

&#160; 

International Regulation 

&#160; 

In addition to regulations in the United States, a variety of foreign regulations govern clinical trials, commercial sales, and distribution of product candidates. The approval process varies from country to country and the time to approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. 

&#160; 

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement 

&#160; 

In the United States and other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers, and other organizations. Third-party payers are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of medical products and services in addition to safety and efficacy and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Third-party reimbursement adequate to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development may not be available for our products. 

&#160; 

Competitive Environment For Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine 

&#160; 

The biotechnology and medical device industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our competitors include major multinational medical device companies, pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and stem cell companies operating in the fields of tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, cardiac, vascular, orthopedics and neural medicine. Many of these companies are well-established and possess technical, research and development, financial, and sales and marketing resources significantly greater than ours. In addition, many of our smaller potential competitors have formed strategic collaborations, partnerships and other types of joint ventures with larger, well established industry competitors that afford these companies potential research and development and commercialization advantages in the technology and therapeutic areas currently being pursued by us. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are also conducting and financing research activities which may produce products directly competitive to those being commercialized by us. Moreover, many of these competitors may be able to obtain patent protection, obtain FDA and other regulatory approvals and begin commercial sales of their products before us. 

&#160; 

For patients diagnosed with cartilage defects, there are several treatment options, including arthroscopic debridement/chondroplasty, marrow stimulation techniques such as microfracture, osteochondralautografts for smaller cartilage injuries, allografts, and autologous chondrocyte implants for larger, more complex injuries. 

&#160; 

The main competitor for Carticel in the U.S. is the microfracture procedure. Microfracture is a minimally invasive procedure that can be performed during the initial arthroscopic procedure. Short term results are generally considered good in smaller cartilage defects. Other competitive treatments in the U.S. include autograft/allograft procedures and a juvenile donor-derived allograft product DeNovo NT from Zimmer Holdings Inc. (Zimmer). 

Carticel is the only FDA-approved ACI product on the market in the United States. We are aware of two ACI products in development. Histogenics Corporation began a Phase 3 study of its Neocart implant in February 2010. Neocart is an autologous chondrocyte tissue implant under development for treatment of symptomatic articular cartilage lesions on the femur. Aesculap Biologics, LLC initiated a Phase 3 study in 2014 of NovoCart 3D &#174; , a matrix induced autologous chondrocyte product designed to repair articular cartilage defects of the knee. 

&#160; 

The competitive treatment alternatives to MACI in the EU are the same as those for Carticel in the U.S., including debridement/chondroplasty, microfracture, and osteochondralautografts. Although there is very little use of allografts or allograft-derived products, the competitive product environment is much more robust. Competitors include microfracture augmentation products such as ChondroGide&#174; from Geistlich Pharma AG and direct ACI competitors including ChondroCelect&#174; from TiGenix NV. 

&#160; 

Patients suffering catastrophic burns over a significant portion of total body surface area have few options for permanent skin coverage. When undamaged skin is available, a procedure known as meshed split-thickness auto-grafting can be considered. However, this option becomes less viable as the percentage of total body surface area burn increases. Epicel is a lifesaving therapy and represents the only option for patients with TBSA burns greater than 70%. In lower TBSA (&#60;50%) Avita Medical is developing ReCell&#174; for the U.S. market for patients with TBSA burns lower than 50%, with a late stage trial and project approval expected in 2017. ReCell is an on-site preparation of autologous epithelial cells suspension. 

We are investigating ixmyelocel-T, an autologous cell therapy, in ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (ischemic heart failure) and recently completed the blinded portion of the Phase 2b clinical trial and announced that the trial had met its primary endpoint of reduction in clinical cardiac events and that incidence of adverse events, including serious adverse events, in patients treated with ixmyelocel-T was comparable to patients in the placebo group. Competitor cell (autologous and allogeneic) and gene therapies are currently under clinical development in Phases 1, 2 and 3 in heart failure patients. Examples are, Mesoblast Ltd., which is conducting a Phase 3 trial with allogeneic cell therapy and Cardio3 Biosciences which completed enrollment in an EU based Phase 

3 trial with a bone marrow derived autologous therapy with stated plans to initiate a U.S. Phase 3 trial. Gene therapies are being evaluated in Phase 2 trials by Juventas Therapeutics, Inc. and Celladon Corporation. 

&#160; 

Our potential commercial products address a broad range of existing and emerging therapeutic markets, in which cell-based therapy is a new and as of yet, unproven, commercial strategy. In a large part, we face primary competition from existing medical devices and drug products. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories and substantially greater resources. These include companies such as Arthrex Inc. (Arthrex), Zimmer, Baxter International, Inc. (Baxter), Biomet, Inc., Johnson &#38; Johnson, Inc. (Johnson &#38; Johnson), Medtronic, Inc. (Medtronic), and others. 

&#160; 

In the general area of cell-based therapies, we potentially compete with a variety of companies, most of whom are specialty medical products or biotechnology companies. Some of these, such as Arthrex and Zimmer, Baxter, Johnson &#38; Johnson, Medtronic and Miltenyi Biotec Inc. are well-established and have substantial technical and financial resources compared to ours. However, as cell-based products are only just emerging as viable medical therapies, many of our most direct competitors are smaller biotechnology and specialty medical products companies. These include Ocata Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly Advanced Cell Technology, Inc.), Cytomedix, Inc. (formerly Aldagen, Inc.), Arteriocyte Medical Systems, Inc., Athersys, Inc., Cytori Therapeutics, Inc., International Stem Cell Corporation, Neostem, Inc., Terumo Medical Corporation (formerly Harvest Technologies Corporation), Mesoblast Ltd., Osiris Therapeutics, Inc., Pluristem, Inc. Stem Cells, Inc., Tengion, Inc., and others. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 190 full-time employees.
