 Item 1. BUSINESS &#160; 

Our Company 

&#160;

Strategic Overview 

&#160;

Teligent, Inc., or the Company, is a specialty generic pharmaceutical company. Our mission is to become a leader in the specialty generic pharmaceutical market. Under our own label, we currently market and sell generic topical and branded generic injectable pharmaceutical products in the United States and Canada. In the United States we are currently marketing eight generic topical pharmaceutical products and four branded generic pharmaceutical products. Through the completion of an acquisition, we now sell a total of nineteen generic and branded generic injectable products and medical devices in Canada. Generic pharmaceutical products are bioequivalent to their brand name counterparts. We also provide development, formulation, and manufacturing services to the pharmaceutical, over-the-counter, or OTC, and cosmetic markets. We operate our business under one segment. Effective October 23, 2015, we changed our name from IGI Laboratories, Inc. to Teligent, Inc. On October 26, 2015, our common stock, which was previously listed on the NYSE MKT, began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the trading symbol &#8220;TLGT.&#8221; Our office, laboratories and manufacturing facilities are located at 105 Lincoln Avenue, Buena, New Jersey.

&#160;

Currently, we have two platforms for growth:

&#160;

&#183; Developing, manufacturing and marketing a portfolio of generic pharmaceutical products in our own label in topical, injectable, complex and ophthalmic dosage forms; and &#160;

&#183; Managing our current contract manufacturing and formulation services business. &#160;

We have been in the contract manufacturing and development of topical products business since the early 1990s, but our strategy since 2010 has been focused on the growth of our own generic pharmaceutical business. Since 2010, we have focused on transitioning our business to include more customers in the topical pharmaceutical industry. In 2014, we broadened our target product focus from topical pharmaceuticals to include a wider specialty pharmaceutical approach. We believe that expanding our development and commercial base beyond topical generics, historically the cornerstone of our expertise, to include injectable generics, complex generics and ophthalmic generics (what we call our &#8220;TICO strategy&#8221;), will leverage our existing expertise and capabilities, and broaden our platform for more diversified strategic growth.

&#160;

As of the date of this report, we have acquired 25 drug products that have been previously approved by the FDA. Our pipeline includes 31 Abbreviated New Drug Applications, or ANDAs filed with the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for additional pharmaceutical products. In addition, we have four abbreviated new drug submissions, or ANDSs, on file with Health Canada. We have an additional 39 product candidates at various stages of our development pipeline, ten of which are on stability testing. In December 2015, we announced the approval by the FDA of Cefotan&#174; (Cefotan for Injection). This was our first product approved from the portfolio of discontinued and withdrawn new drug applications, or NDAs, and ANDAs that we purchased from Astra Zeneca on September 25, 2014. We have also experienced an increased rate of review by the FDA of applications filed in Generic Drug User Fee Amendments, or GDUFA, Year 3 and Year 4, which began October 1, 2014, and October 1, 2015, respectively. We submitted fifteen topical ANDAs in 2015. We expect to continue to expand our presence in the generic topical pharmaceutical market through the filing of additional ANDAs with the FDA and the subsequent launch of products as these applications are approved. Our target is to file at least fifteen ANDAs in total in 2016 through our internal product development program, and we plan to file at least 8 ANDSs with Health Canada in 2016. We will also seek to license or acquire further products, intellectual property, or pending applications to expand our portfolio.

&#160;

Teligent Canada . On November 13, 2015, we acquired all of the rights, title and interest in the development, production, marketing, import and distribution of all injectable pharmaceutical products of Alveda Pharmaceuticals Inc., or Alveda, pursuant to two asset purchase agreements, one relating to the acquisition of all of the intellectual property-related assets of Alveda and the other relating to the acquisition of all other assets of Alveda.

&#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In connection with the closing of the acquisition, we formed three subsidiaries: Teligent Luxembourg S.&#224;.r.l., or LuxCo, a private limited company incorporated under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and wholly-owned by the Company; Teligent O&#220;, a private limited company incorporated under the laws of Estonia that is wholly-owned by LuxCo; and Teligent Canada Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia that is wholly-owned by LuxCo.

&#160;

Teligent Canada currently has seven employees, including a general manager of Teligent Canada, located in our offices in Toronto, Canada. Teligent Canada acquired all of the Alveda working capital, including accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and capital assets. In addition, Teligent Canada acquired Alveda&#8217;s existing customer relations, all contracts necessary to execute the Canadian distribution activities, the existing work force, operational permits, and all intellectual property required to operate the marketing and distributions of products in Canada. Teligent Canada currently markets and distributes nineteen products. We plan to transition these products to distribute them under a Teligent Canada label later this year.

&#160;

Teligent O&#220;. We hired our general manager of Teligent O&#220; in the first quarter of 2016. Teligent O&#220; will be responsible for the development, enhancement, maintenance, protection and exploitation functions related to the intellectual property-related assets acquired from Alveda. In addition, Teligent O&#220; will be responsible for the management of the supply chain function and procurement of products for sale to Teligent Canada. In 2016, we intend to hire additional headcount in Teligent O&#220; and secure a quality control laboratory space in preparation to support our Teligent US supply chain management and technical services teams.

&#160;

Teligent Jersey Limited. On October 5, 2015, we, together with our wholly-owned subsidiary incorporated under the laws of Jersey, or Teligent Jersey, entered into and closed an Asset Purchase Agreement and certain other ancillary agreements with Concordia Pharmaceuticals Inc., S.&#224;.r.l., Barbados Branch, or Concordia, pursuant to which we acquired all rights, title and interests of Concordia in the existing inventory and certain contracts associated with three currently marketed injectable pharmaceutical products (Fortaz&#174;, Zinacef TM , and Zantac&#174; Injection), and Teligent Jersey acquired all rights, title and interests of Concordia in, among other things, certain other contracts, product registrations and books and records associated with those products. In consideration for the purchase of those assets, we paid Concordia an aggregate of $10,100,000 in cash. The transaction is accounted for as a purchase of the product and product rights. In addition, we purchased approximately $1.2 million of inventory related to the three products acquired.

&#160;

Facility Expansion. With the ongoing expansion activities at our facility of our research and development laboratories, as well as our manufacturing capabilities, we believe that, based on current forecasts, capacity at our existing facility would be sufficient for our topical manufacturing needs into 2017. In 2014, we initiated the planning phase of the expansion of our facility in Buena, New Jersey. Planning continued throughout 2015, and we acquired the building adjacent to our manufacturing facility in August 2015. We have commenced the construction project at 101 Lincoln Avenue, in Buena, New Jersey, which will be the future home to our brand new product development laboratory, in addition to our regulatory affairs, supply chain and corporate services teams. We expect this phase of the project to be completed in the summer of 2016. We intend to begin the expansion of the existing manufacturing facility at 105 Lincoln Avenue, in Buena, New Jersey in April 2016. This expansion will increase our manufacturing capacity for topical products, and also enable our production of sterile injectable products. In order to begin development, registration and manufacture of some of our sterile injectable and ophthalmic products, we are partnering with contract manufacturing organizations. The current plans consider a total capital outlay of approximately $45 million to complete this project. Upon completion of the site expansion, we may transfer the manufacturing of some of those products back to our Buena, New Jersey facility.

&#160;

In addition, we may continue to explore ways to accelerate our growth through the creation of unique opportunities from the acquisition of additional intellectual property, and the expansion of the use of our existing intellectual property.

&#160;

Our Generic Pharmaceutical Business 

&#160; 

In September 2010, we leveraged our existing formulation and manufacturing capabilities to begin the Company&#8217;s transformation from being solely a contract manufacturing and development company into a generic pharmaceutical company with our own portfolio of products, as recognized by our first ANDA submission to the FDA. ANDAs are submitted to the FDA for generic drug products that have the same active ingredient, strength, dosage form, and route of administration as brand name innovator drug products to which they are bioequivalent, meaning that there is no significant difference between the drugs in their rate and extent of absorption in the body. In the United States, approved ANDA generic drugs are usually interchangeable with the innovator drug. This means that the generic version may generally be substituted for the branded product by either a physician or pharmacist when dispensing a prescription. Our commercialization of each of these product candidates requires approval of the respective ANDA by the FDA.

&#160;

Since September 2010, we have expanded our generic topical pharmaceutical pipeline of prescription products by submitting 35 ANDAs to the FDA, of which four have been approved. We submitted fifteen ANDAs in 2015, and expect to file at least fifteen ANDAs in 2016 for topical generic pharmaceutical products.

&#160;

In December 2012, we launched our first generic topical pharmaceutical products under our own label. In March 2014, we received our first approval from the FDA for an ANDA for the generic equivalent of lidocaine hydrochloride USP 4% topical solution. In May 2014, we received tentative approval for our second ANDA, the generic equivalent of diclofenac sodium topical solution 1.5%, which received final approval from the FDA in July 2015. We also have a number of additional product candidates in various stages of development.

&#160;

Based on IMS Health Reports data, the addressable market, as of January 2016, for the 31 products we have pending at the FDA totals approximately $1.4 billion in annual sales. We expect to continue to expand our presence in the generic topical pharmaceutical market through the submission of additional ANDAs to the FDA and the subsequent launch of products if and when these applications are approved by the FDA. We also plan to file at least 8 ANDSs with Health Canada in 2016.

&#160;

As part of our growth strategy, we also seek opportunities to acquire additional products and ANDAs or ANDSs. On February 1, 2013, we acquired assets and intellectual property, including an approved ANDA, for econazole nitrate cream 1%, which we launched under our label in September 2013. On September 24, 2014, we acquired from AstraZeneca previously approved ANDAs and NDAs associated with eighteen products, seventeen of which are injectable products and one non-injectable product for pain management. On September 30, 2014, we acquired previously marketed and approved ANDAs associated with two ophthalmic products from Valeant Pharmaceuticals LLC and Valeant Pharmaceuticals Luxembourg SARL, or Valeant, in addition to the exclusive right to acquire three additional previously marketed and approved injectable products from Valeant. In November 2014, we completed the purchase of one of those three optioned injectable products and its related NDA from Valeant. In March 2015, we completed the purchase of the final two optioned injectable products and their related ANDAs from Valeant.

&#160;

Our Contract Manufacturing and Development Business 

&#160; 

We also develop, manufacture, fill and package topical semi-solid and liquid products for branded and generic pharmaceutical customers, as well as the OTC and cosmetic industries. These products are used in a wide range of applications, from purely cosmetic to the prescription treatment of conditions like dermatitis, psoriasis and eczema.

&#160;

Our contract manufacturing and development business includes two services: contract formulation and contract manufacturing. These services are offered to pharmaceutical, OTC and cosmetic customers. For our pharmaceutical contract services customers, we formulate, test and/or manufacture prescription drugs and medical devices. The products include cosmetics sold by retail stores directly to the public, as well as prescription drug products promoted directly to physicians. All contract manufacturing products are produced under our customers&#8217; labels. As a result of our commitment to file at least fifteen topical ANDAs for the Teligent portfolio in 2016, our research and development team will be focused more on the growth of our organic pipeline. Therefore, we do not expect to record significant revenues from our contract formulation services in 2016 and beyond.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Contract development involves developing topical formulations to satisfy a customer&#8217;s product request. Our experienced formulators can develop a novel formulation or replicate an existing formula through reverse engineering. We offer full support for the products we develop through developing test methods, full analytical services, manufacturing scale-up criteria, validation and regulatory assistance. Upon completion of our contract formulation projects, we are often successful in securing contract manufacturing services to manufacture the products we helped the customer develop. We have filed several 510(k) submissions with the FDA to obtain clearance on behalf of our customers for the marketing and distribution of certain medical devices. In addition, we have four additional ANDAs pending approval at the FDA that we submitted under joint development and commercialization agreements with our partners. In December 2012, after completion of the required formulation and regulatory requirements, we submitted two of those ANDAs on behalf of one of our pharmaceutical partners. In December 2013, we submitted another of the ANDAs associated with a generic topical pharmaceutical drug product, which, once approved, will be licensed, marketed and distributed by one of our large multi-national pharmaceutical partners, West-Ward Pharmaceuticals Corp. In June 2014, we submitted an ANDA under a joint development and commercialization agreement with Impax Laboratories, Inc.

&#160;

We believe that our quality contract manufacturing and development business provides a consistent and reliable source of products and services to our customers. We offer flexibility in batch sizing and package design, which gives our customers the opportunity to select the appropriate presentation for each product. Our high-speed packaging lines can accommodate a variety of tubes, bottles, pumps and jars. As a result of the rollout of our TICO strategy and the increased focus and commitment of R&#38;D and technical resources toward internal projects, we anticipate that revenue from our contract services business will decrease over time.

&#160;

Our Financings 

&#160; 

On December 22, 2014, we consummated the sale of an aggregate of $143.75 million in principal of our notes, or the Notes, to Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as the initial purchasers, including the initial purchasers&#8217; exercise of their option to purchase an $18.75 million in principal of Notes. The Notes were sold in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In connection with the sale of the Notes, we entered into an indenture with Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.75% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing June 15, 2015. The Notes will mature on December 15, 2019, unless earlier repurchased or redeemed by the Company or converted by holders, pursuant to the terms therein. Additionally, subject to certain conditions, we may redeem for cash any or all outstanding Notes on or after December 19, 2017 in an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. No sinking fund is provided for the Notes. The Notes are the Company&#8217;s senior unsecured obligations and will not be guaranteed by any of our existing or future subsidiaries. Aggregate net proceeds were approximately $139 million, after deducting underwriter commissions and other expenses paid by us.

&#160;

&#160;

Our Competitive Strategy 

&#160;

Our goal is to become a leader in the specialty generic pharmaceutical market. Under our own label, we currently market and sell generic topical and branded generic injectable pharmaceutical products in the United States and Canada. We also provide development, formulation, and manufacturing services to the pharmaceutical, OTC, and cosmetic industries. We have been in the contract manufacturing and development of topical products business since the early 1990s, but our strategy since 2010 has been focused on the growth of our own generic pharmaceutical business. In 2014, we started the transformation of our business from working toward being a leader in the topical generic pharmaceutical industry to becoming a leader in the specialty pharmaceutical markets. We believe that expanding our development and commercial base beyond topical generics, the cornerstone of our expertise, to injectable generics, complex generics and ophthalmic generics (what we call our TICO strategy), will leverage existing expertise and capabilities, diversify our commercial opportunities and broaden our platform for long-term strategic growth.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our TICO Strategy 

&#160; 

Our TICO strategy originated from our opportunity to leverage the industry value chain, which we have developed and strengthened through our topical portfolio. This value chain includes our internal expertise in product and molecule selection and development, manufacturing, sales, logistics and distribution, as well as our relationships with our customers and consumers. With the notable exception of manufacturing capabilities, we see the potential to effectively leverage our existing infrastructure across this value chain and to further expand our strategic reach to the injectable, complex and ophthalmic generic pharmaceutical markets.

&#160;

Topical (T) - Our focus on the topical market has been the foundation for our growth. While the Company has manufactured topical products since the early 1990s, we began to focus our strategy on the topical generic market in 2010. In December 2012, we launched our first generic topical pharmaceutical products under our own label. Currently, we market eight topical products under our own label. We have recently received FDA approvals for lidocaine ointment 5%, which we plan to launch in the first quarter of 2016, and desoximetasone ointment 0.25%, which we plan to launch in the second quarter of 2016. In our topical pipeline, we have 31 ANDAs submitted to the FDA that are awaiting approval, and an additional 39 product candidates in our development pipeline, 10 of which are on stability testing. We intend to continue to develop topical generic products and utilize our expertise in drug formulation and manufacture to expand our own generic topical prescription drug portfolio. We are targeting to develop and file regulatory submissions with the FDA for at least fifteen topical products in 2016 through the ANDA process. Upon regulatory approval, we would market these products under the Teligent label to national chain drug stores and drug wholesalers through our internal sales efforts. Based on IMS Health Reports data, the addressable market, as of January 2016, for the 31 products we have pending at the FDA totals approximately $1.4 billion in annual sales.

&#160;

In our topical contract services business, we have developed strong customer relationships that we believe provide us with both recurring revenue streams from those customers and opportunities to selectively increase our product offerings to our customers. We intend to continue to capitalize on our strong customer relationships to maintain some contract manufacturing and development revenues.

&#160;

We have an FDA-registered, cGMP-compliant facility that is equipped for manufacturing topical, semi-solid and liquid products. The design and configuration of our manufacturing facility provides flexibility in manufacturing batch sizes from 250 kg up to 4,000 kg. We intend to leverage this flexibility and capacity to support our growth in the topical prescription markets. We are finalizing the planning phase of expanding this facility to increase our topical manufacturing capacity and warehousing capacity to accommodate the expected growth created by the eventual commercial launch of the 31 topical generic pharmaceutical products in our pipeline.

&#160;

Injectable (I) - As part of the injectable phase of our TICO strategy, on September 24, 2014, we acquired from AstraZeneca previously approved ANDAs and NDAs associated with eighteen products, seventeen of which are injectable products and one of which is a non-injectable product for pain management. Of the products we acquired, five of the products are currently on the FDA drug shortage list. We have received FDA approval for our first product in this portfolio, Cefotan&#174; (Cefotetan for Injection), and we are working with our manufacturing partner to launch the product in the first quarter of 2016.

&#160;

On November 13, 2015, we formed Teligent Canada, and completed the acquisition of Alveda. Teligent Canada currently has seven employees, including a general manager located in our offices in Toronto, Canada. Teligent Canada acquired all of the Alveda working capital, including accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and capital assets. In addition, Teligent Canada acquired Alveda&#8217;s existing customer relations, all contracts necessary to execute the Canadian distribution activities, the existing work force, operational permits, and all intellectual property required to operate the marketing and distributions of Alveda&#8217;s products in Canada. Teligent Canada currently markets and distributes nineteen injectable products.

&#160;

On October 5, 2015, we acquired three currently marketed injectable pharmaceutical products (Fortaz&#174;, Zinacef TM and Zantac&#174; Injection) from Concodia Pharmaceuticals Inc., S.&#224;.r.l., Barbados Branch.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

On September 30, 2014, we acquired previously marketed and approved ANDAs associated with two ophthalmic products from Valeant, in addition to the exclusive right to acquire three additional previously marketed and approved injectable products from Valeant. In November 2014, we completed the purchase of one of those three optioned injectable products and its related NDA from Valeant. In March 2015, we completed the purchase of the final two optioned injectable products and their related ANDA from Valeant.

&#160;

We intend to leverage our existing topical value chain as we build our injectable generic portfolio. In 2015, we entered into partnerships with contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the manufacture of some of our products in our portfolio of sterile products. Longer term, we expect to bring much of this production capability in-house.

&#160;

In 2015, we have performed extensive analysis on the expansion of our existing facility in Buena, New Jersey, and the addition of sterile manufacturing capabilities to our facility. We have completed the concept, design, equipment ordering and construction planning activities necessary to qualify a facility for both pilot- and commercial-scale operations, including an R&#38;D laboratory, sterile manufacturing and packaging capabilities, and warehouse and administrative space. We intend to begin construction in April 2016.

&#160;

We plan to continue to review business development opportunities to expand our injectable portfolio.

&#160;

Complex (C) - We have begun three projects that we consider to be part of the complex portfolio of our TICO strategy. We consider our focus on complex products or markets to be broadly defined to include potential complexity in one of the critical areas of our industry value chain. As part of our complex program, we are researching two 505(b)(2) projects. A 505(b)(2) submission is an NDA that contains full safety and effectiveness reports, but permits some of the information required for approval to come from studies not conducted by or for the applicant, thereby avoiding unnecessary duplication of studies already performed on a product. In addition, we are currently working with a contract research organization to develop a generic equivalent of a pharmaceutical drug product designated for a chronic rare disease. The intent of this opportunity is to provide patients with a lower cost alternative of an approved orphan drug. The Orphan Drug Designation program at the FDA provides orphan status to drugs and biologics which are defined as those intended for the safe and effective treatment, diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases/disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S., or that affect more than 200,000 persons, but are not expected to recover the costs of developing and marketing a treatment drug. We will continue to seek opportunities relevant to building our complex portfolio of products.

&#160;

Ophthalmic (O) - As part of the ophthalmic portfolio of our TICO strategy, on September 30, 2014, we acquired previously marketed and approved ANDAs associated with two ophthalmic products from Valeant. Similar to our injectable portfolio, we are forming partnerships with CMOs for near-term commercial production, but plan to eventually manufacture these products within our own facility. We plan to continue to review business development opportunities to expand our ophthalmic portfolio.

&#160;

Our Customers 

&#160;

Generic Pharmaceutical Business. The manufacturing and commercialization of generic specialty pharmaceutical markets is competitive, and there are established manufacturers, suppliers and distributors actively engaged in all phases of our business. We currently only manufacture and sell topical generic pharmaceutical products under our own label. In October 2015, we acquired and began to sell our first generic injectable products. The injectable products are currently sold under another company&#8217;s label and will be transitioned to our label in accordance with FDA guidance in 2016. In Canada, we currently market nineteen products in the Alveda label which will be transitioned to the Teligent label in 2016. As we continue to execute our TICO strategy, we will compete in other markets, including the injectable and ophthalmic generic pharmaceutical markets, and expect to face other competitors.

&#160;

For the years ended December 31, 2015, and 2014, 43% and 44% of our total product sales, net, respectively, were to the three large wholesale drug distributors: AmerisourceBergen Corporation, or ABC; Cardinal Health, Inc., or Cardinal; and McKesson Drug Company, or McKesson. ABC accounted for approximately 28% and 42% of our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

ABC, Cardinal and McKesson are key distributors of our products, as well as a broad range of health care products for many other companies. None of these distributors is an end user of our products. Generally, if sales to any one of these distributors were to diminish or cease, we believe that the end users of our products would likely find little difficulty obtaining our products either directly from us or from another distributor. However, the loss of one or more of these distributors, together with a delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for end users, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, ABC, Cardinal and McKesson have entered into strategic alliances with Walgreens, CVS Caremark and Rite-Aid, respectively. Since Walgreens, CVS Caremark and Rite-Aid are customers for several of our products, the loss of our distributor relationship with any of the three large wholesalers could result in a reduction to our revenues.

&#160;

We consider our business relationships with ABC, Cardinal and McKesson to be in good standing and have fee for services contracts with each of them. However, a change in purchasing patterns, a decrease in inventory levels, an increase in returns of our products, delays in purchasing products and delays in payment for products by one or more of these distributors could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, we experienced a change in purchasing patterns at ABC in April 2015. We continue to analyze the market for other opportunities to expand our current relationships with other customers, while we continue to seek to diversify our existing portfolio of specialty generic drug products through internal research and development. In addition, we continue to explore business development opportunities to add additional products and /or capabilities to our existing portfolio.

&#160;

Contract Manufacturing and Development Business. Our customers in the contract manufacturing business generally consist of pharmaceutical companies, as well as cosmetic and OTC product marketers, who require product development/manufacturing support. For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 86% of our contract services revenue was derived from pharmaceutical customers, as compared to 79% of total contract services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. One contract manufacturing customer represented 11% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, and one of our contract manufacturing services customers represented 13% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. We do not expect any contract manufacturing or formulation services customers to exceed 10% of revenue for 2016 and beyond.

&#160;

Concentration of credit risk. In 2015, we had sales to three customers which individually accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue. These customers had sales of $12.3 million, $5.8 million and $5.0 million, respectively, and represented 52% of total revenues in the aggregate. Accounts receivable related to these major customers comprised 83% of all accounts receivable as of December 31, 2015.

&#160;

In 2014, we had sales to two customers which individually accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue. These customers had sales of $10.5 million and $4.4 million, respectively, and represented 44% of total revenues in the aggregate. Accounts receivable related to these major customers comprised 42% of all accounts receivable as of December 31, 2014.

&#160;

In 2013, we had sales to three customers which individually accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue. These customers had sales of $2.8 million, $2.2 million and $2.1 million, respectively, and represented 39% of total revenues in the aggregate.

&#160;

Our Products 

&#160; 

We recorded net revenue from one product, econazole nitrate cream, which accounted for 45% and 38% of total revenues in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company did not have significant revenue from any one product in 2013.

Our Suppliers 

&#160;

We require a supply of quality raw materials and components to manufacture and package pharmaceutical products for ourselves and third parties with which we have contracted. The principal components of our products are active and inactive pharmaceutical ingredients and certain packaging materials. The APIs and other materials and supplies used in our pharmaceutical manufacturing operations are generally available and purchased from many different U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers. However, in some cases, the raw materials used to manufacture pharmaceutical products are available only from a single supplier. Even when more than one supplier exists, we may choose, and in some cases have chosen, only to list one supplier in our applications submitted to the FDA. Any change in a supplier not previously approved must then be submitted through a formal approval process with the FDA. No supplier represented 10% or more of our purchases in 2015, 2014 or 2013.

Research and Development 

&#160;

Our R&#38;D activities are integral to our business and are conducted at our facility in Buena, New Jersey. Our R&#38;D department is led by our Chief Scientific Officer, Stephen Richardson, who joined the Teligent team in October 2015. The R&#38;D team consists of 26 full-time employees and their responsibilities include: formulation, reverse engineering, methods development, analytical and microbiologic testing and scale up, and regulatory expertise. Our employees have specific expertise in developing topical products in a wide range of dosage forms, including simple solutions through complex creams. All ANDA topical development is conducted in-house except for bioequivalence testing, which is performed by what we believe to be a qualified contract research organization. In 2015, Teligent added injectable development capabilities to the team.

&#160;

We have been steadily increasing our investment in R&#38;D as we believe that R&#38;D is the future of the Company. We incurred $13.2, $6.9, and $2.7 million on R&#38;D expenses in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. We expect to increase our R&#38;D spending in 2016 to approximately 28 to 32% of revenue in 2016 to expand our ANDA submissions and pipeline. As the business continues to grow over the next three to five years, we expect research and development costs as a percentage of revenue to decline.

Product Development and Government Regulation 

&#160;

United States 

&#160;

Prescription pharmaceutical products in the U.S. are generally marketed as either brand or generic drugs. Brand products are usually marketed under brand names through marketing programs that are designed to generate physician and consumer loyalty. Brand products generally are patent protected, which provides a period of market exclusivity during which time they are sold with little or no competition for the compound, although there typically are other participants in the therapeutic area. Additionally, brand products may benefit from other periods of non-patent market exclusivity. Exclusivity normally provides brand products with the ability to maintain their profitability for relatively long periods of time and brand products typically continue to play a significant role in the market due to physician and consumer loyalties after the end of patent protection or other market exclusivities.

&#160;

Generic pharmaceutical products are the pharmaceutical and therapeutic equivalents of the brand product, also known as the reference listed drug, or RLD. A reference listed brand drug is an approved drug product listed in the FDA publication entitled Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, popularly known as the Orange Book. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, provides that generic drugs may enter the market after the approval of an ANDA, An ANDA approval requires that bioequivalence to the reference listed drug be demonstrated and also requires that any patents on the corresponding reference listed drug be expired, invalidated, non-infringed and/or any other relevant market exclusivity periods related to the reference listed drug be expired as well. Generic drugs are bioequivalent to their reference brand name counterparts. Accordingly, generic products provide a safe, effective and cost-efficient alternative to users of these reference brand products. Branded generic pharmaceutical products are generic products in that they are approved for marketing under an ANDA, but they may be more responsive to promotion efforts generally used to promote branded pharmaceutical products. Growth in the generic pharmaceutical industry has been, and will continue to be, driven by the increased market acceptance of generic drugs, as well as the number of brand drugs for which patent terms and/or other market exclusivities have expired.

&#160;

We obtain new generic products primarily through internal product development. Additionally, we license or co-develop products through arrangements with other companies. All applications for FDA approval must contain information relating to product formulation, raw material suppliers, stability, manufacturing processes, packaging, labeling and quality control. Information to support the bioequivalence of generic drug products or the safety and effectiveness of new drug products for their intended use is also required to be submitted. There are generally two types of applications used for obtaining FDA approval of new products:

&#160;

&#183; New Drug Application &#8212; An NDA is filed when approval is sought to market a newly developed branded product and, in certain instances, for a new dosage form, a new delivery system or a new indication for a previously approved drug. &#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; ANDA &#8212; An ANDA is filed when approval is sought to market a generic equivalent of a drug product previously approved under an NDA and listed in the FDA&#8217;s Orange Book or for a new dosage strength for a drug previously approved under an ANDA. &#160;

The ANDA development process is generally less time-consuming and complex than the NDA development process. It typically does not require new preclinical and clinical studies, because it relies on the studies establishing safety and efficacy conducted for the RLD previously approved through the NDA process. The ANDA process, however, does typically require one or more bioequivalence studies to show that the ANDA drug is bioequivalent to the previously approved reference listed brand drug. Bioequivalence studies compare the bioavailability of the proposed drug product with that of the RLD product containing the same active ingredient. Bioavailability is a measure of the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety is absorbed from a drug product and becomes available at the site of action. Thus, a demonstration of bioequivalence confirms the absence of a significant difference between the proposed product and the reference listed brand drug in terms of the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety becomes available at the site of drug action when administered at the same molar dose under similar conditions.

&#160;

Generic products are generally introduced to the marketplace at the expiration of patent protection for the brand product or at the end of a period of non-patent market exclusivity. However, if an ANDA applicant files an ANDA containing a certification of invalidity, non-infringement or unenforceability related to a patent listed in the Orange Book with respect to a reference drug product, the applicant may be able to market the generic equivalent prior to the expiration of patent protection for the brand product. Such patent certification is commonly referred to as a Paragraph IV certification. If the holder of the NDA sues, claiming infringement or invalidation, within 45 days of notification by the applicant, the FDA may not approve the ANDA application until the earlier of the rendering of a court decision favorable to the ANDA applicant or the expiration of 30 months. An ANDA applicant that is first to file a Paragraph IV certification is eligible for a period of generic marketing exclusivity. This exclusivity, which under certain circumstances may be required to be shared with other ANDA sponsors that have made Paragraph IV certifications, lasts for 180 days, during which the FDA cannot grant final approval to other ANDA applications for a generic equivalent to the same reference drug.

In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to a period of non-patent market exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an application for a generic version product. If the reference drug is a new chemical entity, the FDA may not accept an ANDA for a generic product for up to five years following approval of the NDA for the new chemical entity. If it is not a new chemical entity, but the holder of the NDA conducted clinical trials essential to approval of the NDA or a supplement thereto, the FDA may not approve an ANDA for reference NDA product before the expiration of three years. Certain other periods of exclusivity may be available if the RLD is indicated for treatment of a rare disease or the sponsor conducts pediatric studies in accordance with FDA requirements.

&#160;

Supplemental ANDAs are required for approval of various types of changes to an approved application and these supplements may be under review for six months or more. In addition, certain types of changes may only be approved once new bioequivalence studies are conducted or other requirements are satisfied.

&#160;

An additional requirement for FDA approval of NDAs and ANDAs is that our manufacturing procedures and operations conform to FDA requirements and guidelines, generally referred to as current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs. The requirements for FDA approval encompass all aspects of the production process, including validation and recordkeeping, the standards around which are continuously changing and evolving.

&#160;

Facilities, procedures, operations and/or testing of products are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, and other authorities. In addition, the FDA conducts pre-approval and post-approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether our systems and processes are in compliance with cGMP and other FDA regulations. Our suppliers are subject to similar regulations and periodic inspections.

&#160;

In 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or the FDASIA, was enacted into law. FDASIA is intended to enhance the safety and security of the U.S. drug supply chain by holding all drug manufacturers supplying products to the U.S. to the same FDA inspection standards and schedules. Specifically, prior to the passage of FDASIA, U.S. law required U.S. based manufacturers to be inspected by FDA every two years but remained silent with respect to foreign manufacturers, causing some foreign manufacturers to go as many as nine years without a routine FDA cGMP inspection, according to the Government Accountability Office.

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

FDASIA also included GDUFA, a novel user fee program to provide FDA with approximately $1.5 billion in total user fees through 2018 focused on three key aims:

&#160;

&#183; Safety &#8211; Ensure that industry participants, foreign or domestic, are held to consistent quality standards and are inspected with parity using a risk-based approach. &#160;

&#183; Access &#8211; Expedite the availability of generic drugs by bringing greater predictability to the review times for abbreviated new drug applications, amendments and supplements and improving timeliness in the review process. &#160;

&#183; Transparency &#8211; Enhance FDA&#8217;s visibility into the complex global supply environment by requiring the identification of facilities involved in the manufacture of generic drugs and associated APIs, and improve FDA&#8217;s communications and feedback with industry. &#160;

Under GDUFA, 70% of the total fees are being derived from facility fees paid by Finished Dosage Form manufacturers and API facilities listed in pending or approved generic drug applications. The remaining 30% of the total fees are being derived from application fees, including generic drug application fees, prior approval supplement fees and fees for certain types of Drug Master Files, or DMFs.

&#160;

Canada 

&#160;

In Canada, the registration process for approval of all generic pharmaceuticals has two tracks that proceed in parallel. The first track of the process involves an examination of the proposed generic product by Health Canada, the Federal department responsible for national public health, to ensure that the quality, safety and efficacy of the proposed generic product meets Canadian standards and bioequivalence requirements. The second track concerns patent rights of the brand drug owner. Companies may submit an application called an abbreviated new drug submission, or ANDS to Health Canada that compares the proposed generic drug to another drug marketed in Canada under a Notice of Compliance, or NOC, issued to a first person. When Health Canada is satisfied that the generic pharmaceutical product described in the ANDS satisfies the statutory requirements, it issues an NOC for that product for the uses specified in the ANDS, subject to any court order that may be made in the second track of the approval process.

&#160;

The second track of the approval process is governed by the Patented Medicines NOC Regulations, or the Regulations. The owner or exclusive licensee of patents relating to the brand drug for which it has an NOC may have established a list of patents administered by Health Canada that enumerates all the patents claiming the medicinal ingredient, formulation, dosage form or the use of the medicinal ingredient. It is possible that even though the patent for the API may have expired, the originator may have other patents on the list which relate to new forms of the API, a formulation or additional uses. Most brand name drugs have an associated patent list containing one or more unexpired patents claiming the medicinal ingredient itself or a use of the medicinal ingredient (a claim for the use of the medicinal ingredient for the diagnosis, treatment, mitigation or prevention of a disease, disorder or abnormal physical state or its symptoms). In its ANDS, a generic applicant must make at least one of the statutory allegations with respect to each patent on the patent list, for example, alleging that the patent is invalid or would not be infringed and explaining the basis for that allegation. In conjunction with filing its ANDS, the generic applicant is required to serve the originator a Notice of Allegation, or NOA, which gives a detailed statement of the factual and legal basis for its allegations in the ANDS. The originator may commence a court application within 45 days after it has been served with the NOA, if it takes the position that the allegations are not justified. When the application is filed in court and served on Health Canada, Health Canada may not issue an NOC until the earlier of the determination by the court after a hearing or the expiration of 24 months from the commencement of the generic drug application. The period may be shortened or lengthened by the court in certain circumstances. An NOC can be obtained for a generic product only if the generic respondent is successful in dismissing the application under the Regulations in court. The legal costs incurred in connection with the application could be substantial.

&#160;

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Section C.08.004.1 of the Canadian Food and Drug Regulations is the so-called data protection provision, and the current version of this section applies in respect of all drugs for which an NOC was issued on or after June 17, 2006. A subsequent applicant for approval to market a drug for which an NOC has already been issued does not need to perform duplicate clinical trials similar to those conducted by the first NOC holder, but is permitted to demonstrate safety and efficacy by submitting data demonstrating that its formulation is bioequivalent to the formulation that was issued for the first NOC. The first party to obtain an NOC for a drug will have an eight-year period of exclusivity starting from the date it received its NOC based on those clinical data. A subsequent applicant for approval that seeks to establish safety and efficacy by comparing its product to the product that received the first NOC will not be able to file its own application until six years after the issuance of the first NOC. The Minister of Health will not be permitted to issue an NOC to that applicant until eight years after the issuance of the first NOC &#8212; this additional two-year period will correspond in most cases to the 24-month automatic stay under the Regulations. If the first person provides the Minister with the description and results of clinical trials relating to the use of the drug in pediatric populations, it will be entitled to an extra six months of data protection. A drug is only entitled to data protection so long as it is being marketed in Canada.

&#160;

Facilities, procedures, operations and/or testing of products are subject to periodic inspection by Health Canada and the Health Products and Food Branch Inspectorate. In addition, Health Canada conducts pre-approval and post-approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether our systems are in compliance with the good manufacturing practices in Canada, Drug Establishment Licensing, or the EL, requirements and other provisions of the Regulations. Competitors are subject to similar regulations and inspections.

&#160;

The federal government, provinces and territories in Canada operate drug benefit programs through which eligible recipients receive drugs through public funding; these drugs are listed on provincial or territorial Drug Benefit Formularies (each, a &#8220;Formulary&#8221;). Eligible recipients include First Nations and Inuit clients, seniors, persons on social assistance, low-income earners, and those with certain specified conditions or diseases. Formulary listings are also used by private payors to reimburse generic products. To be listed in a Formulary, drug products must have received an NOC from Health Canada and must comply with each jurisdiction&#8217;s individual review process.

&#160;

The primary regulatory approval for pharmaceutical manufacturers, distributors and importers selling pharmaceuticals to be marketed in Canada is the issuance of an establishment license, or EL. An EL is issued once Health Canada has approved the facility in which the pharmaceuticals are manufactured, distributed or imported. A key requirement for approval of a facility is compliance with the good manufacturing practices in Canada. For pharmaceuticals that are imported, the license for the importing facility must list all foreign sites at which imported pharmaceuticals are manufactured. To be listed, a foreign site must demonstrate compliance with the good manufacturing practices in Canada.

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

We make, sell, distribute and market our prescription drug products to national chain drug stores and drug wholesalers and distributors and group purchasing organizations, or GPOs, in the United States and Canada. This commercialization infrastructure includes satisfying our state, provincial, territorial, or national licensing requirements, implementing procedures with our third-party logistics partners, and maintaining appropriate sales order to cash administrative processes and a manager of national accounts to manage our sales.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

In our generic topical prescription drug business, we face competition from other generic drug manufacturers and brand-name pharmaceutical companies through authorized generics. Although there are a significant number of competitors in the generic drug market, there are fewer competitors in the topical generic drug market. The six dominant companies in the topical generic drug market are: Taro Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd., Sandoz (the generic pharmaceutical division of Novartis AG), Allergan, Inc., Perrigo Company, Mylan, Inc. and Akorn, Inc. Collectively, these six competitors control approximately 65% of the generic topical market by value based on IMS data from January 2016. We believe the concentrated nature of the topical generic drug market creates an opportunity for us to be able to compete based on a variety of factors, including our focus on niche opportunities within the market segment and our dedication to quality in every area of our business.

&#160;

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In our generic injectable prescription drug business, we also face competition from other generic drug manufacturers and brand-name pharmaceutical companies through authorized generics. Although there are a significant number of competitors in the generic drug market, there are fewer dominant competitors in the injectable generic drug market. The 6 dominant companies in the injectable generic drug market in the United States consist of Hospira, Inc. (a subsidiary of Pfizer, Inc.), Fresenius Kabi USA, Sandoz (the generic pharmaceutical division of Novartis AG), Mylan, Inc., Dr. Reddy&#8217;s Laboratories Limited, and West-Ward (a subsidiary of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC). Collectively, these six competitors control approximately 59% of the generic injectable market by value based on IMS data from January 2016. In Canada, we face competition from largely the same firms as in the United States as well as certain Canada-only firms. The Canadian generic injectable market is dominated by Sandoz (the generic pharmaceutical division of Novartis AG), Pfizer Injectables, and Fresenius Kabi Canada. 

&#160;

Our generic injectable strategy is focused on injectable products with limited competition, and products that have a history of lack of supply, or instability in the supply chain, where we can add value and leverage on our ability to be a reliable supplier to the marketplace. We believe the concentrated nature of some molecules within the injectable generic drug market, and history of lack of supply of certain molecules in the marketplace, create opportunities for us that we believe will enable us to compete based on a variety of factors, including our focus on niche opportunities within the market segment and our dedication to quality in every area of our business.

&#160;

The contract manufacturing services market is highly competitive and includes larger organizations with substantially greater resources than us. Many of our competitors are companies that commercialize and/or manufacture their required products at their own facilities. These competitors include major pharmaceutical companies, generic drug manufacturers and consumer health product companies that generally have substantially greater manufacturing, R&#38;D, marketing and financial resources than us and, in some cases, have more geographically diversified international operations. We compete specifically with a number of different privately-held contract manufacturing companies, including DPT Laboratories, Ltd. Although this market is competitive, the competition is limited due to the need for specific expertise in topical formulations and cGMP facilities. We believe that we have the expertise required and we will continue to service our existing customers in this market by providing high quality, customer-oriented service, complemented by our contract development expertise in topical formulations.

&#160;

Environmental Matters 

&#160;

Our operations are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those of the United States Environmental Protection Agency and equivalent state and local regulatory agencies. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use, handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety. Our manufacturing facility uses, in varying degrees, hazardous substances in its processes. Contamination at our facility can result and has resulted in liability to us, for which we have recorded appropriate reserves as needed. For example, two of the Company&#8217;s facilities have undergone remediation of environmental contamination. See Note 16 to the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

To compete effectively, we need to develop and maintain a proprietary position with regard to our own technology, product candidates and business. Our goal is to safeguard our trade secrets and know-how, attain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our product candidates, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our current product candidates and any future product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology. We seek to achieve this protection through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents.

&#160;

We depend upon the skills, knowledge, experience and know-how of our management and R&#38;D personnel, as well as that of our consultants, advisors and collaborators. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we currently rely, and will continue to rely in the future, on confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. We require our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to any other parties. We also require our employees and consultants to disclose and assign to us their ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions. We understand that these agreements may not provide us with adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure.

&#160;

&#160; 15 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We also seek to obtain patent protection when necessary, and we understand that this may not provide us with complete protection against competitors who may attempt to circumvent our patents.

&#160;

Facility and Operations 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s executive administrative offices are located in Buena, New Jersey, in two facilities of approximately 33,000 square feet built on 8.44 acres of land in 1995, which we own. This facility is used for production, product development, marketing and warehousing for our pharmaceutical, cosmeceutical and cosmetic products. Our manufacturing capabilities encompass a full suite of competencies, including regulatory, quality assurance and in-house validation.

&#160;

The facility is equipped to manufacture semi-solids, ointments, gels and liquids in solution form. The facility is also configured to provide flexibility in manufacturing. Pilot batches typically range from 30 kg to 250 kg, while commercial batches may range from 250 kg to 4,000 kg.

&#160;

We operate our facility in accordance with cGMP, utilizing the same high standards as our pharmaceutical customers. Our facility is registered with the FDA. We believe that our facility and equipment are in good condition, are well-maintained and are able to operate at present levels. Our manufacturing operations are focused on regulatory compliance, continuous improvement, process standardization and excellence in quality and execution across the organization.

&#160;

We also own four acres of land adjacent to our main facility that can be used for future expansion. We also lease an additional 11,000 square feet of warehouse space in Vineland, New Jersey.

&#160;

The Company also leases approximately 7,500 square feet of corporate office space in Iselin, New Jersey, and will soon occupy approximately 4,000 square feet of office space in Toronto, Canada. The Company currently subleases office space in Toronto, Canada.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

On December 31, 2015, we had a total of 107 full-time employees, including five full-time employees in Canada. In addition, as the need arises, we occasionally utilize short-term, part-time employees who are paid on an hourly basis. We also utilize temporary employees provided by a third-party on a regular basis, primarily in our production department. We do not have a collective bargaining agreement with our employees and we believe that our employee relations are good.
