 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General 

SL Green Realty Corp. is a self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, with in-house capabilities in property management, acquisitions and dispositions, financing, development and redevelopment, construction and leasing. We were formed in June 1997 for the purpose of continuing the commercial real estate business of S.L. Green Properties, Inc., our predecessor entity. S.L. Green Properties, Inc., which was founded in 1980 by Stephen L. Green, the Company's Chairman, had been engaged in the business of owning, managing, leasing, acquiring and repositioning office properties in Manhattan, a borough of New York City. Reckson Associates Realty Corp., or Reckson, and Reckson Operating Partnership, L.P., or ROP, are wholly-owned subsidiaries of SL Green Realty Corp. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we owned the following interests in properties in the New York Metropolitan area, primarily in midtown Manhattan. Our investments in the New York Metropolitan area also include investments in Brooklyn, Long Island, Westchester County, Connecticut and New Jersey, which are collectively known as the Suburban properties:

The weighted average occupancy for commercial properties represents the total occupied square feet divided by total available rentable square feet. The weighted average occupancy for residential properties represents the total occupied units divided by total available units. 

(2) 

As of December 31, 2015 , we owned a building that was comprised of approximately 270,132 &#32;square feet of retail space and approximately 222,855 &#32;square feet of residential space. For the purpose of this report, we have included the building in the retail properties count and have bifurcated the square footage into the retail and residential components. 

(3) 

This property was held for sale as of December 31, 2015 . In February 2016, the property was sold. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we also managed an office building with approximately 336,000 &#32;square feet, which is owned by a third party, and held debt and preferred equity investments with a book value of $1.7 billion . 

Our corporate offices are located in midtown Manhattan at 420 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10170. As of December 31, 2015 , our corporate staff consisted of 296 &#32;persons, including 187 &#32;professionals experienced in all aspects of commercial real estate. We can be contacted at (212) 594-2700. We maintain a website at www.slgreen.com . On our website, you can obtain, free of charge, a copy of our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such material electronically with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. We have also made available on our website our audit committee charter, compensation committee charter, nominating and corporate governance committee charter, code of business conduct and ethics and corporate governance principles. We do not intend for information contained on our website to be part of this annual report on Form 10-K. You can also read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at its Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, 

DC 20549 (1-800-SEC-0330). The SEC maintains an Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. 

Unless the context requires otherwise, all references to the "Company," "SL Green," "we," "our" and "us" in this annual report means SL Green Realty Corp., a Maryland corporation, and one or more of its subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership, or, as the context may require, SL Green only or the Operating Partnership only, and "S.L. Green Properties" means S.L. Green Properties, Inc., a New York corporation, as well as the affiliated partnerships and other entities through which Stephen L. Green has historically conducted commercial real estate activities. 

Corporate Structure 

In connection with the Company's initial public offering, or IPO, in August 1997, the Operating Partnership received a contribution of interests in real estate properties as well as a 95% economic, non-voting interest in the management, leasing and construction companies affiliated with S.L. Green Properties. We refer to these management, leasing and construction entities, which are owned by SL Green Management Corp, as the "Service Corporation." The Company is organized so as to qualify and have elected to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. 

Substantially all of our assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted through, the Operating Partnership. We are the sole managing general partner of the Operating Partnership, and as of December 31, 2015 , we owned 96.39% &#32;of its economic interests. All of the management and leasing operations with respect to our wholly-owned properties are conducted through SL Green Management LLC, or Management LLC. The Operating Partnership owns a 100% interest in Management LLC. 

In order to maintain the Company's qualification as a REIT while realizing income from management, leasing and construction contracts with third parties and joint venture properties, all of these service operations are conducted through the Service Corporation, a consolidated variable interest entity. We, through our Operating Partnership, expect to receive substantially all of the cash flow from the Service Corporation's operations. All of the voting common stock of the Service Corporation is held by an entity owned and controlled by the chairman of the Company's board of directors. 

Business and Growth Strategies 

SL Green is New York City's largest commercial landlord and an S&#38;P 500 company that is focused primarily on acquiring, managing and maximizing the value of Manhattan commercial properties. 

Our core business is the ownership of high quality commercial properties and our primary business objective is to maximize the total return to stockholders, through growth in funds from operations and through asset value appreciation. The commercial real estate expertise resulting from owning, operating, investing and lending in Manhattan for over 35 years has enabled us to invest in a collection of premier office and retail properties, selected multifamily residential assets, and high quality debt and preferred equity investments. We also own high quality office properties in the surrounding markets of Brooklyn, Long Island, Westchester County, Connecticut and New Jersey. 

We are led by a strong, experienced management team that provides a foundation of skills in all aspects of property ownership and management including acquisitions, dispositions, management, leasing, operations, capital improvements, and financing. It is with this team that we have achieved a market leading position in our targeted submarkets. 

We seek to enhance the value of our company by executing strategies that include the following: 

&#8226; 

Leasing and property management, which capitalizes on our extensive presence and knowledge of the marketplaces in which we operate; 

&#8226; 

Acquiring office, retail and residential properties and employing our local market skills to reposition these assets to create incremental cash flow and capital appreciation; 

&#8226; 

Investing in debt and preferred equity positions that generate consistent strong risk-adjusted returns, increase the breadth of our market insight, foster key market relationships and source potential future investment opportunities; 

&#8226; 

Executing dispositions through sales or joint ventures that harvest embedded equity that has been generated through management's value enhancing activities; and 

&#8226; 

Maintaining a liquid balance sheet with access to diversified sources of property and corporate capital. 

Leasing and Property Management 

We seek to capitalize on our management's extensive knowledge of the Manhattan and Suburban markets and the needs of our tenants through proactive leasing and management programs, which include: (i) use of in-depth market experience resulting from managing and leasing tens of millions of square feet of office and retail space since the Company was founded, predominantly in Manhattan; (ii) careful tenant management, which results in long average lease terms and a manageable lease expiration schedule; (iii) utilization of an extensive network of third-party brokers to supplement our in-house leasing team; (iv) use of comprehensive building management analysis and planning; and (v) commitment to tenant satisfaction by providing high quality tenant services at competitive rental rates. 

It is our belief that our proactive leasing efforts have directly contributed to our average portfolio occupancy consistently exceeding the market average. 

Property Acquisitions 

We acquire core properties for long-term value appreciation and earnings growth. We also acquire non-core properties that are typically held for shorter periods during which we intend to create significant increases in value. This strategy has resulted in capital gains that increase our investment capital base. In implementing this strategy, we continually evaluate potential acquisition opportunities. These acquisitions may come from new properties as well as properties in which we already hold a joint venture interest or from our debt and preferred equity investments. 

Through intimate knowledge of our markets we have developed an ability to source transactions with superior risk-adjusted returns by capturing off-market opportunities that lead to acquisitions at meaningful discounts to replacement costs. In rising markets, we acquire strategic vacancies that provide the opportunity to take advantage of our exceptional leasing and repositioning capabilities to increase cash flow and property value. In stable or falling markets, we target assets featuring credit tenancies with fully escalated in-place rents to provide cash flow stability near-term and the opportunity for increases over time. 

Over the last several years, we have expanded our acquisition activities into selected high value retail locations in Manhattan, and multifamily properties. Management&#8217;s breadth of activities in New York City have enabled us to identify and acquire off-market retail in prime Manhattan locations. Combining our real estate skills and ability to attract premier tenants in an environment of growing retail rents has resulted in transactions that have provided significant capital appreciation. In addition, this same market penetration has permitted us to grow a portfolio of high quality, well-located multifamily properties 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;In acquiring core and non-core properties, directly or through joint ventures with a predominance of high quality institutional investors, we believe that we have the following advantages over many of our competitors: (i) senior management's average 27 years of experience leading a full-service, fully-integrated real estate company focused on the Manhattan office market; (ii) the ability to offer tax-advantaged structures to sellers through the exchange of ownership interests, including units in our Operating Partnership; and (iii) the ability to close transactions quickly despite complicated structures. 

Property Repositioning 

Our extensive knowledge of the markets in which we operate and our ability to efficiently plan and execute capital projects provide the expertise to enhance returns by repositioning properties that are underperforming. Many of the retail and commercial office properties we own or seek to acquire feature unique architectural design elements, including large floor plates, and other amenities and characteristics that can be appealing to tenants when fully exploited. Our strategic investment in these properties, combined with our active management and pro-active leasing, provide the opportunity to creatively meet market needs and generate favorable returns. 

Debt and Preferred Equity Investments 

We invest in well-collateralized debt and preferred equity investments that generate attractive yields. See Note 5, "Debt and Preferred Equity Investments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Knowledge of our markets and our leasing and asset management expertise provide underwriting capabilities that enable a highly educated assessment of risk and return. The benefits of this investment program, which has a carefully managed aggregate size generally not to exceed 10% &#32;of our total enterprise value, include the following: 

&#8226; 

Our typical investments generally provide high current returns and, in certain cases, the potential for future capital gains. Because we are the largest commercial landlord in Manhattan, our expertise and operating capabilities provide both insight and operating skills that mitigate risk. 

&#8226; 

In certain cases, these investments may also serve as a potential source of real estate acquisitions for us. This is particularly true when a property's current ownership seeks an efficient off-market transaction, because the current ownership knows that we have already gained knowledge of the asset through the existing investment, and that we can close more efficiently than others if we believe such acquisition would be beneficial. 

&#8226; 

These investments are concentrated in Manhattan, which helps us gain market insight, awareness of upcoming investment opportunities and foster key relationships that may provide access to future investment opportunities. 

Property Dispositions 

We continually evaluate our properties to identify those most suitable to meet our long-term earnings and cash flow growth objectives and contribute to increasing portfolio value. Properties that no longer meet our objectives are evaluated for sale, or in certain cases, joint venture to release equity created through management's value enhancement programs or to take advantage of opportune market valuations. 

The capital proceeds generated from these dispositions can be efficiently re-deployed into property acquisitions and debt and preferred equity investments that we expect will provide enhanced future capital gains and earnings growth opportunities. Management may also elect to utilize the capital proceeds from these dispositions to repay existing indebtedness of the Company or its subsidiaries or increase cash liquidity. 

Capital Resources 

Our objective is to maintain numerous corporate and property level capital sources to obtain the most appropriate and lowest cost financings. This objective is supported by: 

&#8226; 

Property operations that generally provide stable and growing cash flows through market cycles due to constraints on new supply in Manhattan, long average lease terms, high credit quality tenants and superior leasing, operating and asset management skills; 

&#8226; 

Concentration of our activities in a Manhattan market that is consistently attractive to property investors and lenders through market cycles relative to other market participants; 

&#8226; 

Maintaining strong corporate liquidity and careful management of future debt maturities; and 

&#8226; 

Maintaining access to corporate capital markets through balanced financing and investment activities that result in strong balance sheet and cash flow metrics. 

Competition 

The leasing of real estate is highly competitive, especially in the Manhattan office market. We compete for tenants with landlords and developers of similar properties located in our markets primarily on the basis of location, rent charged, services provided, balance sheet strength and liquidity and the design and condition of our properties. We face competition from other real estate companies, including other REITs that currently invest in markets other than or in addition to Manhattan, private real estate funds, domestic and foreign financial institutions, life insurance companies, pension trusts, partnerships, individual investors and others that may have greater financial resources or access to capital than we do or that are willing to acquire properties in transactions which are more highly leveraged or with different financial attributes than we are willing to pursue. 

Manhattan Office Market Overview 

Manhattan is by far the largest office market in the United States, containing more rentable square feet than the next five largest central business district office markets combined. The properties in our portfolio are concentrated in some of Manhattan's most prominent midtown locations. 

According to Cushman and Wakefield Research Services as of December 31, 2015, Manhattan has a total inventory of approximately 394.7 million &#32;square feet, including approximately 240.3 million &#32;square feet in Manhattan. Cushman and Wakefield Reserch Services estimates that in midtown Manhattan, approximately 4.0 million &#32;square feet of new construction will become available next year, approximately 41.7% &#32;of which is pre-leased. This increase is partially offset by approximately 1.4 million &#32;square feet that is projected to be converted from office use to an alternative use. This will add approximately 1.01% to Manhattan's total inventory gross of conversions and 0.7% &#32;net of conversions. 

General Terms of Leases in the Manhattan Markets 

Leases entered into for space in Manhattan typically contain terms that may not be contained in leases in other U.S. office markets. The initial term of leases entered into for space in Manhattan is generally seven to fifteen years. Tenants leasing space in excess of 10,000 square feet for an initial term of 10 years or longer often will negotiate an option to extend the term of the lease for one or two renewal periods, typically for a term of five years each. The base rent during the initial term often will provide for agreed-upon periodic increases over the term of the lease. Base rent for renewal terms is most often based upon the then fair market rental value of the premises as of the commencement date of the applicable renewal term (generally determined by binding arbitration in the event the landlord and the tenant are unable to mutually agree upon the fair market value), though base rent for a renewal period may be set at 95% of the then fair market rent. Very infrequently, leases may contain termination options whereby a tenant can terminate the lease obligation before the lease expiration date upon payment of a penalty together with repayment of the unamortized portion of the landlord's transaction costs (e.g., brokerage commissions, free rent periods, tenant improvement allowances, etc.). 

In addition to base rent, a tenant will generally also pay its pro rata share of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses for the building over a base year, which is typically the year during which the term of the lease commences, based upon the tenant's proportionate occupancy of the building. In some smaller leases (generally less than 10,000 square feet), in lieu of paying additional rent based upon increases in building operating expenses, base rent will be increased each year during the lease term by a set percentage on a compounding basis (though the tenant will still pay its pro rata share of increases in real estate taxes over a base year). 

Tenants typically receive a free rent period following commencement of the lease term, which in some cases may coincide with the tenant's construction period. 

The landlord most often supplies electricity either on a sub-metered basis at the landlord's cost plus a fixed percentage or a rent inclusion basis (i.e., a fixed fee is added to the base rent for electricity, which amount may increase based upon increases in electricity rates or increases in electrical usage by the tenant). Base building services, other than electricity, such as heat, air conditioning, freight elevator service during business hours and base building cleaning typically are provided at no additional cost, but are included in the building's operating expenses. The tenant will typically pay additional rent only for services which exceed base building services or for services which are provided other than during normal business hours. 

In a typical lease for a new tenant renting in excess of 10,000 square feet, the landlord will deliver the premises with existing improvements demolished. In such instances, the landlord will typically provide a tenant improvement allowance, which is a fixed sum that the landlord makes available to the tenant to reimburse the tenant for all or a portion of the tenant's initial construction of its premises. Such sum typically is payable as work progresses, upon submission by the tenant of invoices for the cost of construction and lien waivers. However, in certain leases (most often for relatively small amounts of space), the landlord will construct the premises for the tenant at a cost to the landlord not to exceed an agreed upon amount with the tenant paying any amount in excess of the agreed upon amount. In addition, landlords may rent space to a tenant that is "pre-built" (i.e., space that was constructed by the landlord in advance of lease signing and is ready to for the tenant to move in with the tenant selecting paint and carpet colors).

Rent Growth 

We are constantly evaluating the conditions of the markets in which we operate in order to assess the potential rent growth embedded in our portfolio. We estimated that rents in place at December 31, 2015 &#32;for all leases expiring in future periods, excluding triple net leases, in our Manhattan and Suburban consolidated operating properties were 16.3% &#32;and 7.4% , respectively, below management's estimates of current market asking rents. Taking rents are typically lower than asking rents and may vary from building to building. We estimated that rents in place at December 31, 2015 &#32;for all leases expiring in future periods, excluding triple net leases, in our Manhattan and Suburban operating properties owned through unconsolidated joint ventures were 8.4% &#32;and 2.3% , respectively, below management's estimates of current market asking rents. At December 31, 2014 , the estimated rents in place for our Manhattan and Suburban consolidated operating properties were 13.6% &#32;and 3.2% , respectively, below management's estimates of the then current market asking rents. At December 31, 2014 , the estimated rents in place for our Manhattan and Suburban unconsolidated operating properties were 8.3% &#32;and 1.8% , respectively, below management's estimates of the then current market asking rents. As of December 31, 2015 , 33.0% &#32;and 52.7% &#32;of all leases in-place in our Manhattan and Suburban consolidated operating properties, respectively, were scheduled to expire during the next five years. As of December 31, 2015 , 38.3% &#32;and 40.1% &#32;of all leases in-place in our Manhattan and Suburban operating properties owned through unconsolidated joint ventures, respectively, were also scheduled to expire during the next five years. There can be no assurances that our estimates of current market rents are accurate, that market rents currently prevailing will not erode in the future or that we will realize any 

rent growth. However, we believe that rents, which in the current portfolio are below market, provide a potential for long-term internal growth. 

Industry Segments 

The Company is a REIT that acquires, owns, repositions, manages and leases commercial office, retail and multifamily properties in the New York Metropolitan area and has two reportable segments: real estate and debt and preferred equity investments. We evaluate real estate performance and allocate resources based on earnings contribution to income from continuing operations. 

At December 31, 2015 , our real estate portfolio was primarily located in one geographical market, the New York Metropolitan area. The primary sources of revenue are generated from tenant rents and escalations and reimbursement revenue. Real estate property operating expenses consist primarily of security, maintenance, utility costs, real estate taxes and, at certain properties, ground rent expense. As of December 31, 2015 , three tenants in our office portfolio contributed 9.7% , 9.1%, and 6.2% of our office portfolio annualized cash rent. No other tenant contributed more than 5.0% &#32;of our office portfolio annualized cash rent. Office portfolio annualized cash rent includes our consolidated annualized cash rent and our share of joint venture annualized cash rent. No property contributed in excess of 10.0% &#32;of our consolidated total revenue for 2015 . Our industry segments are discussed in Note 22, "Segment Information," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

In January 2016, the tenant that contributed 9.7% of our office portfolio annualized cash rent executed a purchase option provided to them in the lease for the property at 388-390 Greenwich Street in Manhattan.
