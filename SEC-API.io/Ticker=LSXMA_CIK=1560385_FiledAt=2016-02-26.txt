 Item 1. Business. 

&#160; 

(a) &#160; General Development of Business 

&#160; 

Liberty Media Corporation (&#8220;Liberty&#8221;, the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221;) owns interests in subsidiaries and other companies which are engaged in the media and entertainment industries. Through our subsidiaries and affiliates, we principally operate in North America. Our principal businesses and assets include our consolidated subsidiaries SIRIUS XM (defined below) and the Braves Holdings, LLC (&#8220;Braves Holdings&#8221;), and our equity affiliate Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (&#8220;Live Nation&#8221;). 

&#160; 

In September 2011, Liberty Interactive Corporation (&#8220;Liberty Interactive&#8221; and formerly named Liberty Media Corporation) completed the split-off of its former wholly-owned subsidiary (then known as Liberty Media Corporation) from its Liberty Interactive tracking stock group (the &#8220;Split-Off&#8221;). 

&#160; 

During August 2012, the Board of Directors of Starz (formerly known as Liberty Media Corporation) authorized a plan to distribute to the stockholders of Starz shares of a wholly-owned subsidiary, Liberty ( formerly known as Liberty Spinco, Inc.), that held, as of January 11, 2013, all of the businesses, assets and liabilities of Starz not associated with Starz, LLC (with the exception of the Starz, LLC office building) (the "Starz Spin-Off"). The transaction was effected as a pro-rata dividend of shares of Liberty to the stockholders of Starz. The businesses, assets and liabilities not included in Liberty are part of a separate public company which was renamed Starz. 

&#160; 

Due to the relative significance of Liberty to Starz (the legal spinnor) and senior management's continued involvement with Liberty following the Starz Spin-Off, Liberty was treated as the "accounting successor" to Starz for financial reporting purposes, notwithstanding the legal form of the Starz Spin-Off previously described. Therefore, the historical financial statements of Starz continue to be the historical financial statements of Liberty and Starz, LLC has been treated as discontinued operations upon completion of the Starz Spin-Off in the first quarter of 2013. For purposes of this Form 10-K, Liberty is treated as the spinnor for purposes of discussion and as a practical matter for describing all the historical information contained herein. 

&#160; 

On January 18, 2013, Liberty, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, purchased 50,000,000 shares of the common stock (&#8220;SIRIUS XM Common Stock&#8221;), par value $0.001 per share, of SIRIUS XM Radio, Inc. (now known as Sirius XM Holdings Inc., &#8220;SIRIUS XM&#8221;) for $3.1556 per share in a block purchase from a financial institution (the &#8220;Block Transaction&#8221;). The Company used available cash on hand to acquire the shares of SIRIUS XM Common Stock in the Block Transaction. Additionally, on January 18, 2013 a subsidiary of the Company converted all of its remaining shares of SIRIUS XM's Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B-1, par value $0.001 per share, into 1,293,509,076 shares of SIRIUS XM Common Stock. As a result of these transactions, along with shares of SIRIUS XM Common Stock acquired by the Company and its subsidiaries in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, the Company and its subsidiaries hold more than 50% of the capital stock of SIRIUS XM entitled to vote on any matter, including the election of directors. Therefore, Liberty began consolidating SIRIUS XM in the first quarter of 2013. 

&#160; 

On October 9, 2013, Liberty entered into a share repurchase agreement with SIRIUS XM pursuant to which SIRIUS XM agreed to acquire approximately 136. 6 million SIRIUS XM shares for $500 million . Approximately &#160; 43. 7 million shares w ere repurchased in 2013 for $160 million in proceeds and the remaining shares were repurchased in 2014 for proceeds of $340 million . The retirement of SIRIUS XM shares on a consolidated basis did not significantly impact the consolidated results as it only required an adjustment to noncontrolling interest as the shares were repurchased and retired. Additionally, during 2014, SIRIUS XM entered into certain accelerated share repurchase agreements pursuant to which SIRIUS XM repurchased approximately 223.2 million shares for approximately $756 million. SIRIUS XM repurchased approximately 524.2 million, 423.0 million and 476.5 million shares of SIRIUS XM common stock during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, for $2.0 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. Liberty continues to maintain a controlling interest in SIRIUS XM following the comp letion of the share repurchases. 

I- 1 

&#160;

SIRIUS XM, since the date of our investment, has repurchased approximately 1.8 billion SIRIUS XM shares for approximately $6.3 billion (including the shares repurchased from Liberty discussed above). As of December 31, 2015 our economic ownership interest in SIRIUS XM is approximately 61%. 

During 2014, Liberty&#8217;s board approved the issuance of shares of its Series C common stock to holders of its Series A and Series B common stock, effected by means of a dividend. On July 23, 2014, holders of Series A and Series B common stock as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 7, 2014, the record date for the dividend, received a dividend of two shares of Series C common stock for each share of Series A or Series B common stock held by them as of the record date. The impact of the Series C common stock issuance has been reflected retroactively due to the treatment of the dividend as a stock split for accounting purposes. Additionally, in connection with the Series C common stock issuance and the Broadband Spin-Off (defined below), outstanding Series A common stock warrants were adjusted, as well as the number of shares covered by outstanding cash convertible note hedges and purchased call options (the &#8220;Bond Hedge Transaction&#8221;). There were 21,085,900 warrants with a strike price of $64.46 outstanding at December 31, 2015. The number of shares covered by the Bond Hedge Transaction was adjusted to 21,085,900 shares of Liberty Series A common stock and the strike price was adjusted to $47.43 per share, which corresponds to the adjusted conversion price of our 1.375% Cash Convertible Senior Notes due 2023. 

On November 4, 2014, Liberty completed the spin-off to its stockholders of common stock of a newly formed company called Liberty Broadband Corporation ("Liberty Broadband") (the &#8220;Broadband Spin-Off&#8221;). Shares of Liberty Broadband were distributed to the shareholders of Liberty as of a record date of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 29, 2014. Liberty Broadband is comprised of, among other things, (i) Liberty&#8217;s former interest in Charter Communications, Inc. (&#8220;Charter&#8221;), (ii) Liberty&#8217;s former subsidiary TruePosition, Inc. (&#8220;TruePosition&#8221;), (iii) Liberty&#8217;s former minority equity investment in Time Warner Cable, Inc. ("Time Warner Cable"), (iv) certain deferred tax liabilities, as well as liabilities related to Time Warner Cable call options and (v) initial indebtedness, pursuant to margin loans entered into prior to the completion of the Broadband Spin-Off. Prior to the completion of the Broadband Spin-Off, Liberty Broadband borrowed funds under margin loans and made a final distribution to Liberty of approximately $300 million in cash. The Broadband Spin-Off was intended to be tax-free to stockholders of Liberty. In the Broadband Spin-Off, record holders of Liberty Series A, Series B and Series C common stock received one share of the corresponding series of Liberty Broadband common stock for every four shares of Liberty common stock held by them as of the record date for the Broadband Spin-Off, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. 

During November 2015, Liberty&#8217;s board of directors authorized management to pursue a reclassification of the Company&#8217;s common stock into three new tracking stock groups, one to be designated as the Liberty Braves tracking stock, one to be designated as the Liberty Media tracking stock and one to be designated as the Liberty SiriusXM tracking stock, and to cause to be distributed subscription rights related to the Liberty Braves tracking stock following the creation of the new tracking stocks. 

In connection with the creation of the new tracking stocks, each outstanding share of Liberty&#8217;s Series A, Series B and Series C common stock would be cancelled and reclassified by exchanging each such share for newly issued shares of the corresponding series of Liberty Braves tracking stock, Liberty Media tracking stock and Liberty SiriusXM tracking stock. Cash will be paid in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares. In addition, following the creation of the new tracking stocks, Liberty would distribute to holders of its Liberty Braves tracking stock subscription rights to acquire shares of Series C Liberty Braves tracking stock. The record dates, distribution dates, and distribution ratios for the creation of the new tracking stocks and the distribution of subscription rights will be announced at a later date. 

The Liberty Braves tracking stock would be intended to track and reflect the separate economic performance of the businesses, assets and liabilities to be attributed to the Liberty Braves Group. Liberty intends to attribute to the Liberty Braves Group its subsidiary, Braves Holdings, LLC (&#8220;Braves Holdings&#8221;), which indirectly owns the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball Club (&#8220;ANLBC&#8221;) and certain assets and liabilities associated with ANLBC&#8217;s stadium and mixed use development project (the &#8220;Development Project&#8221;), cash and all liabilities arising under a note from Braves Holdings to Liberty, with total capacity of up to $165 million of borrowings by Braves Holdings (the &#8220;Intergroup Note&#8221;) relating to funds to be borrowed and used for investment in the Development Project. The Intergroup Note is expected to be repaid using proceeds from the proposed subscription rights offering (as described in more detail below). Any remaining proceeds from the rights offering will be attributed to the Liberty Braves Group. 

I- 2 

&#160;

The Liberty SiriusXM tracking stock would be intended to track and reflect the separate economic performance of the businesses, assets and liabilities to be attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group. Liberty intends to attribute to the Liberty SiriusXM Group its subsidiary SIRIUS XM, cash and its margin loan obligation incurred by a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary of Liberty. 

The Liberty Media tracking stock would be intended to track and reflect the separate economic performance of the businesses, assets and liabilities to be attributed to the Liberty Media Group. Liberty intends to attribute to the Liberty Media Group all of the businesses, assets and liabilities of Liberty other than those specifically attributed to the Liberty Braves Group or the Liberty SiriusXM Group, including Liberty&#8217;s interests in Live Nation, minority equity investments in Time Warner, Inc. and Viacom, Inc., the Intergroup Note, any recovery received in connection with the Vivendi lawsuit and cash, as well as Liberty&#8217;s 1.375% Cash Convertible Notes due 2023 and related financial instruments. Following the creation of the tracking stocks, the Liberty Media Group will also hold an approximate 20% inter-group interest in the Liberty Braves Group. 

The subscription rights to acquire shares of Series C Liberty Braves tracking stock are expected to be issued to raise capital to repay the Intergroup Note and for working capital purposes. The subscription rights would enable the holders to acquire shares of Series C Liberty Braves tracking stock at a 20% discount to the market price of the Series C Liberty Braves tracking stock. Liberty expects the subscription rights to be publicly traded, once the exercise price has been established and the rights offering to expire twenty trading days following its commencement. 

Liberty expects that the Series A, Series B and Series C Liberty Braves Group common stock will trade under the symbols BATRA/B/K respectively, that the Series A, Series B and Series C Liberty Media Group common stock will trade under the symbols LMCA/B/K, respectively, and that the Series A, Series B and Series C Liberty SiriusXM Group common stock will trade under the symbols LSXMA/B/K, respectively. Liberty expects that Series A and Series C of each of the Liberty Braves tracking stock and the Liberty Media tracking stock will trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market and that Series B of each of these stocks will trade on the OTC Markets. In addition, Liberty expects that each series (Series A, Series B and Series C) of the Liberty SiriusXM tracking stock will trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 

The creation of the new tracking stocks will be subject to various conditions, including the requisite approval of the holders of Liberty&#8217;s common stock at a stockholders&#8217; meeting and the receipt of the opinion of tax counsel. Liberty expects to complete the creation of the new tracking stocks in the first half of 2016. The rights offering will also be subject to various conditions, including the creation of the new tracking stocks.

&#160;

&#160; 

Distribution of Radios 

&#160; 

Automakers . SIRIUS XM distributes satellite radios through the sale and lease of new vehicles. SIRIUS XM has agreements with every major automaker to offer satellite radios in their vehicles. Satellite radios are available as a factory or dealer-installed option in substantially all vehicle makes sold in the United States. Most automakers include a subscription to SIRIUS XM's radio service in the sale or lease of their new vehicles. In certain cases, SIRIUS XM receives subscription payments from automakers in advance of the activation of its service. SIRIUS XM shares with certain automakers a portion of the revenue it derives from subscribers using vehicles equipped to receive SIRIUS XM&#8217;s service. SIRIUS XM also reimburses various automakers for certain costs associated with the satellite radios installed in new vehicles, including in certain cases hardware costs, engineering expenses and promotional and advertising expenses. 

Previously Owned Vehicles . SIRIUS XM also acquires subscribers through the sale and lease of previously owned vehicles with factory-installed satellite radios. SIRIUS XM has entered into agreements with many automakers to market subscriptions to purchasers and lessees of vehicles which include satellite radios sold through their certified pre-owned programs. SIRIUS XM also works directly with many franchise and independent dealers on programs for non-certified vehicles. SIRIUS XM has developed systems and methods to identify purchasers and lessees of previously owned vehicles which include satellite radios and have established marketing plans to promote its services to these potential subscribers. 

&#160; 

Retail . SIRIUS XM sells satellite radios directly to consumers through its website. Satellite radios are also marketed and distributed through national and regional retailers. 

&#160; 

SIRIUS XM's Satellite Radio Systems 

&#160; 

SIRIUS XM's satellite radio systems are designed to provide clear reception in most areas despite variations in terrain, buildings and other obstructions. SIRIUS XM continually monitors its infrastructure and regularly evaluates improvements in technology. 

&#160; 

SIRIUS XM's satellite radio systems have three principal components: satellites, terrestrial repeaters and other satellite facilities; studios; and radios. 

&#160; 

Satellites, Terrestrial Repeaters and Other Satellite Facilities 

&#160; 

Satellites . SIRIUS XM provides its service through a fleet of eight orbiting satellites, five in the Sirius system, FM-1, FM-2, FM-3, FM-5 and FM-6, and three in the XM system, XM-3, XM-4 and XM-5. SIRIUS XM&#8217;s constellation of three XM satellites operate in a geostationary orbit, with XM-5 used as a spare for both the XM and Sirius constellations. SIRIUS XM&#8217;s constellation of five Sirius satellites operate in two separate orbits. Three of the Sirius satellites, FM-1, FM-2 and FM-3, operate in a hig hly inclined elliptical orbit. The other two Sirius satellites, FM-5 and FM-6, ope rate in a geostationary orbit. SIRIUS XM plans to transition its Sirius constellation to solely a geostationary orbit using the FM-5 and FM-6 satellites. As part of this transition, FM-1, FM-2 and FM-3 are expected to be moved into disposal orbits during 2016. 

Satellite Insurance . SIRIUS XM does not have in-orbit insurance policies covering its satellites, as SIRIUS XM considers the premium costs to be uneconomical relative to the risk of satellite failure. 

&#160; 

Terrestrial Repeaters . In some areas with high concentrations of tall buildings, such as urban centers, signals from SIRIUS XM's satellites may be blocked and reception of satellite signals can be adversely affected. In many of these areas, SIRIUS XM has deployed terrestrial repeaters to supplement satellite coverage. SIRIUS XM operates over 1,100 terrestrial repeaters as part of its systems across the United States. 

&#160; 

Other Satellite Facilities . SIRIUS XM controls and communicates with its satellites from facilities in North America and maintains earth stations in Panama and Ecuador to control and communicate with three of its Sirius system satellites , FM-1, FM-2 and FM-3 . Its satellites are monitored, tracked and controlled by a third party satellite operator. 

&#160; 

I- 7 

&#160;

Studios 

&#160; 

SIRIUS XM's programming originates from studios in New York City and Washington, D.C., and, to a lesser extent, from smaller studios in Los Angeles, Nashville and a variety of smaller venues across the country. SIRIUS XM&#8217;s headquarters are based in New York City. Both its New York City and Washington D.C. offices house facilities for programming origination, programming personnel and facilities to transmit programming. 

&#160; 

Radios 

&#160; 

Radios are primarily manufactured in two principal configurations: in-dash radios and dock &#38; play radios. 

&#160; 

SIRIUS XM does not manufacture radios. SIRIUS XM has authorized manufacturers and distributors to produce and distribute radios, and has licensed its technology to various electronics manufacturers to develop, manufacture and distribute radios under certain brands. SIRIUS XM manages various aspects of the production of satellite radios. To facilitate the sale of radios, SIRIUS XM may subsidize a portion of the radio manufacturing costs to reduce the hardware price to consumers. 

&#160; 

Connected Vehicle Services 

&#160; 

SIRIUS XM also provides connected vehicle services. SIRIUS XM's connected vehicle services are designed to enhance the safety, security and driving experience for vehicle operators while providing marketing and operational benefits to automakers and their dealers. SIRIUS XM offers a portfolio of location-based services through two-way wireless connectivity, including safety, security, convenience, maintenance and data services, remote vehicles diagnostics, stolen or parked vehicle locator services, and monitoring of vehicle emission systems. SIRIUS XM&#8217;s connected vehicle business provides services to several automakers, including Acura, BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Infiniti, Lexus, Nissan and Toyota. 

&#160; 

Canada 

&#160; 

SIRIUS XM also has an equity interest in the satellite radio services offered in Canada through its investment in Sirius XM Canada Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;SIRIUS XM Canada&#8221;). SIRIUS XM owns approximately 37% of the equity of SIRIUS XM Canada. Subscribers to the services offered by SIRIUS XM Canada are not included in the subscriber count above or subscriber-based operating metrics. 

&#160; 

Other Services 

&#160; 

Commercial Accounts . SIRIUS XM's programming is available for commercial establishments. Commercial subscription accounts are available through providers of in-store entertainment solutions and directly from SIRIUS XM. Certain commercial subscribers are included in SIRIUS XM&#8217;s subscriber count. 

&#160; 

Satellite Television Service . &#160; Certain of SIRIUS XM's music channels are offered as part of certain programming packages on the DISH Network satellite television service. Subscribers to the DISH Network satellite television service are not included in SIRIUS XM's subscriber count. 

&#160; 

Subscribers to the following services are not included in SIRIUS XM's subscriber count, unless the applicable service is purchased by the subscriber separately and not as part of a radio subscription to SIRIUS XM services:

Copyrights to Programming 

&#160; 

In connection with its satellite radio music programming, SIRIUS XM must negotiate and enter into royalty arrangements with two sets of rights holders: Holders of copyrights in musical works (that is, the music and lyrics) and holders of copyrights in sound recordings (that is, the actual recording of a work). 

&#160; 

Musical works rights holders, generally songwriters and music publishers, are traditionally represented by performing rights organizations, such as the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (&#8220;ASCAP&#8221;), Broadcast Music, Inc. (&#8220;BMI&#8221;), and SESAC, Inc. (&#8220;SESAC&#8221;). These organizations negotiate fees with copyright users, collect royalties and distribute them to the rights holders. SIRIUS XM has arrangements with all of these organizations. However, the market for rights relating to musical works is changing rapidly. Certain songwriters and music publishers have withdrawn from the traditional performing rights organizations, particularly ASCAP and BMI, and new entities have formed to represent rights holders. In addition, the United States Justice Department is reviewing the consent decrees that have governed ASCAP and BMI since the 1940s and other aspects of the musical works market. The changing market for musical works may have an adverse effect on SIRIUS XM, including increasing its costs or limiting the musical works available to SIRIUS XM. 

&#160; 

Sound recording rights holders, typically large record companies, are primarily represented by SoundExchange, an organization which negotiates licenses, and collects and distributes royalties on behalf of record companies and performing artists. Under the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995 and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, SIRIUS XM may negotiate royalty arrangements with the owners of sound recordings fixed after February 15, 1972, or if negotiation is unsuccessful, the royalty rate is established by the Copyright Royalty Board (the &#8220;CRB&#8221;) of the Library of Congress. 

&#160; 

The CRB has issued its determination regarding the royalty rate payable by SIRIUS XM under the statutory license covering the performance of sound recordings fixed after February 15, 1972 over its satellite digital audio radio service, and the making of ephemeral (server) copies in support of such performances, for the five-year period ending on December 31, 2017. Under the terms of the CRB's decision, SIRIUS XM will pay a royalty based on gross revenue , subject to certain exclusions, of 10.5% for 2016 and 11% for 2017. The rate for 2015 was 10%. 

&#160; 

The revenue subject to royalty includes subscription revenue from SIRIUS XM's U.S. satellite digital audio radio subscribers and advertising revenue from channels other than those channels that make only incidental performances of sound recordings. Exclusions from revenue subject to the statutory license fee include, among other things, revenue from channels, programming and products or other services offered for a separate charge where such channels make only incidental performances of sound recordings; revenue from equipment sales; revenue from current and future data services (including video and connected vehicle services) offered for a separate charge; intellectual property royalties received by SIRIUS XM; credit card, invoice and fulfillment service fees; and bad debt expense. The regulations also allow SIRIUS XM to further reduce its monthly royalty fee in proportion to the percentage of its performances that feature pre-1972 recordings (which are not subject to federal copyright protection) as well as those that are licensed directly from the copyright holder, rather than through the statutory license. 

&#160; 

To secure the rights to stream music content over the Internet, including to mobile devices, SIRIUS XM also must obtain licenses from, and pay royalties to, copyright owners of musical compositions and, in certain cases, sound recordings. SIRIUS XM has arrangements with ASCAP, SESAC and BMI to license the musical compositions it streams over the Internet. The licensing of certain sound recordings fixed after February 15, 1972 for use on the Internet is also subject to the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act of 1995 and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 on terms established by the CRB. In 2015, SIRIUS XM paid a per performance rate for the streaming of c ertain sound recordings on the I nternet of $0.0024 per play. 

In December 2015, the CRB released the rates and terms for the use of sound recordings by non-interactive Internet services, such as SIRIUS XM&#8217;s Internet radio service, for the period of 2016 through 2020. Effective as of January 1, 

I- 9 

&#160;

2016, the CRB set a royalty rate at $0.0017 per performance for ad-supported services and a royalty rate at $0.0022 per performance for subscription based services. In accordance with the CRB&#8217;s decision, these royalty rates will increase during the period from 2017 through 2020 based on the consumer price index. 

&#160; 

SIRIUS XM&#8217;s rights to perform certain copyrighted sound recordings (that is, the actual recording of a work) that were fixed after February 15, 1972 are governed by United States federal law, the Copyright Act. In contrast, SIRIUS XM&#8217;s rights to perform certain sound recordings that were fixed before February 15, 1972 are governed by state statutes and common law and are subject to litigation in five states. 

&#160; 

Trademarks 

&#160; 

SIRIUS XM registered, and intends to maintain, the trademarks &#8220;Sirius&#8221;, &#8220;XM&#8221;, &#8220;SiriusXM&#8221; and &#8220;SXM&#8221; with the United States Patent and Trademark Office in connection with the services it offers. SIRIUS XM is not aware of any material claims of infringement or other challenges to its right to use the &#8220;Sirius&#8221;, &#8220;XM&#8221;, &#8220;SiriusXM&#8221; or "SXM&#8221; trademarks in the United States. SIRIUS XM also has registered, and intends to maintain, trademarks for the names of certain of its channels. SIRIUS XM has also registered the trademarks &#8220;Sirius&#8221;, &#8220;XM&#8221; and "SiriusXM" in Canada. SIRIUS XM has granted a license to use certain of its trademarks in Canada to Sirius XM Canada. 

&#160; 

Braves Holdings, LLC 

Braves Holdings (collectively with its subsidiaries) is the indirect owner and operator of the Major League Baseball (&#8220;MLB&#8221;) club the Atlanta Braves (&#8220;Braves&#8221;, the &#8220;club&#8221; and the &#8220;team&#8221;) and certain assets and liabilities associated with the Braves&#8217; stadium and Braves Holdings&#8217; mixed use development project, which we refer to as the &#8220;Development Project&#8221; and as described in &#8220;Facilities&#8221; below. We acquired the Braves from Time Warner, Inc. in 2007. 

Business Operations 

Braves Holdings derives revenue from both local and national sources. Team revenue includes revenue from ticket sales, broadcasting rights, shared revenue collected and distributed by MLB, merchandise sales, farm clubs, revenue sharing arrangements and other sources. Revenue related to the Braves&#8217; facilities include corporate sales and naming rights, concessions, advertising, suites and premium seat fees, parking and publications. Ticket sales and broadcasting rights are the team&#8217;s primary revenue drivers. 

Television and Radio Broadcasting. Braves Holdings derives substantial revenue from the sale of broadcasting rights to the Braves&#8217; baseball games. Each MLB club has the right to authorize the television broadcast within its home television territory of games in which it participates, subject to certain exceptions. The Braves have long-term local broadcasting agreements with Sportsouth Network II, LLC, the owner and operator of the SportSouth video programming service (&#8220; Fox SportSouth&#8221; ). Nationally, the Braves participate in the revenue generated from the national broadcasting and radio arrangements negotiated by MLB on behalf of the 30 MLB clubs with ESPN, TBS, Fox and SIRIUS XM (the &#8220;National Broadcast Rights&#8221;). Under the rules and regulations adopted by MLB, as well as a series of other agreements and arrangements that govern the operation and management of an MLB club (collectively, the &#8220;MLB Rules and Regulations&#8221;), the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball (the &#8220;BOC&#8221;) has the authority, acting as the agent on behalf of all of the MLB clubs, to enter into and administer all contracts for the sale of National Broadcast Rights. Each MLB club also has the right to authorize radio broadcast, within the United States (or Canada, in the case of the Toronto Blue Jays), of its games, subject to certain restrictions. The Braves also have the largest radio affiliate network in MLB, with 147 local radio station affiliates broadcasting Braves games across the Southeast (the &#8220;Braves Radio Network&#8221;) 

Ticket Sales. The Braves offer single game tickets, as well as various season ticket packages. The per-ticket average price of 2016 full-season ticket plans ranges from $5.19 to $69.51, depending upon the seating area. In 2012, the Braves instituted a variable pricing strategy to help eliminate the perceived difference in value for certain games, which was often exploited in the secondary market. The club created six pricing tiers per seat, based upon various factors including the day of the week, date and opposing team. The Braves have also begun to encourage fans to use digital ticketing, which allows the club to track important data, put parameters on resales, and provide paperless benefits to its consumers. 

I- 10 

&#160;

Advertising and Corporate Sponsorship. The Braves work with a variety of corporate sponsors to facilitate advertising and promotional opportunities both at Turner Field and the new SunTrust Park. Advertising space is available on the main scoreboard, elsewhere throughout each ballpark and in programs sold at each game. The Braves also enter into long-term licensing agreements for advertising rights with respect to various suites and hospitality spaces. The Braves&#8217; marketing department works closely with the club&#8217;s sponsors to offer contests, sweepstakes and additional entertainment and promotional opportunities during Braves home games, and the club allows the Braves name and logo to be used in connection with certain local promotional activities. The Braves also coordinate advertising placement through the Braves Radio Network, and has a cross-promotional sponsorship and marketing agreement with Fox SportSouth. 

Player Contracts and Salaries. The Collective Bargaining Agreement (the &#8220;CBA&#8221;) requires MLB clubs to sign players using the Uniform Player&#8217;s Contract. The minimum Major League contract salary for players during the 2015 season under the CBA was $507,500. If a player is injured or terminated by the team for lack of skill during the regular season, he is entitled to all of his salary under the contract for the remainder of the year. Contracts may cover one year or multiple years, but generally under multi-year contracts a player&#8217;s salary is guaranteed even if the contract is terminated by the team, or if the player dies or becomes ill, during the term of the contract. The Braves are not required to pay the remaining contract salaries of players who resign or refuse to play. 

Team 

Player Personnel. Under MLB Rules and Regulations, each team is permitted to have 40 players under contract, but may only maintain 25 players on its active roster from the Opening Day of the season through August 31 of each year. During the remainder of the season, teams may keep an active roster consisting of all 40 players under contract. The Braves&#8217; roster reflects the team&#8217;s commitment to developing and securing talented young players, driving future on-field success. 

Player Development. The Braves are associated with six minor league teams located in the United States, five of which are owned by Braves Holdings. The club&#8217;s minor league affiliates are detailed below:

* Not owned by Braves Holdings 

The Braves also operate a baseball academy in the Dominican Republic under the Dominican Summer League. Dominican players, and players from other Latin American countries, are an important source of talent for the Braves and other MLB clubs, but these players may not participate in the first-year draft process (which is limited to only residents of the United States, United States territories, and Canada, including international players who are enrolled in a high school or college in such locations). However, the Braves may enter into contracts with Latin American players, subject to certain MLB Rules and Regulations. 

Facilities 

Turner Field. Since opening in 1997, the &#8220;Home of the Braves&#8221; has been an Atlanta landmark. The stadium was originally constructed for the 1996 Summer Olympic Games, and was known as Centennial Olympic Stadium, before being converted into a baseball park. Turner Field today has just under 50,000 seats, 58 private suites and four private membership clubs: the 755 Club, the SunTrust Club, the Superior Plumbing Club and the Georgia&#8217;s Own Credit Union Club. 

I- 11 

&#160;

Braves Holdings has exclusive operating rights to Turner Field pursuant to an Operating Agreement (the &#8220;Turner Operating Agreement&#8221;) with the Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority (the &#8220;AFCRA&#8221;). Under the current Turner Operating Agreement with AFCRA, the Braves pay an annual operating fee and a capital fee. AFCRA utilizes the capital solely for capital maintenance and repairs. At the end of the Turner Operating Agreement term in 2016, any balance in the Capital Fund may be used by ACFRA in its sole discretion. Braves Holdings has a $500,000 operator fee and a $1.5 million capital fee due for the remainder of the Turner Operating Agreement term, which expires at the end of the 2016 season. On November 11, 2013, the Braves announced that the team would leave Turner Field at the end of the current term of the Turner Operating Agreement. Braves Holdings has since begun construction on a new stadium complex, SunTrust Park, located in Cobb Country, Georgia. 

SunTrust Park. Effective for the 2017 season, the Braves are expected to relocate into a new ballpark located in Cobb County, Georgia. Braves Holdings will have exclusive operating rights to the facility via a Stadium Operating Agreement with Cobb County and the Cobb-Marietta Coliseum and Exhibit Hall Authority (the &#8220;Authority&#8221;). In 2014, Braves Holdings, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, purchased 82 acres of land (of which Braves Holdings has retained title to all but the portion of the parcel underlying the ballpark) for the purpose of constructing a MLB facility and development of a mixed-use complex adjacent to the ballpark. The construction of the new ballpark, which is expected to have a total cost of approximately $672 million, is being funded by a combination of Braves Holdings, Cobb County, the Cumberland Improvement District (the &#8220;CID&#8221;) and the Authority. The Authority has issued $368 million in bonds to fund its portion of the costs, Cobb County is contributing an additional $14 million and the CID is contributing $10 million. Braves Holdings is expected to contribute a minimum of $280 million toward the completion of ballpark. Braves Holdings funding for these initiatives has come from cash reserves and utilization of a construction loan and two credit facilities with aggregate commitments of $520 million. As of December 31, 2015, Braves Holdings had utilized approximately $147 million under these credit arrangements. In addition, Braves Holdings, through affiliated entities and third party development partners, is in the process of developing land around the ballpark for a mixed-use complex, which is expected to feature retail, residential, office, hotel and entertainment opportunities. The expected cost for this mixed-use development is approximately $558 million, and Braves Holdings&#8217; affiliated entities will be responsible for approximately $490 million of such development costs, which Braves Holdings intends to fund with a mix of approximately $200 million in equity and $290 million of new debt. 

Once completed, we believe SunTrust Park will be an industry-leading sports complex spanning approximately 1,100,000 square feet, with 41,200 seats, including 30 suites and 4,200 premium seats, multiple hospitality clubs and retail merchandise venues. The stadium will also feature concessions and restaurant spaces, administrative offices for team operations, sales and marketing, as well as a ticket office, team clubhouse and training rooms. 

Champion Stadium. Champion Stadium in Lake Buena Vista, Florida is the Braves&#8217; spring training facility, and the playing facility of the Braves&#8217; Rookie League affiliate GCL Braves. The stadium is part of the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex at Walt Disney World Resort, and features four luxury sky boxes and more than 9,500 seats. The Braves signed a 20-year lease agreement for the complex in 1997, which will expire after the last day of spring training in 2017. The club receives limited use of the stadium, four practice fields, a half-sized infield, clubhouse, temporary clubhouse space for minor league players and office space for both year-round and spring training operations. 

As the owner of a MLB franchise, Braves Holdings must comply with rules promulgated by the MLB Commissioner and MLB's constitution and bylaws. Each franchise is required to share locally derived revenue with the other MLB franchises and their owners through MLB's revenue sharing plan. Under the MLB rules, each MLB franchise participates in the MLB Central Fund, which acts as a conduit of centrally derived revenue (primarily from National Broadcast Rights, national sponsorships and licensing deals, and the MLB All Star Game) to the clubs, and funds certain expenses (such as contributions to the MLB Players Benefit Plan, administrative and operational expenses of the Commissioner's office, a reserve fund for the Commissioner's office, and administrative expenses of the Central Fund) on behalf of the MLB franchises. Each MLB franchise's share of the Central Fund, following certain adjustments which are made under the MLB revenue share arrangements, is paid to each MLB franchise by the end of each year, unless otherwise determined by the Commissioner. Also under the MLB rules, each MLB franchise is required to participate in and contribute to certain profit sharing initiatives, such as MLB Advanced Media L.P., MLB's interactive media and internet company which runs MLB's official website and all of the MLB teams' websites.

Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. 

&#160; 

Live Nation is considered the largest live entertainment company in the world and seeks to innovate and enhance the live entertainment experience for artists and fans before, during and after the show. Live Nation has four business segments: Concerts, Ticketing, Artist Nation and Sponsorship &#38; Advertising. 

&#160; 

Live Nation's Business Segments &#160; 

&#160; 

Concerts. Live Nation's Concerts segment principally involves the global promotion of live music events in their owned or operated venues and in rented third-party venues, the operation and management of music venues, the production of music festivals across the world and the creation of associated content . During 201 5 , Live Nation's Concerts business generated approximately $ 5.0 billion, or 69%, of Live Nation's total revenue. Live Nation promoted 2 5,5 00 live music events in 201 5 , including artists such as Fleetwood Mac, Kevin Hart, AC/DC, One Direction, Maroon 5 &#160; and Luke Bryan and through festivals such as Electric Daisy Carnival, Rock Werchter, Austin City Limits, Lollapalooza and Bonnaroo . While its Concerts segment operates year-round, Live Nation generally experiences higher revenue during the second and third quarters due to the seasonal nature of shows at its outdoor amphitheaters and festivals, which primarily occur from May through October . Revenue is generally impacted by the number of events, volume of ticket sales and ticket prices. Event costs such as artist fees and production service expenses are included in direct operating expenses and are typically substantial in relation to the revenue. 

&#160; 

Ticketing . Live Nation's Ticketing segment is primarily an agency business that sells tickets for events on behalf of its clients and retains a fixed fee or a percentage of the total convenience charge and order processing fee for its services. Live Nation sells tickets for its events and also for third-party clients across multiple live event categories, providing ticketing services for leading arenas, stadiums, amphitheaters, music clubs, concert promoters, professional sports franchises and leagues, college sports teams, performing arts venues, museums and theaters. Liv e Nation sells tickets through websites, mobile apps, ticket outlets and telephone call centers. During the year ended December 31, 2015, Live Nation sold 69 %, 21 %, 7 % and 3 % of primary tickets through these channels, respectively. Live Nation's Ticketing segment also manages its online activities including enhancements to its websites and bundled product offerings. During 2015, the Ticketing business generated approximately $ 1.6 billion, or 23 % of Live Nation's total revenue, which excludes the face value of tickets sold. Through all of its ticketing services, Live Nation sold 160 million tickets in 2015 on which Live Nation was paid fees for its services. In addition, Live Nation sold approximately 297 million tickets in total using its Ticketmaster system s , through season seat packages and its venue clients' box of fices, for which Live Nation does not receive a fee. Live Nation's ticketing sales are impacted by fluctuations in the availability of events for sale to the public, which may vary depending upon event scheduling by its clients. 

&#160; 

Artist Nation . Live Nation's Artist Nation segment primarily provides management services to music artists and other clients in exchange for a commission on the earnings of these artists. The Artist Nation segment also creates and sells merchandise for music artists at live performances, to retailers and directly to consume rs via the Internet. During 2015 , the Artist Nation business generated approximately $ 439 million, or 6 %, of Live Nation's total revenue. Revenue earned from the Artist Nation segment is impacted to a large degree by the touring schedules of the artists Live Nation represents and generally Live Nation experiences higher revenue during the second and third quarters as the period from May through October tends to be a popular time for touring events. 

&#160; 

Sponsorship &#38; Advertising. Live Nation's Sponsorship &#38; Advertising segment employs a sales force that creates and maintains relationships with sponsors, through a combination of strategic, international, national and local opportunities that allow businesses to reach customers through its concert, venue, artist relationship and ticketing assets, including advertising on Live Nation websites. Live Nation drives increased advertising scale to further monetize its concerts platform through rich media offerings including advertising associated with live streaming and music-related original content. Live Nation works with its corporate clients to help create marketing programs that drive their business goals and connect their brands directly with fans and artists. Live Nation also develops, books and produces custom events or programs for its clients&#8217; specific brands which are typically experienced exclusively by the clients&#8217; customers. These custom events can involve live music events with talent and media, using both online and traditional outlets. During 2015 , the Sponsorship &#38; Advertising business generated approximately $3 34 million, or 5 %, of Live Nation's total revenue. Live 

I- 13 

&#160;

Nation typically experiences higher revenue in the second and third quarters as a large portion of sponsorships are typically associated with our outdoor venues and festivals which are primarily used or occur from May through October. 

&#160; 

Terms of Live Nation Investment 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, we beneficially owned approximately 69.6 million shares of Live Nation common stock, which represented approximately 35% of the issued and outstanding shares as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Under our stockholders agreement with Live Nation, we have the right to nominate two directors (one of whom must qualify as an independent director) to the Live Nation board of directors, currently comprised of 12 directors, for so long as our ownership interest provides us with not less than 5% of the total voting power of Live Nation's equity securities. We also have the right to cause one of our nominees to serve on the audit committee and the compensation committee of the board, provided they meet the independence and other qualifications for membership on those committees. 

&#160; 

We have agreed under the stockholders agreement not to acquire beneficial ownership of Live Nation equity securities that would result in our having in excess of 35% of the voting power of Live Nation's equity securities. That percentage is subject to decrease for specified transfers of our Live Nation stock. We have been exempted from the restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and Live Nation has agreed in the stockholders agreement not to take certain actions that would materially and adversely affect our ability to acquire Live Nation securities up to the voting percentage referred to above. 

&#160; 

Other Minority Investments 

&#160; 

We also own a portfolio of minority equity investments in publicly traded media companies, including Time Warner, Inc. (NYSE: TWX) and Viacom, Inc. (Nasdaq: VIAB). These are assets that were acquired mostly in tax-efficient transactions and are currently held as non-core assets. In the past we have entered into swaps, exchangeable debentures, and other derivatives to monetize these investments and mitigate balance sheet risk. We intend to continue to monetize these investments, which may include further derivative and structured transactions as well as public and private sales. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Matters 

&#160; 

Satellite Digital Audio Radio Services 

&#160; 

As an operator of a privately owned satellite system, SIRIUS XM is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (&#8220;FCC&#8221;) under the Communications Act of 1934, principally with respect to: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the licensing of its satellite systems; 

&#183; 

preventing interference with or to other uses of radio frequencies; and 

&#183; 

compliance with FCC rules established specifically for U.S. satellites and satellite radio services. 

&#160; 

Any assignment or transfer of control of SIRIUS XM's FCC licenses must be approved by the FCC. The FCC's order approving the merger of SIRIUS XM's wholly-owned subsidiary, Vernon Merger Corporation, with and into its wholly-owned subsidiary, XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc., in July 2008 requires SIRIUS XM to comply with certain voluntary commitments it made as part of the FCC merger proceeding. SIRIUS XM believes it complies with those commitments. 

&#160; 

In 1997, SIRIUS XM was the winning bidder for FCC licenses to operate a satellite digital audio radio service and provide other ancillary services. SIRIUS XM's FCC licenses for its Sirius system satellites expire in 2017 and 2022. SIRIUS XM's FCC licenses for its XM satellites expire in 2018, 2021 and 2022. One of SIRIUS XM&#8217;s XM satellites is operating under special temporary authority from the FCC is in the process of being de-orbited . SIRIUS XM anticipates that, absent significant misconduct on its part, the FCC will renew its licenses to permit operation of its satellites for their useful lives, and grant a license for any replacement satellites. 

&#160; 

In some areas with high concentrations of tall buildings, such as urban centers, signals from SIRIUS XM's satellites may be blocked and reception can be adversely affected. In many of these areas, SIRIUS XM has installed terrestrial 

I- 14 

&#160;

repeaters to supplement its satellite signal coverage. The FCC has established rules governing terrestrial repeaters and has granted SIRIUS XM a license through 2027 to operate its repeater network. 

&#160; 

In many cases, SIRIUS XM obtains FCC certifications for satellite radios, including satellite radios that include FM modulators . SIRIUS XM believes its radios that are in production comply with all applicable FCC rules. 

&#160; 

SIRIUS XM is required to obtain export licenses from the United States government to export certain ground control equipment, satellite communications/control services and technical data related to its satellites and their operations. The delivery of such equipment, services and technical data to destinations outside the United States and to foreign persons is subject to strict export control and prior approval requirements from the United States government (including prohibitions on the sharing of certain satellite-related goods and services with China). 

&#160; 

Changes in law or regulations relating to communications policy or to matters affecting SIRIUS XM's services could adversely affect its ability to retain its FCC licenses or the manner in which SIRIUS XM operates. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

SIRIUS XM faces significant competition for both listeners and advertisers, including from providers of radio or other audio services. SIRIUS XM&#8217;s digital competitors are making in-roads into vehicles, where it is currently the prominent alternative to traditional AM/FM radio. &#160; Traditional AM/FM radio has a well-established demand for its services and generally offers free broadcasts paid for by commercial advertising rather than by subscription fees. The availability of traditional free AM/FM radio reduces the likelihood that customers would be willing to pay for SIRIUS XM&#8217;s subscription services and, by offering free broadcasts, it may impose limits on what SIRIUS XM can charge for its services. &#160; SIRIUS XM also faces competition from Internet radio and Internet-enabled smartphones, which often have no geographic limitations and provide listeners with radio programming from across the country and around the world. Major media companies and online-only providers, including Apple, Google Play, Pandora and iHeartRadio, also make high fidelity digital streams available through the Internet for free or, in some cases, for less than the cost of a satellite radio subscription. Internet-enabled smartphones, which are easily integrated into vehicles, are often free to the user and offer music and talk content. Leading audio smartphone radio applications include Apple, Pandora, Spotify, and iHeartRadio. Certain of these applications also include advanced functionality, such as personalization, and allow the user to access large libraries of content. In addition, SIRIUS XM faces competition as a result of the deployment or planned deployment by nearly all automakers of integrated multimedia systems in dashboards. These systems can combine control of audio entertainment from a variety of sources, including AM/FM/HD radio broadcasts, satellite radio, Internet radio, smartphone applications and stored audio, with navigation and other advanced applications such as restaurant bookings, movie show times and financial information. Internet radio and other data are typically connected to the system via a bluetooth link to an Internet-enabled smartphone or wireless modem installed in the vehicle, and the entire system may be controlled by touchscreen or voice recognition. &#160; These systems enhance the attractiveness of Internet-based competitors by making such applications more prominent, easier to access, and safer to use in the car. SIRIUS XM also faces competition from a number of providers that offer specialized audio services through either direct broadcast satellite or cable audio systems and that are targeted to fixed locations, mostly in-home. The radio service offered by direct broadcast satellite and cable audio is often included as part of a package of digital services with video service, and video customers generally do not pay an additional monthly fee for the audio service. In addition, the audio entertainment marketplace continues to evolve rapidly, with a steady emergence of new media platforms that compete with SIRIUS XM's services now or that could compete with its services in the future. The in dash navigation market is also being threatened by increasingly capable smartphones that provide advanced navigation functionality, including live traffic. 

Braves Holdings faces competition from many alternative forms of leisure entertainment. During the baseball season, Braves Holdings competes with other sporting and live events for game day attendance, which is integral to Braves Holdings' ticket, concession and souvenir sales revenue. The broadcasting of the Atlanta Braves&#8217; games, which is another significant source of revenue for Braves Holdings , competes against a multitude of other media options for viewers, including premium programming, home video, pay-per-view services, online activities, movies and other forms of news and information. In addition, Braves Holdings competes with the other Major League Baseball teams for a limited pool of player, coaching and managerial talent. This talent contributes to the Atlanta Braves&#8217; winning record and league standings, which are critical components of Braves Holdings&#8217; competitiveness. 

I- 15 

&#160;

Live Nation faces competition in the live music industry, in attracting touring artists to the venues it owns and operates, from ticketing services primarily through online channels but also through phone, outlet and box office channels, and in its artist management and sponsorships businesses. Competition in the live entertainment industry is intense. Live Nation believes that it competes primarily on the basis of its ability to deliver quality music products, sell tickets and provide enhanced fan and artist experiences. It believes that its primary strengths include the quality of service delivered to its artists, fans and corporate sponsors, its track record in promoting and producing live music events and tours both domestically and internationally, artist relationships, its global footprint, ticketing software and services, its ecommerce site and associated database, distribution platform (venues), the scope and effectiveness in its expertise of marketing and sponsorship programs and its financial stability.
