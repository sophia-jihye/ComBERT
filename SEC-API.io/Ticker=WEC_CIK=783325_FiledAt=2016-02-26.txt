Represents distribution sales for customers who have purchased power from an alternative electric supplier in Michigan. 

Electric Sales 

Our electric energy deliveries included supply and distribution sales to retail and wholesale customers and distribution sales to those customers who switched to an alternative electric supplier. In 2015, retail electric revenues accounted for 87.3% &#32;of total electric operating revenues, while wholesale (including resale) electric revenues accounted for 10.7% &#32;of total electric operating revenues. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Wisconsin Segment Contribution to Operating Income for information on MWh sales by customer class. 

Our electric utilities are authorized to provide retail electric service in designated territories in the state of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits and boundary agreements with other utilities, and in certain territories in the state of Michigan pursuant to franchises granted by municipalities. 

Our electric utilities buy and sell wholesale electric power by participating in the MISO Energy Markets. The cost of our generation offered into the MISO Energy Markets, compared to our competitors, affects how often our generating units are dispatched and how we buy and sell power. For more information, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources &#8211; Industry Restructuring. 

Large Electric Retail Customers 

We provide electric utility service to a diversified base of customers in such industries as mining, paper, foundry, food products and machinery production, health services, governmental, and large retail chains. In February 2015, our largest retail electric customer, the owner of two iron ore mines located in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, returned as a customer after choosing an alternative electric supplier in September 2013. Wisconsin Electric entered into a special contract with each of the mines to provide full requirements electric service through December 31, 2019. In 2015, we deferred, and we expect to continue to defer, the margin from those sales and will apply these amounts for the benefit of Wisconsin retail electric customers in a future rate proceeding. For more information,

see Note 23, Michigan Settlement , and Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources &#8211; Industry Restructuring. 

Wholesale Customers 

We provide wholesale electric service to various customers, including electric cooperatives, municipal joint action agencies, other investor-owned utilities, municipal utilities, and energy marketers. Wholesale sales accounted for 6.0% , 5.3%, and 5.9% of total electric energy sales during 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Wholesale revenues accounted for 4.5% , 3.9%, and 4.3% of total electric operating revenues during 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. 

Resale 

The majority of our sales for resale are sold to one RTO, MISO, at market rates based on availability of our generation and RTO demand. Resale sales accounted for 20.9% , 18.5%, and 13.3% of total electric energy sales during 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Resale revenues accounted for 6.2% , 7.8%, and 4.3% of total electric operating revenues during 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. 

Electric Sales Growth 

Our service territory experienced slightly declining weather-normalized retail electric sales in 2015 as positive customer growth was more than offset by reduced volumes related to lower use per customer. We currently forecast retail electric sales volumes, excluding the two iron ore mines, to grow at a compound annual rate of between flat and 0.5% over the next five years, assuming normal weather. In addition, we forecast associated electric peak demand, excluding the two iron ore mines, to grow at a compound annual rate of between 0.5% to 1.0% over the next five years, also assuming normal weather. The owner of the two iron ore mines has announced its intention to shut down one of the mines in 2017. The potential loss of retail electric sales associated with this mine is estimated at approximately 2% of our annual total retail electric sales. 

Electric Generation and Supply Mix 

Our electric supply strategy is to provide our customers with energy from plants using a diverse fuel mix that is expected to maintain a stable, reliable, and affordable supply of electricity. We supply a significant amount of electricity to our customers from power plants that we own. We supplement our internally generated power supply with long-term power purchase agreements, including the Point Beach power purchase agreement discussed in Power Purchase Commitments below, and through spot purchases in the MISO Energy Markets. 

Our rated capacity by fuel type as of December 31 is shown below. For more information on our electric generation facilities, see Item 2. Properties.

Coal-Fired Generation 

Our coal-fired generation consists of nine &#32;operating plants with a rated capacity of 4,955 MW as of December 31, 2015 . For more information about our operating plants, see Item 2. Properties. 

Natural Gas-Fired Generation 

Our natural gas-fired generation consists of nine &#32;operating plants, including peaking units, with a rated capacity of 3,173 MW as of December 31, 2015 . For more information about our operating plants, see Item 2. Properties. 

Oil-Fired Generation 

Fuel oil is used for combustion turbines at certain of our natural gas-fired plants as well as for ignition and flame stabilization at one of our coal-fired plants. Our oil-fired generation had a rated capacity of 180 MW as of December 31, 2015 . We also have natural gas-fired peaking units with a rated capacity of 1,217 &#32;MW, which have the ability to burn oil if natural gas is not available due to delivery constraints. For more information about our operating plants, see Item 2. Properties. 

Renewable Generation 

Hydroelectric 

Our hydroelectric generating system consists of 30 operating plants with a total installed capacity of 168 MW and a rated capacity of 146 MW as of December 31, 2015 . All of our hydroelectric facilities follow FERC guidelines and/or regulations. 

Wind 

We have six &#32;wind sites, consisting of 280 &#32;turbines, with an installed capacity of 447 MW and a rated capacity of 73 &#32;MW as of December 31, 2015. 

2015 Form 10-K 

WEC Energy Group, Inc. 

Biomass 

We constructed a biomass-fueled power plant at a Rothschild, Wisconsin paper mill site that went into commercial operation in November 2013. Wood waste and wood shavings are used to produce a rated capacity of approximately 50 MW of electric power as well as steam to support the paper mill's operations. Fuel for the power plant is supplied by both the paper mill and through contracts with biomass suppliers. 

Electric System Reliability 

The PSCW requires us to maintain a planning reserve margin above our projected annual peak demand forecast to help ensure reliability of electric service to our customers. These planning reserve requirements are consistent with the MISO calculated planning reserve margin. The PSCW has a 14.5% reserve margin requirement for long-term planning (planning years two through ten). For short-term planning (planning year one), the PSCW requires Wisconsin utilities to follow the planning reserve margin established by MISO. MISO has a 14.3% reserve margin requirement from January 1, 2016, through May 31, 2016, and 15.2% for the remainder of 2016. The MPSC does not have minimum guidelines for future supply reserves. 

We had adequate capacity through company-owned generation units and power purchase contracts to meet the MISO calculated planning reserve margin during 2015 &#32;and expect to have adequate capacity to meet the planning reserve margin requirements during 2016 . &#32; However, extremely hot weather, unexpected equipment failure or unavailability across the 15-state MISO market footprint could require us to call upon load management procedures. Load management procedures allow for the reduction of energy use through agreements with customers to directly shut off their equipment or through interruptible service, where customers agree to reduce their load in the case of an emergency interruption. 

Fuel and Purchased Power Costs 

Our retail electric rates in Wisconsin are established by the PSCW and include base amounts for fuel and purchased power costs. The electric fuel rules set by the PSCW allow us to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, under or over-collections of actual fuel and purchased power costs that exceed a 2% &#32;price variance from the costs included in the rates charged to customers. For more information about the fuel rule, see Item 1. Business &#8211; D. Regulation. 

Our average fuel and purchased power costs per MWh by fuel type were as follows for the years ended December 31:

We purchase coal under long-term contracts, which helps with price stability. Coal and associated transportation services have continued to see volatility in pricing due to changing domestic and world-wide demand for coal and the impacts of diesel costs, which are incorporated into fuel surcharges on rail transportation. Certain of our coal transportation contracts contain fuel cost adjustments that are tied to changes in diesel fuel and crude oil prices. Currently, diesel fuel contracts are not actively traded. Therefore, we use financial heating oil contracts to mitigate risk related to diesel fuel prices. 

We purchase natural gas for our plants on the spot market from natural gas marketers, utilities, and producers, and we arrange for transportation of the natural gas to our plants. We have firm and interruptible transportation, as well as balancing and storage agreements, intended to support our plants' variable usage. 

Wisconsin Electric and WPS both have a PSCW-approved hedging program that allows them to hedge up to 75% of their potential risks related to fuel surcharge exposure. Wisconsin Electric and WPS also have a program that allows them to hedge up to 65% and 75%, respectively, of their estimated natural gas use for electric generation in order to help manage their natural gas price risk. These hedging programs are generally implemented on a 36-month forward-looking basis. The results of all of these programs are reflected in the average costs of natural gas and purchased power.

Coal Supply 

We diversify the coal supply for our electric generating facilities and jointly-owned plants by purchasing coal from several mines in Wyoming, as well as from various other states. For 2016 , approximately 78% of our total projected coal requirements of approximately 16 million tons are contracted under fixed-price contracts. See Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information &#32;on amounts of coal purchases and coal deliveries under contract. 

The annual tonnage amounts contracted for 2016 &#32;through 2018 &#32;are as follows:

Coal Deliveries 

All of our 2016 &#32;coal requirements are expected to be shipped by our owned or leased unit trains under existing transportation agreements. The unit trains transport the coal for electric generating facilities from mines in Wyoming, Pennsylvania, and Montana. The coal is transported by train to our rail-served electric-generating facilities and to dock storage in Superior, Wisconsin, until needed by our lake vessel-served facilities. Additional small volume agreements may also be used to supplement the normal coal supply for our facilities. 

Midcontinent Independent System Operator Costs 

In connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed and operates the MISO Energy Markets, which include its bid-based energy markets and ancillary services market. We are participants in the MISO Energy Markets. In 2013, MISO expanded its footprint to include entities in Mississippi, Arkansas, Texas, and Missouri, a region referred to as MISO South. These changes have not had a material impact on our allocation of transmission costs, and we do not expect them to have a material impact in the future. For more information on MISO, see Item 1. Business &#8211; D. Regulation. 

Power Purchase Commitments 

We enter into short and long-term power purchase commitments to meet a portion of our anticipated electric energy supply needs. As of December 31, 2015 , our power purchase commitments with unaffiliated parties for the next five years is 1,432 &#32;MW per year. This amount includes 1,033 MW per year related to a long-term power purchase agreement for electricity generated by Point Beach. In addition, 234 MW per year relates to a long-term power purchase agreement under which we purchase power at a price determined monthly based on a formula tied to a natural gas price index. 

Other Matters 

Seasonality 

Our electric utility sales are impacted by seasonal factors and varying weather conditions. We sell more electricity during the summer months because of the residential cooling load. We continue to upgrade our electric distribution system, including substations, transformers, and lines, to meet the demand of our customers. Our generating plants performed as expected during the warmest periods of the summer, and all power purchase commitments under firm contract were received. During this period, Wisconsin Electric did not require public appeals for conservation, and it did not interrupt or curtail service to non-firm customers who participate in load management programs. In addition, WPS did not require any public appeals for conservation, and it did not interrupt or curtail service to non-firm customers who participate in load management programs for capacity reasons. However, WPS did have service curtailments for economic reasons. 

Competition 

Our electric utilities face competition from various entities and other forms of energy sources available to customers, including self-generation by large industrial customers and alternative energy sources. Our electric utilities compete with other utilities for sales to municipalities and cooperatives as well as with other utilities and marketers for wholesale electric business. 

2015 Form 10-K 

WEC Energy Group, Inc. 

The retail electric utility market in Wisconsin is regulated by the PSCW. Retail electric customers do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier, and it is uncertain when, if ever, retail electric choice might be implemented in Wisconsin. The regulated energy industry continues to experience significant structural changes, which could eventually lead to increased competition in Wisconsin. 

The retail electric utility market in Michigan remains open to competition with its retail choice program, which allows customers to remain with their regulated utility at regulated rates or choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. We continue providing distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customer's power supplier.

Natural Gas Utility Operations 

For the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Wisconsin natural gas utility operations include Wisconsin Gas's and Wisconsin Electric's natural gas operations for all periods and WPS's natural gas operations, including in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, beginning July 1, 2015, due to the acquisition of Integrys and its subsidiaries. 

We are authorized to provide retail natural gas distribution service in designated territories in the state of Wisconsin, as established by indeterminate permits and boundary agreements with other utilities. We also transport customer-owned natural gas. Together our natural gas distribution utilities are the largest in Wisconsin, and we operate throughout the state, including the City of Milwaukee and surrounding areas, northeastern Wisconsin, and large areas of both central and western Wisconsin.

Natural Gas Deliveries 

Our gas therm deliveries include customer-owned transported natural gas. Transported natural gas accounted for approximately 50.7% of the total volumes delivered during 2015 , 42.3% &#32;during 2014 , and 43.1% &#32;during 2013 . Our peak daily send-out during 2015 &#32;was 18.2 million therms on January 7, 2015 . 

2015 Form 10-K 

WEC Energy Group, Inc. 

Large Natural Gas Customers 

We provide natural gas utility service to a diversified base of industrial customers who are largely within our electric service territory. Major industries served include governmental, educational, food products, paper, and metal. Fuel used for Wisconsin Electric's electric generation represents our largest transportation customer. Natural gas therms delivered to Wisconsin Electric for electric generation represented 15.3%, 9.3%, and 10.4% of the total volumes delivered during 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. 

Natural Gas Supply, Pipeline Capacity and Storage 

We have been able to meet our contractual obligations with both our suppliers and our customers. For more information on our natural gas utility supply and transportation contracts, see Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies. 

Pipeline Capacity and Storage 

The interstate pipelines serving Wisconsin originate in major natural gas producing areas of North America: the Oklahoma and Texas basins, western Canada, and the Rocky Mountains. We have contracted for long-term firm capacity from a number of these sources. This strategy reflects management's belief that overall supply security is enhanced by geographic diversification of the supply portfolio. 

Due to the daily and seasonal variations in natural gas usage in Wisconsin, we have also contracted for substantial underground storage capacity, primarily in Michigan. We target storage inventory levels at approximately 35% of forecasted winter demand; November through March is considered the winter season. Storage capacity, along with our natural gas purchase contracts, enables us to manage significant changes in daily demand and to optimize our overall natural gas supply and capacity costs. We generally inject natural gas into storage during the spring and summer months when demand is lower and withdraw it in the winter months. As a result, we can contract for less long-line pipeline capacity during periods of peak usage than would otherwise be necessary and can purchase natural gas on a more uniform daily basis from suppliers year-round. Each of these capabilities enables us to reduce our overall costs. 

We hold daily transportation and storage capacity entitlements with interstate pipeline companies as well as other service providers under varied-length long-term contracts. 

Term Natural Gas Supply 

We have contracts for firm supplies with terms of 3&#8211;7 months with suppliers for natural gas acquired in the Chicago, Illinois market hub and in the producing areas discussed above. The pricing of the term contracts is based upon first of the month indices. 

Combined with our storage capability, management believes that the volume of natural gas under contract is sufficient to meet our forecasted firm peak-day and seasonal demand. Our Wisconsin natural gas utilities' forecasted design peak-day throughput is 30.8 million therms for the 2015 through 2016 heating season. 

Secondary Market Transactions 

Pipeline long-line and storage capacity and natural gas supplies under contract can be resold in secondary markets. As local distribution companies, our Wisconsin natural gas utilities must contract for capacity and supply sufficient to meet the firm peak-day demand of our customers. Peak or near peak demand days generally occur only a few times each year. The secondary markets facilitate higher utilization of contracted capacity and supply during those times when the full contracted capacity and supply are not needed by the utility, helping to mitigate the fixed costs associated with maintaining peak levels of capacity and natural gas supply. Through pre-arranged agreements and day-to-day electronic bulletin board postings, interested parties can purchase this excess capacity and supply. The proceeds from these transactions are passed through to rate payers, subject to our approved GCRMs. During 2015 , we continued to participate in the secondary markets. For information on the GCRMs, see Note 1(d), Revenues and Customer Receivables. 

Spot Market Natural Gas Supply 

We expect to continue to make natural gas purchases in the spot market as price and other circumstances dictate. We have supply relationships with a number of sellers from whom we purchase natural gas in the spot market. 

2015 Form 10-K 

WEC Energy Group, Inc. 

Hedging Natural Gas Supply Prices 

Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas have PSCW approval to hedge up to 60% of planned winter demand and up to 15% of planned summer demand using a mix of NYMEX-based natural gas options and futures contracts. WPS has PSCW approval to hedge up to 67% of planned winter demand using a combination of planned withdrawals from storage and NYMEX financial instruments. These approvals allow these companies to pass 100% of the hedging costs (premiums and brokerage fees) and proceeds (gains and losses) to rate payers through their respective GCRMs. Hedge targets (volumes) are provided annually to the PSCW as part of each company's three-year natural gas supply plan and risk management filing. 

To the extent that opportunities develop and physical supply operating plans are supportive, Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Gas, and WPS also have PSCW approval to utilize NYMEX-based natural gas derivatives to capture favorable forward-market price differentials. These approvals provide for 100% of the related proceeds to accrue to these companies' respective GCRMs. 

Seasonality 

Since the majority of our customers use natural gas for heating, customer use is sensitive to weather and is generally higher during the winter months. Accordingly, we are subject to variations in earnings and working capital throughout the year as a result of changes in weather. 

Our working capital needs are met by cash generated from operations and debt (both long-term and short-term). The seasonality of natural gas revenues causes the timing of cash collections to be concentrated from January through June. A portion of the winter natural gas supply needs is typically purchased and stored from April through October. Also, planned capital spending on our natural gas distribution facilities is concentrated in April through October. Because of these timing differences, the cash flow from customers is typically supplemented with temporary increases in short-term borrowings (from external sources) during the late summer and fall. Short-term debt is typically reduced over the January through June period. 

Competition 

Competition in varying degrees exists between natural gas and other forms of energy available to consumers. A number of our large commercial and industrial customers are dual-fuel customers that are equipped to switch between natural gas and alternate fuels. We are allowed to offer lower-priced natural gas sales and transportation services to dual-fuel customers. Under natural gas transportation agreements, customers purchase natural gas directly from natural gas marketers and arrange with interstate pipelines and us to have the natural gas transported to their facilities. We earn substantially the same margin (difference between revenue and cost of natural gas) whether we sell and transport natural gas to customers or only transport their natural gas. 

Our ability to maintain our share of the industrial dual-fuel market depends on our success and the success of third-party natural gas marketers in obtaining long-term and short-term supplies of natural gas at competitive prices compared to other sources and in arranging or facilitating competitively priced transportation service for those customers that desire to buy their own natural gas supplies. 

Federal and state regulators continue to implement policies to bring more competition to the natural gas industry. While the natural gas utility distribution function is expected to remain a highly regulated, monopoly function, the sale of the natural gas commodity and related services are expected to remain subject to competition from third parties for large commercial and industrial customers. It remains uncertain if and when the current economic disincentives for small firm customers to choose an alternative natural gas commodity supplier may be removed such that we begin to face competition for the sale of natural gas to those customers. 

Steam Utility Operations 

Wisconsin Electric has a steam utility that generates, distributes, and sells steam supplied by VAPP and MCPP to customers in metropolitan Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Steam is used by customers for processing, space heating, domestic hot water, and humidification. Wisconsin Electric operates a district steam system in downtown Milwaukee and the near south side of Milwaukee, and steam is supplied to this system from VAPP. Wisconsin Electric also operates the steam production and distribution facilities of the MCPP located on the Milwaukee County Grounds in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. In 2015, we entered into an agreement to sell the MCPP, which is expected to close during the first half of 2016.

Natural Gas Supply, Pipeline Capacity and Storage 

We manage portfolios of natural gas supply contracts, storage services, and pipeline transportation services designed to meet varying customer use patterns with safe, reliable natural gas supplies at the best value. 

Our natural gas supply requirements are met through a combination of fixed-price purchases, index-priced purchases, contracted and owned storage, peak-shaving facilities, and natural gas supply call options. We contract for fixed-term firm natural gas supply each year to meet the demand of firm system sales customers. To supplement natural gas supply and manage risk, we purchase additional natural gas supply on the monthly and daily spot markets. 

For more information on our natural gas utility supply and transportation contracts, see Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies . 

2015 Form 10-K 

WEC Energy Group, Inc. 

We contract with local distribution companies and interstate pipelines to purchase firm transportation services. We believe that having multiple pipelines that serve our natural gas service territory benefits our customers by improving reliability, providing access to a diverse supply of natural gas, and fostering competition among these service providers. These benefits can lead to favorable conditions for our Illinois utilities when negotiating new agreements for transportation and storage services. Our Illinois utilities further reduce their supply cost volatility through the use of financial instruments, such as commodity futures, swaps, and options as part of their hedging programs. They hedge between 25% and 50% of natural gas purchases, with a target of 37.5%. 

We own a 38.3 Bcf storage field (Manlove Field in central Illinois) and contract with various other underground storage service providers for additional storage services. Storage allows us to manage significant changes in daily natural gas demand and to purchase steady levels of natural gas on a year-round basis, which provides a hedge against supply cost volatility. We also own a natural gas pipeline system that connects Manlove Field to Chicago and eight major interstate pipelines. These assets are directed primarily to serving rate-regulated retail customers and are included in our regulatory rate base. We also use a portion of these company-owned storage and pipeline assets as a natural gas hub, which consists of providing transportation and storage services in interstate commerce to our wholesale customers. Customers deliver natural gas to us for storage through an injection into the storage reservoir, and we return the natural gas to the customers under an agreed schedule through a withdrawal from the storage reservoir. Title to the natural gas does not transfer to us. We recognize service fees associated with the natural gas hub services provided to wholesale customers. These service fees reduce the cost of natural gas and services charged to retail customers in rates. 

We had adequate capacity to meet all firm natural gas demand obligations during 2015 and expect to have adequate capacity to meet all firm demand obligations during 2016. Our Illinois utilities' forecasted design peak-day throughput is 25.4 million therms for the 2015 through 2016 heating season. 

Accelerated Natural Gas Main Replacement Program 

PGL is continuing work on the AMRP, a 20-year project that began in 2011 under which PGL is replacing approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging natural gas pipeline infrastructure. PGL currently recovers these costs through a surcharge on customer bills pursuant to an ICC approved qualifying infrastructure plant rider, which is in effect through 2023. For information on investigations related to the AMRP, see Note 22, Regulatory Environment . 

Seasonality 

Since the majority of our customers use natural gas for heating, customer use is sensitive to weather and is generally higher during the winter months. Accordingly, we are subject to variations in earnings and working capital throughout the year as a result of changes in weather. 

Our Illinois utilities' working capital needs are met by cash generated from operations and debt (both long-term and short-term). The seasonality of natural gas revenues causes the timing of cash collections to be concentrated from January through June. A portion of the winter natural gas supply needs is typically purchased and stored from April through November. Also, planned capital spending on our natural gas distribution facilities is concentrated in April through November. Because of these timing differences, the cash flow from customers is typically supplemented with temporary increases in short-term borrowings (from external sources) during the late summer and fall. Short-term debt is typically reduced over the January through June period. 

Competition 

Although our Illinois utilities' rates are regulated by the ICC, we still face varying degrees of competition from other entities and other forms of energy available to consumers. Absent extraordinary circumstances, potential competitors are not allowed to construct competing natural gas distribution systems in our service territory due to a judicial doctrine known as the "first in the field." In addition, we believe it would be impractical to construct competing duplicate distribution facilities due to the high cost of installation. 

Since 2002, all our Illinois utilities' natural gas customers have had the opportunity to choose a natural gas supplier other than us. As a result, we offer natural gas transportation service to enable customers to directly manage their energy costs. Transportation customers purchase natural gas directly from third-party natural gas suppliers and use our distribution system to transport the natural gas to their facilities. We still earn a distribution charge for transporting the natural gas for these customers. As such, the loss of revenue associated with the cost of natural gas that our transportation customers purchase from third-party suppliers has little impact on our net income, as it is offset by an equal reduction to natural gas costs. 

2015 Form 10-K 

WEC Energy Group, Inc. 

An interstate pipeline may seek to provide transportation service directly to end users, which would bypass our natural gas transportation service. However, we have a bypass rate approved by the ICC, which allows us to negotiate rates with customers that are potential bypass candidates to help ensure that such customers use our transportation service. 

Other States Segment 

Our other states segment includes the natural gas utility operations of MERC and MGU. We acquired the natural gas distribution operations of MERC and MGU, located in Minnesota and Michigan, respectively, on June 29, 2015, with the acquisition of Integrys. MERC serves customers in various cities and communities throughout Minnesota, and MGU serves customers in the southern portion of lower Michigan.

MERC hedges up to 70% of planned winter demand using a combination of planned withdrawals from storage and NYMEX financial instruments. MGU hedges up to 20% of its planned annual purchases using NYMEX financial instruments. 

Combined with our storage capability, management believes that the volume of gas under contract is sufficient to meet our forecasted firm peak-day and seasonal demand. Forecasted design peak-day throughput for our other states utilities segment is 8.2 million therms for the 2015 through 2016 heating season. 

Seasonality 

Since the majority of our customers use natural gas for heating, customer use is sensitive to weather and is generally higher during the winter months. Accordingly, we are subject to variations in earnings and working capital throughout the year as a result of changes in weather.

Short-term debt is typically reduced over the January through June period. 

Competition 

Although our other states utilities' rates are regulated by the MPUC and MSPC, we still face varying degrees of competition from other entities and other forms of energy available to consumers. Many large commercial and industrial customers have the ability to switch between natural gas and alternate fuels. Due to the volatility of energy commodity prices, we have seen customers with dual fuel capability switch to alternate fuels for short periods of time, then switch back to natural gas as market rates change. 

MERC commercial and industrial customers have the opportunity to choose a natural gas supplier and all MGU customers have the opportunity to choose a natural gas supplier other than us. We offer natural gas transportation service and also offer interruptible natural gas sales to enable customers to better manage their energy costs. Transportation customers purchase natural gas directly from third-party natural gas suppliers and use our distribution systems to transport the natural gas to their facilities. We still earn a distribution charge for transporting the natural gas for these customers. As such, the loss of revenue associated with the cost of natural gas that our transportation customers purchase from third-party suppliers has little impact on our net income, as it is offset by an equal reduction to natural gas costs. Customers continue to switch between firm system supply, interruptible system supply, and transportation service each year as the economics and service options change. 

Electric Transmission Segment 

American Transmission Company 

ATC is a regional transmission company that owns, maintains, monitors, and operates electric transmission systems in Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, and Minnesota. ATC is expected to provide comparable service to all customers, including Wisconsin Electric and WPS, and to support effective competition in energy markets without favoring any market participant. ATC is regulated by the FERC for all rate terms and conditions of service and is a transmission-owning member of MISO. MISO maintains operational control of ATC's transmission system, and Wisconsin Electric and WPS are non-transmission owning members and customers of MISO. As of December 31, 2015 , our ownership interest in ATC was approximately 60% . This increase over the December 31, 2014 , ownership interest of approximately 26% was due to the acquisition of Integrys on June 29, 2015. See Note 4, Investment in American Transmission Company, for more information . 

In April 2011, ATC and Duke Energy announced the creation of a joint venture, DATC, that will seek opportunities to acquire, build, own, and operate new electric transmission infrastructure in North America to address increasing demand for affordable, reliable transmission capacity. In April 2013, DATC acquired a 72% interest in California's Path 15 transmission line. DATC continues to evaluate new projects and opportunities, along with participating in the competitive bidding process on projects it considers viable. These projects are located in the service territories of several different RTOs around the country. On January 20, 2016, the FERC issued an order authorizing ATC to enter into a proposed restructuring involving the creation of three new entities: ATC Holdco, ATC Development, and ATC Development Manager, Inc. ATC&#8217;s current member owners will have the option to retain their existing 

2015 Form 10-K 

WEC Energy Group, Inc. 

ownership interests limited to ATC in Wisconsin and adjacent states or to exchange their current ATC ownership interests for ownership interests in ATC Holdco, which would allow them to participate in ATC's transmission business in Wisconsin and adjacent states, as well as new transmission development projects throughout the U.S. 

ATC is currently named in a complaint filed with the FERC requesting a reduction in the base ROE used by MISO transmission owners. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources &#8211; Other Matters, for more information. 

C. NON-UTILITY OPERATIONS 

We Power Segment 

We Power, through wholly owned subsidiaries, has designed and built approximately 2,350 MW of generation in Wisconsin as part of our PTF strategy. This generation is made up of capacity from the Oak Creek Expansion units, OC 1 and OC 2, which were placed in service in February 2010 and January 2011, respectively, and the PWGS units, PWGS 1 and PWGS 2, which were placed in service in July 2005 and May 2008, respectively. Two unaffiliated entities collectively own approximately 17%, or approximately 211 MW, of OC 1 and OC 2. All four of the PTF units are being leased to Wisconsin Electric under long-term leases (the Oak Creek units have 30-year leases and the PWGS units have 25-year leases). The PTF units are positioned to provide a significant portion of our future generation needs. 

Our PTF strategy was designed to address Wisconsin Electric's electric supply needs by increasing the electric generating capacity in Wisconsin while allowing us to maintain a diversified fuel mix by including both new coal-fired plants and natural gas-fired plants. Because of the significant investment necessary to construct these generating units, we constructed the plants under Wisconsin's Leased Generation Law, which allows a non-utility affiliate to construct an electric generating facility and lease it to the public utility. The law allows a public utility that has entered into a lease approved by the PSCW to recover fully in its retail electric rates that portion of any payments under the lease that the PSCW has allocated to the public utility's Wisconsin retail electric service, and all other costs that are prudently incurred in the public utility's operation and maintenance of the electric generating facility allocated to the utility's Wisconsin retail electric service. In addition, the PSCW may not modify or terminate a lease it has approved under the Leased Generation Law except as specifically provided in the lease or the PSCW's order approving the lease. This law effectively created regulatory certainty in light of the significant investment being made to construct the units. All four PTF units were constructed under leases approved by the PSCW. 

&#160; 

We are recovering our costs of the PTF units, including subsequent capital additions, through lease payments that are billed from We Power to Wisconsin Electric and then recovered in Wisconsin Electric's rates as authorized by the PSCW, the MPSC, and the FERC. Under the lease terms, our return is calculated using a 12.7% ROE and the equity ratio is assumed to be 55% for the Oak Creek units and 53% for the PWGS units. 

For additional background information on our PTF strategy, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8211; Power the Future in Item 7. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007. 

Corporate and Other Segment 

The corporate and other segment includes the operations of the WEC Energy Group holding company, the Integrys holding company, and the PELLC holding company, as well as the operations of Wispark, Bostco, Wisvest, WECC, WBS, PDL, and ITF. 

Bostco and Wispark develop and invest in real estate, and combined they had $72.7 million in real estate holdings at December 31, 2015 . Wispark has developed several business parks and other commercial real estate projects, primarily in southeastern Wisconsin. 

Wisvest was originally formed to develop, own, and operate electric generating facilities and to invest in other energy-related entities. However, Wisvest discontinued its development activity several years ago. At December 31, 2015 , Wisvest's only operating asset and investment was Wisvest Thermal Energy Services, which provides chilled water services to the Milwaukee Regional Medical Center. During 2015, we entered into an agreement to sell the MCPP, including Wisvest Thermal Energy Services. This sale is expected to close during the first half of 2016.

WEC Energy Group, Inc. 

WECC was originally formed to invest in non-utility projects, such as low income housing developments. However, due to a focus on our regulated utility business, WECC sold many of its non-utility investments and no longer has significant operations. 

WBS is a wholly owned centralized service company that provides administrative and general support services to our regulated utilities. WBS also provides certain administrative and support services to our nonregulated entities. 

PDL owns distributed renewable projects, primarily solar, and a natural gas-fired cogeneration facility in Wisconsin known as the Combined Locks Energy Center. PDL's natural gas-fired facility is subject to market price volatility and is dispatched to produce energy only when it is economical to do so. PDL's renewable energy facilities rely on renewable resources, such as solar irradiance or landfill gas. There is no market price risk associated with the fuel supply of these facilities. However, production at these facilities can be intermittent due to the availability of the renewable energy resource. 

ITF designs, builds, maintains, owns, and operates CNG fueling stations in multiple states. In addition, ITF manufactures its own compressor package, which includes a proprietary method of compressing natural gas. Since ITF's operations are inconsistent with our risk profile, we entered into an agreement to sell ITF in February 2016. See Note 3, Dispositions, for more information . 

D. REGULATION 

We are a holding company and are subject to the requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005). We also have various subsidiaries that meet the definition of a holding company under PUHCA 2005 and are also subject to its requirements. 

Pursuant to the non-utility asset cap provisions of Wisconsin's public utility holding company law, the sum of certain assets of all non-utility affiliates in a holding company system may not exceed 25% of the assets of all public utility affiliates. However, among other items, the law exempts energy-related assets, including the generating plants constructed by We Power as part of our PTF strategy, from being counted against the asset cap provided that they are employed in qualifying businesses. We report to the PSCW annually our compliance with this law and provide supporting documentation to show that our non-utility assets are below the non-utility asset cap. 

Regulated Utility Operations 

In addition to the specific regulations noted above and below, our utilities are also subject to regulations, where applicable, of the EPA, the WDNR, the MDEQ, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.

Embedded within Wisconsin Electric's and WPS&#8217;s electric rates is an amount to recover fuel and purchased power costs. The Wisconsin retail fuel rules require the utility to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, any under-collection or over-collection of fuel and purchased power costs that are outside of the utility's symmetrical fuel cost tolerance, which the PSCW typically sets at plus or minus 2% of the utility's approved fuel and purchased power cost plan. The deferred fuel and purchased power costs are subject to an excess revenues test. If the utility's ROE in a given year exceeds the ROE authorized by the PSCW, the recovery of under-collected fuel and purchased power costs would be reduced by the amount by which the utility's return exceeds the authorized amount. 

Prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs are recovered dollar-for-dollar from our Michigan retail electric customers and our Wisconsin wholesale electric customers. Our natural gas operations operate under GCRMs as approved by their respective state regulator. Generally, the GCRMs allow for a dollar-for-dollar recovery of prudently incurred natural gas costs. 

For a summary of the significant mechanisms our utility subsidiaries had in place in 2015 that allowed them to recover or refund changes in prudently incurred costs from rate case-approved amounts, see Note 1(d), Revenues and Customer Receivables . 

In May 2015, the PSCW approved the acquisition of Integrys on the condition that Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas will be subject to an earnings sharing mechanism for three years beginning January 1, 2016 . See Note 2, Acquisition, for more information &#32;on this earnings sharing mechanism.

Electric Transmission, Capacity, and Energy Markets 

In connection with its status as a FERC approved RTO, MISO developed bid-based energy markets, which were implemented on April 1, 2005. In January 2009, MISO commenced the MISO Energy Markets, which include the bid-based energy markets and an ancillary services market. We previously self-provided both regulation reserves and contingency reserves. In the MISO ancillary services market, we buy/sell regulation and contingency reserves from/to the market. The MISO ancillary services market has been able to reduce overall ancillary services costs in the MISO footprint. The MISO ancillary services market has enabled MISO to assume significant balancing area responsibilities such as frequency control and disturbance control. 

In MISO, base transmission costs are currently being paid by load-serving entities located in the service territories of each MISO transmission owner. The FERC has previously confirmed the use of the current transmission cost allocation methodology. Certain additional costs for new transmission projects are allocated throughout the MISO footprint. 

As part of MISO, a market-based platform was developed for valuing transmission congestion premised upon the LMP system that has been implemented in certain northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. The LMP system includes the ability to mitigate or eliminate congestion costs through ARRs and FTRs. ARRs are allocated to market participants by MISO, and FTRs are purchased through auctions. A new allocation and auction were completed for the period of June 1, 2015, through May 31, 2016. The resulting ARR valuation and the secured FTRs are expected to mitigate our transmission congestion risk for that period. 

Beginning June 1, 2013, MISO instituted an annual zonal resource adequacy requirement to ensure there is sufficient generation capacity to serve the MISO market. To meet this requirement, capacity resources could be acquired through MISO's annual capacity auction, bilateral contracts for capacity, or provided from generating or demand response resources. Our capacity requirements during 2015 were primarily fulfilled using our own capacity resources.

Other Electric Regulations 

Wisconsin Electric and WPS are subject to the Federal Power Act and the corresponding regulations developed by certain federal agencies. The Energy Policy Act amended the Federal Power Act in 2005 to, among other things, make electric utility industry consolidation more feasible, authorize the FERC to review proposed mergers and the acquisition of generation facilities, change the FERC regulatory scheme applicable to qualifying cogeneration facilities, and modify certain other aspects of energy regulations and Federal tax policies applicable to us. Additionally, the Energy Policy Act created an Electric Reliability Organization to be overseen by the FERC, which established mandatory electric reliability standards and which has the authority to levy monetary sanctions for failure to comply with these standards. 

Wisconsin Electric and WPS are subject to Act 141 in Wisconsin and Public Act 295 in Michigan, which contain certain minimum requirements for renewable energy generation. See Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information . 

All of our hydroelectric facilities follow FERC guidelines and/or regulations. 

Other Natural Gas Regulations 

Almost all of the natural gas we distribute is transported to our distribution systems by interstate pipelines. The pipelines' transportation and storage services, including PGL's natural gas hub, are regulated by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. In addition, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and the state commissions are responsible for monitoring and enforcing requirements governing our natural gas utilities' safety compliance programs for our pipelines under United States Department of Transportation regulations. These regulations include 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 192 (Transportation of Natural and Other Gas by Pipeline: Minimum Federal Safety Standards) and 49 CFR Part 195 (Transportation of Hazardous Liquids by Pipeline). 

We are required to provide natural gas service and grant credit (with applicable deposit requirements) to customers within our service territories. We are generally not allowed to discontinue natural gas service during winter moratorium months to residential heating customers who do not pay their bills. Federal and certain state governments have programs that provide for a limited amount of funding for assistance to low-income customers of the utilities. 

Non-Utility Operations 

We Power, through wholly owned subsidiaries, constructed the new generating capacity in our PTF strategy. These facilities are being leased on a long-term basis to Wisconsin Electric. Environmental permits necessary for operating the facilities are the responsibility of the operating entity, Wisconsin Electric. We Power received determinations from the FERC that upon the transfer of the facilities by lease to Wisconsin Electric, We Power's subsidiaries would not be deemed public utilities under the Federal Power Act and thus would not be subject to the FERC's jurisdiction. 

E. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE 

Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation by state and federal environmental agencies governing air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste management, environmental remediation, and management of natural resources. Costs associated with complying with these requirements are significant. Additional future environmental regulations or revisions to existing laws, including for example, additional regulation of GHG emissions, coal combustion products, air emissions, or wastewater discharges, could significantly increase these environmental compliance costs. 

Anticipated expenditures for environmental compliance and remediation issues for the next three years are included in the estimated capital expenditures described in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8211; Capital Requirements in Item 7. For a discussion of matters related to certain solid waste and coal combustion product landfills, manufactured gas plant sites, and air and water quality, see Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies , and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources &#8211; Environmental Matters in Item 7.
