Our History 

&#160; 

We (or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) were initially formed in June 1979 as Alpha Solarco Inc., a Colorado corporation. From June 1979 through February 2003, we were either inactive or involved in discontinued business ventures. We changed our name to Fiber Application Systems Technology, Ltd in February 2003. In January 2004, we changed our state of incorporation by merging into Innovative Food Holdings, Inc. (IVFH), a Florida corporation formed for that purpose. As a result of the merger, we changed our name to that of Innovative Food Holdings, Inc. In January 2004, we also acquired Food Innovations, Inc. (&#8220;FII&#8221; or &#8220;Food Innovations&#8221;), a Delaware corporation, for 500,000 (post reverse-split) shares of our common stock. 

&#160; 

On May 18, 2012, the Company executed a Stock Purchase Agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Artisan Specialty Foods, Inc., an Illinois corporation (&#8220;Artisan&#8221;), from its owner, Mr. David Vohaska. The purchase price was $1.2 million, with up to another $300,000 (with a fair value of $131,000) payable in the event certain financial milestones are met over the next one or two years. Those milestones have been met. The purchase price was primarily financed via a loan from Alpha Capital in the principal amount of $1,200,000. Prior to the acquisition, Artisan was a supplier and had sold products to the Company. 

&#160; 

On November 2, 2012, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement (the &#8220;Haley Acquisition&#8221;) with The Haley Group, LLC whereby we acquired all existing assets of The Haley Group, LLC and its customers. The Haley Acquisition was valued at a total cost of $119,645. On June 30, 2014, pursuant to a purchase agreement, the Company purchased 100% of the membership interest of Organic Food Brokers, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (&#8220;OFB&#8221;), for $300,000, 100,000 options and up to an additional $225,000 in earn-outs if certain milestones are met. 

&#160; 

On August 15, 2014, pursuant to a merger agreement (the &#8220;Fresh Diet Merger Agreement&#8221;), the Company acquired The Fresh Diet, Inc. (&#8220;The Fresh Diet&#8221; or &#8220;FD&#8221;) through a reverse triangular merger as the registrant created a subsidiary corporation (FD Acquisition Corp) that merged with and into FD with FD being the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The purchase price consisted of 10,000,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock valued at $14,000,000. The majority of FD&#8217;s current liabilities consisted of approximately $3.8 million of deferred revenues and approximately $2.1 million in short term commercial loans and there were additional ordinary course of business expenses such as trade payables, payroll and sales taxes which vary from month to month. In addition, it had some long term obligations the bulk of which consist of interest free loans from FD&#8217;s former shareholders in the amount of approximately $2.2 million which are not due for three years. Prior to the merger FD had purchased an immaterial amount of product from the Company. FD operated as an independent subsidiary subject to oversight of its board of directors and the Company&#8217;s President and CEO. Effective February 23, 2016, the Company closed a transaction to sell 90% of our ownership in FD to New Fresh Co., LLC, a Florida limited liability company controlled by the former founder of FD who was appointed Interim CEO of FD on February 9, 2016. The consideration to Innovative Food Holdings consisted primarily of a restructuring of our loans, which includes the ability to convert to additional amounts of FD under certain circumstances. There is no continuing cash inflows or outflows from or to the discontinued operations.

By employing chefs and culinary experts to handle customer service, we are able to provide our customers with extensive information about our products, including: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Flavor profile and eating qualities 

&#160; &#160; &#160;&#9679; 

Recipe and usage ideas 

&#160; &#160; &#160;&#9679; 

Origin, seasonality, and availability

Cross utilization ideas and complementary uses of products

Our logistics manager works directly with our vendors to ensure our strict packaging requirements are in place at all times. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Relationship with U.S. Foods 

&#160; 

We have historically sold the majority of our products, $22,218,034 and $18,446,745 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively (72% and 71% of total sales in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively) through a distributor relationship between FII and Next Day Gourmet, L.P., a subsidiary of U.S. Foods, a leading broadline distributor. On January 26, 2015 we executed a contract between Food Innovations, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, and U.S. Foods. The term of the Agreement is from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016 and provides for up to three (3) automatic annual renewals thereafter if no party gives the other 30 days&#8217; notice of its intent not to renew. 

&#160; 

Growth Strategy 

&#160; 

While the U.S. economic recovery remains fragile, there appears to be much for the specialty food industry to celebrate. According to The Specialty Food Association, specialty food sales during 2014 grew to over $109 billion which represents a 22% increase over 2012 ; with sale to consumers in retail foodservice at approximately $85 billion and sales of specialty foodservice products of over $24.1 billion. Sales of specialty foods in the specialty foodservice channel have grown 30.7% or averaging approximately 10% per year between 2012 and 2014. For our continued growth within the specialty foodservice industry and the consumer specialty food industry , we rely on the availability to our customers of our chefs' culinary skills, a high level of personal customer service, premium quality products, new product introductions, and continued expansion of our marketing activities with new and existing customers in both the specialty foodservice space and the consumer specialty food space. 

&#160;

We anticipate attempting to grow our current specialty foodservice business both through increased sales of existing products to our existing foodservice customers, the introduction of new products to our foodservice customers, increasing our foodservice customer base, and through further entry into markets such as the direct to consumer market through a variety of potential sales channels, and sales partnerships and directly via the web. 

&#160;

In addition to attempting to grow our current business, we believe that there are lateral opportunities in the food industry. We may consider the possibility of acquiring a specialty food manufacturer, or specialty food distributor at some future point in time. We anticipate that, given our current cash flow levels, any acquisition could potentially involve the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or third party financing, which may not be available on acceptable terms. No acquisition will be consummated without thorough due diligence. No assurance can be given that we will be able to identify and successfully conclude negotiations with any potential target. 

&#160; 

General economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for food-prepared-away-from-home and, in turn, can impact our customers and our sales. We believe the current general economic conditions, including pressure on consumer disposable income, may contribute to a slow or declining growth in the overall broadline foodservice market We intend to continue our efforts to expand our market share and grow earnings by focusing on sales growth, margin management, productivity gains and supply chain management, and product and service differentiation. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

While we face intense competition in the marketing of our products and services, it is our belief that there is no other single company in the United States that offers such a broad range of customer service oriented, quality, chef driven products and specialty gourmet meals, for delivery from same day to 72 hours.. Our primary competition in both areas is from local purveyors that supply a limited local market and have a limited range of products and from other specialty gourmet distributors. However, many purveyors are well established, have reputations for success in the development and marketing of these types of products and services and have significantly greater financial, marketing, distribution, personnel and other resources. These financial and other capabilities permit such companies to implement extensive advertising and promotional campaigns, both generally and in response to efforts by additional competitors such as us, to enter into new markets and introduce new products and services. 

&#160; 

Insurance 

&#160; 

We maintain a general liability insurance policy with a per occurrence limit of $1,000,000 and aggregate policy covering $2,000,000 of liability and non-owned automobile personal injury coverage with a limit of $1,000,000. Such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all potential claims against us and additional insurance may not be available in the future at a reasonable price. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Various federal and state laws currently exist, and more are sure to be adopted, regulating the delivery of fresh food products. We require all third-party vendors to certify that they maintain at least $2,000,000 liability insurance coverage and compliance with Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP), an FDA- and USDA-mandated food safety program, or a similar standard. Any changes in the government regulation of delivering of fresh food products that hinders our current ability and/or cost to deliver fresh products, could adversely impact our net revenues and gross margins and, therefore, our profitability and cash flows could also be adversely affected. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

We currently employ 46 full-time employees, including 6 chefs and 2 executive officers. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory. None of our employees are represented by a union.
