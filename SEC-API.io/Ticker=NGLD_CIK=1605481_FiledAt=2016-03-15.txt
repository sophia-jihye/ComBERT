 Item 1. Description of Business. 

&#160; 

Organization 

&#160; 

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on February 27, 2014 with fiscal year end in December 31. On April 28, 2014, we filed a Certificate of Correction to our Articles of Incorporation to correct a typographical error in our Articles of Incorporation to state that the total number of authorized shares were 110,000,000, $0.0001 par value rather than 100,000,000, $0.001 par value. On March 3, 2016, our Board and majority shareholders approved an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation by adding Articles Twelve through Fourteen, which, in summary: (i) grants the board the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision in the Articles; (ii) authorizes the Board, without the consent of the shareholders, to adopt any recapitalization affecting the outstanding securities by effecting a forward or reverse splits of all of the outstanding securities, provided the recapitalization does not require any amendment to the Articles; and (iii) authorizes the Board to change our name without shareholder approval. We are a consulting service company, which provides management and consulting services to early and middle stage start-ups. From beginning operations in March 2014 to May 31, 2015, we had not been engaged by any start-ups to provide any services; however, in June 2015, we were engaged by our first client. In December 2015, we invested $65,000 in a mineral property interest and are required to invest an additional $435,000 over the next two years to maintain our interest. We have accumulated losses in the amount of $156,994 as of December 31, 2015. We have never been party to any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding, nor have we undergone any material reclassification, merger, consolidation, purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business. 

&#160; 

We have only recently commenced planned operations and have begun to generate minimal revenue. We will not be profitable until we derive sufficient revenues and cash flows from the sale of our consulting services or from our investment in our joint venture. Our chief executive officer and director, Jeffrey T. Cocks, is our only employee. Mr. Cocks will devote at least ten hours per week to us but may increase the number of hours as necessary.

&#160; 

On February 28, 2014, we issued 21,000,000 shares of our $0.0001 par value common stock, valued at $0.0001 per share, to our 3 founders, which includes 7,000,000 common shares to our chief executive officer, Jeffrey Cocks and 7,000,000 common shares to our director, Michael Levine, and 7,000,000 common shares to BCIM Management, LP, in exchange for organizational services incurred in our formation, which our board of directors valued at $0.0001 per share, or $700, $700, and $700, respectively for preformation services rendered to develop our organization, business model and website. In January 2015, issued 850,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $0.10 per share for $85,000. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $89,788 in operational expenses and incurred a net loss of ($87,035). We anticipate our burn rate for overhead will be approximately $2,500 per month. We believe that our present capital is sufficient to cover our monthly burn rate for the next 12 months. We believe that we will require approximately $350,000 in cash to accomplish the goals set out in our plan of operation, which includes our joint venture investment. To the extent we are unable to accomplish our goals with the proceeds from the issuance of our common stock, then we intend to raise additional capital from investors through the sale of our common stock or from loans or advances from our founding shareholders.

Business 

&#160; 

We are an early stage company that commenced operations in March 2014. Until May 2015, our activities were limited to organizational and business development activities. In June 2015, we entered into our first consulting agreement. We intend to assist start-ups and development stage companies, as well as established companies, with consulting services focused on providing administrative support and consulting to entertainment, web and mobile technology companies. Our mission is to assist management in early stage companies with services designed to keep them focused on their core business ideas while provide the administrative support such as bookkeeping, payroll, website development and marketing strategies. We intend to focus our marketing efforts in the digital media, entertainment, music, consumer, Internet, and social networking industries and will look at investment opportunities as we encounter them. We will use the Internet as well as the services of an independent sales representative to market our services to start-up companies in California and Nevada with our initial efforts focused in Los Angeles. We also intend to market to service professionals. We have had limited operations and have limited financial resources having raised $85,000 in our initial public offering as of January 5, 2015. Our auditors indicated in their report on our financial statements (the &#8220;Report&#8221;) that &#8220;the Company&#8217;s lack of business operations and early losses raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.&#8221; From our inception to May 2015, we were devoted primarily to start-up, development and operational activities, which include: 

&#160; 

&#160; 1. Formation of the Company; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2. Development of our business plan; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 3. Evaluating various target industries to market our services; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 4. Research on marketing channels/strategies for our services; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 5. Secured our website domain www.techfoundryventures.com and beginning the development of our initial online website; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 6. Research on services and pricing of our services; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 7. Signed non-disclosure agreements with a few third parties to exchange information on cooperative marketing efforts; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 8. Complete our initial public offering. &#160; 

We are offering services to target companies with the mission to assist the founders develop their product and services and provide hands-on support services to reduce startup costs and accelerate time to market. Besides general administrative services, we offer services to assist with product development and design, corporate formation and structure. We also offer virtual office space, financial and accounting resources, marketing and branding services and legal guidance by partnering with law firms and accounting firms. By offering these services, we intend to enable our potential entrepreneurial clients the time to focus on developing their products and services so they are not consumed with administrative activities that will consume valuable time from their work schedules. We believe that the administrative and other consulting services will increase the value of our potential clients&#8217; businesses thereby increasing the attractiveness for additional capital to enable them to bring their products and services to market. We are also evaluating various investment opportunities as we encounter them and, in December 2015, we entered into a joint venture agreement to acquire a 50% interest in a mining project, which is set forth in our Plan of Operation. 

&#160; 

Our goal is to assist entrepreneurs by partnering with them and providing them with the assistance and tools to bring their ideas to market. We initially targeted businesses in Southern California and are now offering our services in Nevada.

Market Opportunity 

&#160; 

The entertainment, web and mobile technology industries are rapidly growing sectors of the U.S. economy, and companies building entertainment and social media applications have grown their user bases and revenues at unprecedented rates in recent years. We believe that an attractive opportunity exists for a public company focused on assisting these businesses in the early-stage of their existence and technological development will provide our opportunity, which can include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Global adoption of Internet infrastructure and the proliferation of mobile technology. The cost of Internet access continues to decline, facilitating an increasing number of Internet users and driving up time spent online. This trend is magnified by the proliferation of smartphones and mobile technology, resulting in users with perpetual access to the Internet. As the Internet becomes more accessible, more data is being transmitted online, requiring evolving applications and businesses to manage this flow of information. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Dramatic shifts in the way people share and consume information. The growing usage and availability of the Internet results in an increasing number of human connections. As more people are connected, an increasing volume of information is being shared. The benefits of this information flow manifest themselves in more ways than simply interacting with friends, and the Internet is becoming an increasingly important tool in businesses&#8217; marketing programs. Connectivity among humans, when harnessed by businesses, can drive marketing costs down to virtually zero. We believe that as more consumption occurs on the Internet, more mediums of efficiently disseminating information are required. This secular shift creates vast opportunities for companies creating and investing in these technologies. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Declining costs to build web- and mobile-based technology . The cost of starting and operating an Internet-based business has dramatically declined over the last decade as a result of dropping hardware costs and maturing open-source software. This decline has resulted in a shift in the capabilities web technology founders look for in a partner. Increasingly, entrepreneurs are valuing business support, brand connections, marketing and product support over the level of funding available from a partner. This adaptation creates a large and growing opportunity for web-technology incubators providing comprehensive support services to entrepreneurs. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Increasing focus on web-based technology and entertainment companies by the capital market. The explosive growth of social media and entertainment content companies has attracted significant capital from investors. By consulting with these businesses, we believe we will benefit from this heightened desire for social media and entertainment investments through greater subsequent financing and sale opportunities for our client companies. &#160; 

Our Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Our goal is to consult with digital media, entertainment, music, consumer, Internet, and social networking companies, as well as other companies, by providing administrative support, which will allow management to focus on their core business. We believe this will generate capital appreciation of the client companies and realized gains for their founders. We believe that by consulting with entrepreneurs at inception, we will generate client loyalty while we add value for our potential clients. The following are key elements of our strategy: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Guide our clients through the challenges of early development. We intend to help provide our client companies with the human capital to cultivate their products and services and grow into profitability. We believe that our services will reduce time, costs and accelerate the time to bring the clients&#8217; products and services to market through managerial assistance, marketing resources, and technological collaboration. As the client companies mature, we can advise them by providing strategic guidance, access to legal and accounting resources. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Apply a structured consulting process to our deployment of personnel and consultants. Web-based technology is becoming increasingly capital-efficient, and our model is optimized to leverage this trend. By advising clients in the earliest stages of their lifecycles we believe that we will achieve returns with minimal expenditures. We intend to use web-based applications, such as QuickBooks Online, to enable us to assist our clients. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Consult to diverse, innovative and dynamic clients. We believe that the low capital requirements to consult with our target clients, coupled with the short development timeline of technology and start-up companies, enable us to spread our resources across a wide spectrum of clients. Some companies will achieve positive cash flow, some will require further capital, and some will fail. By diversifying our target clients and industries, we believe we will mitigate risk and enhance the value of our clients. &#160; 

We intend to provide managerial assistance to our clients and, to the extent available, offer our services for cash or contingent compensation. We will negotiate our fees on a case-by-case basis and intend to offer hourly rates, flat fees and contingent fees for our services. The managerial assistance means, among other things, we, through our directors, officers or employees, offer to provide, and, if accepted, do provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of our client. 

&#160;

We will provide a variety of services to client companies, including the following:

We intend to derive income from our clients for the performance of these services.
