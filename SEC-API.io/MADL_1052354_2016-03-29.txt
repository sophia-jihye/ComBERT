 Item 1. Business 

(a) General &#160; development &#160; of &#160; business 

Man-AHL Diversified I L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the &#147;Partnership&#148;), was organized in September 1997 under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act and commenced trading operations on April 3, 1998, for the purpose of engaging in the speculative trading of physical commodities, futures and forward contracts and related instruments. The Partnership was formerly named AHL Diversified (USA) L.P., but was renamed in February 2002. The Partnership is a &#147;feeder&#148; fund in a &#147;master-feeder&#148; structure, whereby the Partnership invests substantially all of its assets in Man AHL Diversified Trading Company L.P. (the &#147;Trading Company&#148;). AHL Partners LLP (the &#147;Trading Advisor&#148;), a United Kingdom limited liability partnership, is the Partnership&#146;s and the Trading Company&#146;s trading advisor. The Trading Advisor also serves as the Partnership&#146;s commodity pool operator. Man Investments (USA) Corp. (the &#147;General Partner&#148;), a Delaware corporation, is the Partnership&#146;s general partner. The Trading Advisor is an affiliate of the General Partner. Man Investments Holdings Limited, a United Kingdom holding company that is part of Man Group plc, a United Kingdom public limited company, is the sole shareholder of the Trading Advisor, and Man Investments Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation that is part of Man Group plc, is the sole shareholder of the General Partner. 

On January 28, 2008, the Partnership filed a registration statement under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;). The registration statement, which was subsequently amended, became effective on or about March 28, 2008. The Partnership offers two classes of units of limited partnership interest in the Partnership (&#147;Units&#148;): Class A Units are generally offered; Class B Units are offered to employee benefit plans, IRAs and other retirement plans and accounts. The two Classes of Units are identical to each other except that Class B Units may be purchased, transferred, held and redeemed in a minimum amount of $10,000. On April 1, 2009, the Partnership added two new series of Units: Class A Series 2 Units (&#147;Class A-2&#148;) and Class B Series 2 Units (&#147;Class B-2&#148;). Except as described in section (c) below, Class A-2 and Class B-2 units are identical to Class A and B units, respectfully. 

Although the Partnership uses the term &#147;class&#148; to distinguish between certain interests in the Partnership, the Partnership does not believe that the differences between such interests are sufficient to make them separate &#147;classes&#148; under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, as all the interests in the Partnership, regardless of &#147;class,&#148; are of substantially similar character and the holders of which enjoy substantially similar rights and privileges. The holders of interests in the Partnership (regardless of &#147;class&#148;) share pro rata in the Partnership&#146;s profits and losses, enjoying no preferences over one another during the life of the Partnership or upon dissolution and otherwise have identical rights under the Limited Partnership Agreement, the only differences among the &#147;classes&#148; relating to fees and minimum investment. 

The General Partner became the general partner of the Partnership as of April 1, 2005 when Man-AHL (USA) Corp., the Partnership&#146;s original general partner and trading advisor (&#147;Man-AHL&#148;), appointed it as such. In addition to the appointment of the General Partner, Man-AHL appointed Man-AHL (USA) Limited to serve as the trading advisor to the Partnership commencing as of April 1, 2005. Following the appointments of the General Partner as a general partner and Man-AHL (USA) Limited as the trading advisor, Man-AHL resigned as a general partner and trading advisor of the Partnership. The General Partner agreed to continue the Partnership without interruption or change. On June 1, 2014, the General Partner appointed the Trading Advisor as trading advisor of the Partnership, and Man-AHL (USA) Limited resigned as trading advisor. The Trading Advisor implements the same trading program and employs substantively the same personnel as did Man-AHL (USA) Limited. The General Partner controls and manages the business of the Partnership, but has otherwise delegated its investment management authority and commodity pool operator responsibilities with respect to the Partnership to the Trading Advisor. Purchasers of Units, as the Partnership&#146;s &#147;Limited Partners,&#148; have no right to participate in management or control of the Partnership. The offices of the Partnership, where its books and records are kept, are located at the office of the General Partner: HSBC Tower, 452 5 th Ave., 27 th Floor, New York, NY, 10018; telephone (212) 649-6600. 

&#160;

(b) Financial &#160; information &#160; about &#160; segments 

The Partnership&#146;s business constitutes only one segment, i.e. , a speculative commodity pool. The Partnership does not engage in sales of goods and services. Financial information regarding the Partnership&#146;s business is set forth in the Partnership&#146;s Financial Statements incorporated into Item 8 hereof and attached as Exhibit 13.1 hereto. 

(c) Narrative &#160; description &#160; of &#160; business 

The Partnership engages in speculative trading of physical commodities, futures contracts, spot and forward contracts, swaps and options and other related instruments, directly and indirectly through an investment in the Trading Company, pursuant to the trading strategies employed by the Trading Advisor. The Partnership invests substantially all of its assets in the Trading Company. 

The investment objective of the Trading Advisor&#146;s futures trading program (referred to herein as the &#147;AHL Diversified Program&#148;) is to deliver substantial capital growth for commensurate levels of volatility over the medium term, independent of the movement of the stock and bond markets, through the speculative trading, directly and indirectly, of physical commodities, futures contracts, spot and forward contracts, swaps and options on the foregoing, exchanges of futures for physical transactions and other investments (sometimes hereinafter referred to as &#145;futures&#146;) on domestic and international exchanges and markets (including the interbank and over-the-counter (&#147;OTC&#148;) markets). 

The AHL Diversified Program employs a systematic, statistically based investment strategy that is designed to identify and capitalize on inefficiencies in markets around the world. A stable and robust trading and implementation infrastructure is then employed to capitalize on these trading opportunities. The trading systems are quantitative and primarily directional in nature, meaning that investment decisions are entirely driven by mathematical models based on market trends and other historic relationships. Trading signals are always generated systematically; thus the Trading Advisor does not engage in discretionary trading during drawdowns or at other times. Trading takes place around-the-clock and real-time price information is used to respond to price moves across a diverse range of global markets. The trade execution team operates alongside the investment management team in London. It operates 24 hours a day on a rotational eight-hour shift structure. 

The trading process is the product of continuing research and development performed by the Trading Advisor (inclusive of its affiliates) since 1987. Although the underlying investment methodology is proprietary and the precise details confidential, the guiding principles have remained unchanged through the years: diversification, discipline, efficiency, rigorous risk management and ongoing research. 

The AHL Diversified Program invests in a diversified portfolio of instruments which may include futures, options and forward contracts, swaps and other financial derivative instruments both on and off exchange. The AHL Diversified Program trades globally in several market sectors, including, without limitation, currencies, bonds, energies, stock indices, interest rates, metals and agriculture. 

In addition to sector and market diversification, the AHL Diversified Program seeks to achieve diversification by combining various systems driven by computerized processes or trading algorithms, which sample prices in real time and measure price momentum and breakouts. In aggregate, the systems run more than 2,000 price samples each day spread across the 240 or so markets. The trading algorithms aim mainly to capture price trends and close out positions when there is a high probability of a different trend developing, although the AHL Diversified Program may also include algorithmic systems based on quantitative fundamental data that can be captured efficiently, such as interest rate data. Another aspect of diversification is the fact that the various systems generate signals across different time frames, ranging from two to three days to several months, which helps to reduce the risk of the AHL Diversified Program. 

&#160;

In line with the principle of diversification, the approach to portfolio construction and asset allocation is premised on the importance of deploying investment capital across the full range of sectors and markets. Particular attention is paid to correlation of markets and sectors, expected returns, trading costs and market liquidity. Portfolios are regularly reviewed and, when necessary, adjusted to reflect changes in these factors. The Trading Advisor also has a process for adjusting market risk exposure in real time to reflect changes in the volatility of individual markets. 

The integrity of the AHL Diversified Program&#146;s defined investment style is ensured by adherence to a rigorous control process. All the strategies and systems applied by the Trading Advisor are designed to target defined volatility levels rather than returns, and the investment process is underpinned by computer-supported analytical instruments, disciplined real-time risk control and management information systems. As risk control is integral to each part of the investment process, risk management consists primarily of monitoring risk measures and ensuring the systems remain within prescribed limits. A proprietary risk measurement method similar to the industry standard &#147;value-at-risk&#148; helps ensure that the rule-based decisions that drive the investment process remain within predefined risk parameters. Margin-to-equity ratios are monitored daily, and the level of exposure in each market is quantifiable at any time and is adjusted in accordance with market volatility. Market correlation is closely monitored to prevent over-concentration of risk and ensure optimal portfolio weightings. Market liquidity is examined with the objective of ensuring that the Trading Company will be able to initiate and close out trades as indicated by AHL Diversified Program&#146;s systems at market prices, while brokerage selection and trade execution are continually monitored with the objective of ensuring quality market access. 

As the success of the AHL Diversified Program is largely dependent on its systems, the Trading Advisor is committed to investing in leading computer technology. The Trading Advisor (inclusive of affiliates) also maintains a disaster recovery site where a back-up trading system runs permanently and in parallel with the main system. 

The AHL Diversified Program uses margin and considerable leverage to reach model allocations. 

The AHL Diversified Program is supported by a dedicated team of investment specialists that continually seek to extend the range and versatility of the original investment techniques. As such, the Trading Advisor may increase the number and diversity of markets, strategies and instruments traded directly or indirectly by the AHL Diversified Program. 

The Trading Advisor is paid a monthly management fee, payable in arrears, in an amount equal to 0.1667% of the month-end Net Asset Value of the Partnership (as defined in the Partnership&#146;s Sixth Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement, as the same may be amended or supplemented from time to time (the &#147;Agreement&#148;)) whether or not the Partnership is profitable (approximately 2% annually). The General Partner is paid a monthly general partner administrative fee in an amount equal to 0.0833% of the month-end Net Asset Value of the Partnership whether or not the Partnership is profitable (approximately 1% annually). The Trading Advisor may pay a portion of its management fee to the General Partner, and the General Partner may share a portion of its administrative fee with the Placement Agent (as defined below). 

The Partnership will pay the Trading Advisor an incentive fee equal to 20% of the Net New Appreciation (as defined in the Agreement), if any, achieved by the Partnership as of the end of such calendar month. Net New Appreciation achieved during a calendar month means the excess, if any, of (a) the Net Asset Value of the Partnership as of the end of a calendar month (without reduction for any incentive fees accrued or paid to the Trading Advisor for the calendar month or for any redemptions or distributions effected during or as of the end of such calendar month and without increase for any additional capital contributions effected during or as of the end of such calendar month) over (b) the Net Asset Value of the Partnership as of the end of the most recent prior calendar month for which an incentive fee was accrued or paid to the Trading Advisor, with clause (b) reduced by the amount of the incentive fee accrued or paid for such prior calendar month and also reduced by any redemptions or distributions, and increased by any contributions, effected as of or subsequent to the end of such prior calendar month through the first day of the calendar month referred to in clause (a), above. 

&#160;

Man Investments Inc., an affiliate of the General Partner and Trading Advisor, is the lead placement agent for the Partnership (the &#147;Placement Agent&#148;). In connection with various services provided by the Placement Agent to the Partnership related to the offer and sale of interests in the Partnership and the ongoing servicing of its investors, the Partnership will pay the Placement Agent a servicing fee equal to, in respect to Class A Units and Class B Units, 0.0833% of the month-end Net Asset Value of such Units (approximately 1% annually), and in respect of Class A-2 Units and Class B-2 Units, 0.0625% of the month-end Net Asset Value of such Units (approximately 0.75% annually), whether or not the Partnership is profitable as of the end of each month. The Placement Agent may pass all or a portion of the servicing fee on to certain other selling and services agents. In addition, Units purchased through such selling and services agents may be subject to the payment of an additional upfront selling commission of up to 3% of the purchase price of the Units. 

The Partnership&#146;s organizational and initial offering fees and expenses were approximately $50,000 (including its pro-rata share of the Trading Company&#146;s organizational fees and expenses) and have been paid by the Partnership. Such organizational fees and expenses (excluding promotional and offering fees and expenses) have been completely amortized. The Partnership pays all of its expenses incurred in the ordinary course of its business. The Partnership also pays its extraordinary expenses, if any. 

The Trading Company utilizes a number of brokers in the performance of its trading activities. Credit Suisse Securities (USA), J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &#38; Smith Incorporated serve as the Trading Company&#146;s futures brokers; the Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch serve as the Trading Company&#146;s foreign exchange prime brokers; J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) also act as the clearing members for centrally cleared credit default swap index transactions engaged in by the Trading Company; and the Trading Company conducts certain OTC interest rate swap trading through the JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Royal Bank of Scotland and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (collectively, the &#147;Brokers&#148;). The Partnership is charged brokerage commissions at institutional rates, inclusive of all applicable National Futures Association (the &#147;NFA&#148;), exchange, clearing and other transaction fees. In connection with trading spot and forward contracts in the interbank foreign currency markets, the Partnership pays clearing fees of between $3.25 and $4.00 per transaction as well as dealer profits, which cannot be quantified, embedded in dealer quotes. 

The Partnership invests substantially all of its assets in the Trading Company. Most of the Trading Company&#146;s assets will be held in cash or United States (&#147;U.S.&#148;) government securities in accounts in the name of the Trading Company at the brokers or a bank, which currently is The Bank of New York Mellon and in order to conduct futures trading activities, will be transferred, as necessary, into segregated accounts at the brokers. Approximately 20% to 40% of the Trading Company&#146;s assets will be committed as margin for futures positions. The brokers may receive compensating balance treatment and excess interest income on the Partnership&#146;s assets, through the Trading Company, held at the brokers in the form of cash. 

The Trading Company engages in trading on non-U.S. exchanges and markets. In connection with trading on non-U.S. exchanges and markets, the brokers may either maintain Trading Company assets in accordance with the requirements of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the &#147;CFTC&#148;) Rule 30.7 or may redeposit Trading Company assets with non-U.S. banks and brokers which may not be subject to regulatory schemes comparable to those applicable to the Brokers. 

Regulation 

Under the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (the &#147;CEA&#148;), commodity exchanges and trading in futures and swaps (as defined in the CEA) are subject to regulation by the CFTC. The NFA, a &#147;registered futures association&#148; under the CEA, is the only non-exchange self-regulatory organization for futures industry professionals. The CFTC has delegated to the NFA responsibility for the registration of &#147;commodity trading advisors,&#148; &#147;commodity pool operators,&#148; &#147;futures commission merchants,&#148; &#147;swap dealers,&#148; &#147;introducing brokers&#148; and their respective associated persons and &#147;floor brokers&#148; and &#147;floor traders.&#148; The CEA requires commodity 

&#160;

pool operators and commodity trading advisors, such as the General Partner and Trading Advisor, respectively, and commodity brokers, swap dealers, or futures commission merchants to be registered and to comply with various reporting and record keeping requirements. The CFTC may suspend a commodity pool operator&#146;s or trading advisor&#146;s registration if it finds that its trading practices tend to disrupt orderly market conditions or in certain other situations. In the event that the registration of the Trading Advisor as a commodity pool operator or commodity trading advisor were terminated or suspended, the Trading Advisor would be unable to fulfill its obligations as the Partnership&#146;s commodity pool operator or implement the AHL Diversified Program on behalf of the Partnership. Should the Trading Advisor&#146;s registrations be suspended, termination of the Partnership might result. 

In addition to such registration requirements, the CFTC and certain commodity exchanges have established limits on the maximum net long or net short position which any person may hold or control in particular commodities. Most exchanges also limit the changes in futures contract prices that may occur during a single trading day. 

The CFTC adopted a separate position limits rule for 28 so-called &#147;exempt&#148; ( i.e. metals and energy) and agricultural futures and options contracts and their economically equivalent swap contracts. Limits in spot months were generally to be set at 25% of the official estimated deliverable supply of the underlying commodity and, in a non-spot month, a percentage of the average aggregate 12-month rolling open interest in all months (swaps and futures) for each contract. Although substantial portions of this rule were vacated by court action, the CFTC, in November 2013, proposed substantially similar rules to its prior position limits regime. It is as yet unclear whether the Trading Advisor will be required to modify its trading on behalf of its clients, including the Trading Company, with respect to certain futures contracts which may have an adverse affect the Partnership.
