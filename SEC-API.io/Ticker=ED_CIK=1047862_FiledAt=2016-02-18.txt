PART I 

&#160; 

Item 1: Business 

Overview 

Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison), incorporated in New York State in 1997, is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding common stock of Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (CECONY), Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&#38;R), the competitive energy businesses and Con Edison Transmission, Inc. (Con Edison Transmission). As used in this report, the term the &#8220;Companies&#8221; refers to Con Edison and CECONY. 

Con Edison&#8217;s principal business operations are those of CECONY, O&#38;R and the competitive energy businesses. CECONY&#8217;s principal business operations are its regulated electric, gas and steam delivery businesses. O&#38;R&#8217;s principal business operations are its regulated electric and gas delivery businesses. The competitive energy businesses sell electricity to retail customers, provide energy-related products and services, and develop, own and operate renewable and energy infrastructure projects. 

Con Edison seeks to provide shareholder value through continued dividend growth, supported by earnings growth in regulated utilities and contracted assets. The company invests to provide reliable, resilient, safe and clean energy critical for New York City&#8217;s growing economy. The company is an industry-leading owner and operator of contracted, large-scale solar generation in the United States. Con Edison is a responsible neighbor, helping the communities it serves become more sustainable. 

CECONY 

Electric 

CECONY provides electric service to approximately 3.4 million customers in all of New York City (except a part of Queens) and most of Westchester County, an approximately 660 square mile service area with a population of more than nine million. 

Gas 

CECONY delivers gas to approximately 1.1 million customers in Manhattan, the Bronx, parts of Queens and most of Westchester County. 

Steam 

CECONY operates the largest steam distribution system in the United States by producing and delivering approximately 22,000 MMlb of steam annually to approximately 1,700 customers in parts of Manhattan. 

O&#38;R 

Electric 

O&#38;R and its utility subsidiaries, Rockland Electric Company (RECO) and Pike County Light &#38; Power Company (Pike) (together referred to herein as O&#38;R) provide electric service to approximately 0.3 million customers in southeastern New York and in adjacent areas of northern New Jersey and northeastern Pennsylvania, an approximately 1,350 square mile service area. 

Gas 

O&#38;R delivers gas to over 0.1 million customers in southeastern New York and adjacent areas of northeastern Pennsylvania. 

Assets Held for Sale 

In October 2015, O&#38;R entered into an agreement to sell Pike to Corning Natural Gas Holding Corporation (see 

Note U to the financial statements in Item 8). 

Competitive Energy Businesses 

Con Edison pursues competitive energy opportunities through three wholly-owned subsidiaries: Con Edison Solutions, Con Edison Energy and Con Edison Development. These businesses sell to retail customers electricity purchased in wholesale markets and enter into related hedging transactions, provide energy-related products and services to wholesale and retail customers, and develop, own and operate renewable and energy infrastructure projects. 

Assets Held for Sale 

In June 2015, Con Edison initiated a plan to sell the retail electric supply business of its competitive energy businesses &#32;(see Note U to the financial statements in Item 8). 

Con Edison Transmission 

Con Edison Transmission invests in electric and gas transmission projects through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Consolidated Edison Transmission, LLC (CET Electric) and Con Edison Gas Midstream, LLC (CET Gas). CET Electric, which was formed in 2014, is investing in a company that is expected to own electric transmission assets being developed in New York. At December 31, 2015, Con Edison&#8217;s capital contribution to CET Electric was $3 million. CET Gas, which was formed in 2016, is investing in a company developing a proposed gas transmission project in West Virginia and Virginia. See &#8220;Con Edison Transmission,&#8221; below. 

Utility Regulation 

State Utility Regulation 

Regulators 

The Utilities are subject to regulation by the NYSPSC, which under the New York Public Service Law, is authorized to set the terms of service and the rates the Utilities charge for providing service in New York. See &#8220;Rate Plans,&#8221; below and in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. It also approves the issuance of the Utilities&#8217; securities. See &#8220;Capital Resources,&#8221; below. It exercises jurisdiction over the siting of the Utilities&#8217; electric transmission lines (see &#8220;Con Edison Transmission,&#8221; below) and approves mergers or other business combinations involving New York utilities. In addition, it has the authority to impose penalties on utilities, which could be substantial, for violating state utility laws and regulations and its orders. See &#8220;Other Regulatory Matters&#8221; in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. O&#38;R&#8217;s New Jersey subsidiary, RECO, is subject to similar regulation by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU). O&#38;R&#8217;s Pennsylvania subsidiary, Pike, is subject to similar regulation by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PAPUC). The NYSPSC, together with the NJBPU and the PAPUC, are referred to herein as state utility regulators. 

In March 2013, following the issuance of recommendations by a commission established by the Governor of New York and submission by the Governor of a bill to the State legislature, the New York Public Service Law was amended to, among other things, authorize the NYSPSC to (i) levy expanded penalties against combination gas and electric utilities; (ii) review, at least every five years, an electric utility&#8217;s capability to provide safe, adequate and reliable service, order the utility to comply with additional and more stringent terms of service than existed prior to the review, assess the continued operation of the utility as the provider of electric service in its service territory and propose, and act upon, such measures as are necessary to ensure safe and adequate service; and (iii) based on findings of repeated violations of the New York Public Service Law or rules or regulations adopted thereto that demonstrate a failure of a combination gas and electric utility to continue to provide safe and adequate service, revoke or modify an operating certificate issued to the utility by the NYSPSC (following consideration of certain factors, including public interest and standards deemed necessary by the NYSPSC to ensure continuity of service, and due process). 

New York Utility Industry 

Restructuring in the 1990s 

In the 1990s, the NYSPSC restructured the electric utility industry in the state. In accordance with NYSPSC orders, the Utilities sold all of their electric generating facilities other than those that also produce steam for CECONY&#8217;s steam business (see Electric Operations &#8211; Electric Facilities below) and provided all of their customers the choice to buy electricity or gas from the Utilities or other suppliers (see Electric Operations &#8211; Electric Sales and Deliveries and 

Gas Operations &#8211; Gas Sales and Deliveries below). In 2015, 65 percent of the electricity and 31 percent of the gas CECONY delivered to its customers, and 58 percent of the electricity and 45 percent of the gas O&#38;R delivered to its customers, was purchased by the customers from other suppliers. In addition, the Utilities no longer control and operate their bulk power electric transmission facilities. See &#8220;New York Independent System Operator (NYISO),&#8221; below. 

Following industry restructuring, there were several utility mergers as a result of which substantially all of the electric and gas delivery service in New York State is now provided by one of four investor-owned utility companies &#8211; Con Edison, National Grid plc, Avangrid, Inc. (an affiliate of Iberdrola, S.A.) and Fortis Inc. &#8211; or one of two state authorities &#8211; New York Power Authority (NYPA) or Long Island Power Authority. 

Reforming the Energy Vision 

In April 2014, the NYSPSC instituted its REV proceeding, the goals of which are to improve electric system efficiency and reliability, encourage renewable energy resources, support distributed energy resources (DER) and empower customer choice. In this proceeding, the NYSPSC is examining the establishment of a distributed system platform to manage and coordinate DER, and provide customers with market data and tools to manage their energy use. The NYSPSC also is examining how its regulatory practices should be modified to incent utility practices to promote REV objectives. 

In February 2015, the NYSPSC issued an order in its REV proceeding in which, among other things, the NYSPSC: 

&#8226; 

ordered CECONY, O&#38;R and the other electric utilities to file distributed system implementation plans pursuant to which the utilities, under the NYSPSC&#8217;s authority and supervision, would serve as distributed system platforms to optimize the use of DER; 

&#8226; 

indicated that the utilities will be allowed to own DER only under limited circumstances, and that utility affiliate ownership of DER within the utility&#8217;s service territory will require market power protections; 

&#8226; 

ordered the utilities to file energy efficiency plans See &#8220;Environmental Matters - Climate Change," below; 

&#8226; 

instituted a separate proceeding to consider large-scale renewable generation; 

&#8226; 

required the utilities to file demonstration projects for approval by NYSPSC staff; and 

&#8226; 

indicated that the design and implementation of the reformed energy system will occur over a period of years. 

In June 2015, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) submitted a report in the large-scale renewable generation proceeding. The report included program design principles and strategies. The NYSPSC requested comments on, among other things: customer funding mechanisms; utility-backed power purchase agreements; financing options; and utility-owned generation. In December 2015, the Governor of New York directed the NYSPSC to establish a clean energy standard to mandate achievement by 2030 of the State Energy Plan&#8217;s goals of 50 percent of the State&#8217;s electricity being provided from renewable resources and reducing carbon emissions by 40 percent (see &#8220;Environmental Matters - Climate Change,&#8221; below) and to support the continued operation of upstate nuclear plants. In January 2016, the NYSPSC expanded the scope of this proceeding to include consideration of a clean energy standard and the NYSPSC staff issued a report in which it recommended that New York load serving entities be responsible for supplying a defined percentage of their retail customer load from eligible resources. The NYSPSC staff recommended that compliance be demonstrated through the use of tradable renewable energy credits and zero emissions credits or an alternative compliance payment mechanism. The NYSPSC staff suggested that utilities should act as the financial guarantor of NYSERDA&#8217;s renewable energy credit activities. In addition, the NYSPSC staff recommended that New York utilities be required to procure an appropriate percentage of their renewable energy credit targets through long-term power purchase agreements with developers of renewable generation and that utility ownership of generation be permitted only in exceptional circumstances. 

In July 2015, the NYSPSC staff issued a white paper on ratemaking and utility business models in the REV proceeding. The NYSPSC staff indicated that the proposals included in the white paper reflect several foundational principles: align earning opportunities with customer value; maintain flexibility; provide accurate and appropriate value signals; maintain a sound electric industry; shift balance of regulatory incentives to market incentives; and achieve public policy objectives. The white paper, among other things, included proposals for: market based earnings opportunities, including distributed system platform revenues; adoption of earnings impact mechanisms to incent peak demand reduction, energy efficiency, customer engagement and information access, affordability and interconnection; retention of existing safety, reliability, customer service and utility-specific performance mechanisms; modifications to rate plan net utility plant reconciliations to encourage cost-effective use of operating resources and third-party investment; tying rate plan earnings sharing mechanisms to a performance index; 

pre-approval, where appropriate, of investments in distributed system platform capabilities; three-year rate plans, with an opportunity for two-year extensions; and rate design and DER compensation, including net energy metering, standby service tariffs, study of demand charges and facilitation of time-of use rates. The NYSPSC is expected to make policy determinations in 2016 on the regulatory design and regulatory matters addressed in the white paper. 

In November 2015, CECONY submitted to the NYSPSC an update to the company&#8217;s advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) plan for its electric and gas delivery businesses. The plan, which is subject to NYSPSC review and approval, addresses AMI&#8217;s financial, operations and environmental benefits to customers and how AMI supports the REV proceeding&#8217;s objectives. AMI components include smart meters, a communication network, information technology systems and business applications. The plan provides for full deployment of AMI to the company&#8217;s customers to be implemented over a six-year period. Under the plan, aggregate estimated capital expenditures for AMI implementation would be approximately $1,300 million, including $69 million of AMI capital expenditures in 2016. O&#38;R&#8217;s electric and gas rate plans authorize, subject to NYSPSC modification or halt following its further consideration of AMI implementation, aggregate capital expenditures of approximately $30 million to begin AMI implementation for the company&#8217;s customers. 

In December 2015, the NYSPSC authorized a cost recovery surcharge mechanism for REV demonstration projects. Three CECONY and one O&#38;R demonstration projects have been approved by the NYSPSC staff. The demonstration projects are expected to inform decisions with respect to developing distributed system platform functionalities, measuring customer response to programs and prices associated with REV markets. 

In January 2016, the NYSPSC established a benefit cost analysis framework that will apply to, among other things, utility proposals to make investments that could instead be met through DER alternatives that meet all applicable reliability and safety requirements. The framework&#8217;s primary measure is a societal cost test which, in addition to addressing avoided utility costs, is to quantitatively address certain environmental externalities and, where appropriate, qualitatively address other externalities. The NYSPSC directed the utilities to develop and file benefit cost analysis handbooks to guide DER providers in structuring their projects and proposals. 

The NYSPSC is conducting additional proceedings to consider certain REV-related matters, including proceedings on DER valuation and net energy metering. 

The Companies are not able to predict the outcome of the REV proceeding or related proceedings or their impact. 

Rate Plans 

Investor-owned utilities in the United States provide delivery service to customers according to the terms of tariffs approved by the appropriate state utility regulator. The tariffs include schedules of rates for service that limit the rates charged by the utilities to amounts that recover from their customers costs approved by the regulator, including capital costs, of providing service to customers as defined by the tariff. The tariffs implement rate plans adopted by state utility regulators in rate orders issued at the conclusion of rate proceedings. The utilities&#8217; earnings depend on the limits on rates authorized in their rate plans and their ability to operate their businesses in a manner consistent with such rate plans. 

The utilities&#8217; rate plans cover specified periods, but rates determined pursuant to a plan generally continue in effect until a new rate plan is approved by the state utility regulator. In New York, either the utility or the NYSPSC can commence a proceeding for a new rate plan, and a new rate plan filed by the utility will generally take effect automatically in approximately 11 months unless prior to such time the NYSPSC approves a rate plan. 

In each rate proceeding, rates are determined by the state utility regulator following the submission by the utility of testimony and supporting information, which are subject to review by the staff of the regulator. Other parties with an interest in the proceeding can also review the utility&#8217;s proposal and become involved in the rate proceeding. The review process is overseen by an administrative law judge who is employed by the NYSPSC. After an administrative law judge issues a recommended decision, that generally considers the interests of the utility, the regulatory staff, other parties, and legal requisites, the regulator will issue a rate order. The utility and the regulator&#8217;s staff and interested parties may enter jointly into a proposed settlement agreement prior to the completion of this administrative process, in which case the agreement could be approved by the regulator with or without modification. 

For each rate plan, the revenues needed to provide the utility a return on invested capital is determined by multiplying the utilities&#8217; forecasted rate base by the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital determined in the rate plan. In general, rate base is the sum of the utility&#8217;s net plant and working capital less deferred taxes. The NYSPSC uses a forecast of the average rate base for the year that new rates would be in effect (rate year). The NJBPU and 

the PAPUC use the rate base balances that would exist at the beginning of the rate year. The capital structure used in the weighted average cost of capital is determined using actual and forecast data for the same time periods as rate base. The costs of long-term debt, customer deposits and the allowed return on common equity represent a combination of actual and forecast financing information. The allowed return on common equity is determined by each state&#8217;s respective utility regulator. The NYSPSC&#8217;s current methodology for determining the allowed return on common equity assigns a one-third weight to an estimate determined from a capital asset pricing model applied to a peer group of utility companies and a two-thirds weight to an estimate determined from a dividend discount model using stock prices and dividend forecasts for a peer group of utility companies. Both methodologies employ market measurements of equity capital to estimate returns rather than the accounting measurements to which such estimates are applied in setting rates. 

Pursuant to the Utilities&#8217; rate plans, there generally can be no change to the rates charged to customers during the respective terms of the rate plans other than specified adjustments provided for in the rate plans. 

For information about the Utilities&#8217; rate plans see Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. 

Liability for Service Interruptions 

The tariff provisions under which CECONY provides electric, gas and steam service, and O&#38;R provides electric and gas service, limit each company&#8217;s liability to pay for damages resulting from service interruptions to circumstances resulting from its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The tariff provisions under which RECO and Pike provide electric service provide that the company is not liable for interruptions that are due to causes beyond its control. 

CECONY&#8217;s tariff for electric service also provides for reimbursement to electric customers for spoilage losses resulting from service interruptions in certain circumstances. In general, the company is obligated to reimburse affected residential and commercial customers for food spoilage of up to approximately $500 and $10,000, respectively, and reimburse affected residential customers for prescription medicine spoilage losses without limitation on amount per claim. The company&#8217;s maximum aggregate liability for such reimbursement for an incident is $15 million. The company is not required to provide reimbursement to electric customers for outages attributable to generation or transmission system facilities or events beyond its control, such as storms, provided the company makes reasonable efforts to restore service as soon as practicable. 

New York electric utilities are required to provide credits to customers who are without electric service for more than three days. The credit to a customer would equal the portion of the monthly customer charge attributable to the period the customer was without service. If an extraordinary event occurs, the NYSPSC may direct New York gas utilities to implement the same policies. 

The NYSPSC has approved a scorecard for use as a guide to assess electric utility performance in restoring electric service during outages that result from a major storm event. The scorecard, which could also be applied by the NYSPSC for other outages or actions, was developed to work with the penalty and emergency response plan provisions of the New York Public Service Law. The scorecard includes performance metrics in categories for preparation, operations response and communications. 

Each New York electric utility is required to submit to the NYSPSC annually a plan for the reasonably prompt restoration of service in the case of widespread outages in the utility&#8217;s service territory due to storms or other events beyond the control of the utility. If, after evidentiary hearings or other investigatory proceedings, the NYSPSC finds that the utility failed to implement its plan reasonably, the NYSPSC may deny recovery of any part of the service restoration costs caused by such failure. In March 2015, the NYSPSC approved emergency response plans submitted by CECONY and O&#38;R, subject to certain modifications. In December 2015, CECONY and O&#38;R submitted updated plans. 

Generic Proceedings 

The NYSPSC from time to time conducts &#8220;generic&#8221; proceedings to consider issues relating to all electric and gas utilities operating in New York State. Pending proceedings include the REV proceeding and related proceedings, discussed above, and proceedings relating to data access; retail access; utility staffing levels; energy efficiency and renewable energy programs; low income customers and consumer protections. The Utilities are typically active participants in such proceedings. 

Federal Utility Regulation 

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), among other things, regulates the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce and the transmission and sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce. In addition, the FERC has the authority to impose penalties, which could be substantial, including penalties for the violation of reliability and cyber security rules. Certain activities of the Utilities and the competitive energy businesses are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC. The Utilities are subject to regulation by the FERC with respect to electric transmission rates and to regulation by the NYSPSC with respect to electric and gas retail commodity sales and local delivery service. As a matter of practice, the NYSPSC has approved delivery service rates for the Utilities that include both transmission and distribution costs. The electric and gas transmission projects in which CET Electric and CET Gas invest are also subject to regulation by the FERC. See &#8220;Con Edison Transmission,&#8221; below. 

New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) 

The NYISO is a not-for-profit organization that controls and operates most of the electric transmission facilities in New York State, including those of the Utilities, as an integrated system. It also administers wholesale markets for electricity in New York State and facilitates the construction of new transmission it considers necessary to meet identified reliability, economic or public policy needs. The New York State Reliability Council (NYSRC) promulgates reliability standards subject to FERC oversight. Pursuant to a requirement that is set annually by the NYSRC, the NYISO requires that entities supplying electricity to customers in New York State have generating capacity (owned, procured through the NYISO capacity markets or contracted for) in an amount equal to the peak demand of their customers plus the applicable reserve margin. In addition, the NYISO has determined that entities that serve customers in New York City must procure sufficient capacity from resources that are electrically located in New York City to cover a substantial percentage of the peak demands of their New York City customers. It also requires entities that serve customers in the lower Hudson valley and New York City customers that are served through the lower Hudson valley to procure sufficient capacity from resources electrically located in the lower Hudson valley. These requirements apply both to regulated utilities such as CECONY and O&#38;R for the customers they supply under regulated tariffs and to companies such as Con Edison Solutions that supply customers on market terms. To address the possibility of a disruption due to the unavailability of gas, generating units located in New York City that are capable of using either gas or oil as fuel may be required to use oil as fuel for certain periods and new generating units are required to have dual fuel capability. RECO, O&#38;R&#8217;s New Jersey subsidiary, provides electric service in an area that has a different independent system operator &#8211; PJM Interconnection LLC (PJM). See &#8220;CECONY &#8211; Electric Operations &#8211; Electric Supply&#8221; and &#8220;O&#38;R &#8211; Electric Operations &#8211; Electric Supply,&#8221; below. 

Competition 

The Utilities do not consider it reasonably likely that another company would be authorized to provide utility delivery service of electricity, natural gas or steam where the company already provides service. Any such other company would need to obtain NYSPSC consent, satisfy applicable local requirements, install facilities to provide the service, meet applicable services standards, and charge customers comparable taxes and other fees and costs imposed on the service. A new delivery company would also be subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the NYSPSC. See &#8220;Utility Regulation &#8211; State Utility Regulation &#8211; Regulators,&#8221; above. 

Distributed generation, such as solar energy production facilities, fuel cells and micro-turbines, provide alternative sources of energy for the Utilities&#8217; electric delivery customers, as does oil for the Utilities&#8217; gas delivery customers. Micro-grids and community-based micro-grids enable distributed generation to serve multiple locations and multiple customers. Other distributed energy resources, such as demand reduction and energy efficiency programs, provide alternatives for the Utilities&#8217; delivery customers to manage their energy usage. The following table shows the aggregate capacities of the distributed generation projects connected to the Utilities&#8217; distribution systems at December 31, 2015 and 2014:

The Utilities 

CECONY 

CECONY, incorporated in New York State in 1884, is a subsidiary of Con Edison and has no significant subsidiaries of its own. Its principal business segments are its regulated electric, gas and steam businesses. 

For a discussion of the company&#8217;s operating revenues and operating income for each segment, see &#8220;Results of Operations&#8221; in Item 7. For additional information about the segments, see Note N to the financial statements in Item 8. 

Electric Operations 

Electric Facilities 

CECONY&#8217;s capitalized costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, for distribution facilities were $16,394 million &#32;and $15,531 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. For its transmission facilities, the costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, were $2,833 million &#32;and $2,744 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively, and for its portion of the steam-electric generation facilities, the costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, were $459 million &#32;and $451 million , at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

Distribution Facilities. &#32;CECONY owns 62 area distribution substations and various distribution facilities located throughout New York City and Westchester County. At December 31, 2015 , the company&#8217;s distribution system had a transformer capacity of 29,762 MVA, with 36,929 miles of overhead distribution lines and 97,286 miles of underground distribution lines. The underground distribution lines represent the single longest underground electric delivery system in the United States. 

Transmission Facilities. The company&#8217;s transmission facilities are located in New York City and Westchester, Orange, Rockland, Putnam and Dutchess counties in New York State. At December 31, 2015 , CECONY owned or jointly owned 438 miles of overhead circuits operating at 138, 230, 345 and 500 kV and 749 miles of underground circuits operating at 69, 138 and 345 kV. The company&#8217;s 39 transmission substations and 62 area stations are supplied by circuits operated at 69 kV and above. For information about transmission projects to address, among other things, reliability concerns associated with the potential closure of the Indian Point Energy Center (which is owned by Entergy Corporation subsidiaries) see &#8220;CECONY &#8211; Electric Operations &#8211; Electric Supply&#8221; and &#8220;Con Edison Transmission,&#8221; below. 

CECONY&#8217;s transmission facilities interconnect with those of National Grid, Central Hudson Gas &#38; Electric Corporation, O&#38;R, New York State Electric &#38; Gas, Connecticut Light &#38; Power Company, Long Island Power Authority, NYPA and Public Service Electric and Gas Company. 

Generating Facilities. CECONY&#8217;s electric generating facilities consist of plants located in Manhattan whose primary purpose is to produce steam for the company's steam business. The facilities have an aggregate capacity of 724 MW. The company expects to have sufficient amounts of gas and fuel oil available in 2016 &#32;for use in these facilities. 

Electric Sales and Deliveries 

CECONY delivers electricity to its full-service customers who purchase electricity from the company. The company also delivers electricity to its customers who choose to purchase electricity from other energy suppliers (retail choice program). In addition, the company delivers electricity to state and municipal customers of NYPA and economic development customers of municipal electric agencies. 

The company charges all customers in its service area for the delivery of electricity. The company generally recovers, on a current basis, the cost of the electricity that it buys and then sells to its full-service customers. It does not make any margin or profit on the electricity it sells. CECONY&#8217;s electric revenues are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism. As a result, its electric delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. CECONY&#8217;s electric sales and deliveries for the last five years were:

Electric Peak Demand 

The electric peak demand in CECONY&#8217;s service area generally occurs during the summer air conditioning season. &#32; The weather during the summer of &#32; 2015 &#32; was cooler than design conditions. &#32; CECONY&#8217;s 2015 &#32;service area peak demand was 12,316 MW, which occurred on July 20, 2015. The 2015 &#32;peak demand included an estimated 4,795 MW for CECONY&#8217;s full-service customers, 5,745 MW for customers participating in its electric retail choice program and 1,776 MW for NYPA&#8217;s electric commodity customers and municipal electric agency customers. &#8220;Design weather&#8221; for the electric system is a standard to which the actual peak demand is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes. Since the NYISO can invoke demand reduction programs under specific circumstances, design conditions do not include these programs&#8217; potential impact. However, the CECONY forecasted peak demand at design conditions does include the impact of certain demand reduction programs. The company estimates that, under design weather conditions, the 2016 &#32;service area peak demand wil l be 13,650 MW, including an estimated 6,340 MW for its full-service customers, 5,315 MW for its electric retail choice customers and 1,995 M W for NYPA&#8217;s customers and municipal electric agency customers. The company forecasts an average annual growth in electric peak demand in its service area at design conditions over the next five years to be approximately 0.2 percent per year. 

Electric Supply 

Most of the electricity sold by CECONY to its full-service customers in 2015 &#32;was purchased under firm power contracts or through the wholesale electricity market administered by the NYISO. The company expects that these resources will again be adequate to meet the requirements of its customers in 2016 . The company plans to meet its continuing obligation to supply electricity to its customers through a combination of electricity purchased under contracts, purchased through the NYISO&#8217;s wholesale electricity market, or generated from its electricity generating facilities. For information about the company&#8217;s contracts for approximately 1,900 MW of electric generating capacity, see Notes I and O to the financial statements in Item 8. To reduce the volatility of its customers&#8217; electric energy costs, the company has contracts to purchase electric energy and enters into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of a portion of its expected purchases under these contracts and through the NYISO&#8217;s wholesale electricity market. 

CECONY owns generating stations in New York City associated primarily with its steam system. As of December 31, 2015 , the generating stations had a combined electric capacity of approximately 724 MW, based on 2015 &#32;summer test ratings. For information about electric generating capacity owned by the company, see &#8220;Electric Operations &#8211; Electric Facilities &#8211; Generating Facilities,&#8221; above. 

In general, the Utilities recover their purchased power costs, including the cost of hedging purchase prices, pursuant to rate provisions approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. See &#8220;Financial 

and Commodity Market Risks &#8211; Commodity Price Risk,&#8221; in Item 7 and &#8220;Recoverable Energy Costs&#8221; in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. From time to time, certain parties have petitioned the NYSPSC to review these provisions, the elimination of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companies&#8217; financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 

CECONY monitors the adequacy of the electric capacity resources and related developments in its service area, and works with other parties on long-term resource adequacy within the framework of the NYISO. In addition, the NYISO has adopted reliability rules that include obligations on transmission owners (such as CECONY) to construct facilities that may be needed for system reliability if the market does not solve a reliability need identified by the NYISO. See &#8220;New York Independent System Operator&#8221; above. In a July 1998 order, the NYSPSC indicated that it &#8220;agree(s) generally that CECONY need not plan on constructing new generation as the competitive market develops,&#8221; but considers &#8220;overly broad&#8221; and did not adopt CECONY&#8217;s request for a declaration that, solely with respect to providing generating capacity, it will no longer be required to engage in long-range planning to meet potential demand and, in particular, that it will no longer have the obligation to construct new generating facilities, regardless of the market price of capacity. 

In November 2012, the NYSPSC directed CECONY to work with NYPA to develop a contingency plan to address reliability concerns associated with the potential closure of the nuclear power plants at the Indian Point Energy Center (which is owned by Entergy Corporation subsidiaries). In February 2013, CECONY and NYPA submitted their plan, and, in October 2013, the NYSPSC approved three transmission projects and several energy efficiency, demand reduction and combined heat and power programs to address concerns associated with the potential closure. The transmission projects, which also address transmission congestion between upstate and downstate and make available more generation from Staten Island, are scheduled to be placed into service in 2016. See &#8220;Con Edison Transmission&#8221; below. In February 2014, CECONY submitted to the NYSPSC the implementation plan for the energy efficiency, demand reduction and combined heat and power programs, which are estimated to cost up to $285 million. In April 2014, the NYSPSC authorized CECONY to recover its program costs, the majority of which are expected to be incurred from 2014 through 2016, over a ten-year period through a surcharge billed to its electric delivery customers. 

Gas Operations 

Gas Facilities 

CECONY&#8217;s capitalized costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, for gas facilities, which are primarily distribution facilities, were $5,196 million &#32;and $4,530 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

Natural gas is delivered by pipeline to CECONY at various points in or near its service territory and is distributed to customers by the company through an estimated 4,348 miles of mains and 369,791 service lines. The company owns a natural gas liquefaction facility and storage tank at its As toria property in Queens, New York. The plant can store 1,062 MDt of which a maximum of about 250 MDt can be withdrawn per day. The company has about 1,226 MDt of additional natural gas storage capacity at a field in upstate New York, owned and operated by Honeoye Storage Corporation, a corporation 28.8 percent owned by CECONY and 71.2 pe rcent owned by Con Edison Development. 

Gas Sales and Deliveries 

The company generally recovers the cost of the gas that it buys and then sells to its full-service customers. It does not make any margin or profit on the gas it sells. CECONY&#8217;s gas revenues are subject to a weather normalization clause and a revenue decoupling mechanism. As a result, its gas delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. CECONY&#8217;s gas sales and deliveries for the last five years were:

Gas Peak Demand 

The gas peak demand for firm sales customers in CECONY&#8217;s service area occurs during the winter heating season. The peak day dem and during the winter &#32; 2015 / 2016 &#32; (through February 1, &#32; 2016 ) occurred on January 4, 2016 when the demand reached 1,068 MDt. The &#32; 2015 / 2016 &#32; peak day demand included 551 MDt for CECONY&#8217;s full-service customers and 517 MDt for customers participating in its gas retail choice program. &#8220;Design weather&#8221; for the gas system is a standard to which the actual peak demand is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes. The company estimates that, under design weather conditions, the &#32; 2016 / 2017 &#32; service area peak day demand will be 1,456 MDt, including an estimated 757 MDt for its full-service customers and 699 MDt for its gas retail choice customers. &#32; The forecasted peak day demand at design conditions does not include gas used by interruptible gas customers including electric and steam generating stations. The company forecasts an average annual growth of the gas peak demand over the nex t five years at design conditions to be approximately 2.3 percent in its service area. 

Gas Supply 

CECONY and O&#38;R have combined their gas requirements, and contracts to meet those requirements, into a single portfolio. The combined portfolio is administered by, and related management services are provided by, CECONY (for itself and as agent for O&#38;R) and costs are allocated between the Utilities in accordance with provisions approved by the NYSPSC. See Note S to the financial statements in Item 8. 

Charges fr om suppliers for the firm purchase of gas, which are based on formulas or indexes or are subject to negotiation, are generally designed to approximate market prices. The Utilities have contracts with interstate 

pipeline companies for the purchase of firm transportation from upstream points where gas has been purchased to the Utilities&#8217; distribution systems, and for upstream storage services. Charges under these transportation and storage contracts are approved by the FERC. The Utilities are required to pay certain fixed charges under the supply, transportation and storage contracts whether or not the contracted capacity is actually used. These fixed charges amounted &#32; to approximately $291 million in 2015 , including $252 million for CECONY. See &#8220;Contractual Obligations&#8221; below. At December 31, 2015, the contracts were for various terms extending to 2020 for supply and 2027 for the transportation and storage. In January 2016, CECONY entered into two 20-year transportation contracts, one of which is for capacity on the proposed Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP) (see &#8220;Con Edison Transmission - CET Gas" below). In addition, the Utilities purchase gas on the spot market and contract for interruptible gas transportation. See &#8220;Recoverable Energy Costs&#8221; in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. 

Steam Operations 

Steam Facilities 

CECONY&#8217;s capitalized costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, for steam facilities, including steam's portion of the steam-electric generation facilities, were $1,849 million &#32;and $1,795 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

CECONY generates steam at one steam-electric generating station and five steam-only generating stations and distributes steam to its customers through approximately 105 miles of transmission, distribution and service piping.

Steam Peak Demand and Capacity 

Demand for steam in CECONY&#8217;s service area peaks during the winter heating season. The one-hour peak demand during the winter of &#32; 2015 / 2016 &#32; (through February 1, 2016) occurred on January 5, 2016 when the demand reached 8.0 MMlb per hour. &#8220;Design weather&#8221; for the steam system is a standard to which the actual peak demand is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes. The company&#8217;s estimate for the winter of &#32; 2016 / 2017 &#32; peak demand of its steam customers is about 8.9 MMlb per hour under design conditions. The company forecasts an average annual decrease in steam peak demand in its service area at design conditions over the next five years to be approximately 0.8 percent. 

On &#32; December 31, 2015 , the steam system was capable of delivering approximately 11.3 MMlb of steam per hour, and CECONY estimates that the system w ill have a capacity of 11.6 MMlb of steam per hour in the 2016 / 2017 &#32;winter. 

Steam Supply 

Forty percent of the steam produced by CECONY in 2015 &#32;was supplied by the company&#8217;s steam-only generating assets; 43 percent was produced by the company&#8217;s steam-electric generating assets, where steam and electricity are primarily cogenerated; and 17 percent was purchased under an agreement with Brooklyn Navy Yard Cogeneration Partners L.P. 

O&#38;R 

Electric Operations 

Electric Facilities 

O&#38;R&#8217;s capitalized costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, for distribution facilities were $850 million &#32;and $830 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. For its transmission facilities, the costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation, was $212 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 . 

O&#38;R, RECO and Pike, own, in whole or in part, transmission and distribution facilities which include 547 circuit miles of transmission lines, 14 transmission substations, 62 distribution substations, 86,794 in-service line transformers, 3,994 pole miles of overhead distribution lines and 1,889 miles of underground distribution lines. O&#38;R&#8217;s transmission system is part of the NYISO system except that portions of RECO&#8217;s system are located within the transmission area controlled by PJM. 

Electric Sales and Deliveries 

O&#38;R delivers electricity to its full-service customers who purchase electricity from the company. The company also delivers electricity to its customers who purchase electricity from other suppliers through the company&#8217;s retail choice program. 

The company charges all customers in its service area for the delivery of electricity. O&#38;R generally recovers, on a current basis, the cost of the electricity that it buys and then sells to its full-service customers. It does not make any margin or profit on the electricity it sells. O&#38;R&#8217;s New York electric revenues (which accounted for 74 percent of O&#38;R&#8217;s electric revenues in 2015) are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism. As a result, O&#38;R&#8217;s New York electric delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. O&#38;R&#8217;s electric sales in New Jersey and Pennsylvania are not subject to a decoupling mechanism. O&#38;R&#8217;s electric sales and deliveries for the last five years were:

Electric Peak Demand 

The electric peak demand in O&#38;R&#8217;s service area occurs during the summer &#32; air conditioning season. The weather during the summer of 2015 was cooler than design conditions. O&#38;R &#8217;s 2015 &#32;service area peak demand was &#32; 1,405 MW, which occurred on July 20, 2015. The &#32; 2015 &#32; peak demand included an estimated 779 MW for O&#38;R&#8217;s &#32; full-service c ustomers and 626 MW for customers participating in its electric retail choice program. &#8220;Design weather&#8221; for the electric system is a standard to which the actual peak demand is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes. Since the NYISO can invoke demand reduction programs under specific circumstances, design conditions do not include these programs&#8217; potential impact. However, the O&#38;R forecasted peak demand at design conditions does include the impact of certain demand reduction programs. The company estimates that, under design weather conditions, the &#32; 2016 &#32; service area peak demand will be 1,632 MW, including an estimated 902 MW for its full-service customers and 730 MW for its electric retail choice customers. The company forecasts an average annual growth in electric p eak demand in the company&#8217;s service area over the next five years at design conditions to be approximately 0.3 percent per year. 

Electric Supply 

The electricity O&#38;R sold to its full-service customers in 2015 &#32;was purchased under firm power contracts or through the wholesale electricity market. The company expects that these resources will again be adequate to meet the requirements of its customers in 2016 . O&#38;R does not own any electric generating capacity. The company plans to meet its continuing obligation to supply electricity to its customers through a combination of electricity purchased under contracts or purchased through the wholesale electricity market. To reduce the volatility of its customers&#8217; electric energy costs, the company has contracts to purchase electric energy and enters into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of a portion of its expected purchases. For information about the company&#8217;s contracts, see Note O to the financial statements in Item 8. 

In general, the Utilities recover their purchased power costs, including the cost of hedging purchase prices, pursuant to rate provisions approved by the state public utility regulatory authority having jurisdiction. See &#8220;Financial and Commodity Market Risks &#8211; Commodity Price Risk,&#8221; in Item 7 and &#8220;Recoverable Energy Costs&#8221; in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. From time to time, certain parties have petitioned the NYSPSC to review these provisions, the elimination of which could have a material adverse effect on the Companies&#8217; financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 

Gas Operations 

Gas Facilities 

O&#38;R&#8217;s capitalized costs for utility plant, net of accumulated depreciation for gas facilities, which are primarily distribution facilities, were $502 million &#32;and $476 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. O&#38;R and Pike own their gas distribution systems and O&#38;R owns a gas transmission system. Natural gas is delivered by pipeline to O&#38;R at various points in or near its service territory and is distributed to customers by the company through an estimated 1,876 miles of mains and 105,482 service lines. 

Gas Sales and Deliveries 

O&#38;R generally recovers the cost of the gas that it buys and then sells to its full-service customers. It does not make any margin or profit on the gas it sells. O&#38;R&#8217;s gas revenues are subject to a weather normalization clause. O&#38;R&#8217;s New York gas revenues (which accounted for substantially all of O&#38;R&#8217;s gas revenues in 2015 ) are subject to a revenue decoupling mechanism. As a result, its gas delivery revenues are generally not affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved. O&#38;R&#8217;s gas sales and deliveries for the last five years were:

Gas Peak Demand 

The gas peak demand for firm sales customers in O&#38;R&#8217;s service area occurs during the winter heating season. The peak day demand during the winter 2015 / 2016 &#32;(through February 1, 2016) occurred on January 4, 2016 when the demand reached 163 MDt. The 2015 / 2016 &#32;peak day demand included 72 MDt for O&#38;R&#8217;s full-service customers and 91 MDt for customers participating in its gas retail choice program. &#8220;Design weather&#8221; for the gas system is a standard to which the actual peak demand is adjusted for evaluation and planning purposes. The company estimates that, under design weather conditions, the 2016 / 2017 &#32;service area peak day demand will be 224 MDt, including an estimated 99 MDt for its full-service customers and 125 MDt for its gas retail choice customers. The f orecasted peak day demand at design conditions does not include gas used by interruptible gas customers including electric generating stations. The company forecasts an average annual growth of the gas peak demand over the next five years at design conditions to be approximatel y 0.6 percent in its service area. 

Gas Supply 

O&#38;R and CECONY have combined their gas requirements and purchase contracts to meet those requirements into a single portfolio. See &#8220;CECONY &#8211; Gas Operations &#8211; Gas Supply&#8221; above. 

Competitive Energy Businesses 

Con Edison Solutions 

Con Edison Solutions primarily sells electricity to industrial, commercial and governmental customers in the northeastern United States and Texas. It also sells electricity to residential and small commercial customers (mass market) in the northeastern United States. Con Edison Solutions does not sell electricity to the Utilities. Con Edison Solutions does sell electricity to customers who are provided delivery service by the Utilities. It also provides energy efficiency services, procurement and management services to companies and governmental entities throughout most of the United States. 

Con Edison Solutions was reported by DNV GL in September 2015 to be the 12th largest non-residential retail electricity provider in the United States. At December 31, 2015 , it served approximately 143,000 mass market customers, excluding approximately 143,000 served under aggregation agreements. Con Edison Solutions&#8217; electricity sales for the last five years were:

Con Edison Solutions also provides energy-efficiency services to government and commercial customers. The services include the design and installation of lighting retrofits, high-efficiency heating, ventilating and air 

conditioning equipment and other energy saving technologies. The company is compensated for its services based primarily on the increased energy efficiency of the installed equipment over a multi-year period. Con Edison Solutions has won competitive solicitations for energy savings contracts with the United States Department of Energy and the United States Department of Defense, and a shared energy savings contract with the United States Postal Service. The company owns renewable energy projects predominately in Massachusetts and California with an ag gregate capacity of 23 MW (AC). 

In June 2015, Con Edison initiated a plan to sell the retail electric supply business &#32;(see Note U to the financial statements in Item 8). 

Con Edison Energy 

Con Edison Energy provides services to manage the dispatch, fuel requirements and risk management activities for 4,465 MW of generating plants and merchant transmission in the northeastern United States owned by unrelated parties and manages energy supply assets leased from others. Among other things, the company also provides wholesale hedging and risk management services to Con Edison Solutions and Con Edison Development. The company, beginning during 2013, no longer engages in the sale of electricity to utilities. The company had sold electricity that it had purchased in wholesale markets to utilities in the northeastern United States, primarily under fixed and indexed price contracts, which they used to supply their full-service customers. 

Con Edison Development 

Con Edison Development develops, owns and operates energy infrastruc ture. The company focuses its efforts on renewable electric production projects, and at the end of &#32; 2015 &#32; was estimated to be the &#32; sixth &#32; largest owner of operating solar capacity in North America. The output of most of the projects is sold und er long-term power purchase agreements (PPA). The following table provides information about the projects the company owned at December 31, 2015 :

Purchased in January and February 2015. The total project cost is expected to be approximately $300 million. Electricity generated by these projects is to be purchased by Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Edison pursuant to long-term power purchase agreements. 

(f) 

In addition, in September 2015, Con Edison Development purchased a 50 percent membership interest in Panoche Holdings, LLC, which owns a project company that is developing, but has not started constructing, a 247 MW (AC) solar electric production project in California. See Note Q to the financial statements in Item 8. See &#8220;Capital Requirements,&#8221; below. Also, in October 2015, Con Edison Development purchased Lost Hills, which is developing but has not started constructing, a 20 MW (AC) solar electric production project in California and in November 2015 purchased Upton County, which is developing but has not started constructing, a 150 MW (AC) solar electric production project in Texas. 

In January 2016, Con Edison Development purchased a company that is the owner of a106 MW (AC) solar electric production project in Texas (Texas Solar 7). The total cost of this project is expected to be approximately $375 million. The project will be financed, in part, by debt secured by the project. Electricity generated by this project is to be purchased by the City of San Antonio pursuant to a long-term power purchase agreement. 

Con Edison Transmission 

CET Electric 

In January 2016, Con Edison transferred a wholly-owned subsidiary, Consolidated Edison Transmission LLC (CET Electric), to another wholly-owned subsidiary, Con Edison Transmission, Inc. (Con Edison Transmission). In November 2014, CET Electric, along with affiliates of certain other New York transmission owners, formed New York Transco LLC (NY Transco). CET Electric owns a 45.7 percent interest in NY Transco. NY Transco&#8217;s transmission projects are expected to be developed initially by CECONY and other New York transmission owners and, subject to NYSPSC approval, sold to NY Transco. 

Initially, NY Transco projects are expected to include three projects (called the TOTS Projects) that the NYSPSC approved in October 2013 in its proceeding to address potential needs that could arise should the Indian Point Energy Center (which is owned by Entergy Corporation subsidiaries) no longer be able to operate. The TOTS Projects, which are scheduled to be placed into service by Summer 2016, include two projects that CECONY is developing and one project that another regulated affiliate of NY Transco is developing. The current aggregated estimated cost of the TOTS projects is approximately $230 million (most of which is for the projects CECONY is developing). 

In April 2015, FERC issued an order granting certain transmission incentives for NY Transco projects. In November 2015, NY Transco, certain New York transmission owners (including CECONY and O&#38;R), the NYSPSC and other parties submitted to FERC for approval a settlement agreement applicable to the TOTS Projects (other than costs that have not already been incurred related to a portion of one of the projects that may no longer be needed). The settlement agreement, among other things, provides for a 10 percent return on common equity (or 9.5 percent for capital costs in excess of $228 million incurred prior to the projects&#8217; commercial operation date), a maximum common equity ratio of 53 percent and allocation of 63 percent of the costs of the projects to load serving entities in the CECONY and O&#38;R service areas. 

In December 2015, the NYSPSC issued an order in its competitive proceeding to select transmission projects that would relieve transmission congestion between upstate and downstate. The NYSPSC determined that there is a public policy need for new transmission to address the congestion, such as a project ($1,000 million estimated cost) proposed on behalf of NY Transco. This NY Transco project, which could be completed in the 2019 to 2021 timeframe, would be developed, at least initially, by New York transmission owners other than CECONY until the project was sold to NY Transco. The NYSPSC also directed certain developers, including NY Transco, to submit project(s) to the NYISO. Under its public policy planning process, the NYISO will solicit and evaluate proposed project(s) that meet the public policy need and make a selection in accordance with its FERC-approved criteria. The cost of the project(s) selected by the NYISO would be recoverable through the NYISO&#8217;s tariff. 

CET Gas 

In January 2016, Con Edison Transmission formed Con Edison Gas Midstream, LLC (CET Gas) and CET Gas acquired a 12.5 percent ownership interest in MVP, a company developing a proposed gas transmission project in West Virginia and Virginia. MVP has indicated that the estimated total project cost is $3,000 million to $3,500 million, and that, subject to FERC approval, MVP is targeting to be fully in-service during the fourth quarter of 2018.

(b) 

Estimates do not include amounts for the energy efficiency, demand reduction and combined heat and power programs discussed under &#8220;CECONY &#8211; Electric Operations &#8211; Electric Supply,&#8221; above. 

The Utilities have an ongoing need to make substantial capital investments primarily to maintain the reliability of their electric, gas and steam delivery systems. Their estimated construction expenditures also reflect programs that will give customers greater control over their energy usage and bills, help integrate new clean energy technologies into the Utilities&#8217; electric delivery systems and accelerate their gas main replacement program. 

Estimated capital expenditures for Con Edison Transmission reflect planned investments in electric and gas transmission projects. Estimated capital expenditures for the competitive energy businesses reflect planned investments in renewable generation and energy infrastructure projects. Actual capital expenditures for Con Edison Transmission and the competitive energy businesses could significantly increase or decrease from the amounts estimated depending on market conditions and opportunities.

Includes interest on variable rate debt calculated at rates in effect at December 31, 2015 . 

(b) 

Included in these amounts is the cost of minimum quantities of energy that the company is obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. 

(c) 

Included in these amounts is the cost of minimum quantities of natural gas supply, transportation and storage that the Utilities are obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. 

(d) 

Amounts shown for other purchase obligations, which reflect capital and operations and maintenance costs incurred by the Utilities in running their day-to-day operations, were derived from the Utilities&#8217; purchasing system as the difference between the amounts authorized and the amounts paid (or vouchered to be paid) for each obligation. For many of these obligations, the Utilities are committed to purchase less than the amount authorized. Payments for the &#8220;Other Purchase Obligations&#8221; are generally assumed to be made ratably over the term of the obligations. The Utilities believe that unreasonable effort and expense would be involved to enable them to report their &#8220;Other Purchase Obligations&#8221; in a different manner. 

(e) 

Amounts represent commitments to purchase minimum quantities of electric energy and capacity, renewable energy certificates, natural gas, natural gas pipeline capacity, energy efficiency services and construction services entered into by Con Edison&#8217;s competitive energy businesses. 

(f) 

Con Edison reasonably expects to resolve approximately $25 million of its liability for uncertain tax positions within the next twelve months, of which an estimated $12 million may be settled in cash payments. Con Edison is unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the 

resolution of its remaining liability for uncertain tax positions, which will depend on the progress of tax examinations with the various tax authorities. See Note L to the financial statements in Item 8. 

The Companies&#8217; commitments to make payments in addition to these contractual commitments include their other liabilities reflected in their balance sheets, any funding obligations for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans, financial hedging activities, their collective bargaining agreements and Con Edison&#8217;s guarantees of certain obligations of its competitive energy businesses and CET - Electric. See Notes E, F, O and &#8220;Guarantees&#8221; in Note H to the financial statements in Item 8. 

Capital Resources 

Con Edison is a holding company that operates only through its subsidiaries and has no material assets other than its interests in its subsidiaries. Con Edison finances its capital requirements primarily through internally-generated funds and the sale of its securities. Con Edison&#8217;s ability to make payments on external borrowings and dividends on its common shares depends on receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries or proceeds from the sale of its securities or its interests in its subsidiaries. 

For information about restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Utilities and significant debt covenants, see Note C to the financial statements in Item 8. 

For information on the Companies&#8217; commercial paper program and revolving credit agreements with banks, see Note D to the financial statements in Item 8. 

The Utilities finance their operations, capital requirements and payment of dividends to Con Edison from internally-generated funds, contributions of equity capital from Con Edison, if any, and external borrowings. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Item 7. 

Con Edison plans to meet its 2016 capital requirements, including for maturing securities, through internally-generated funds and the issuance of securities. The company&#8217;s plans include the issuance of between $1,000 million and $1,500 million of long-term debt at the Utilities and the issuance of additional debt secured by its renewable electric &#32;production projects. The company&#8217;s plans also include the issuance of up to $200 million of common equity in addition to equity under its dividend reinvestment, employee stock purchase and long term incentive plans. 

The Companies require access to the capital markets to fund capital requirements that are substantially in excess of available internally-generated funds. See &#8220;Capital Requirements,&#8221; above. Each of the Companies believes that it will continue to be able to access capital, although capital market conditions may affect the timing and cost of the Companies&#8217; financing activities. The Companies monitor the availability and costs of various forms of capital, and will seek to issue Con Edison common stock and other securities when it is necessary or advantageous to do so. For information about the Companies&#8217; long-term debt and short-term borrowing, see Notes C and D to the financial statements in Item 8. 

In 2012, the NYSPSC authorized CECONY, through 2016, to issue up to $3,500 million of debt securities ($3,200 million of which the company had issued as of December 31, 2015 ). In 2013, the NYSPSC authorized O&#38;R, through 2017, to issue up to $305 million of debt securities ($220 of which the company had issued as of December 31, 2015 ). The NYSPSC also authorized CECONY and O&#38;R for such periods to issue up to $2,500 million and $125 million, respectively, of debt securities to refund existing debt securities. At December 31, 2015 , the Utilities had not refunded any securities pursuant to this authorization. In January 2016, CECONY filed a petition with the NYSPSC for authorization to issue up to $5,200 million of debt securities prior to December 31, 2019. 

Con Edison&#8217;s competitive energy businesses have financed their operations and capital requirements primarily with capital contributions and borrowings from Con Edison, internally-generated funds and external borrowings. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Item 7.

The commercial paper of Con Edison and O&#38;R is rated P-2, A-2 and F2, respectively, by Moody&#8217;s, S&#38;P and Fitch. The commercial paper of CECONY is rated P-1, A-2 and F2 by Moody&#8217;s, S&#38;P and Fitch, respectively. Con Edison&#8217;s issuer credit rating is A3, A- and BBB+ by Moody&#8217;s, S&#38;P and Fitch, respectively. The senior unsecured debt of CECONY is rated A2, A- and A- by Moody&#8217;s, S&#38;P and Fitch, respectively. The senior unsecured debt of O&#38;R is rated A3, A- and A- by Moody&#8217;s, S&#38;P and Fitch, respectively. Securities ratings assigned by rating organizations are expressions of opinion and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities. A securities rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 

CECONY has $636 million of tax-exempt debt for which the interest rates are to be determined pursuant to periodic auctions. Of this amount, $391 million is insured by Ambac Assurance Corporation and $245 million is insured by Syncora Guarantee Inc. (formerly XL Capital Assurance Inc.). Credit rating agencies have withdrawn the ratings of these insurers. Subsequently, there have not been sufficient bids to determine the interest rates pursuant to auctions, and interest rates have been determined by reference to a variable rate index. The weighted average annual interest rate o n this tax-exempt debt was 0.14 percent on &#32; December 31, 2015 . The weighted average interest rate was 0.14 &#32;percent, 0.10 percent and 0.17 percent for the years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. Under CECONY&#8217;s current electric, gas and steam rate plans, variations in auction rate debt interest expense are reconciled to the levels set in rates. 

Environmental Matters 

Climate Change 

As indicated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), including carbon dioxide, are very likely changing the world&#8217;s climate. 

Climate change could affect customer demand for the Companies&#8217; energy services. It might also cause physical damage to the Companies&#8217; facilities and disruption of their operations due to more frequent and more extreme weather-related events. In late October 2012, Superstorm Sandy caused extensive damage to the Utilities&#8217; electric distribution system. Superstorm Sandy interrupted service to approximately 1.4 million of the Utilities&#8217; customers &#8211; more than four times the number of customers impacted by the Utilities&#8217; previous worst storm event (Hurricane Irene in 2011) and resulted in the Utilities incurring substantial response and restoration costs. 

Based on the most recent data (2014) published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Con Edison estimates that its direct GHG emissions constitute less than 0.1 percent of the nation&#8217;s GHG emissions. Con Edison&#8217;s estimated emissions of GHG during the past five years were:

3.4 

3.3

3.2 

3.1 

(a) 

Estimated emissions for 2015 &#32;are subject to third-party verification. 

Con Edison&#8217;s &#32; 48 percent decrease in direct GHG emissions (carbon dioxide, methane and sulfur hexafluoride) since 2005 (6.0 mill ion metric tons) reflects the emission reductions resulting from equipment and repair projects, reduced steam demand, the increased use of natural gas in lieu of fuel oil at CECONY&#8217;s steam production facilities as well as projects to reduce sulfur hexafluoride emissions and to replace gas distribution pipes. 

CECONY has participated for several years in voluntary initiatives with the EPA to reduce its methane and sulfur hexafluoride emissions. The Utilities reduce methane emissions from the operation of their gas distribution systems through pipe maintenance and replacement programs, by operating system components at lower pressure, and by introducing new technologies for leak repair prioritization and to reduce work-related losses. The Utilities reduce emissions of sulfur hexafluoride, which is used for arc suppression in substation circuit breakers and switches, by using improved technologies to locate and repair leaks and by replacing older equipment. The Utilities also actively promote energy efficiency and the use of renewable generation to help their customers&#8217; reduce their GHG emissions. 

NYSERDA and New York utilities have been responsible for implementing the Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard (EEPS) established by the NYSPSC through energy efficiency programs designed and managed by NYSERDA and the utilities and authorized by the NYSPSC. The Utilities billed customers EEPS surcharges of approximately $103 million in 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;to fund these programs. EEPS authorization ended December 2015. Beginning January 2016, New York utilities are responsible for designing and managing their energy efficiency programs consistent with NYSPSC-approved, utility-specific program budgets and metrics. Effective January 2016, the utilities are recovering the costs of their energy efficiency programs from their customers primarily through NYSPSC-approved energy efficiency tracker surcharge mechanisms. 

Through the Utilities&#8217; energy-efficiency programs, customers reduced their annual energy use by approximately 1,005,000 MWh of electricity and 1,395,000 Dt of gas from the programs&#8217; inception in 2009 through 2015 , resulting in their avoiding their release of approximately 650,000 tons of GHG into the atmosphere every year. In addition, CECONY&#8217;s other demand-side management programs assisted customers in reducing their annual energy use by approximately 281,000 MWh of electricity from the programs&#8217; inception in 2004 through 2015 , resulting in their avoiding their release of approximately 158,000 tons of GHG into the atmosphere every year. 

Emissions are also avoided by renewable electric production facilities replacing fossil-fueled electric production facilities. NYSERDA is responsible for implementing the renewable portfolio standard (RPS) established by the NYSPSC. NYSERDA enters into long-term agreements with developers of large renewable electric production facilities and pays them premiums based on the facilities&#8217; electric output. These facilities sell their energy output in the wholesale energy market administered by the NYISO. As a result of the Utilities&#8217; participation in the NYISO wholesale markets, a portion of the Utilities&#8217; NYISO energy purchases are sourced from renewable electric production facilities. NYSERDA also provides rebates to customers who install eligible renewable electric production technologies. The electricity produced by such customer-sited renewables offsets the energy that the Utilities would otherwise have procured, thereby reducing the amount of electricity produced by non-renewable production facilities. The Utilities billed customers RPS surcharges of $131 million and $121 million in 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively, (and approximately $678 million cumulatively from 2006) to fund these NYSERDA programs. In March 2015, NYSERDA reported that the statewide environmental benefits of having electricity generated by renewable production facilities from 2006 through 2014, as opposed to the State&#8217;s &#8220;system-mix,&#8221; amounts to approximately 6,700 tons of nitrogen oxides, 12,200 tons of sulfur dioxides and 6.4 million tons of carbon dioxide in reduced emissions over this time period. For information about NYSPSC proceedings considering renewable generation see &#8220;Utility Regulation &#8211; State Utility Regulation &#8211; New York Utility Industry &#8211; Reforming the Energy Vision," above. 

In June 2015, the New York State Energy Planning Board released its 2015 State Energy Plan. Under New York State law, any energy-related action or decision of State agencies must be reasonably consistent with the plan. The plan reflects clean energy initiatives, including the REV proceeding, NYSERDA&#8217;s clean energy fund and the following goals for New York State to meet by 2030: a 40 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels; 50 percent of electric generation from renewable energy sources; and a 23 percent decrease in energy consumption in buildings from 2012 levels. Also, New York State and New York City have announced goals to reduce GHG emissions 80 percent below 1990 and 2005, respectively, levels by 2050. 

In January 2016, the NYSPSC approved a 10-year $5.3 billion clean energy fund to be managed by NYSERDA under the direction of the NYSPSC. The clean energy fund has four porfolios: market development; innovation and research; NY Green Bank and NY Sun. The Utilities will eliminate the separate RPS tariff and collect all clean energy fund surcharges through the system benefit charge (including previously authorized RPS, EEPS, Technology and Market Development collections, and incremental clean energy fund collections to be collected from electric customers only). 

In August 2015, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued its Clean Power Plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. Under the Clean Power Plan, each state is required to submit for EPA approval a plan to reduce its emissions to specified rate-based or equivalent mass-based target levels (as determined in accordance with the Clean Power Plan) applicable to the state. For New York State, the emissions rate-based target level for 2030 is approximately 20 percent below its 2012 emissions rate. State plans may, among other things, include participation in regional cap-and-trade programs, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), and renewable energy and energy efficiency programs. State plans are to be submitted to the EPA in 2016, with possible extensions to 2018, and are to be in effect not later than 2022. The costs resulting from the Clean Power Plan could be substantial. In February 2016, the Supreme Court of the United States stayed the implementation of the Clean Power Plan until the resolution of litigation challenging the plan. 

CECONY is subject to carbon dioxide emissions regulations established by New York State under RGGI. The initiative, a cooperative effort by Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, established a decreasing cap on carbon 

dioxide emissions resulting from the generation of electricity. Under RGGI, affected electric generators are required to obtain emission allowances to cover their carbon dioxide emissions, available primarily through auctions administered by participating states or a secondary market. CECONY met its requirement of 6.3 million allowances for the most recent RGGI compliance period (2012-2014) and has p urchased sufficient allowances to meet its requirement for the current compliance period (2015-2017). 

The cost to comply with legislation, regulations or initiatives limiting the Companies&#8217; GHG emissions could be substantial. 

Environmental Sustainability 

Con Edison&#8217;s sustainability strategy, as it relates to the environment, provides that the company seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by making effective use of natural resources to address the challenges of climate change and its impact on the company&#8217;s business. As part of its strategy, the company seeks, among other things, to reduce direct and indirect emissions; enhance the efficiency of its water use; minimize its impact to natural ecosystems; focus on reducing, reusing and recycling to minimize consumption; and design its work in consideration of climate forecasts. 

CECONY 

Superfund 

The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 and similar state statutes (Superfund) impose joint and several liability, regardless of fault, upon generators of hazardous substances for investigation costs, remediation costs and environmental damages. The sites as to which CECONY has been asserted to have liability under Superfund include its and its predecessor companies&#8217; former manufactured gas sites, its multi-purpose Astoria site, the Gowanus Canal site, and other Superfund sites discussed below. There may be additional sites as to which assertions will be made that the Company has liability. For a further discussion of claims and possible claims against the Company under Superfund, estimated liability accrued for Superfund claims and recovery from customers of site investigation and remediation costs, see Note G to the financial statements in Item 8. 

Manufactured Gas Sites 

CECONY and its predecessors formerly owned and operated manufactured gas plants at 51 sites (MGP Sites) in New York City and Westchester County. Many of these sites have been subdivided and are now owned by parties other than CECONY and have been redeveloped for other uses, including schools, residential and commercial developments and hospitals. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) is requiring CECONY to investigate, and if necessary, develop and implement remediation programs for the sites, including any neighboring areas to which contamination may have migrated. 

CECONY has started remedial investigations at all 51 MGP Sites. After investigations, no MGP impacts have been detected at all or portions of 15 sites, and the NYSDEC has issued No Further Action (NFA) letters for these sites. 

Coal tar or other MGP-related contaminants have been detected at the remaining 36 sites. Remedial actions have been completed at all or portions of six sites and the NYSDEC has issued NFA letters for these sites. In addition, remedial actions have been completed by property owners at all or portions of three sites under the NYS Brownfield Cleanup Program and Certificates of Completion have been issued by the NYSDEC for these sites. Remedial design is ongoing for the remaining sites, however, the information as to the extent of contamination and scope of the remediation likely to be required for many of these sites is incomplete. The company estimates that its undiscounted potential liability for the completion of the site investigation and cleanup of the known contamination on MGP sites (other than the Astoria site which is discussed below) could range from $484 million to $2,280 million. 

Astoria Site 

CECONY is permitted by the NYSDEC to operate a hazardous waste storage facility on property owned by it in the Astoria section of Queens, New York. Portions of the property were formerly the location of a manufactured gas plant and also have been used or are being used for, among other things, electric generation operations, electric substation operations, the storage of fuel oil and liquefied natural gas, and the maintenance and storage of electric equipment. As a condition of its NYSDEC permit, the company is required to investigate the property and, where environmental contamination is found and action is necessary, to remediate the contamination. The company&#8217;s investigations are ongoing. The company has submitted to the NYSDEC and the New York State Department of Health reports and in the future will be submitting additional reports identifying the known areas of contamination. The company estimates that its undiscounted potential liability for the completion of the site investigation and cleanup of the known contamination on the property could range &#32; from $158 million to $461 million. 

Gowanus Canal 

In August 2009, CECONY received a notice of potential liability and request for information from the EPA about the operations of the company and its predecessors at sites adjacent or near the 1.8 mile Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn, New York. In March 2010, the EPA added the Gowanus Canal to its National Priorities List of Superfund sites. The canal&#8217;s adjacent waterfront is primarily commercial and industrial, currently consisting of concrete plants, warehouses, and parking lots. The canal is near several residential neighborhoods. In September 2013, the EPA issued its record of decision for the site. The EPA concluded that there was significant contamination at the site, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides, metals and volatile organic compounds. The EPA selected a remedy for the site that includes dredging and disposal of some contaminated sediments and stabilization and capping of contamination that will not be removed. The EPA estimated the cost of the selected remedy to be $506.1 million (and indicated the actual cost could be significantly higher or lower). The EPA has identified 39 potentially responsible parties (PRPs) with respect to the site, including CECONY (which the EPA indicated has facilities that may be a source of PCBs at the site). The EPA has ordered the PRPs, including CECONY, to coordinate and cooperate with each other to perform and/or fund the remedial design for the selected remedy, which EPA estimates will cost $35 million. CECONY is participating with other PRPs in an allocation process to determine each PRP&#8217;s share of the liability for these remedial design costs. In June 2015, other Federal agencies and the NYSDEC notified the PRPs of their intent to perform a natural resource damage assessment for the site. CECONY is unable to estimate its exposure to liability for the Gowanus Canal site. 

Other Superfund Sites 

In September 2007, the NYSDEC demanded that the company investigate and remediate PCB contamination that may have migrated from a former CECONY service center facility in Flushing New York, into the adjacent Flushing River. In April 2008, the company and NYSDEC entered into a consent order under which the company agreed to implement a NYSDEC-approved investigation program for the Flushing River and, if deemed necessary by the NYSDEC to protect human health and the environment, to implement a NYSDEC-approved remediation program for any PCB contamination in the river attributable to the site. In March 2011, the company submitted to NYSDEC a report indicating that PCBs had migrated from the site to sediment in a portion of the river. In August 2013, the NYSDEC selected a remedy that requires the company to submit a remedial design report, remove contaminated sediment, restore the river bed with clean material, prepare a site management plan and implement institutional controls. The company estimates that its undiscounted potential liability for the completion of the cleanup in Flushing River could range from $5 million to $6 million. 

In October 2015, CECONY received a notice of violation from the NYSDEC relating to a September 2015 discharge of dielectric fluid from an electric transmission line into the Bronx River. This administrative proceeding may result in monetary sanctions of more than $0.1 million for violations of certain New York State provisions regulating the discharge of materials into, and for the protection of, the environment. Remediation has been substantially completed at a cost of $1.4 million. CECONY is continuing to monitor the site. 

CECONY is a PRP at additional Superfund sites involving other PRPs and participates in PRP groups at those sites. The company generally is not managing the site investigation and remediation at these multiparty sites. Work at these sites is in various stages, and investigation, remediation and monitoring activities at some of these sites can be expected to continue over extended periods of time. The company believes that it is unlikely that monetary sanctions, such as penalties, will be imposed by any governmental authority with respect to these sites. 

The following table lists each of the additional Superfund sites for which the company anticipates it may have liability. The table also shows for each such site its location, the year in which the company was designated or alleged to be a PRP or to otherwise have responsibilities for the site (shown in the table under &#8220;Start&#8221;), the name of the court or agency in which proceedings for the site are pending and CECONY&#8217;s estimated percentage of the total liability for each site. The company &#32; currently estimates that its potential liability for investigation, remediation, monitoring and environmental damages at each site is $0.2 million or less, with the exception of the Cortese Landfill site for which the estimate is $0.9 million. Sup erfund liability is joint and several. The company&#8217;s estimate of its liability for each site was determined pursuant to consent decrees, settlement agreements or otherwise and in light of the financial condition of other PRPs. The company&#8217;s actual liability could differ substantially from amounts estimated.

The sites at which O&#38;R has been asserted to have liability under Superfund include its manufactured gas sites and the Superfund sites discussed below. There may be additional sites as to which assertions will be made that O&#38;R has liability. For a further discussion of claims and possible claims against O&#38;R under Superfund, see Note G to the financial statements in Item 8. 

Manufactured Gas Sites 

O&#38;R and its predecessors formerly owned and operated manufactured gas plants at seven sites (O&#38;R MGP Sites) in Orange County and Rockland County, New York. Three of these sites are now owned by parties other than O&#38;R, and have been redeveloped by them for residential, commercial or industrial uses. The NYSDEC is requiring O&#38;R to develop and implement remediation programs for the O&#38;R MGP Sites including any neighboring areas to which contamination may have migrated. 

O&#38;R has completed remedial investigations at all seven of its MGP sites and has received NYSDEC&#8217;s decision regarding the remedial work to be performed at six of the sites. Of the six sites, O&#38;R has completed remediation at three sites. Remedial design is ongoing for the remaining three sites. The company estimates that its undiscounted potential liability for the completion of the site investigation and cleanup of the known contamination on MGP sites could range from $100 million to $151 million. 

Superfund Sites 

O&#38;R is a PRP at Superfund sites involving other PRPs, and participates in PRP groups at those sites. The company is not managing the site investigation and remediation at these multiparty Superfund sites. Work at these sites is in various stages, and investigation, remediation and monitoring activities at some of these sites is expected to continue over extended periods of time. The company believes that it is unlikely that monetary sanctions, such as penalties, will be imposed by any governmental authority with respect to these sites.

Other Federal, State and Local Environmental Provisions 

Toxic Substances Control Act 

Virtually all electric utilities, including CECONY, own equipment containing PCBs. PCBs are regulated under the Federal Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976. The Utilities have procedures in place to manage and dispose of oil and equipment containing PCBs properly when they are removed from service. 

Water Quality 

Under NYSDEC regulations, the operation of CECONY&#8217;s generating facilities requires permits for water discharges and water withdrawals. Conditions to the renewal of such permits may include limitations on the operations of the permitted facility or requirements to install certain equipment, the cost of which could be substantial. For information about the company&#8217;s generating facilities, see &#8220;CECONY &#8211; Electric Operations &#8211; Electric Facilities&#8221; and &#8220;Steam Operations &#8211; Steam Facilities&#8221; above in this Item 1. 

Certain governmental authorities are investigating contamination in the Hudson River and the New York Harbor. These waters run through portions of CECONY&#8217;s service area. Governmental authorities could require entities that released hazardous substances that contaminated these waters to bear the cost of investigation and remediation, which could be substantial. 

Air Quality 

Under new source review regulations, an owner of a large generating facility, including CECONY&#8217;s steam and steam-electric generating facilities, is required to obtain a permit before making modifications to the facility, other than routine maintenance, repair, or replacement, that increase emissions of pollutants from the facility above specified thresholds. To obtain a permit, the facility owner could be required to install additional pollution controls or otherwise limit emissions from the facility. The company reviews on an on-going basis its planned modifications to its generating facilities to determine the potential applicability of new source review and similar regulations. 

The EPA's Transport Rule (also referred to as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule), which was implemented in January 2015, established a new cap and trade program requiring further reductions in air emissions than the Clean Air Intrastate Rule (CAIR) that it replaced. Under the Transport Rule, utilities are to be allocated emissions allowances and may sell the allowances or buy additional allowances. CECONY requested and received NYSPSC approval to change the provisions under which the company recovers its purchased power costs to provide for costs incurred to purchase emissions allowances and revenues received from the sale of allowances. CECONY complied with the Transport Rule in 2015 &#32;and expects to comply with the rule in 2016 . If changes to the Transport Rule that have been proposed are adopted, the number of allowances allocated to CECONY would decrease and the company would be required to purchase allowances to offset the decreased allocation. 

State Anti-Takeover Law 

New York State law provides that a &#8220;domestic corporation,&#8221; such as Con Edison, may not consummate a merger, consolidation or similar transaction with the beneficial owner of a 20 percent or greater voting stock interest in the corporation, or with an affiliate of the owner, for five years after the acquisition of the voting stock interest, unless the transaction or the acquisition of the voting stock interest was approved by the corporation&#8217;s board of directors prior to the acquisition of the voting stock interest. After the expiration of the five-year period, the transaction may be consummated only pursuant to a stringent &#8220;fair price&#8221; formula or with the approval of a majority of the disinterested stockholders. 

Employees 

Con Edison has no employees other than those of CECONY, O&#38;R and Con Edison&#8217;s competitive energy businesses (which at December 31, 2015 &#32;had 13,393 , 1,131 &#32;and 282 &#32;employees, respectively). Of the CECONY and O&#38;R employees, 8,202 &#32;and 615 &#32;employees, respectively, were represented by a collective bargaining unit. The collective bargaining agreement covering most of these CECONY employees expires in June 2016. Agreements covering other CECONY employees and O&#38;R employees expire in June 2017 and May 2017, respectively.
