critical components for fuel systems, engines and transmissions, power steering systems and electromechanical motors. This expertise has been gained through investment in technical capabilities, processes and systems, and skilled program management and product launch capabilities. 

Research and Development 

As a part of our strategic plan, we are in the process of enhancing our research and development efforts. We will initially focus on adjacent markets, manufacturing process enhancements and continuing to improve our product quality. In addition, we intend to develop patented products that can be presented to and sold by our customers. Patent applications for two medical devices were filed in 2015, a surgical knife and impactor adapter and screw assembly. In general, these research and development efforts will entail using dedicated internal experts and resources. The amounts spent on research and development activities by us during each of the last three fiscal years are not material and are expensed as incurred. 

Customers 

Our products are supplied primarily to manufacturers for use in a broad range of industrial applications, including automotive, electrical, agricultural, construction, machinery, heavy truck, rail, medical, aerospace and defense, HVAC, fluid power and diesel engines. Our top ten customers account for approximately 53% of our revenue. Sales to each of these top ten customers are made to multiple customer locations and divisions throughout the world. Only one of these customers, AB SKF (&#147;SKF&#148;), had sales levels that were over 10% of total net sales. Sales to various U.S. and foreign divisions of SKF accounted for approximately 16% of net sales in 2015. In 2015, 56% of our products were sold to customers in North America, 26% to customers in Europe, 13% to customers in Asia and the remaining 5% to customers in South America. 

We sell our products to most of our largest customers under either sales contracts or agreed upon commercial terms. In general, we pass through material cost fluctuations when incurred to our customers in the form of changes in selling prices. We ordinarily ship our products directly to customers within 60 days, and in many cases, during the same calendar month of the date on which a sales order is placed. Accordingly, we generally have an insignificant amount of open (backlog) orders from customers at month end.

See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#151; Results of Operations&#148; for additional segment financial information.

Of our total employment, 17% are management/staff employees and 83% are production employees. The employees at the Pinerolo, Veenendaal and Autocam France plants are unionized. We believe we have a good working relationship with our employees and the unions that represent them. 

Competition 

Precision Bearing Components Group 

Our Precision Bearing Components Group operates in intensely competitive markets. Our primary domestic competitor is Hoover Precision Products, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Tsubaki Nakashima Co., LTD. Our primary foreign competitors are Amatsuji Steel Ball Manufacturing Company, Ltd. (Japan), a wholly owned division of NSK LTD., Tsubaki Nakashima Co., LTD (Japan) and Jiangsu General Ball and Roller Co., LTD (China). Additionally, we compete with bearing manufacturers&#146; in-house (captive) production. 

We believe that competition within the Precision Bearing Components Group is based principally on quality, price and the ability to consistently meet customer delivery requirements. Management believes that our competitive strengths are our precision manufacturing capabilities, our wide product assortment, our reputation for consistent quality and reliability, our global manufacturing footprint and the productivity of our workforce.

Precision Engineered Products Group 

Our Precision Engineered Products Group also operates in intensely competitive markets. We must compete with numerous companies in each industry market segment. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial resources than we do and many currently offer competing products nationally and internationally. 

Our primary competitors in the plastic bearing retainer market are Nakanishi Manufacturing Corporation, and Pressey. Domestically, National, Nypro Inc., Thermotech, GW Plastics, C&#38;J Industries and Nyloncraft are amongst the largest players in the precision plastic components markets. Our primary competitors in the medical device 

&#160;

market are Tecomet, Inc., Lake Region Medical, Inc., and Vention Medical, Inc. Our primary competitors in the electrical market are Deringer-Ney, Inc., Doduco GmbH and Metalor Technologies International. Our primary competitors in the automotive and aerospace market are Interplex Industries, Inc. and Accu-Mold, LLC. 

We believe that competition within the plastic injection molding, plastic bearing retainer, precision plastic components, medical device, electrical, automotive and aerospace markets is based principally on quality, price, design capabilities and speed of responsiveness and delivery. Management believes that our competitive strengths are product development, tool design, fabrication, and tight tolerance molding processes. With these strengths, we have built our reputation in the marketplace as a quality producer of technically difficult products. 

Autocam Precision Components Group 

In the market in which our Autocam Precision Components Group operates, internal production of components by our customers can impact our business as the customers weigh the risk of outsourcing strategically critical components or producing in-house. Our primary outside competitors are H&#228;ring, A. Berger, C&#38;A Tool, American Turned Products, Camcraft and AB Heller. We generally win new business on the basis of technical competence and our proven track record of successful product development. 

Raw Materials 

Precision Bearing Components Group 

The primary raw material used in our core ball and roller business of the Precision Bearing Components Group is 52100 Steel, which is high quality chromium steel. Our other steel requirements include metal strip, stainless steel, and type S2 rock bit steel.

The Precision Bearing Components Group businesses purchase substantially all of their 52100 Steel requirements from suppliers in Europe and Japan, and all of their metal strip requirements from European suppliers and traders. We purchase steel on the basis of composition, quality, availability and price. For precision steel balls, the pricing arrangements with our suppliers are typically subject to adjustment every three to six months in North America and contractually adjusted on an annual basis within the European locations for the base steel price and quarterly for surcharge adjustments. If any of our current suppliers were unable to supply 52100 Steel to us, higher costs and/or production interruptions could occur as a result of obtaining 52100 Steel from alternate sources. Our operating results would be negatively affected in the event that North American or European governments impose any significant quotas, tariffs or other duties or restrictions on the import of such steel, if the U.S. dollar decreases in value relative to foreign currencies or if supplies available to us would significantly decrease.

Precision Engineered Products Group 

The Precision Engineered Products Group uses a wide variety of metals in various forms, including precious metals like gold, silver, palladium and platinum. Through our diverse network of suppliers, we minimize supplier concentration risk and provide a stable supply of raw materials at competitive pricing. This group also procures resins and metal stampings from several domestic and foreign suppliers.

For the Precision Engineered Products Group, we base purchase decisions on quality, service and price. Generally, we do not enter into written supply contracts with our suppliers or commit to maintain minimum monthly purchases of materials. However, we carefully manage raw material price volatility, particularly with respect to precious metals, through the use of consignment agreements. In effect, we lease the precious metals for our own stock and buy the raw materials only on the same day customer shipments are priced, thereby eliminating speculation. In addition, our products with precious metal content are priced with a margin on the raw material cost to further protect against raw material price volatility and to provide incremental profit. 

Autocam Precision Components Group 

The Autocam Precision Components Group produces products from a wide variety of metals in various forms from various sources located in the North America, Europe and Japan. Basic types include hot rolled steel, cold rolled steel (both carbon and alloy), stainless, extruded aluminum, die cast aluminum, gray and ductile iron castings, hot and cold forgings and mechanical tubing. Some material is purchased directly under contracts, some is consigned by the customer, and some is purchased directly from the steel mills. 

&#160;

In each of our three segments, we have historically been affected by upward price pressure on steel principally due to general increases in global demand. In general, we pass through material cost fluctuations to our customers in the form of changes in selling price. 

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 

Historically, we have not owned any U.S. or foreign patents, trademarks or licenses that are material to our business; however, in connection with the PEP Acquisition, we acquired six U.S. patents, four patent applications and trademarks for various trade names. Furthermore, we intend to develop patented products that can be presented to and sold by our customers. 

Additionally, we rely on certain data and processes, including trade secrets and know-how, and the success of our business depends, to some extent, on such information remaining confidential. Each executive officer is subject to a non-competition and confidentiality agreement that seeks to protect this information. Additionally, all employees are subject to company code of ethics policies that prohibit the disclosure of information critical to the operations of our business. 

Seasonal Nature of Business 

Historically, due to a substantial portion of sales to European customers, seasonality has been a factor for our business in that some European customers typically reduce their production activities during the month of August. 

Regulatory Matters 

Environmental Compliance 

Our operations and products are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulatory requirements both domestically and abroad relating to pollution control and protection of the environment. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, discharges to air or water, the generation, storage, handling, and use of automotive hazardous materials and the handling and disposal of hazardous waste generated at our facilities. Under such laws and regulations, we are required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for some of our operations. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. Under some environmental laws and regulations, we could also be held responsible for all the costs relating to any contamination at its past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites. We maintain a compliance program to assist in preventing and, if necessary, correcting environmental problems. In the Precision Bearing Components Group, the Kysucke plant, the Veenendaal plant, the Pinerolo plant and Kunshan plant are ISO 14000 or 14001 certified and all received the EPD (Environmental Product Declaration), except for the Veenendaal plant&#146;s stamped metal parts business. 

Based on information compiled to date, management believes that our current operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We have assessed conditional asset retirement obligations and have found them to be immaterial to the consolidated financial statements. We cannot assure that currently unknown matters, new laws and regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws and regulations will not materially affect our business or operations in the future. More specifically, although we believe that we dispose of waste in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, we cannot be certain that we will not incur significant liabilities in the future in connection with the clean-up of waste disposal sites. 

FDA Compliance 

As a contract manufacturer of medical devices, certain of our subsidiaries, including PEP, are required to register as such with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;). Each of our facilities that manufacture finished medical devices is registered with the FDA. To maintain our registration, we deploy a robust quality management system across all of our manufacturing facilities. 

With respect to medical products that we are specifically developing to sell to our customers, before these devices can be marketed, we will seek to obtain a marketing clearance from the FDA under Section 510(k) of the United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The FDA typically grants a 510(k) clearance if the applicant can establish that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device. Clearance under Section 510(k) typically takes about three months from the date of submission.
