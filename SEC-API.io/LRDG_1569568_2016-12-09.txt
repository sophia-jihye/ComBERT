**Note: First 500 of Bigfoot Lives 2 was had defective packaging and labels and had to be re-manufactured. Used for Advertising promotions and mailings to various vendors and promotional events. 

In addition to the DVD Movies we have added T-shirts and other &#147;branded&#148; products to our inventory. In an effort to further the Bigfoot brand we have developed artwork that has been used to wrap our travel trailer so that the public can recognize our team by our unique logo. We plan to use some of the revenue from the product sales to offset expedition expenses. 

Bigfoot Project Investments Inc. was incorporated pursuant to the laws of the State of Nevada on November 30, 2011. Bigfoot Project Investments Inc. acquired Searching for Bigfoot Inc. for common shares. The agreement contains the customary warranties and representations. After the closing of the acquisition, the business and operations of Searching for Bigfoot Inc. were the business and operations of the issuer.

In 2006, a Nevada corporation; &#147;Searching for Bigfoot Inc.&#148; was formed, to research in determining the existence of a creature commonly referred to as &#147;Bigfoot&#148;. For the past six years &#147;Searching for Bigfoot Inc.&#148; has financed research and expeditions throughout the United States and Canada.

Beginning as a simple organization with the intent of raising funds to produce a movie for distribution, &#147;Searching for Bigfoot Inc.&#148; evolved to a point where it acquired significant value in Video/film footage, materials, artifacts, and relationships with organizations interested in &#147;Bigfoot&#148; existence around the country.

Recently a decision was made to pursue this opportunity as an ongoing investment business venture. Management team members were brought together to form an entertainment investment corporation that would capitalize on both current and future investment projects.

On November 30, 2011 a Nevada corporation, Bigfoot Project Investments Inc., was created.

Bigfoot Project Investments Inc.&#146;s., purpose is to focus all our projects into one investment holding company and to file for a public offering. We intend to consolidate all projects into one investment marketing plan, which we believe could be more effective than a single plan, thereby increasing the overall profits of the projects than if they were individually marketed.

We intend to create investment project entertainment properties surrounding the mythology, research and hopefully, capture the creature known as Bigfoot.

We intend to become an entertainment investment company, where our competitive advantage is our developed knowledge base and the advanced level of maturity of our projects. We intend to capitalize on &#147;Searching for Bigfoot Inc.&#148; current inventory of projects through agreements; allowing our company to continue creation of media properties and the establishment of physical locations, partnerships and alliances with organizations to augment investment markets to create revenue as a stand- alone enterprise.

On January 11, 2013, The Board of Directors of Bigfoot Project Investments Inc. passed a resolution to acquire Searching for Bigfoot Inc. and all the projects and assets currently owned by &#147;Searching for Bigfoot Inc.

The inventory of projects currently consists of nine DVD Movies which are being marketed to both DVD and Video On Demand (VOD) domestic distribution markets. Additionally, preliminary investment plans are being negotiated for a 3D Movie with a movie production company. Foreign distribution markets have recently become available and our contracted marketing company, The Bosko Group, is in the process of negotiating contracts for all nine DVD movies. This market would include the movies being subtitled and dubbed in foreign languages throughout Europe, Asia and South America. Currently we are represented by our contracted marketing distributor, The Bosko Group, in which they represent and sell the rights for the Bigfoot Project Investments Inc. nine DVD Movies. 

We are currently negotiating agreements with a 3D Movie Production Company to produce a movie called &#34;Bigfoot 3D&#34;. The draft script has been written and is being finalized with Golden Leaf Pictures, the production company. Investment funding is required to finalize negotiation of contracts and start production of the movie. There are no agreements in place to provide the funding at this time.

We plan to continue to amass artifacts (footprint castings, skeletal, hair, skin, blood and other creature remains), and media products such as DVD videos, photographs, audio and Written documents, Televised, and Movie media events from our continued Bigfoot Expeditions throughout the United States and Canada. We will be unable to amass additional artifacts without the funding provided by this offering. We will use the artifacts we currently have and the artifacts we intend to acquire. The collection of artifacts is used as scientific evidence to substantiate the existence of this creature known as &#147;Bigfoot&#148; as a species through proper DNA testing and scientific examination. The evidence that the artifacts provide are provided to the scientific community as evidence in documentation of this creature as a new species. This documentation is used in media projects (Television, DVD movies, publications etc.) for marketing and the management believes it has substantial value. Media products such as DVD videos, photographs, audio and written documents, Televised, and Movie media events from our continued Bigfoot Expeditions provide the basis for our media projects, which are marketed and provide revenue. Additionally we will negotiate and purchase intellectual and physical properties relating to the creature as opportunities become available that will continue to feed the development of additional projects.

Bigfoot Project Investments Inc. bears a high degree of risk, lacking maturity and not having a background or reference point to evaluate or compare company performance to the investor. Each of the projects we market will be carefully reviewed for market value by the Board of Directors. These Projects will be based on agreements with property owners of other organizations. Personnel in each project area will share in the responsibility running our company&#146;s operations.

Employees 

Currently, we have no full time employees other than our officers and directors. We anticipate that we will be unable to hire any employees in the next twelve months, unless we generate significant revenues. Meanwhile, we intend to utilize outsourcing quality personnel in conjunction with the talents of our Current Officers and Directors. We believe our future success depends in large part upon the continued services of our current Officers and Directors.
