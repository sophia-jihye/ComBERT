&#160; 

The DiMi Solution Platform 

&#160; 

Our flagship M2M solution is &#8220; DiMi ,&#8221; a proprietary, patent-pending, business intelligence and two-way communications platform that captures and seamlessly integrates real-time data from networked tracking, monitoring, alarm and alert systems, sensors and devices; and, in turn, centralizes this data onto an online command and control dashboard that is accessible 24/7 by a designated user or community of designated users through the secure DiMi Internet portal, found at www.dimispeaks.com . 

&#160; 

To date, we have not yet commenced commercial marketing of DiMi and have not yet generated revenues from operations. DiMi is to begin beta tested in anticipation of the initial commercial roll-out of version 4.0, which is anticipated will take place in the third quarter of 2017. We have also instructed our outsource software developer to begin work on smartphone apps to work in conjunction with version 4.0. For more information on our agreements with our outsource software developer for the development of version 4.0 and corresponding smartphone apps to work in conjunction with version 4.0, see &#8220;MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.&#8221; 

&#160; 

With adoption of the DiMi M2M communication s platform, users can remotely control, monitor, manage and acquire data from their operational assets, providing the interface for lighting, temperature, humidity, keycard access, fleet management and many other vital systems that impact the enterprise. DiMi uses established secure technology standards (i.e. LONet, MODbus, BACnet and ELK) combined with a unique, proprietary software interface that keeps users connected to their asset management and control systems through any web-enabled computer or mobile device. 

&#160; 

By providing dynamic, real-time access to critical information from a wide array of new or legacy sensors, GPS tracking tools and/or diagnostic devices &#8211; irrespective of their make, model or manufacturer, DiMi alerts or reports back to its users via familiar communication tools, like instant messaging, email, HTML and text messaging. Users can even issue global commands to its asset management and control systems through the DiMi software interface. Moreover, DiMi leverages the collected knowledge of a particular asset or assets and compares it to historical performance metrics and other critical benchmarks through an integrated data management module, giving users insight that allows them to rapidly identify and implement proper preventive maintenance measures, efficiency improvements and other key operational activities. 

&#160; 

Our proprietary M2M solutions utilize a cloud-based, two-way communications delivery platform, marketed as &#8220; DiMi .&#8221; Leveraging the power, scalability and flexible turnkey advantages of DiMi&#8217;s patent-pending software and hosting platform, users are able to remotely track, monitor, manage and protect multiple mobile and fixed assets in real-time from virtually any web-enabled desktop computer or mobile device while located anywhere in the world. DiMi features a robust, customized interface that gives its users secure command and control functionality of multiple remote, connected sensors, alarms and diagnostic devices. Moreover, the intuitive DiMi framework readily adapts to and integrates both new and legacy monitoring/sensing equipment &#8211; irrespective of make, model or manufacturer &#8211; providing for simplified, economical M2M deployments. 

&#160; 

Our DiMi solution is currently being used to actively monitor property management systems in several high-rise commercial and residential buildings in New York City &#8211; all beta sites which have served to demonstrate the efficacy of the DiMi technology and M2M communications platform. Moving forward, the Company intends to concentrate its DiMi commercialization efforts on marketing the solution to property management companies, commercial property developers, government/military installations, industrial facilities, retail and restaurant chains, colleges and universities, fleet managers, and any business or institutional concern with valuable fixed and mobile assets requiring remote surveillance, regular maintenance or general oversight. 

&#160; 

We expect to deliver DiMi as a monthly, hosted service that puts critical information into the palm of its user&#8217;s hands with no major hardware investments. Our hosting platform can be tailored for each customer to create secure and reliable end-to-end connectivity between their specific remote connected equipment and DiMi &#8217;s proprietary web interface. Once a new client&#8217;s core M2M business needs have been confirmed, the Company will closely collaborate with the client to design the organizational and process modifications required to ensure a successful DiMi launch, offering full service project definition, management, user interface customization, implementation services and ongoing quality assurance and testing. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Uses and Benefits of the DiMi Solution 

&#160; 

Based upon the knowledge and experience of our executive management in real estate operations and management, we have initially targeted the real estate management industry for initial commercialization of the DiMi Platform solution. Among the uses and benefits of DiMi in the real estate industry are the following: 

&#160; 

&#8220;Smart&#8221; Facility Management 

&#160; 

Today&#8217;s buildings &#8211; whether residential, commercial, medical or otherwise &#8211; are sustained through operation of various utility systems. Through these systems, electricity, heat, HVAC, water, lighting, security and other necessities, are provided to the buildings. 

&#160; 

Some conventional systems are controlled by human operators and, thus, require maintenance staff on-site or on-call to control, maintain and otherwise operate such systems. Other systems may be controlled electronically or through a combination of electronic and human control. These systems force building owners to extend additional resources and incur burdensome costs in order to maintain proper operation of the systems, as well as account for human errors that may result from improper system operation or management. Moreover, many conventional systems are not capable of remotely controlling multiple buildings having multiple building functionalities using a single monitor and control device nor can they adapt to various control interfaces that are used by the buildings and facility managers. 

&#160; 

Our DiMi solution works as a centralizing component of a facility or multiple facilities&#8217; management system, acquiring and interpreting data from thousands of networked devices monitoring systems operating in multiple locations. 

&#160; 

Whether a facility manager is looking to save oil and gas, monitor carbon emissions, avert a flood or monitor and control temperatures, lighting or remote keycard access, DiMi provides a fully integrated, affordable solution. Moreover, DiMi allows our clients to evaluate their building management practices for strengths, weaknesses and opportunities to be greener, more productive and more efficient. DiMi &#8217;s virtual grid can track and sort building data to enable cost savings, reduce the carbon footprint and set new global standards of performance for the facility management industry. 

&#160; 

Energy Savings 

&#160; 

For boilers to run at peak efficiency, operators must attend to boiler staging, water chemistry, pumping and boiler controls, boiler fuel-air mixtures, burn-to-load ratios and stack temperatures. DiMi can consolidate all the above efficiency-enhancing metrics and provide monitoring of water chemistry and temperature to improve equipment efficiency and reduce energy expenditures. DiMi provides these features on a cost effective platform which empowers users to realize significant cost savings. 

&#160; 

DiMi can help maintain consistent temperature throughout buildings and provide the ability for managers to monitor and control irregularities. Users benefit from being able to: prevent system wear and tear from operating under stress, increase the life of the systems through proper timing of maintenance and determine peak efficiencies and set pre-defined conditions and alerts. DiMi &#8217;s service can also measure water consumption by unit to ascertain usage by tenant and carbon emissions to track changes. 

&#160; 

Enhanced Security 

&#160; 

DiMi can provide remote monitoring, control and access to restricted areas. Our technology provides an audit trail that enables users to see who accessed a room and when. The ability to track entries to individual rooms via the audit trail eliminates the cost of replacing locks and lost keys. DiMi readily interfaces with most alarm panels on the market as well as most existing keycard access systems. 

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Disaster Management 

&#160; 

Water leaks and flooding may be costly for property managers and owners. DiMi can assist with disaster management by providing the ability to monitor strategically placed water sensors in bathrooms, elevator shafts, rooftop drains or any other problematic area. Users will be alerted if there are any irregularities within a defined scope to avert catastrophes. In addition, hurricane shields can be activated from a remote location to avoid disaster and minimize costs in protecting assets. 

&#160; 

Routine Maintenance 

&#160; 

All forms of routine maintenance that can be automated can be controlled directly using the DiMi M2M communications solution. From pre-defined schedules, on a demand basis when equipped with the proper sensors to a user&#8217;s instant messaging (&#8220;IM&#8221;) account anywhere the Internet is accessible, maintenance can be performed at will. For example, automated service calls can be enabled when a boiler is operating outside of predetermined optimal ranges or, storage tank levels can be preset to enable DiMi to trigger automatic scheduling of oil deliveries 

&#160; 

Building Value 

&#160; 

We believe that a building that incorporates DiMi will have a documented pedigree of asset performance. Energy management and efficiency gains, along with maintenance and repair history, are mapped through our Master Data Management module. DiMi &#8217;s information management capabilities increase property return on investment and overall property value. 

&#160; 

The Marketplace 

&#160; 

Although widely heralded as a &#8220;transformative&#8221; technology, M2M is not new. The concept was first used during World War II for identifying &#8220;friend&#8221; or &#8220;foe&#8221; to prevent pilots from hitting the wrong targets. Satellites use M2M to fire engines based on guidance and navigation sensors. Garage door openers respond to the clicker in a car. The difference now is that you can network the sensors in devices and objects, and use the data for extended purposes, such as recognizing that the garage door was left open and notifying the homeowner or security company to close it by way of remote command. 

&#160; 

M2M &#8211; also commonly called &#8220;ubiquitous&#8221; or &#8220;pervasive&#8221; computing &#8211; refers to digital microprocessors and sensors embedded in everyday objects and connected to networks. M2M most often refers to &#8220;machine-to-machine,&#8221; although mobile-to-machine or man-to-machine is also used to describe this fast evolving family of technologies. Because M2M communications can exist in practically any machine, environment and market, it holds the potential to reshuffle entire industry structures, creating an anticipated windfall for technology enablers in the M2M arena and enabling an array of solutions that deliver new levels of &#8220;smart services&#8221; and commerce. 

&#160; 

Secondary Target Markets 

&#160; 

Distilling customer needs to discrete services allows us to target and expand high value opportunities and generate critical need niches in vertical market sectors. Combining these niches into a consolidated service, offering a single point customer interface, is expected to give the Company key competitive differentiation in the marketplace. 

&#160; 

Restaurant and Retail Chains &#160;&#8211; DiMi can provide owners and managers of restaurants and retail businesses the ability to monitor and control multiple locations remotely from any web-enabled computer or mobile device. We can provide the interface that gives users real-time insight and control of critical systems within their establishments that enable them to reduce costs, manage more efficiently and increase their return on investment. As long as there is Internet access, users can monitor and manage all of their properties &#8211; whether at home, walking down the street or traveling out of the country. 

&#160; 

With respect to restaurants, DiMi provides the ability to monitor the humidity and temperature of walk-in environments, such as freezers, wine cellars and refrigeration units, helping to ensure that meats age properly, cellaring of wines is maintained and cheese or other perishables are well stored. When a power failure or surge occurs, immediate alerts are sent to a manager or owner&#8217;s handheld device, enabling quicker response times and reducing the loss of inventory from food spoilage or wine cellar temperature fluctuation. 

&#160; 

Weather extremes may also trigger instability in a restaurant environment. DiMi helps by providing the ability to remotely monitor temperatures in one or more restaurants and signal any deviation from normal. 

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Schools, Colleges and Universities &#8211; With DiMi , educational facilities can experience the peace of mind that comes with being able to monitor points of entry as well as restricted areas on-site or remotely from any web-enabled computer or mobile device. 

&#160; 

Our solution helps to protect sensitive documents, dormitories and classrooms housing expensive assets, such as computer centers, biotech labs, movie production and digital publishing facilities. Moreover, through use of DiMi &#8217;s auditing capabilities, school building managers can mitigate losses due to theft and receive immediate, real-time feedback in emergency situations, including security breaches, fire, smoke, gas leaks, and carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide alerts, among other potential crises. 

&#160; 

Healthcare Facilities &#160;&#8211; In addition to benefiting from the same remote monitor and control capabilities afforded all sectors involving the management of building systems, healthcare facilities can leverage DiMi M2M communications solutions in highly innovative ways to enhance resident patient care. 

&#160; 

For instance, DiMi can provide care facilities with an ability to prevent scalding due to inconsistencies in tap water temperature. The risk is greater where the resident population may be elderly, prone to sensory loss or when nerve reaction times are reduced; thus, the intuitive reaction to pull away from the scalding hot water is not sufficient to avoid potentially severe skin burns. 

&#160; 

Another potential application is home monitoring of patients suffering from chronic diseases and conditions, such as congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, asthma and obesity. Hospitals, clinics and physician practices can utilize DiMi to establish an additional communication channel with their patients, removing geographic barriers and enhancing the quality of care. 

&#160; 

Connecting with Telehealth devices used in the home and accessed via any web-enabled computer or wireless device, DiMi &#8217;s powerful interface can give medical staff the ability to monitor and quickly assess &#8211; in real-time &#8211; an at-home patient&#8217;s oxygen levels, pulse, blood pressure and other vital statistics, potentially reducing hospitalization rates, improving treatment plans and decreasing emergency room visits. Moreover, DiMi&#8217;s data management module captures important patient data for medical records, which can help reduce costs related to paperwork and prevent costly mistakes that could lead to malpractice claims. 

&#160; 

Industrial Complexes &#8211; DiMi &#8217;s cloud-based M2M communications platform supports a vast array of possibilities to employ innovative tracking, sensing, monitoring, alerting and reporting equipment to remotely monitor and manipulate industrial control systems. Integrating with existing or new backend systems, DiMi can serve as the command and control interface for a vast number of industrial M2M applications in sectors that range from oil and gas, water treatment and waste management to manufacturing, green power generation and utilities. 

&#160; 

One possible DiMi application is managing an industrial complex&#8217;s consumption of energy by reducing or shifting electricity use to improve electric grid reliability, manage electricity costs, and encourage load shifting or load shedding during times when the electric grid is near capacity. Another would be real-time remote monitoring and control of automated irrigation systems for a commercial farming enterprise or monitoring and detecting tank leaks at oil refineries. 

&#160; 

Because DiMi is hardware-agnostic and readily customized to address the demands of any industrial sector, we believe that the DiMi interface can be leveraged and applied to protect a vast array of fixed and mobile assets deemed valuable and mission-critical. 

&#160; 

Logistics/Fleet Management &#160;- Powered by DiMi , DiMi Telematics provides the commercial transport industry with a cost effective method of monitoring in real-time all aspects of fleet operations, including driver and vehicle performance, geo-tracking, safety, compliance and efficiency. The resulting benefits range from the successful streamlining of routes and schedules to save money in fuel consumption and personnel costs, to mitigating risk and lowering insurance costs. 

&#160; 

Certain U.S. legislation (e.g., Food Safety Act 1990, Quick Frozen Foodstuffs Regs 1995 and the Temperature Control Regs 1995) mandates that mobile transporters of chilled food products closely monitor the temperature of goods in transit to protect them from spoilage. Working in concert with automated, wireless temperature monitoring devices, DiMi is able to transmit alerts directly to fleet managers and/or refrigerated truck drivers when load temperatures approach predefined levels requiring immediate attention. 

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Given the positive outlook for the M2M industry and our targeted market segments, we will sell our solutions in intensely competitive markets. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources than we do. As the markets for our software products and hosting services continue to develop, additional companies, including those with significant market presence in the wireless industry, could enter the markets in which we compete and further intensify competition. In addition, we believe price competition may become a more significant competitive factor in the future. 

&#160; 

Several businesses that share the M2M space can be viewed as competitors, such as M2M application service providers, Mobile Virtual Network Operators, system integrators and wireless operators/carriers that offer a variety of the components and services required for the delivery of complete M2M solutions. 

&#160; 

We believe we have a competitive advantage and are uniquely positioned as an M2M solution-centric business because our M2M communications platform is hardware-agnostic, and our hosting environment is in the cloud which gives us the ability to help businesses lower their IT infrastructure costs and management requirements while improving performance, scalability and flexibility. 

&#160; 

We have also taken, and will continue to take, the necessary steps to secure the proprietary aspects of our applications through patent filings in the U.S. and in key international markets. Moreover, we intend to remain focused on proactively developing best-of-breed Internet-enabled M2M solutions that are designed to effectively meet the evolving needs of our primary target market, namely web-based remote asset tracking, management and control with applications in the commercial, industrial, educational, government and military sectors. 

&#160; 

The markets for our M2M communications solutions will remain characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. Nonetheless, the principal competitive factors in these markets will continue to be product performance, ease of use, reliability, price, breadth of solution offerings, sales and distribution capability, technical support and service, customer relations, and general industry and economic conditions. 

&#160; 

We believe that our consultative approach to enabling hosted M2M technologies for our clients, as well as the attention we give to their specific needs, requirements and circumstances, are critical competitive differentiators that we are dedicated to preserving and nurturing as we grow. Moreover, prudent and timely integration of new and emerging digital and web technologies into our M2M communications platform will remain an underpinning mission for us if we are to earn and maintain distinction as a recognized industry leader. 

&#160; 

Among the public companies with which we may compete are: Digi International, Inc. (Nasdaq:DGII), EnerNOC, Inc. (Nasdaq:ENOC), Evolving Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:EVOL), Gemalto, NV (OTCQB:GTOFF), Numerex Corp. (Nasdaq:NMRX), RF Monolithics, Inc. (Nasdaq: RFMI), Telular Corporation (Nasdaq:WRLS) and Trimble Navigation Ltd. (Nasdaq:TRMB). Many of these competitors have greater name recognition as well as financial and other resources than we have. We may never become a competitive influence in the marketplace. 

&#160; 

Plan of Operations 

&#160; 

DiMi Telematics, Inc. is headquartered in New York City and incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada. Aside from the oversight and administration of our corporate, financial and legal affairs by the executive management team, once commercial roll-out of DiMi takes place, our Company&#8217;s operating activities will be centralized in three core areas: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Sales and Marketing will employ both direct and indirect sales models utilizing an in-house business development team, partners and resellers and self-service through a service on-demand web interface. &#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Our initial sales and marketing team will be comprised of our current management staff, and supplemented by the hiring of dedicated sales professionals as the Company matures. However, we intend to immediately begin building out our global distribution network through reseller and strategic marketing agreements with qualified third party sources. To support and nurture strong relationships with our future sales and marketing partners, we expect to provide co-marketing, trade show support, product training and DiMi demo units, while also actively engaging in industry awareness and leading generation programs.
