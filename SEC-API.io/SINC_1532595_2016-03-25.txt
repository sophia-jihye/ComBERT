Business Developments 

&#160;

Founded in The Netherlands in April 2011 as the provider of one of the first crowdfunding platforms, our business evolved in 2015 into a fully integrated, data driven, user friendly online funding network consisting of several products and services known as The Funding Network&#8482;. The Funding Network&#8482; is intended to give small and medium sized entities (&#8220;SMEs&#8221;) direct access to all forms of finance, while offering investors full transparency on the potential risks and return of their portfolios and was developed in response to the following funding hurdles affecting entrepreneurs and investors in general and SMEs in particular: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Limited or no structured distribution channels for SME finance other than banks, increasing the mismatch between entrepreneurs and financiers; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

No centralized platform for (alternative) financiers, making it difficult and inefficient to find the right financier at the right time; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

No standardized data protocols for SME data, leading to costly and time-intensive (offline) screening and monitoring; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Limited financial skills of entrepreneurs leading to unnecessary inefficiencies and obstacles within the financing process; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Decline in bank financing due to new regulations and recent financial crises, leaving a vacuum in the life cycle of SME financing. 

&#160;

Since 2011, we have been a Dutch leader in equity-based crowdfunding having funded 100 small and medium sized enterprises (&#8220;SME&#8221;) with over &#8364;9.5 million (approximately $10.45 million) in total crowdfunding volume since inception. As of December 31, 2015 we had a community of approximately 36,525 active investors. 

&#160;

Presently, all of the entrepreneurs making use of our crowdfunding platforms are located in The Netherlands and all of the investors are located in Europe with approximately 80% of such investors being located in The Netherlands. We do not presently provide equity based crowdfunding in the United States or to United States investors. The regulations governing equity based crowdfunding in the United States have not yet been adopted. There can be no assurance given that following the adoption of these regulations, we will be able to structure our United States crowdfunding operations, if any, in a manner that complies with such regulations. 

&#160;

Our online funding operations through The Funding Network&#8482; are intended to address the decreasing availability of traditional bank financing options to SMEs in Europe and elsewhere. We are an early mover in online funding having developed in-house investing and monitoring technologies designed to create efficiently structured capital market funding solutions. We believe that we are presently the only European based online funding platform to offer proprietary equity, loan and high quality monitoring services to private SMEs. Certain competitors offer comparable funding services but do not include monitoring services. Others provide equity and loan funding services plus high quality monitoring services but do not currently possess a proprietary user base or internal payment method. 

&#160;

On December 8, 2014 we entered into an agreement (the &#8221;Agreement&#8221;) with Fortion Holding B.V., a Netherlands limited liability corporation conducting its business under the trade name Credion (&#8220;Credion&#8221;). Credion provides financial advisory services in the Dutch small and medium enterprise (&#8220;SME&#8221;) markets and specializes in debt and equity financings for SMEs. The Agreement provides for a strategic alliance between us and Credion in which Credion&#8217;s extensive network of investors and entrepreneurs will be connected with each other through our online funding platform. Credion will process the funding for its SME clients through our platform resulting in monthly recurring revenue and transaction fees for us. The alliance is intended to provide more efficient access to capital for SMEs while greatly improving SME data monitoring standards for investors. SMEs utilizing the platform will have direct access to Credion&#8217;s investor clients as well as our investors. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. is the contractor for all of our crowdfunding business in the Netherlands. We do not own or have any interest in Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A is a variable interest entity (&#8220;VIE&#8221;) which we, through Symbid B.V., effectively control through corporate governance rather than through any ownership. Because we own no interest in Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A., we have no right to receive any distributions from Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. The revenues to us from Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. come from administrative, success and management fees paid to us by Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. Because of the corporate governance control structure, we consolidate the financial statements of Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. with our own. If we were to lose control of Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. through a loss of our majority vote on the members&#8217; counsel of Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A., we would not be able to continue to consolidate the financial results of Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. and this would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, approximately 80% and 96.8% of our revenues, respectively, were derived from Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 we had net losses of $2,299,275 and $2,821,794, respectively. 

&#160;

In August 2014 we incorporated in Germany our indirect, majority owned, subsidiary Symbid Germany GmbH. We contributed capital of $7,749 to this subsidiary, which is currently an entity without operations. Symbid Germany GmbH is expected to be capitalized, followed by an operational launch in 2016 although there can be no assurance given that this goal will be achieved. 

&#160;

Further to the planned European expansion of our equity crowdfunding operations, on February 20, 2015, Symbid Italia SPA (&#8220;Symbid Italia&#8221;), an Italian corporation created to develop the business of equity crowdfunding in Italy, was formed by our wholly owned subsidiary, Symbid Holding B.V., together with Banca Sella Holding SPA (&#8220;Banca Sella&#8221;) and Marco Bicocchi Pichi. Through Symbid Italia, we intend to create a new online funding platform, based on our existing crowdfunding technology, in which Italian investors and entrepreneurs can connect, fund and grow together and to digitalize financial services for Italian small and medium enterprises. The launch of the crowdfunding operations is expected in the second quarter of 2016. Symbid Italia represents the first stage of the European rollout of our crowdfunding platform outside of The Netherlands. In connection with the formation of Symbid Italia, we paid $ 284,525 for a 50.1% ownership interest. Banca Sella holds a 29.94% ownership interest and Mr. Pichi holds a 19.96% interest. The roles and rights of the founding shareholders in managing and developing Symbid Italia are set forth in a 5-year Subscription and Shareholders&#8217; Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;). Banca Sella is an Italian bank with experience in online marketing and the development of distribution channels and innovative banking services. Mr. Pichi is the founder of several technology companies and has extensive executive management experience. The Agreement contains a non-compete provision, restrictions on share transfers, rights of first offer and tag along rights. It also provides for us to provide Symbid Italia with an exclusive royalty free license to use our name and intellectual property in connection with the funding of Italian companies. It further provides for Banca Sella to provide banking services to Symbid Italia. 

&#160;

In June 2015, our loan crowdfunding program was launched, and in the beginning of July 2015 our first successful loan crowdfunding campaign was realized. The launch of this peer-to-business lending service complements our existing equity crowdfunding service and supports the development of our online funding platform for start-ups and small businesses, The Funding Network. Based on our existing crowdfunding technology, loan crowdfunding by Symbid will enable established businesses with at least 3 years of activity and positive cash flows to borrow money from a large group of investors, the &#8220;crowd&#8221;. 

&#160;

This service operates through a transaction-based model similar to our current equity crowdfunding service. There is a fixed 1% success fee upon the successful funding of a loan crowdfunding campaign, paid by the business, plus 1% per year for the term of the loan immediately payable upon successful closing of the campaign. In addition, investors are be charged a flat 1% administration fee. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

To operate the loan crowdfunding Symbid Co&#246;peratie UA obtained an exemption to mediate in redeemable funds from the Dutch Authority Financial Markets. 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

We were incorporated as HapyKidz.com, Inc. in Nevada on July 28, 2011 with the intention to become an e-commerce marketplace that connects merchants to consumers by offering daily discounts on goods and services through a proprietary website. We were not successful in this endeavor. 

&#160;

On September 4, 2013, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State to change our name from HapyKidz.com, Inc. to Symbid Corp. 

&#160;

On December 6, 2013, we closed a share exchange (the &#8220;Share Exchange&#8221;) pursuant to which the 19 shareholders of Symbid Holding B.V. sold all of their capital stock in Symbid Holding B.V. to us in exchange for 21,170,000 shares of our common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the &#8220;Common Stock&#8221;). As a result of the Share Exchange, Symbid Holding B.V. became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. 

&#160;

As the result of the Share Exchange, we are engaged in the business of creating and operating online, equity based crowdfunding platforms, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Symbid Holding B.V. In 2015, we expanded our operations to include an online platform for SME funding, connecting new and traditional sources of finance in one integrated network built around our technology. 

&#160;

In connection with the Share Exchange and pursuant to a December 6, 2013 Split-Off Agreement (the &#8220;Split-Off Agreement&#8221;), we transferred our pre-Share Exchange business to Holli Morris, our pre-Share Exchange majority stockholder, in exchange for the surrender by her and cancellation of 187,500,000 shares of our Common Stock. 

&#160;

As a result of the Share Exchange and Split-Off, we discontinued our pre-Share Exchange business and acquired the business of Symbid Holding B.V. and we have continued the existing business operations of Symbid Holding B.V. as a publicly-traded company under the name Symbid Corp. 

&#160;

Also on December 6, 2013, we completed an initial closing of a private placement offering of 3,098,736 units at $0.50 per unit, for aggregate gross proceeds of $1,549,368 (before deducting placement agent fees and expenses of the offering estimated at approximately $64,895). Each of these units consisted of one share of our common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of our common stock. The warrants are exercisable for a period of three (3) years at a purchase price of $0.75 per share. The private placement was exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;), in reliance upon the exemptions provided by Regulation D and Regulation S promulgated by the SEC thereunder. The private placement was sold to &#8220;accredited investors,&#8221; as defined in Regulation D and/or to &#8220;non-U.S. Persons&#8221; in accordance with Rule 903 of Regulation S under the Securities Act. On February 5, 2014, we completed a second closing of the private placement for aggregate additional gross proceeds of $186,992. On May 20, 2014, we completed a third and final closing of the private placement for aggregate additional gross proceeds of $1,190,405. 

&#160;

The Share Exchange was treated as a recapitalization of the Company for financial accounting purposes and Symbid Holding B.V. was considered the acquiror for accounting purposes. 

&#160;

In accordance with &#8220;reverse acquisition&#8221; accounting treatment, our historical financial statements as of period ends, and for periods ended, prior to the Share Exchange have been replaced with the historical financial statements of Symbid Holding B.V. prior to the Share Exchange in our post Share Exchange filings with the SEC. 

&#160;

Prior to the Share Exchange, we were a &#8220;shell company&#8221; (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). As a result of the Share Exchange, we ceased to be a shell company. 

&#160;

On January 28, 2015, we completed the initial closing under a private placement offering in which we offered shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $0.50 per share. In connection therewith, we sold 1,248,232 shares for aggregate proceeds of $624,116. Effective June 30, 2015, we sold an additional 200,000 shares for aggregate proceeds of $100,000 and completed the offering. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

On July 14, 2015 and September 8, 2015, we closed on the sale of $250,000 and $1,250,000, respectively, in principal amount of 8% unsecured convertible promissory notes (the &#8220;Notes&#8221;). Subject to earlier prepayment or conversion, the Notes mature three years from issuance. Interest is payable on the first, second and third anniversaries of the issuance date. We can prepay the Notes at a 10% premium above the amount of interest and principal their due. At any time after issuance, the holders may, at their option, convert all or a portion of the principal and interest then due into shares of common stock at a price of $0.25 per share. On July 14, 2015, we received conversion notices from four persons holding an aggregate of $190,000 in principal amount of Notes of their determination to convert all of such principal into an aggregate of 760,000 shares and subsequently issued such shares. 

&#160;

Although Symbid Holding B.V., Symbid B.V. and their subsidiaries maintain their books and records in their functional currency, the Euro (&#8220;EUR&#8221; or &#8220;&#8364;&#8221;), the currency of The Netherlands, for financial reporting purposes Symbid Corp. uses the United States dollar (&#8220;U.S. dollars,&#8221; &#8220;USD&#8221; or &#8220;$&#8221;). For purposes of describing metrics or certain business related numbers in the Business description or MD&#38;A Section an exchange rate of $1.1101 for &#8364;1 as of December 31, 2015 has been applied. 

&#160;

Share Exchange and Related Transactions 

&#160;

Share Exchange Agreement 

&#160;

On December 6, 2013 we, Symbid Holding B.V. and the shareholders of Symbid Holding B.V., entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the &#8220;Share Exchange Agreement&#8221;), which closed on the same date. Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, the 19 shareholders of Symbid Holding B.V. sold all of their capital stock in Symbid Holding B.V. to us in exchange for 21,170,000 shares of our Common Stock. As a result of the Share Exchange, Symbid Holding B.V. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. 

&#160;

Prior to the Share Exchange, we ceased being an e-commerce marketplace that offered daily discounts on goods and services through a proprietary website and became a &#8220;shell company&#8221;. Pursuant to the Share Exchange, we acquired the business of Symbid Holding B.V., to engage in the creation and operation of online investment &#8220;crowd funding&#8221; platforms. 

&#160;

At the closing of the Share Exchange, an aggregate of 11,400,000 shares of our Common Stock were issued to the holders of Symbid Holding B.V.&#8217;s common stock and 9,770,000 shares of our Common Stock were delivered in escrow, 600,000 of which were being held in escrow in accordance with the indemnification provisions of the Share Exchange Agreement and are in the process of being released. The remaining 9,170,000 shares in escrow were being held in connection with Symbid&#8217;s prospective acquisitions of additional interests in Gambitious B.V. and Equidam Holding B.V. On June 6, 2014 we determined not to proceed with the purchase of additional shares in Gambitious B.V. As a consequence thereof, 5,000,000 of the 9,170,000 shares, representing the shares which had been allocated to the prospective purchase of additional shares of Gambitious B.V. were returned from escrow and subsequently cancelled. An additional 300,000 shares allocated to our existing ownership interest in Gambitious B.V. at the time of the Share Exchange were similarly returned from escrow and subsequently cancelled due to the reduction in our indirect ownership interest in Gambitious B.V. from 18% to 12%. 600,000 of the shares of our common stock delivered into escrow and allocated to our existing ownership in Gambitious B.V. were distributed to the former shareholders of Symbid Holding B.V., subject to a 5% hold back to further secure the indemnification obligations of the former Symbid Holding B.V. shareholders under the Share Exchange Agreement. The 5% hold back shares are in the process of being released from escrow. 

&#160;

On September 2, 2014 we determined not to proceed with the purchase of additional shares of Equidam Holding B.V. We presently hold an approximately 7% ownership interest in Equidam Holding B.V. Until August 2014, we held a 9% ownership interest in Equidam Holding B.V., which was diluted in connection with an equity financing by Equidam Holding B.V. in which we determined not to participate. As a consequence of the foregoing, the 3,000,000 shares of our common stock allocated to the prospective purchase of additional shares of Equidam Holding B.V. delivered into escrow were returned to us and cancelled. 270,000 of the shares of our common stock delivered into escrow and allocated to our existing ownership interest in Equidam Holding B.V. were distributed to the former shareholders of Symbid Holding B.V., subject to a 5% holdback to further secure the indemnification obligations of the former Symbid Holding B.V. shareholders under the Share Exchange Agreement. The 5% hold back shares are in the process of being released from escrow. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

On February 9, 2015, we sold our remaining 12% interest in Gambitious B.V. for &#8364;18,000 due to Gambitious B.V. having incurred continuing losses in 2014, Gambitious B.V. having switched its business focus to that of the publishing of games, Gambitious B.V. requiring capital contributions from its existing owners and Gambitious B.V. no longer constituting a strategic fit with our evolving operations. 

&#160;

The Share Exchange Agreement contained customary representations and warranties and pre- and post-closing covenants of each party and customary closing conditions. Breaches of the representations and warranties are subject to customary indemnification provisions, subject to specified aggregate limits of liability. 

&#160;

In connection with the Share Exchange, the parties took all actions necessary to ensure that the Share Exchange was treated as a tax-free exchange under Section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 

&#160;

The issuance of shares of our common stock to holders of Symbid Holding B.V.&#8217;s capital stock in connection with the Share Exchange was not registered under the Securities Act, in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, which exempts transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering and/or Regulation S promulgated by the SEC under that section. These securities may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements, and certain of these securities are subject to further contractual restrictions on transfer. See &#8220;Lock Up Agreements and Other Restrictions.&#8221; 

&#160;

We also agreed not to register under the Securities Act the resale of the shares of our common stock received in the Share Exchange by our officers, directors and key employees and holders of 10% or more of our common stock for a period of two years following December 6, 2013. 

&#160;

Split-Off 

&#160;

Upon the closing of the Share Exchange, under the terms of a split-off agreement and a general release agreement, we transferred all of our pre-Share Exchange operating assets and liabilities to our wholly-owned special-purpose subsidiary, Symbid Split Corp., a Delaware corporation (&#8220;Split-Off Subsidiary&#8221;), formed on October 14, 2013. Thereafter, pursuant to the split-off agreement, we transferred all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Split-Off Subsidiary to Holli Morris, the pre-Share Exchange majority stockholder of the Company, and a former sole officer and director of the Company (the &#8220;Split-Off&#8221;), in consideration of and in exchange for (i) the surrender and cancellation of an aggregate of 187,500,000 shares of our Common Stock held by Ms. Morris (which were cancelled and resumed the status of authorized but unissued shares of our common stock) and (ii) certain representations, covenants and indemnities. 

&#160;

Pursuant to the terms of the Split-Off Agreement between Ms. Morris and us and as detailed therein, at the closing of the Split-Off, we transferred all assets and liabilities of our pre-Share Exchange legacy business to Ms. Morris. Prior to the closing of the Share Exchange and Split-Off, Ms. Morris entered into a settlement and release agreement with us dated March 8, 2013, pursuant to which she forgave an aggregate of $45,500 in Company liabilities outstanding as of that date relating to cash loaned and advances made by her to us and to accrued management fees due her. Pursuant to the terms of the Split-Off Agreement, Ms. Morris also assumed and undertook to pay $44,584 in accounts payable and accrued liabilities outstanding as of March 8, 2013 relating to general expenditures, administrative expenses and professional fees of ours. Ms. Morris surrendered all of her shares in the Company to us for cancellation as a condition of the completion of the Share Exchange. 

&#160;

The 2013/2014 Private Placement Offering 

&#160;

Concurrently with the closing of the Share Exchange and in contemplation of the Share Exchange, we held a closing of our private placement offering in which we sold 3,098,736 units of our securities, at a price of $0.50 per unit. Each unit consisted of one share of our common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of our common stock. The warrants are exercisable for a period of three years at an exercise price of $0.75 per share. As a result of the first closing of the private placement offering, we received gross proceeds (before deducting commissions and expenses of the private placement offering) of $1,549,368. The private placement offering was conducted on a &#8220;best efforts&#8221; basis. This closing of the private placement offering and the closing of the Share Exchange were conditioned upon each other. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

We paid the placement agent in the private placement offering, Gottbetter Capital Markets, LLC, a registered broker-dealer, a cash commission of 10% of the gross funds raised from investors in the private placement offering introduced by the placement agent. In addition, the placement agent received warrants exercisable for a period of three years to purchase a number of shares of our common stock equal to ten percent of the number of units sold in the private placement offering to investors introduced by the placement agent, with a per share exercise price of $0.50. The placement agent received fifty percent of the cash fee and warrants for investors in the private placement offering introduced by FireRock Capital, Inc. The placement agent did not receive any cash fees or warrants for private placement offering investors who were pre-Share Exchange shareholders of Symbid Holding B.V. or private placement offering investors who were introduced by Symbid B.V. or affiliated persons. As a result of the foregoing arrangements, with respect to the first closing, the placement agent was paid an aggregate commission of $35,250 and was issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 77,500 shares of our common stock. 

&#160;

We agreed to indemnify the placement agent and its sub-agents to the fullest extent permitted by law, against certain liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the private placement offering, including certain civil liabilities under the Securities Act, and, where such indemnification is not available, to contribute to the payments the placement agent and its sub-agents may be required to make in respect of such liabilities. 

&#160;

On February 5, 2014, we conducted a second closing of the private placement offering in which we sold an additional 373,984 units for aggregate gross proceeds of $186,922. As a result of this closing, the placement agent was paid $7,750 in additional aggregate commissions and was issued warrants to purchase an additional 15,500 shares of our common stock. 

&#160;

On May 20, 2014 we conducted a third and final closing of the private placement offering in which we sold an additional 2,380,810 units for aggregate gross proceeds of $1,190,405. In connection with this closing, the placement agent was not paid additional commissions or issued additional warrants to purchase additional shares of our common stock. 

&#160;

Registration Rights 

&#160;

In connection with the private placement offering, we entered into a registration rights agreement (the &#8220;Registration Rights Agreement&#8221;), pursuant to which we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC covering (a) the shares of common stock issued in the private placement offering, and (b) the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the private placement offering warrants (but not including the shares of common stock underlying the private placement offering placement agent warrants) (the &#8220;Registration Statement&#8221;). The Registration Statement was declared effective on July 11, 2014. We filed a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement which was declared effective on May 8, 2015. 

&#160;

If we were late in filing the Registration Statement or if the Registration Statement was not declared effective within one hundred eighty days of filing with the SEC, monetary penalties become payable by us to the holders of registrable common stock that had not been so registered at a rate equal to one percent of the private placement offering price per share for each full month that (a) we were late in filing the Registration Statement, or (b) the Registration Statement was late in being declared effective by the SEC; provided, however, that in no event would the aggregate of any such penalties exceed ten percent of the purchase price per unit. We did not file the Registration Statement until May 21, 2014 and consequently we incurred late filing penalties in the approximate amount of $15,000. 

&#160;

We further agreed to keep this Registration Statement &#8220;evergreen&#8221; for two years from the date it was declared effective by the SEC, or until Rule 144 of the Securities Act was available to the holders of registrable shares with respect to all of their shares, whichever is earlier. 

&#160;

In any follow-on &#8220;best efforts&#8221; private placement offering of our securities that provides for registration rights, the investors in the private placement offering are entitled to &#8220;piggyback&#8221; registration rights. 

&#160;

2013 Equity Incentive Plan 

&#160;

Before the Share Exchange, our Board of Directors adopted, and our stockholders approved, our 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the &#8220;2013 Plan&#8221;), which provides for the issuance of incentive awards of up to 5,000,000 shares of our Common Stock to officers, key employees, consultants and directors. For a description of the awards made under the 2013 Plan, see &#8220;Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans&#8221;. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Departure and Appointment of Directors and Officers 

&#160;

Our Board of Directors currently consists of six members. On December 6, 2013, Noah Levinson, our sole director before the Share Exchange, resigned his position as a director, and Korstiaan Zandvliet and Robin Slakhorst were appointed to the Board of Directors. On July 15, 2015, we appointed Hendrik Kasteel, Michael Buitelaar, J&#233;r&#245;me Koelewijn and Vincent Lui to the Board of Directors. 

&#160;

Also on December 6, 2013, Mr. Levinson, our President, Secretary, Treasurer and sole officer before the Share Exchange, resigned from these positions, and Korstiaan Zandvliet was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer and President, Maarten van der Sanden was appointed as our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Treasurer and Robin Slakhorst was appointed as our Secretary and Chief Commercial Officer. On April 15, 2014 Maarten van der Sanden resigned as our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer and Philip J. Cooke was appointed to fill these vacated positions. Effective November 14, 2014, Philip J. Cooke resigned as our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Effective March 16, 2015, Maarten van der Sanden was appointed as our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer on an interim basis. Effective November 16, 2015, Maarten van der Sanden resigned as our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer and Dick Kooij was appointed to the vacated Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer positions. On the same date, Robin Slakhorst resigned as our Secretary and Maarten van der Sanden was appointed to the vacated Secretary position. On November 16, 2015, we also appointed Robin Slakhorst as a Vice President. See &#8220;Management &#8211; Directors and Executive Officers&#8221; for information about our directors and executive officers. 

&#160;

Lock-up Agreements and Other Restrictions 

&#160;

In connection with the December 6, 2013 Share Exchange, each of our then executive officers and directors and each person holding 10% or more of our common stock after giving effect to the Share Exchange, the Split-Off and the private placement offering (the &#8220;Restricted Holders&#8221;), holding at that date in the aggregate 11,832,892 shares of our common stock, entered into agreements (the &#8220;Lock-Up and No Shorting Agreements&#8221;), whereby they were restricted for a period of 24 months after the Share Exchange from certain sales or dispositions of our common stock held by them immediately after the Share Exchange, except in certain limited circumstances (the &#8220;Lock-Up&#8221;). All of the Lock-Ups expired on December 5, 2015. 

&#160;

Further, for a period of 24 months after the Share Exchange, each Restricted Holder agreed in the Lock-Up and No Shorting Agreements to be subject to restrictions on engaging in certain transactions, including effecting or agreeing to effect short sales, whether or not against the box, establishing any &#8220;put equivalent position&#8221; with respect to our common stock, borrowing or pre-borrowing any shares of our common stock, or granting other rights (including put or call options) with respect to our common stock or with respect to any security that includes, relates to or derives any significant part of its value from our common stock, or otherwise seeks to hedge his position in our common stock. 

&#160;

Additionally, a non-Restricted Holder, agreed to a Lock-Up for a period of 12 months of 1,000,000 shares of our common stock owned by him which Lock-Up expired on December 6, 2014. 

&#160;

Forward Stock Split 

&#160;

We effected a 25-for-1 forward stock split on our common stock in the form of a dividend with a record date of September 16, 2013 and a payment date of September 17, 2013. All share amounts referenced in this Annual Report, including those applicable to periods prior to the forward stock split, give effect to the forward stock split unless otherwise indicated. 

&#160;

FAC B.V. Acquisition 

&#160;

On July 29, 2014, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with our wholly owned subsidiary, Symbid Holding B.V., and FAC 2 B.V., a limited liability corporation incorporated in The Netherlands. Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, we acquired FAC B.V. (&#8220;Acquiree&#8221;), a limited liability corporation incorporated in The Netherlands from FAC 2 B.V. in exchange for 2,750,000 shares of our restricted common stock. Acquiree owns a perpetual, worldwide, exclusive license to infrastructure technology upon which we have developed a platform to enable cloud based financing solutions for small and medium sized enterprises, expanding on our current equity based crowdfunding solutions in the Netherlands. Acquiree was formed by FAC 2 B.V. for the specific purpose of holding the license and has no customers, employees, operations or revenues. Acquiree&#8217;s only assets are its proprietary software and technology. Prior to our acquisition of Acquiree, (i) a contract employee of ours who is a member of Symbid B.V. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Symbid Holding B.V.) management and is also the managing director of a 5% shareholder of ours indirectly owned 20% of Acquiree; (ii) a contract employee of ours who is a member of Symbid B.V. management indirectly owned 20% of Acquiree; and (iii) a minority shareholder of ours indirectly owned 10% of Acquiree.

&#160;

Fortion Agreement 

&#160;

On December 8, 2014 we entered into an agreement (the &#8221;Agreement&#8221;) with Fortion Holding B.V., a Netherlands limited liability corporation conducting its business under the trade name Credion (&#8220;Credion&#8221;). Credion provides financial advisory services in the Dutch small and medium enterprise (&#8220;SME&#8221;) markets and specializes in debt and equity financings for SMEs. The Agreement provides for a strategic alliance between us and Credion in which Credion&#8217;s extensive network of investors and entrepreneurs will be connected with each other through a new, online funding platform of ours. Credion will process the funding for its SME clients through our platform resulting in monthly recurring revenue and transaction fees for us. The alliance is intended to provide more efficient access to capital for SMEs while greatly improving SME data monitoring standards for investors. SMEs utilizing the platform will have direct access to Credion&#8217;s investor clients as well as our investors. 

&#160;

We will charge SMEs utilizing the platform a service fee for the start package related thereto (&#8364;350) with part of such fee being utilized to purchase advisory services from Credion in its capacity as a preferred supplier. 

&#160;

Financing proposals generated by Credion within the platform can be offered to investors (i) by means of a private placement with the professional financing parties affiliated by service level agreements or (ii) by means of an offer on the online direct funding platform enabling investors to invest online utilizing standardized financial products. For (i) above, the settlement of potential transactions will be finalized outside of the platform. For successful transactions under (ii) above, a percentage of the applicable success fee will be paid to Credion. Financiers will be encouraged, but not required, to purchase monitoring services from us. The financier will pay us a monthly fee for such monitoring services. Entrepreneurs that are introduced to the platform by us will be charged a fee of &#8364;300 for a monitoring start package. 

&#160;

The Agreement provides that commencing January 1, 2015 all financings facilitated and brokered by Credion and its advisors will be registered on our platform. In connection therewith, Credion will add us on a best efforts basis as a contractual party to all service level agreements it has signed and will sign. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Credion has the right to utilize other direct online funding platforms. Similarly, we have the right to facilitate financings brokered by other corporate finance companies, but we must continue to offer the Credion services within the financing process via our platform on a preferred supplier basis. 

&#160;

As consideration for Credion&#8217;s obligations under the Agreement, we issued 1,500,000 shares of our restricted common stock to Credion following execution of the Agreement. For the period January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017, we are required to issue up to an additional 1,000,000 shares of our restricted common stock to Credion, up to 250,000 of which shares are payable as at December 31, 2015 for the period January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, up to 500,000 of which shares are payable as at December 31, 2016 for the period January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 and up to 250,000 of which shares are payable as at December 31, 2017 for the period January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017. The number of shares to be issued for each of 2015, 2016 and 2017 will be based upon the number of monitoring start packages of &#8364;300 times the number of companies purchasing those packages from us that have been introduced to us by Credion. During 2015 no monitoring start packages were sold to customers of Credion and no shares were payable as at December 31, 2015. 

&#160;

SME entrepreneurs will be charged a success fee equal to 5% of the amount raised from the direct online funding platform, 20% of which will be payable to Credion if the SME was introduced to Symbid by Credion. For private placements with SME entrepreneurs introduced by us, SME entrepreneurs will be charged a success fee of &#8364;250. If the entrepreneur has been introduced through the Credion network, no success fee will be charged on the private placement.

Dynasty Wealth Agreement 

&#160;

On July 1, 2015, (the &#8220;Effective Date&#8221;) we entered into a Financial Public Relations Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with Dynasty Wealth, LLC, (&#8220;Dynasty&#8221;) a Nevada limited liability corporation, pursuant to which we engaged Dynasty, on an independent contractor basis, to provide us with financial public relations services. Such services included disseminating public information about us, communicating on our behalf with the investment community, conducting conference calls and arranging meetings on our behalf with prospective investors and other investment professionals, facilitating the production of research reports about us, reviewing proposed press releases and public presentations, and providing general investor relations services. The agreement had an initial term that ran until August 31, 2015 and was subject to extension for up to three years thereafter upon the achievement of certain milestones. 

&#160;

As compensation for the services to be rendered by Dynasty, we paid consulting fees to Dynasty at the rate of $10,000 per month due and payable on the last day of every month. We could elect to pay such consulting fees to Dynasty in cash or common stock or a combination thereof. For payments made in stock, our shares were to be valued based upon the 20 day volume weighted average trading price for our common stock at the time of the election. Notwithstanding the forgoing, the consulting fee for the initial term was paid in the form of 60,000 shares of our common stock. 

&#160;

As additional compensation to Dynasty for services rendered pursuant to the Agreement, we agreed to issue to Dynasty up to one million six hundred thousand (1,600,000) warrants to purchase shares of our common stock at a price of $0.50 per share. The issuance of the warrants was tied to the satisfaction of certain performance metrics involving market capitalization. The performance metrics were not satisfied and none of the warrants were issued. 

&#160;

The Agreement had a minimum term of two months (the &#8220;Initial Term&#8221;) and a maximum term of thirty-eight months. In the event that we achieved a Market Capitalization (as defined below) of $25 million or more by the end of the Initial Term (the &#8220;Initial Term Market Capitalization Metric&#8221;), the Agreement was to be automatically extended to June 1, 2016 and 20,000 warrants were to be issued to Dynasty. If we did not satisfy the Initial Term Market Capitalization Metric, the Agreement was to automatically terminate at the end of the Initial Term. 

&#160;

The Agreement was to be automatically extended to June 1, 2017 and 170,000 warrants were to be issued to Dynasty in the event that we achieved a Market Capitalization of $67.5 million or more during or before the term ending December 31, 2015. 

&#160;

The Agreement was to be automatically extended to June 1, 2018 and 610,000 warrants were to be issued to Dynasty in the event that we achieved a Market Capitalization of $125 million or more during or before the term ending December 31, 2016. 

&#160;

The Agreement was to be automatically extended to August 31, 2018 and 800,000 warrants were to be issued to Dynasty in the event that we achieved a Market Capitalization of $225 million or more during or before the term ending December 31, 2017. 

&#160;

Market Capitalization of the Company was defined for the purposes of the Agreement to be the prior thirty calendar day weighted average daily price for our common stock multiplied by the fully diluted number of shares outstanding, including all instruments convertible into common stock at or below a strike price equal to the prior thirty calendar day average daily price of the common stock. The relevant Market Capitalization objective needed to be achieved for a minimum average of 30 calendar days at any time during the term of the Agreement. 

&#160;

Unless extended by both parties in writing, the Agreement was to automatically terminate in the event that Dynasty did not timely meet the performance requirements described above. In the event the Agreement was terminated, Dynasty was to cease rendering services to us as of the effective date of termination, and we were required to pay Dynasty to the extent not previously paid, any cash fees for the services performed through the date of termination and any additional compensation fees that had been earned pursuant to the achievement of the performance metrics prior to the date of termination. 

&#160;

On November 11, 2015, we entered into the First Amendment (the &#8220;Amendment&#8221;), effective as of August 31, 2015, to the Agreement with Dynasty. We did not achieve the Initial Term Market Capitalization Metric as of August 31, 2015. However, Dynasty continued to provide us with financial public relations services subsequent to August 31, 2015. We subsequently agreed with Dynasty to extend the date for satisfaction of the Initial Term Capitalization Metric from August 31, 2015 to December 31, 2015 and to give the Amendment retroactive effect to August 31, 2015. The Amendment further provided for the $10,000 monthly consulting fee payable under the Agreement for the period September 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015 to be paid in restricted shares of our common stock with a valuation based on the 20 day volume weighted average price for our common stock during the 20 day period ending December 31, 2015. We also pushed back the deadline for achieving a Market Capitalization of $67.5 million or more from December 31, 2015 until March 31, 2016. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

All other terms of the Agreement continued with full force and effect. 

&#160;

The Initial Term Capitalization Metric was not satisfied as of December 31, 2015 and the Agreement was terminated as of such date. 

&#160; 

The Initial term has been paid in shares. Payments in shares for the period from September 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015 are included in the accrued expenses as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160;

Symbid Overview Corporate Structure 

&#160;

Symbid B.V. derives income from its crowdfunding business in The Netherlands through revenue streams from Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A., a Dutch limited liability cooperative that licenses Symbid&#8217;s crowdfunding platform. Symbid B.V. does not own or have any equity interest in Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. is a variable interest entity (&#8220;VIE&#8221;) which Symbid B.V. effectively controls through corporate governance rather than through equity ownership. That is, the majority of the voting power (five (5) votes) within the members&#8217; counsel (which appoints the management board) of Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. is held by Symbid Foundation, a Dutch foundation whose board of directors is appointed by Symbid B.V. Symbid Foundation was established specifically and solely to serve as a management control mechanism with respect to Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. through its ability to control the majority voting power of Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A.&#8217;s members&#8217; counsel. 

&#160;

It is Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A.&#8217;s status as a VIE that allows Symbid B.V. to consolidate the financial statements of Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. as if Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. were a subsidiary of Symbid B.V. If Symbid B.V. were no longer able to maintain effective control over Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A., it would no longer be able to consolidate Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A.&#8217;s financial results with its own. As of December 31, 2015, Symbid B.V.&#8217;s fiscal year end, approximately 80% of Symbid B.V.&#8217;s revenues were derived from the VIE. We rely on the administrative, success and management fees paid by Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. to Symbid B.V. For the year ended December 31, 2014, these fees totaled: Administrative - $95,231, Success - $186,949 and Management - $5,346. For the year ended December 31, 2015, these fees totaled: Administrative - $62,632, Success - $219,523 and Management - $0. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. recognized other income derived from government grants totaling $0 and $5,000, respectively. 

&#160;

Symbid B.V. determined that its crowdfunding operations in The Netherlands would be best served by operating through Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. even though Symbid B.V. does not own Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. and only consolidates its financial results since Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. qualifies as a VIE, because it removes the regulatory burden and additional costs that otherwise might have been imposed on Symbid B.V. if it were deemed to be a broker-dealer offering securities for sale to the public. Under the Dutch regulatory framework, and specifically under the Dutch Act on Financial Supervision, an entity is required to register for a broker-dealer license when it is selling securities to the public. Membership interests in a Dutch cooperative, however, if not freely tradable, are not deemed to be securities under Dutch law. As such, Symbid has determined to ensure that all membership interests in Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. as well as in the various investor cooperatives organized to fund specific projects on the platform are not freely tradable. By adhering to this framework, neither Symbid B.V. nor Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. is required to be licensed as a broker dealer under Dutch law. 

&#160;

If Symbid B.V. were not able to maintain effective control, through Symbid Foundation, over Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A., it would not be able to consolidate the financial results of Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. and as a consequence, its own financial results would suffer. 

&#160;

Although Symbid B.V. determined that for purposes of maximizing its crowdfunding operations in The Netherlands, it would operate through Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. and Symbid Foundation, Symbid B.V. has not concluded that this organizational structure should be used for the future introduction of the Symbid crowdfunding platform in other countries. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

The intellectual property (&#8220;IP&#8221;) underlying Symbid B.V.&#8217;s crowdfunding platform is not owned by Symbid B.V. It is owned by Stichting Symbid IP Foundation, a Dutch foundation that was formed in October 2013 to hold that property as part of Symbid&#8217;s restructuring. In addition to the software IP relating to the crowdfunding platform technology, Stichting Symbid IP Foundation&#8217;s IP consists primarily of two internet domain names (www.symbid.com and www.symbid.nl) and does not include any patents. Stichting Symbid IP Foundation licenses the crowdfunding platform technology to Symbid Holding B.V. on a perpetual, exclusive basis. Symbid Holding B.V., in turn, licenses the technology, on a perpetual basis, to Symbid B.V. which has sublicensed the technology to Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. for use in The Netherlands. Without the primary license of the crowdfunding platform technology from Stichting Symbid IP Foundation, Symbid would not be able to continue its business. By transferring the Symbid crowdfunding technology to Stichting Symbid IP Foundation, Symbid believes that it has insulated and protected that property from various types of claims that otherwise might possibly arise if the property had remained in a corporate entity. 

&#160;

Our subsidiary, FAC B.V. is the owner of the perpetual, worldwide, exclusive license to infrastructure technology upon which we have developed a platform to enable cloud based financing solutions for small and medium sized enterprises, expanding on our current equity based crowdfunding solutions in the Netherlands. 

&#160;

How the Symbid Equity Crowdfunding Platform Works 

&#160;

Symbid provides an online platform where companies and individuals are able to submit business propositions for funding by individual investors. Individuals and companies register their business propositions with the online Symbid crowdfunding platform operated by Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. and become &#8220;Class B Members&#8221; of Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. and control one vote, as a group, within the Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. members&#8217; council. The entrepreneur indicates how much capital (&#8220;Target Funding&#8221;) is required to start or grow his (or her) business and, once the business proposition is approved by Symbid, that information is published on the Symbid website along with a description, including video and power point presentations as provided by the entrepreneur, of the entrepreneur&#8217;s business proposition. The entrepreneur sets a date by which the Target Funding is expected to be reached (&#8220;Funding Deadline&#8221;) and the proposition is only funded if the Target Funding is reached. A Funding Deadline may be extended for up to 180 days if the Target Funding is not successful within the original Funding Deadline. The entrepreneur can offer the business proposition to a select group of invitees or open the offering to the entire Symbid community. Once the Target Funding is reached, the business proposition is funded and the entrepreneur pays a 5% success fee to Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. 

&#160;

Individual investors (currently limited to residents of the European Union) review Symbid&#8217;s crowdfunding website to search for propositions they believe could be viable investments for them. Prospective investors have access on the Symbid crowdfunding website to basic information about the various business propositions being offered without having to register or open an account on the Symbid platform. If a prospective investor wants access to more information, including detailed financial information, about a business proposition offered on the Symbid platform, that person is required to register with Symbid and to open an account on the Symbid platform. 

&#160;

Once a person registers with Symbid, if he (or she) wants to invest in one or more business propositions on the Symbid platform, that person purchases &#8220;e-money&#8221; by depositing a certain amount of funds with the Symbid platform. These funds are held in a segregated trust account by Intersolve, an electronic money institution regulated by the Dutch Central bank and the Dutch Financial Markets Authority. Once an investor opens an account and buys e-money, that investor becomes a &#8220;Class A Member&#8221; of Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. Class A Members, as a group, control one vote within the Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. members&#8217; council. Electronic money (e&#8211;money) is an electronically (including magnetically) stored monetary value, represented by a claim on the issuer, which is issued on receipt of funds for the purpose of making payment transactions, and which is accepted by a person other than the electronic money issuer. 

&#160;

On Symbid&#8217;s website, an investor sees his (or her) e-money in the investor&#8217;s account in a digital wallet, an electronic device that allows an individual to make electronic purchases, payments and, in Symbid&#8217;s case, investments. Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. charges investors an administration fee of 1% (1.21% including VAT) of investment funds deposited into an electronic wallet. Investors can invest in a proposition with a minimum investment of &#8364; 20 ($22) up to a maximum of &#8364; 20,000 ($22,000) and each business proposition can be funded up to a maximum of &#8364; 2.5 million ($2.75 million). 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Until a particular business proposition&#8217;s Target Funding is reached, an investor can freely withdraw his (or her) investment from one proposition and invest it in another proposition. However, when the Target Funding is reached, investments are fixed and can no longer be withdrawn. Withdrawn funds are returned to an investor&#8217;s electronic wallet and any e-money remaining in an electronic wallet can either be invested in other business propositions on the Symbid platform or redeemed from Intersolve and returned to an investor&#8217;s personal bank account. Until December 1, 2014, Intersolve charged investors a flat fee of &#8364; 20 ($22) for redemption. For each redemption requested after December 1, 2014, Symbid has been charged &#8364;15 ($16.5). This should be seen as a service from Symbid to their investors in order to make it as easy as possible for money transactions to be processed on the platform. 

&#160;

When a proposition is fully funded, that is, the Target Funding is reached, all investors are gathered into one single purpose investment vehicle, a Dutch limited liability cooperative which operates independent of Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. The entrepreneur being funded is a member of the cooperative as the entrepreneur is required to make the minimum contribution to the cooperative associated with its proposition, or &#8364; 20 (approximately $22). The entrepreneur&#8217;s voting rights as an investor for its equity investment are the same as other investors within the cooperative, commensurate with its pro rata investment in the cooperative. Each membership interest, whether it is the membership of the entrepreneur or an investor, shares the same voting rights. Subsequently, that entity buys, with the Target Funding, a predetermined number of shares in the equity capital of the entrepreneur&#8217;s existing or newly established legal entity. This process occurs online. The cooperative has the same level of rights in the entrepreneur&#8217;s business as a direct equity investor commensurate with its ownership percentage in the target company; however, the voting interests are exercised through the directors of the cooperative elected by members of the cooperative. 

&#160;

At the outset of a crowdfunding campaign, the entrepreneur must identify a minimum of two investors, generally two investors that have contributed the most significant amount to the crowdfunding proposition, to serve as founders and directors of the investor cooperative. If a proposition becomes fully funded, the cooperative is formally incorporated and the entrepreneur and two investor designees are nominated to the Board of Directors. During the formal incorporation of the cooperative, the investors have the ability to dismiss the proposed directors and/ or nominate additional members of the cooperative to become directors. This formal ratification process of the Board of Directors is subject to the approval through voting rights of the members of the cooperative during the incorporation of the cooperative. The cooperative must have a minimum of three directors and there is no maximum number of directors. A director of the cooperative must also be a member of the cooperative. Investors in the cooperative have the opportunity at the Annual General Meeting of Members of the cooperative to propose a resolution for additional directors or dismiss existing directors. 

&#160;

As a shareholder in the entrepreneur&#8217;s company, the Board of Directors of the investor cooperative can exercise voting rights similar to direct equity investors at an annual shareholder&#8217;s meeting or other forum. Investors in the cooperative jointly make decisions either through an online voting forum established for the investor cooperative or at an annual or general meeting of the cooperative. As such, individual investors in the cooperative cannot directly exercise voting or other rights generally afforded to a direct equity investor. Voting rights are exercised through the cooperative via its elected directors who act on behalf of the cooperative&#8217;s investors. 

&#160;

The following table provides an overview of the investor&#8217;s rights within a cooperative and those of a direct equity investor: 

&#160;

Direct equity investor in private company 

&#160; Investor as member of a cooperative 

&#160; &#160; &#160; Voting rights regarding decisions within target company 

&#160; Voting rights regarding decisions within cooperative and representative share of voting rights based on ownership percentage in the investment 

&#160; &#160; &#160; Pay-out of dividends directly from the target company 

&#160; Pay-out of dividends from the cooperative received from the target company 

&#160; &#160; &#160; Ability to transfer securities to third parties, dependent on contractual agreements with the private companies 

&#160; Significant restrictions on the transferability of memberships, which can only be made to members within the cooperative, subject to the approval of the cooperative&#8217;s Board of Directors. No ability to transfer securities to third parties 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Members of an investor cooperative are limited to transferring or selling their membership interests only to other registered members within the cooperative. Once a crowdfunding proposition is completed, the investor can obtain a membership register for all investors included in the cooperative upon request to the Board of Directors of the cooperative to pursue the sale of that investor&#8217;s membership interests to another cooperative member. Should a member within an investor cooperative decide to sell its membership interests, approval of the cooperative&#8217;s Board of Directors is required. The buying and selling parties would agree upon a selling price, after which a transfer agreement is required to be executed and consideration paid by the buyer. In addition, the Board of Directors of the cooperative would have to document its approval of the transfer. Membership interests in an investor cooperative cannot be sold, transferred, or otherwise assigned unless the buyer is also a member of the cooperative. Should a member within an investor cooperative decide to sell its membership interests, approval of the cooperative&#8217;s Board of Directors is required. The buying and selling parties would agree upon a selling price, after which a transfer agreement is required to be executed and consideration paid by the buyer. In addition, the Board of Directors of the cooperative would have to document its approval of the transfer. Membership interests in an investor cooperative cannot be sold, transferred, or otherwise assigned unless the buyer is also a member of the cooperative. 

&#160;

Subsequently, if a new round of funding is required by the entrepreneur&#8217;s company, the entrepreneur can decide whether or not to utilize the Symbid platform again or raise funds from outside the Symbid platform. In both of the aforementioned cases, the investment of the initial investors through the cooperative would become diluted. Investors can receive a return on their investments in the investor cooperative through (i) the sale of the target company by the entrepreneur as a result of which the investor cooperative would receive selling shareholder consideration, (ii) dividends paid to investors, including to the investor cooperative, by the target company, or (iii) the buy-back of shares issued to and held by the investor cooperative. For each of these scenarios, investors in the cooperative would receive a pro rata return of their investments in the target company. 

&#160;

On the Symbid platform, users who invest in an entrepreneurial venture not only become owners, but become part of a community with the entrepreneur. The entrepreneur and the investors gain access to each other on the Symbid platform through a secured online collaboration community. People within the collaboration community know who else invested in the business proposition and together they can join forces to advise and assist the funded company. This online community offers various collaboration tools to actively manage and monitor the progress of the company and enables investors to interact with the entrepreneur or the entrepreneur&#8217;s management team. Usage of the online community is voluntary at the election of the entrepreneurs and investors. 

&#160;

Market Need - The Problem Definition 

&#160;

Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (&#8220;SMEs&#8221;) are crucial engines of economic growth, job creation and social cohesion. In many countries SMEs represent approximately 99% of all business entities. However, entrepreneurs and investors in the SME backbone of our economies experience obstacles and barriers when seeking to connect, fund and grow. Recent financial crises and stricter banking regulations are contributing to this vacuum in the life cycle of SME financing. Access to capital remains one of the biggest challenges in the creation, survival and growth of SMEs. 

&#160;

The recent global credit crunch has decreased the access to capital for small and medium-sized businesses according to a report recently released by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (the &#8220;OECD&#8221;). The report &#8216;Financing SMEs and Entrepreneurs 2012: An OECD Scoreboard&#8217; analyzed data from 18 countries, and found that business loans to SME&#8217;s in the countries surveyed fell sharply during the recession of 2008 and, although these loans picked up somewhat in 2010, as of 2013 they had failed to surpass their 2007 levels. Loan conditions for SMEs include shortened maturities and increased demands for collateral. Venture and growth capital also suffered a big drop during the period covered by the OECD report. The banking sector, a natural source of debt financing for start-up and growing companies, has to comply with new requirements and legislation as a result of past bad practices and the recent financial crisis. 

&#160;

The availability of finance for European small businesses has failed to improve along with the slow economic recovery since the 2008 financial crisis. This suggests the current &#8216;equity gap&#8217; facing SMEs is caused by deeper, structural issues in the way small business are funded. The Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE), published annually by the European Commission and European Central Bank, states that in 2014 the availability of bank loans for early-stage SMEs across the European Union declined by a further 8% in an already difficult funding climate. The SAFE report indicates that 30% of early-stage SMEs across the European Union were rejected for bank financing in 2014, with little or no possibility of future negotiations. In the Netherlands, where Symbid was incorporated in 2011, 39% of all SMEs were rejected by banks in 2014 &#8211; the highest rejection rate in the European Union. Clearly, the role of banks as a provider of debt financing to SMEs has significantly decreased over the past few years. It is expected that this role will decrease further in the coming years with the credit crunch reaching its peak level and the Basel III Accord being implemented in 2013 through 2019. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

According to the SAFE report, &#8216;innovative&#8217; businesses active in the online industries have the poorest access to finance across the different types of business entities surveyed. This is due primarily to the difficulties associated with the valuation of companies that lack well-defined material assets but whose core business is based mostly upon intellectual property. Therefore, in our digital age, it is the more forward-thinking, online-oriented businesses which are suffering most from the lack of bank finance for SMEs. 

&#160;

The lack of access to capital for SMEs has also been recognized in the United States where the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act) was enacted into law in April 2012. The JOBS Act is intended to encourage the funding of small businesses located in the United States by easing various federal and state securities regulations. It is expected that once the SEC promulgates regulations required under the JOBS Act, entrepreneurs will be able to engage an online crowd of investors through equity crowdfunding. Title II went into effect on September 23, 2013. Title III rulings enabling the general solicitation of unaccredited investors, thereby effectively legalizing equity crowdfunding in the U.S. as is already the case in most European countries, went into effect on January 29, 2016. 

&#160;

In any case, more than 80% of all private companies do not have access to a structured and affordable (alternative) capital &#8216;market&#8217; other than banks. The alternative finance industry in Europe grew by 144% to almost &#8364;3 billion in 2014, and is expected to have more than doubled in size in 2015. Across Europe, there are now over 300 platforms active in the alternative finance sector. The &#8216;equity gap&#8217; facing European SMEs is waiting to be filled by a centralized platform for alternative finance with standardized data protocols. If rejected for a bank loan, as 30% of early-stage SMEs were in the European Union in 2014, entrepreneurs can struggle to navigate the emerging alternative finance market. With each platform focusing on one type of finance, for example peer-to-peer lending or equity crowdfunding, a capital search is a costly and time-consuming process for entrepreneurs. The lack of standardized SME financial data, plus the sometimes limited financial skills of entrepreneurs, creates a mismatch between small business and investors. Furthermore, there are currently no platforms which offer both alternative financing and traditional financing options, such as bank loans. 

&#160;

Increasingly, entire industries are being concentrated into single online destinations &#8211; termed &#8216;go-to&#8217; platforms. Online platforms based on horizontal, peer-to-peer models continue to revolutionize the music, hospitality and personal transportation industries. The financial industry has remained particularly resilient to digital technologies and, as yet, not one go-to platform exists which provides small businesses with access to various types of funding, alternative and traditional. 

&#160;

Online Funding Operations 

&#160;

The launch of The Funding Network&#8482; took place in early March 2015. Built around our investing and monitoring technology, The Funding Network&#8482; gives entrepreneurs access to various types of finance, while offering (private and institutional) investors risk/reward transparency. Entrepreneurs connecting to our online funding platform are guided towards the type of funding best suited to their needs by our professional advisors. Investors can personalize their deal flow according to key business criteria, pinpointing the investment opportunities that matter to them. This is intended to produce a more efficient capital allocation service, underpinned by standardized XBRL data streamed from the financial reporting system. Our platform is designed to connect entrepreneurs, start-ups and small businesses to all types of funding. 

&#160;

Our platform breaks down the funding process from beginning to end. We connect entrepreneurs to investors via sound financial advice. Investors seek new opportunities, then monitor the performance of their investments. Financial advisors give support to entrepreneurs along the way, while accountants provide the real-time financial data. The funding process consists of the following steps: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; CREATE : The entrepreneur and advisor together create a funding request in a standardized deal format. 

&#160; 

SHARE : The standardized funding request can be shared with a variety of institutional investors, and a network of over 36,000 private (crowdfunding) investors, who can invest from as little as &#8364; 20 ($22). Deals can be shared publically (open) or privately (closed). 

&#160; 

MATCH : We match deals with the right investors based on personalized preferences and can facilitate the settlement if required. 

&#160; 

MONITOR : Ongoing financial analysis of private companies, resulting in reporting for optimal risk and return management. Financial data can be imported into our monitoring from the accountant reporting system. Standardized data allows for comparing the performance of companies. Investors and entrepreneurs both use a personalized dashboard based on pre-set Key Performance Indication (&#8220;KPI&#8221;) relating to a particular company.

Crowdfunding 

&#160;

We began our operations in April 2011 as one of the first equity based crowdfunding platforms worldwide, enabling access to capital for entrepreneurs through the offering of securities to the public over the internet. The security based or equity based crowdfunding model, however, is not the only crowdfunding model and, currently, the following two models can be identified: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Equity based: crowdfunding for financial return through revenue and profit sharing; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Lending based: crowdfunding for financial return through interest on a loan. 

&#160;

By the launch of The Funding Network in 2015 the Company decided to not proceed with the reward based model and focus on SME financing through debt or equity. 

&#160;

Online Funding 

&#160;

Monitoring Services 

&#160;

We offer our monitoring technology as part of The Funding Network&#8482; and as a standalone product for business partners. The technology provides insights for investors and entrepreneurs with the periodical financial results of a portfolio of companies. This monitoring product is being used to co-develop the optimal KPI representation together with launching partner Credion, a financial advisory firm in the Netherlands. The product is an online application fully integrated into The Funding Network&#8482; by Symbid, handling XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) data in order to calculate KPIs and inform users of the key performance trends of a particular business. Entrepreneurs connecting to The Funding Network&#8482; register to have their company&#8217;s data monitored and encourage their investors to subscribe to their company&#8217;s monitoring portal access. The product was conceived with its target user being an investor, but will also be marketed to entrepreneurs focused on assessing and improving the performance of their own business. 

&#160;

Our monitoring product was introduced in February 2015 with Credion, a leading Dutch financial advisory firm, as our launching partner. Credion is offering our monitoring services to their network of investors (&#8220;SLA partners&#8221;) where they have contractual agreements in the form of a Service Level Agreement through their office franchise. In order to offer this product, Credion must first request the appropriate monitoring portal access from Symbid who will charge the end user a pre-defined fee per monitoring portal access per month. Consequently, this product will function as a subscription-based monthly recurring revenue model. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

As a launching customer, Credion has almost 100 Dutch franchise partners that use a single workflow system with separate logins per franchise (with multiple users). Credion will add this monitoring service to its franchise service portfolio via a request form at the end of their SME funding workflow. All franchises have access to the Credion national investor (SLA partner) database, but have their own private (SME) client base. In this monitoring system, Symbid has to have the role of administrator, while franchises cannot see which company is a client of which franchise. They however may see which companies are available for monitoring, or which Credion SLA partner has a subscription on which company monitoring portal access. 

&#160;

Financial Advisory Services 

&#160;

With Credion as a launching partner, we also indirectly offer financial services as part of our overall product and service portfolio. A pre-defined registration fee paid by all entrepreneurs connecting to our platform covers a limited number of meeting hours with a professional financial advisor. This advisor provides guidance to entrepreneurs relating to the most suitable type of funding for their particular business, and co-creates a request for funding together with the entrepreneur. This ensures all entrepreneurs receive the most efficient capital allocation service possible within our network. Credion will provide these financial advisory services for the foreseeable future in accordance with our signed, non-exclusive, long-term partnership agreement. 

&#160;

Strategic Product Roll Out 

&#160;

We have been offering our equity based crowdfunding platform in The Netherlands since April 2011. Since May 2012 that platform has been available to European investors. We launched a loan based crowdfunding platform model during the second quarter of 2015. 

&#160;

The internalization strategy of our platforms starting with an expansion in Europe will require additional capital of between $2.5 million and $4 million, to establish local offices in various European countries. We do not have these funds currently and we will have to sell additional debt or equity in order to raise the required funds. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise these funds on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are not able to raise these funds we will not be able to roll-out our European crowdfunding expansion strategy. Alternatively, we may be able to initiate partnership projects with local teams to provide the Symbid brand in other European countries. 

&#160;

The roll out of our partnering strategy is in progress, with new affiliate and group partners being linked to the Symbid platform on an ongoing basis. We are also in ongoing discussions with potential corporate partners, however we cannot give any assurance that any of these discussions will result in corporate partnerships. We do not need any additional funding for rolling out our partnering strategy. 

&#160;

A brief overview of service companies currently related to our crowdfunding eco-system is provided below. 

&#160;

FAC B.V. 

&#160; On July 29, 2014, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with our wholly owned subsidiary, Symbid Holding B.V., and FAC 2 B.V., a limited liability corporation incorporated in The Netherlands. Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, we acquired FAC B.V. (&#8220;Acquiree&#8221;), a limited liability corporation incorporated in The Netherlands from FAC 2 B.V. in exchange for 2,750,000 shares of our restricted common stock. Acquiree owns a perpetual, worldwide, exclusive license to infrastructure technology upon which we intend to develop a platform to enable cloud based financing solutions for small and medium sized enterprises, expanding on our current equity based crowdfunding solutions in the Netherlands. The license provides the required technology for ongoing monitoring of private companies. Financial data can be imported into Symbid monitoring from the accountant reporting system resulting in powerful reporting for optimal risk and return management. Standardized data allows for comparing the performance of companies. Investors and entrepreneurs get a personal dashboard with KPI&#8217;s for key variables and covenants. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Equidam Holding B.V. 

&#160; Equidam Holding B.V., founded in August 2013, is one of the first companies to be organized in any country as a crowdfunding service provider. Started as an online valuation tool for private companies with a particular focus on Small and Medium-sized Enterprises, Equidam Holding B.V. now also offers monitoring services to investors on the Symbid platform. In addition to Equidam Holding B.V.&#8217;s relationship with Symbid, this company has entered partnerships with European crowdfunding platforms to provide its services to these platforms as well. Symbid currently owns a 7% direct interest in Equidam Holding B.V. following an additional round of financing by Equidam Holding B.V. in which we determined not to participate. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; Fortion Holding B.V. 

&#160; Fortion Holding B.V. is providing under the brand name Credion financial advisory services in the Dutch small and medium enterprise markets and specializes in debt and equity financings for SMEs. Through a strategic alliance between us and Credion in which Credion&#8217;s extensive network of investors and entrepreneurs will be connected with each other through a new, online funding platform of ours. Credion will process the funding for its SME clients through our platform resulting in monthly recurring revenue and transaction fees for us. The alliance is intended to provide more efficient access to capital for SMEs while greatly improving SME data monitoring standards for investors. SMEs utilizing the platform will have direct access to Credion&#8217;s investor clients as well as our investors. 

&#160;

Financing proposals generated by Credion within the platform can be offered to investors (i) by means of a private placement with the professional financing parties affiliated by service level agreements or (ii) by means of an offer on the online direct funding platform enabling investors to invest online utilizing standardized financial products. For (i) above, the settlement of potential transactions will be finalized outside of the platform. For successful transactions under (ii) above, a percentage of the applicable success fee will be paid to Credion. Financiers will be encouraged, but not required, to purchase monitoring services from us. The financier will pay us a monthly fee for such monitoring services. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; Kredietpaspoort Co&#246;peratie UA 

&#160; The Kredietpaspoort (Credit Passport) is an online &#8220;passport&#8221; which provides up-to date information about entrepreneurs and their business. The product is designed to be used by private investors to quickly assess the prospects and reliability of start-ups, SMEs and their owners before making an investment. In essence, the Credit Passport is a simple-to-use yet comprehensive online tool which provides the necessary information for all lenders. 

&#160;

Meanwhile, entrepreneurs gain insight into their funding potential with specific information about the types of investor attracted to their business and why they choose to invest or not. Furthermore, entrepreneurs are immersed in investment terminology and can learn how to target investors more effectively. The service enables investors and entrepreneurs to do business in a more efficient, streamlined fashion and reduces uncertainty for both sides. 

&#160;

The Credit Passport complements The Funding Network by enabling entrepreneurs to create an online summary of critical investor information, thereby eliminating the costly paper trails which currently inhibit entrepreneurs in raising funds. We are currently a minority shareholder in the Kredietpaspoort initiative. Developed in close collaboration with Erasmus University Rotterdam and the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, this project recently received a grant from the Dutch government in order to ensure a swift, effective roll-out in the Netherlands. 

&#160;

Symbid Italia SPA 

&#160; Through Symbid Italia, we intend to create a new online funding platform, based on our existing crowdfunding technology, in which Italian investors and entrepreneurs can connect, fund and grow together and to digitalize financial services for Italian small and medium enterprises. Symbid Italia represents the first stage of the European roll-out of our crowdfunding platform outside of The Netherlands. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; Symbid Germany GmbH 

&#160; Through Symbid Germany, we intend to create a new online funding platform, based on our existing crowdfunding technology, in which German investors and entrepreneurs can connect, fund and grow together and to digitalize financial services for German small and medium enterprises. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Symbid is planning to launch a service-store for entrepreneurial products and services such as those provided by the companies listed above. Symbid&#8217;s vision is to have entrepreneurs raise and spend their target capital on the Symbid platform. In this service-store framework, other companies can offer additional products and services, and Symbid will share in the revenues derived from the products and services sold to entrepreneurs and investors on this service-store platform. 

&#160;

The Market 

&#160;

In 2010 there was already an established market for lending- and donation-based crowdfunding models. Equity-based crowdfunding platforms began to appear only in 2009/2010. 

&#160;

According to Massolution (Crowdsourcing.org), an organization which conducts ongoing research into the growth of the crowdfunding market worldwide, the global crowdfunding industry was worth $4.8 billion in 2013, reportedly doubled in size in 2014, and have experienced similar growth levels in 2015, exceeding $10 billion. Reward- and loan-based crowdfunding (peer-to-peer lending) currently account for approximately 80% of this industry, but equity crowdfunding is expected to enlarge its market share in the short- to mid-term future. The passing of certain sections of the JOBS Act enabling general solicitation to non-accredited investors in the U.S. is expected to accelerate this trend. 

&#160;

In terms of the wider online funding industry &#8211; specifically peer-to-peer lending and equity crowdfunding &#8211; the IOSCO Research Department reports that this market was worth $6.4 billion in 2013, with the U.S., U.K. and China accounting for the vast majority of the market. According to the European Alternative Finance Benchmarking Survey 2014, online alternative finance, comprising all platform-based financial transactions outside traditional banking, grew across Europe from &#8364;1.21 billion in 2013 to &#8364;2.96 billion in 2014. Consisting of peer-to-peer lending, crowdfunding, microfinance and invoice trading, the European alternative finance industry grew by 144% during the course of 2014. The U.K. contributed &#8364;2.3 billion to this total (74.3%), and represents by far the largest market for alternative finance in Europe while the markets of France, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and Sweden are all comparable in size. 

&#160;

The overall European alternative industry has grown beyond &#8364;7b in 2015 if the market fundamentals remain sound and growth continues apace. In 2014, &#8364;201m of early-stage, growth and working capital funding was provided to European SMEs and start-ups by alternative finance platforms. The volume of online alternative business funding has been growing steadily at around 75% year on year, and the estimated number of start-ups and SMEs funded through online alternative finance platforms has been growing at an even faster average rate of 133% over the last three years to around 5,801 SMEs or start-ups in 2014. The significant growth in the European alternative finance market has been attributed to an increase in the number of institutional investors participating in alternative finance, particularly in the U.K. 

&#160;

Currently, market shares in online funding are relatively easy to acquire. Symbid anticipates a major market consolidation of the online funding industry in the next 2-3 years resulting in the emergence of &#8220;go-to&#8221; European platforms. 

&#160;

Research On The Crowdfunding Market Size In The European Union Vs. United States 

&#160;

Massolution has estimated that crowdfunding market funding volumes in 2013 were worth $5.1 billion worldwide, with the United States accounting for more than half of the total funds raised, at approximately $3.7 billion, and Europe as a whole accounting for approximately $1.3 billion. Total funds raised in other regions are expected to be in the range of $100 million. 

&#160;

We are currently not active in the US market. 80% of the total funding volume on our crowdfunding platform has originated from the Dutch home market, serving currently only Dutch companies. An additional 20% of our total platform funding volume is derived from investors in other countries. None of our platform funding has come from the United States. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

The Symbid Business Model 

&#160;

Our business is intended to facilitate the full funding process for SMEs from prospective creation through and including, the monitoring process. We expect that our business will lead to revenue generation from the following sources: 

&#160;

Create process related revenues 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Application fees &#8211; $385 for every entrepreneur applying for funding through our online funding network, with part of such fee being utilized to purchase advisory services from Credion in its capacity as a preferred supplier 

&#160;

Matchmaking related revenues 

&#160;

Public Funding 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Transaction fees &#8211; For every payment transaction to a Symbid wallet or investment in an investment proposition, a fee of 1% is charged to the investor (1.21% including VAT). 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Success fee &#8211; When reaching a funding target, 5% (exclusive of VAT) of the target capital is charged to the target company. 

&#160;

Private funding 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Placement fee &#8211; When reaching a funding target, a variable success fee is being charged to that target company. 

&#160;

Monitoring related revenues 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Monitoring fees - Each financier will pay us a monthly fee of $10 (exclusive of VAT) for one monitoring portal access. Entrepreneurs will be charged a fee of $330 (exclusive VAT) for a monitoring start package which includes three portal accesses for the period of one year. 

&#160;

Licensing related revenues 

&#160;

In addition to sublicensing the crowdfunding platform technology to Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A., Symbid intends to sublicense the platform technology in the forms discussed below to others in The Netherlands and to country partners as part of its internalization strategy. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

White label licenses - Symbid offers stand-alone and white label versions of its crowdfunding platform to partners, companies and other (educational) organizations. Stand-alone versions of the crowdfunding platform operate independently in a closed environment while white label versions are interconnected with the Symbid crowdfunding platform allowing for interaction with Symbid platform users. Target net revenue per partner is $10,000 for the set-up and a yearly license fee to cover maintenance costs. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Software licenses &#8211; Symbid offers exclusive licenses within a country to use the Symbid legal and technology infrastructure. Set-up fees are at a minimum of $27,000 and yearly license fees will be offered for a minimum of $10,000 per year; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Affiliate and Group licenses &#8211; Symbid offers owners of existing communities or groups a crowdfunding service so they do not require their own crowdfunding infrastructure. Prices range from $530 to $2,500 on a yearly basis. 

&#160;

Strategic Plan 

&#160;

Key success factors for a leading global business crowdfunding brand 

&#160;

The crowdfunding industry is currently developing from a niche industry to a global industry with billions of dollars of raised capital. Based on the more than 25 years of combined experience of Symbid&#8217;s management team in this emerging market as well as other relevant factors, Symbid believes that it will be able to capture a meaningful market position in this industry. The following aspects are key elements of Symbid&#8217;s strategic plan: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

To serve a large base of people on any given platform, it is critical that Symbid can operate as matchmaker, much like a dating service, with the highest degree of accessibility possible; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Serious/professional investors will require a quality infrastructure and best practices, Symbid has been developing these best practices since its inception; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

To offer an infrastructure which supports the financial model on a global scale and works for both entrepreneurs and investors; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Local responsiveness of Symbid is required in order to roll out the infrastructure on a global scale; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Partners, third-party analysts, researchers, potential suppliers and experts must be able to tap into and spread the content of the platform, much like is done for the public equity marketplace using social networks like Facebook and Twitter; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Standardized flows of information for both investors and entrepreneurs must be provided, to increase the efficiency of the transaction for all parties involved. 

&#160;

An important lesson learned from the combined 25 years of experience of our management team in this industry is &#8220;think global, act local.&#8221; Fundraising activities take place in a local eco-sphere. If a company wants to tap into the deal flow in a particular market, it will need to connect to the local networks in that market. However, with respect to infrastructure and general knowledge of the crowdfunding business, significant economies of scale can be reached if the company is active on a global scale. Symbid has, therefore, structured its organization as a global holding company with a connected network of subsidiary or affiliate country partners. 

&#160;

HOLDING LEVEL 

&#160; COUNTRY LEVEL 

&#160; &#160; &#160; Positioning strategy 

&#160; Country sales 

Product strategy 

&#160; HR and Partner management 

Partnering strategy 

&#160; Country marketing 

Acquisition strategy 

&#160; Customer support 

Financial planning 

&#160; Event management 

Execution plan 

&#160; Proposition management 

&#160;

The holding company level and the country level operations will have the responsibilities as described in the table above. These responsibilities are discussed in more detail below. 

&#160;

Symbid will work at the Holding Level jointly with future partners at the Country Level to evaluate the applicability of the Dutch cooperative structure model established in The Netherlands to a respective country&#8217;s regulatory environment, including the United States once SEC equity crowdfunding regulations are adopted. We expect that the Company&#8217;s experience with crowdfunding at the Holding Level combined with crowdfunding knowledge at the local level will support the &#8220;think global, act local&#8221; approach of Symbid; however, it is unlikely that the unique Dutch cooperative structure will comply with local crowdfunding rules and regulations without adapting to each country-specific set of crowdfunding regulations. As such, we expect that the combination of our crowdfunding experience at the Holding Level combined with Country Level input will result in a tailored solution to establish local crowdfunding &#8220;eco-spheres.&#8221; We currently do not have any country level subsidiaries or affiliates. 

&#160;

&#160;&#8220;Think global, act local&#8221; Partnering strategy 

&#160;

For a healthy eco-system of public growth financing for SME&#8217;s several actors are required: entrepreneurs, investors, financial advisors, incubators and analysts. Symbid offers an extensive partnering strategy geared towards having all actors on one platform (see figure below), to offer an optimal financing eco-system. Symbid chooses not to offer all services by itself but to work with outstanding partners, especially in the fields of: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Attracting deals and investors; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Business (e)-valuation and monitoring; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Offering value added services for the companies; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Offering value added services for the companies. 

&#160;

Country Partners 

&#160;

Symbid Country Partners will be responsible for creating the eco-system as shown in the visual above. Symbid has carefully tested and experimented with how to serve a market in an optimal way and this model has evolved from that process. The conditions for setting up a Country partnership are outlined as follows: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Access to a market with potentially large number of transactions; 

&#160;

&#160;&#9679; 

Legal model compliant with local regulations; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Access to partner network of financial advisors or accountants (top-30 in a country); 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Access to partnerships with incubators; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Access to partnerships with local business angel networks; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Local team available with experience in corporate finance and business financing. 

&#160;

Financial Advisors 

&#160;

Financial advisors play a pivotal role in structuring deals before engaging in the funding process. Symbid, or more specific its Country Partners, will enter into partnerships with several financial advisory companies (and/or accountancy firms) to connect them with the entrepreneurs signing up to the platform to structure those deals together with the entrepreneur. A perfect side benefit of educating this target group of financial advisors and accountants is that, once they are familiar with a specific service like Symbid&#8217;s, they have a much higher tendency to promote Symbid towards their clients, entrepreneurs as well as potential investors. 

&#160;

For Symbid, financial advisors are used to create a certain level of validation of the deal flow and additionally are perfect ambassadors towards their own clientele to promote the Symbid service. Symbid identifies them therefore as a separate actor on the platform. Symbid is planning currently to roll-out a training program for financial advisors and accounts. By then this group of actors can also become a direct revenue stream. 

&#160;

Affiliate Partners 

&#160;

Affiliate partners are partners with access to deal flow and/or investors, but who have no interest in engaging in an online crowdfunding service themselves from an operational point of view. By becoming an affiliate partner these parties have the option to refer entrepreneurs and/or investors to the Symbid platform and once these referred users generate fees on the Symbid platform, these fees are shared with the affiliate partner who referred them. 

&#160;

The affiliate program creates incentive for third parties to refer users to the Symbid platform because it results in a financial &#8220;cash back&#8221; fee per transaction. The affiliate program serves as a no-cure, no-pay marketing approach that dramatically lowers the upfront costs of marketing expenses. Affiliate partners usually can &#8216;tap into&#8217; an existing clientele or user base (online as well as offline) and since there is a financial incentive, they promote the Symbid platform within their network, saving Symbid the upfront costs of having to market its brand within these networks by itself. 

&#160;

The Determination not to Acquire Additional Shares in Gambitious B.V. or Equidam Holding B.V. 

&#160;

In accordance with the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, we were holding in escrow 8,000,000 shares of our common stock in connection with the proposed acquisitions (directly and/or through Symbid Holding B.V. or another subsidiary) of 100% ownership of Gambitious B.V. and Equidam Holding B.V. 3,000,000 of these escrow shares were assigned to the purchase of the balance of Equidam Holding B.V. and 5,000,000 of the escrow shares were assigned to the purchase of the balance of Gambitious B.V. We were also holding in escrow an additional 1,170,000 shares of our common stock in connection with the indirect minority interests we held in Gambitious B.V. and Equidam Holding .V. at the time of the Share Exchange with 900,000 of such shares being allocated to the interest held in Gambitious B.V. and 270,000 of such shares being allocated to the interest held in Equidam Holding B.V. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

In the event that we acquired Gambitious B.V. within the six month period following the Share Exchange closing date, the number of escrow shares that were being held for the Gambitious B.V. acquisition equal to the number of shares of our common stock to be issued as consideration for the purchase of the remaining interest in Gambitious B.V. were to be cancelled, and the remainder of the Gambitious B.V. escrow shares were to be distributed pro rata to the Symbid Holding B.V. pre-Share Exchange stockholders after such acquisition was completed. 

&#160;

In the event that we acquired Equidam Holding B.V. within the six month period following the Share Exchange closing date, the number of escrow shares that were being held for the Equidam Holding B.V. acquisition equal to the number of shares of our common stock to be issued as consideration for Equidam Holding B.V. were to be cancelled, and the remainder of the Equidam escrow shares were to be distributed pro rata to the Symbid Holding B.V. pre-Share Exchange stockholders after such acquisition was completed. 

&#160;

If either transaction was not completed within six months after the closing of the Share Exchange, the escrow shares allocated to that transaction were to be cancelled, and if both such acquisitions were not completed within six months after the closing of the Share Exchange, all of the 8,000,000 escrow shares were to be cancelled. 

&#160;

In February 2014, we completed a sale of interests in Gambitious Co&#246;peratie U.A. from Symbid B.V. to Sjoerd Geurts, a member of the management board of Gambitious B.V. and a shareholder of the Company. In May 2014, we sold additional interests in Gambitious Co&#246;peratie U.A. to Brian Grigby, an officer of Gambitious B.V. These sales resulted in our direct ownership in Gambitious Co&#246;peratie U.A. being reduced from 63% to 46% and our indirect interest in Gambitious B.V. being reduced from 18% to 13.8%., after the sale to Geurts, and the sale to Grigby resulted in a further reduction in the Company&#8217;s direct ownership in Gambitious Co&#246;peratie U.A. and indirect ownership in Gambitious B.V. to 42% and 12%, respectively. These sales were each completed at a price of EUR 1 (approximately $1.37). As consideration for the sale of these memberships, we received an option to license a niche-specific crowdfunding legal structure for the UK market that Gambitious had developed. Upon exercise of this option, we would have been required to pay for half of the costs incurred by Gambitious in the development of this legal structure, but as of today we have not called upon this option. The niche-specific crowdfunding legal structure optioned by us was specific to the video games industry. If we determined to exercise this option, we expected that we could utilize the licensed structure in countries outside of the Netherlands where we do not currently operate. Gambitious had made advancements in its own crowdfunding legal structure and, accordingly, the management of both we and Gambitious came to an agreement that we sell an agreed upon number of interests in Gambitious Co&#246;peratie U.A. to reflect the advancement of Gambitious as a stand-alone platform. Symbid B.V.&#8217;s initial investment in the membership interests in Gambitious Co&#246;peratie U.A. that it sold as set forth above totaled &#8364;9,000 (approximately $12,300), for a 63% membership interest in Gambitious Co&#246;peratie U.A., which percentage was diluted though subsequent financing rounds. On February 9, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Gambitious B.V. pursuant to which we transferred our remaining interests in Gambitious Co&#246;peratie U.A. to Gambitious Partners USA, LLC for &#8364;18,000 (approximately $ 20,300 and amended our license agreement with Gambitious B.V. The license agreement has been amended to a &#160; non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, fully paid-up, sublicenseable (including to parties who further wish to sublicense) and transferable right to use, alter, distribute, make, have made, copy or otherwise exploit the Software Gambitious has been using from Symbid&#8217;s software library, without limitation to field or form. 

&#160;

On June 6, 2014 we determined not to proceed with the purchase of additional shares of Gambitious B.V. As a consequence thereof, the 5,000,000 shares of our common stock allocated to the prospective purchase of additional shares of Gambitious B.V. delivered into escrow in connection with the December 6, 2013 Share Exchange Agreement with Symbid Holding B.V. and the shareholders of Symbid Holding B.V. were returned to us and cancelled. 600,000 of the shares of our common stock allocated to our 12% ownership interest in Gambitious B.V. were distributed to the shareholders of Symbid Holding B.V., subject to a 5% holdback to further secure the indemnification obligations of the Symbid Holding B.V. shareholders under the Share Exchange Agreement. The hold back shares are in the process of being released from escrow. In recognition of the February and May 2014 sales by us of shares in Gambitious B.V. to third parties reducing our indirect ownership interest in Gambitious B.V. from 18% to 12%. 300,000 shares of our common stock held in escrow allocated to the sold off interests were also returned to us and cancelled. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

On June 6, 2014 we also entered into an Extension Agreement with Equidam Holding B.V. pursuant to which we were granted the right, for an additional 3 months, through September 9, 2014, to negotiate the purchase of additional shares of Equidam Holding B.V. During the summer of 2014 Equidam attracted an additional round of funding from private investors, being able to self-sustain until the end of 2015. After intensive discussions between the management teams of Equidam and Symbid in September 2014 it has been decided a stand-alone strategy could be of best interest for both parties. As a consequence thereof, the 3,000,000 shares of our common stock allocated to the prospective purchase of additional shares of Equidam Holding B.V. delivered into escrow in connection with the December 6, 2013 Share Exchange Agreement with Symbid Holding, B.V. and the shareholders of Symbid Holding B.V. were returned to us and cancelled. 270,000 of the shares of our common stock allocated to our 9% ownership interest in Gambitious B.V. were distributed to the shareholders of Symbid Holding B.V., subject to a 5% holdback to further secure the indemnification obligations of the Symbid Holding, B.V. shareholders under the Share Exchange Agreement. The hold back shares are in the process of being released from escrow, 

&#160;

Equidam Holding B.V. is one of the first crowdfunding service providers worldwide. Organized as an in-house project of Symbid, Equidam Holding B.V. raised its seed funding on the Symbid crowdfunding platform and became a Symbid spin-out in early 2013. Started as an online valuation tool for small private companies, Equidam Holding B.V. now also offers monitoring services to investors on the Symbid platform. In addition to Equidam Holding B.V.&#8217;s relationship with Symbid, this company has entered partnerships with a number of European crowdfunding platforms to provide its services to these platforms as well. 

&#160;

Equidam Holding B.V. offers its crowdfunding services to both entrepreneurs and investors. Symbid has been offering the Equidam Holding B.V. products to its customers for almost a year. Based on this experience and Symbid&#8217;s belief that Equidam Holding B.V. offers added value to its crowdfunding activities relating to both entrepreneurs and investors, Symbid desires to effect a more sophisticated integration of the Equidam Holding B.V. service offering within the Symbid crowdfunding platform. By doing this, Symbid believes it can increase the added value of the Symbid crowdfunding platform to its customers. Symbid also believes that by integrating Equidam Holding B.V.&#8217;s services on its crowdfunding platform, it will add value to a combined international roll-out of the Equidam Holding B.V. and Symbid services. 

&#160;

History and Organizational Structure 

&#160;

Symbid B.V. was incorporated on March 29, 2011, as a privately held besloten vennootschap (private limited liability company) organized under the laws of The Netherlands. Through October 3, 2013, Symbid B.V. was our primary operating company managing all of our activities including our crowdfunding platform in The Netherlands. Until October 16, 2013, Symbid B.V. was the owner of our intellectual property (the &#8220;IP&#8221;). This entity was also the contractor for all material agreements related to the IP. Additionally, Symbid B.V nominates for appointment, by the Symbid Foundation board, the board of directors of Symbid Foundation. The management board of Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A is appointed by its members&#8217; council, by a simple majority vote. Symbid Foundation has the majority vote within the Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A members&#8217; council. Symbid B.V. also holds ownership interests in Equidam Holding B.V. (7%). 

&#160;

Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A., a limited liability cooperative, was incorporated in The Netherlands on April 6, 2011 specifically to facilitate Symbid&#8217;s Netherlands business. This entity is the contractor for all of Symbid&#8217;s crowdfunding related agreements with users, entrepreneurs and investors. Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. licenses and operates the Symbid crowdfunding IT-platform developed by Symbid B.V. and pays Symbid B.V. licensing fees for the use of this platform. As indicated above, the management board of Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A is appointed by its members&#8217; council, by simple majority vote. Symbid Foundation has the majority vote within the Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. members&#8217; council. 

&#160;

As a cooperative, Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. is an organization of members rather than stockholders. Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. has five classes of members: &#8220;A Members&#8221; who are equity investors, &#8220;B Members&#8221; who are entrepreneurs raising capital through equity investments, the &#8220;C Member&#8221; who is Symbid Foundation, the &#8220;D Members&#8221; who pledge funds to an entrepreneur and the &#8220;E Members&#8221; who are entrepreneurs raising capital through pledges. A Dutch cooperative has capital which is divided among its members in accordance with their investments in the cooperative, and all members hold cooperative membership certificates. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. incurs expenses on behalf of its members including, for example, legal expenses relating to infrastructure improvements, member events and accounting costs. In April 2012, Symbid Co&#246;peratie UA received a one-time subsidy from the Dutch government in the amount of $30,000 (&#8364; 22,996). Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. determined that it could recognize this subsidy as revenue earned over the course of its Kredietpaspoort project. Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. considered both IFRS and US GAAP guidance in its assessment for this accounting. In the absence of specific guidance surrounding government grants under US GAAP, Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. evaluated the government subsidy considering IAS 20 and FASB ASC 605, concluding that the ratable recognition of income related to the grant should be recognized over the period that it was earned. Apart from that one-time subsidy, Symbid Co&#246;peratie UA does not have any sources of income other than administrative and success fees which it assigns to Symbid B.V. by agreement. As such, it is expected that Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. will not generate any excess net profits. 

&#160;

Net profits of Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A., if any, are distributable, at the approval of the members&#8217; council, to the cooperative&#8217;s members in accordance with their investments on the Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. crowdfunding platform. Although Symbid B.V. has a variable economic interest in Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A., through its ability to appoint the board of Symbid Foundation which, in turn, holds the majority of the voting power within the members&#8217; council of Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. and, thus, the financial statements of Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. are consolidated with those of Symbid B.V., Symbid B.V. is not entitled to any profit distributions of Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. It is not expected, however, because of the license and management agreements between Symbid B.V. and Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A., that Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. will generate any distributable profits. 

&#160;

Symbid determined to operate its crowdfunding platform in The Netherlands through a cooperative structure for the following reasons: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Symbid believes that the vision of crowdfunding is one of cooperation and people making things happen together. This vision is best expressed through a cooperative structure under Dutch law that embraces a vision of members working together for each other; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

The cooperative structure provides the framework to more easily make our customers, entrepreneurs and investors, members of a community; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

The mechanics for adding new members to a Dutch cooperative enable us complete all Symbid related investment transactions over the internet, without any off-line interaction with investors. 

&#160;

Although Symbid B.V. determined that for purposes of maximizing its crowdfunding operations in The Netherlands as outlined above, it would operate through Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. and Symbid Foundation, we have not concluded that this organizational structure should be used for the roll out of the Symbid crowdfunding platform in other countries. 

&#160;

Symbid Foundation was incorporated in The Netherlands on April 5, 2011 specifically to facilitate Symbid&#8217;s business in The Netherlands. The members of the board of directors of Symbid Foundation are appointed by the Symbid Foundation board and nominated by Symbid B.V. Symbid Foundation has voting control within the member&#8217;s council of Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. as it controls five (5) votes out of a total of nine (9). The other four votes on the Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. members&#8217; counsel are controlled by the four other member groups (A,B,D and E) each voting separately as a group through their representatives. The member&#8217;s council of Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. appoints the management board of Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A., so, indirectly, through its majority vote on the members&#8217; council, the board of directors of Symbid Foundation is able to appoint the board of directors of Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. Symbid Foundation is not involved in any business or economic transactions and has no function other than to oversee the board of directors of Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. 

&#160;

Reorganization of Corporate Structure 

&#160;

Because of the December 6, 2013 Share Exchange and Symbid&#8217;s plans to enter various new markets, Symbid determined to restructure the legal organization of its business as described below. 

&#160;

Symbid Holding B.V. was incorporated on October 3, 2013, as a privately held besloten vennootschap (private limited liability company) organized under the laws of The Netherlands. Symbid Holding B.V. was organized to serve as the holding company for all of Symbid&#8217;s business activities in The Netherlands and in other countries. As such, on October 3, 2013, the holders of the capital shares of Symbid B.V. exchanged their shares for capital shares of Symbid Holding B.V. and, as a result, Symbid B.V. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Symbid Holding B.V. Symbid B.V. is now the Symbid operating entity for the Company&#8217;s business in The Netherlands. As such, Symbid B.V. will continue to hold the ownership interests in Gambitious B.V. and Equidam Holding B.V. Symbid expects to organize separate operating companies for its proposed activities in other countries. These entities will be organized as subsidiaries of Symbid Holding B.V. Although not yet commercially operational this legal structure has been realized with Symbid Holding BV becoming a majority shareholder in Symbid Germany GmbH and Symbid Italia SPA. FAC B.V. operates as of July 2014 as a 100% subsidiary of Symbid Holding B.V. In conjunction with this reorganization, Symbid&#8217;s IP, which includes all of the software relating to the Symbid crowdfunding internet platform, was transferred to a new entity organized in The Netherlands on October 3, 2013, Stichting Symbid IP Foundation. We do not have an ownership interest in Stichting Symbid IP Foundation but maintain management control over Stichting Symbid IP Foundation through our control of Stichting Symbid IP Foundation&#8217;s board of directors. See &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Our intellectual property is owned by Stichting Symbid IP Foundation, a Dutch entity that we do not own&#8221;. Pursuant to the organizational documents of Stichting Symbid IP Foundation, the board of directors of Stichting Symbid IP Foundation must be composed of at least two members, one of whom must always be Symbid B.V. or one of its directors and the other must always be Symbid Corp. or one of its directors. The size of the board of directors of Stichting Symbid IP Foundation is established by the board itself, giving Symbid B.V. and Symbid Corp. full control over the Stichting Symbid IP Foundation board. Stichting Symbid IP Foundation has granted a perpetual license in the IP to Symbid Holding B.V. which, in turn, has granted a perpetual, exclusive license in the IP to Symbid B.V. Symbid B.V. has sublicensed the IP to Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. With respect to future Symbid crowdfunding platform business projects in other countries, Symbid Holding B.V. will grant IP licenses to the new legal entities established for these business purposes. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. is the contractor for all of our crowdfunding business in The Netherlands. We do not own or have any interest in Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. is a variable interest entity (&#8220;VIE&#8221;) which we, through Symbid B.V., effectively control through corporate governance rather than through any other ownership. The majority of the voting power within the members counsel (which appoints the management board of Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A.) is held by Symbid Foundation, a Dutch foundation whose board of directors is appointed by Symbid B.V. Symbid Foundation was established specifically and solely to serve as a management control mechanism with respect to Symbid Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. through its ability to control the majority voting power of Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. members&#8217; counsel. Because we own no interest in Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A., we have no right to receive any distributions from Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. The revenues to us from Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. come from administrative, success and management fees paid to us by Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. Because of the corporate governance control structure, we consolidate the financial statements of Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. with our own. If we were to lose control of Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. through a loss of our majority vote on the members&#8217; counsel of Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A., we would not be able to continue to consolidate the financial results of Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. and this would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160;

Neither Symbid Corp., Symbid Holding B.V., Symbid B.V. nor any of their affiliates have any ownership interests in Stichting Symbid IP Foundation, Symbid Foundation or Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. 

&#160;

A schematic overview of our current corporate structure is set forth below. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The Competitive Environment 

&#160;

The crowdfunding industry has developed rapidly since 2000 when several non-governmental organizations and companies started raisings funds online. The concept of online fundraising was quickly adapted to various forms of collective funding over the internet, now all being labelled as crowdfunding. 

&#160;

There are several different forms of crowdfunding. The main categories are: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Donation-based crowdfunding: donations made online to a specific project or cause without the prospect of any return; 

&#160; &#160; &#9679; 

Pre-sales (reward-based) crowdfunding: donations made online to a specific project or cause with the prospect of a return in the form of a product or service, when the project is successful; 

&#160; &#160; &#9679; 

Debt/loan crowdfunding (peer-to-peer and peer-to-business lending): investments made online in a specific loan proposal (business as well as private) with the prospect of a return in the form of interest and repayment of the initial debt; 

&#160; &#160; &#9679; 

Equity crowdfunding: investments made online in specific investment proposals with the prospect of a return in the form of dividends and value growth. 

&#160; 

Globally, more than 3,000 crowdfunding platforms are currently active in the marketplace. However, the majority of these platforms are involved in donation- or reward-based (pre-sales) crowdfunding. The low barriers to entry in this sector allow many vendors to establish crowdfunding platforms, but, typically, their scope is limited to a specific geography or nice industry, such as books or movies. Research firm Massolution, in its &#8220;Crowdfunding Industry Report 2013,&#8221; estimated that the global market size of crowdfunding in 2012 was $2.7 billion. The same crowdfunding research firm, Massolution, estimated that the global crowdfunding industry was worth $4.8 billion in 2013, reportedly doubled in size in 2014, and have experienced similar growth levels in 2015, exceeding $10 billion. Many of the existing crowdfunding platforms struggle in this growth environment with respect to their ability to professionalize their systems and legal frameworks and otherwise manage their growth. Reward- and loan-based crowdfunding (e.g. peer-to-peer lending) currently account for approximately 80% of this industry, but equity crowdfunding is expected to rapidly enlarge its market share in the short- to mid-term future. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

The equity crowdfunding market is still in a relatively early stage of development in comparison to the other forms of crowdfunding due to regulatory and structural problems encountered when operating an equity crowdfunding platform in various countries. According to the Massolution &#8220;Crowdfunding Industry Report 2013,&#8221; the global equity crowdfunding market was worth just $116 million in sales volume. Although figures for the global equity crowdfunding industry in 2014 are not yet available, according to the European Alternative Finance Benchmarking Survey 2014, the European equity crowdfunding industry was worth $218 million in 2014, with the UK contributing $127 million to this total. Europe remains a key geography in the equity crowdfunding industry due to the continued unavailability of equity crowdfunding in the U.S. due to ongoing SEC discussions regarding the relevant titles of the JOBS Act. Currently the UK has the largest equity crowdfunding market. The two leading UK platforms, Seedrs and Crowdcube, currently account for more than all other European platforms combined according to their own funding volume totals. 

&#160;

The 28 countries of the European Union are a very long way from offering a homogeneous regulation environment for crowdfunding. This is particularly true of equity crowdfunding which touches on multiple heavily regulated areas of finance such as investment advice, securities trading, retail banking and corporate finance. Few European countries have, like France, issued new regulations that are specific to investment crowdfunding. Most have, like Germany and the UK, tried to fit crowdfunding into the existing legal framework of capital investment and granted exemptions such as a simplified prospectus. In the &#8216;Review of Crowdfunding Regulation&#8217; published at the end of 2014, the chairman of the European Crowdfunding Network, claimed that a harmonized single European market for crowdfunding &#8220; may even be further [away] than last year [in 2013] &#8221;. This is because while crowdfunding is rapidly emerging across Europe, growing 100% or 200% a year in leading markets such as France and the United Kingdom, entrepreneurs and finance regulators have pragmatically negotiated legal frameworks at the country level. Additionally, because non-accredited investors in the United States have been and are presently prohibited from investing through online equity crowdfunding platforms, rapid growth in the equity crowdfunding sector, particularly in the United States, has been handicapped. The signing of the JOBS Act in 2012 was expected to result in the ability of non-accredited investors in the United States to participate in equity crowdfunding, but this has been delayed by discussions over the exact nature of SEC regulations. 

&#160;

T he SEC has, as of October 30, 2015, adopted final regulations permitting private companies to sell and trade securities via crowdfunding under the mandate of the JOBS Act. The section of the JOBS Act enabling non-accredited investors to participate fully in the equity crowdfunding market - Title III - is expected to be implemented as of May 16, 2016. The full implementation of Title III of the JOBS Act is expected to have significant implications for U.S. start-ups &#38; non-accredited investors alike, essentially enabling citizens of the U.S. to invest in start-ups. This in turn is expected to result in rapid growth for the U.S. equity crowdfunding industry. Any future entry of Symbid into the U.S. equity crowdfunding market once Title III is implemented will have to comply with all SEC regulations as they have been adopted by the SEC. 

&#160;

The alternative finance industry in Europe grew by 144% to almost &#8364;3 billion in 2014, and has more than doubled in size in 2015. Across Europe, there are now over 300 platforms active in the alternative finance sector. The &#8220;equity gap&#8221; facing European SMEs is waiting to be filled by a centralized platform for alternative finance with standardized data protocols. If rejected for a bank loan, as 30% of early-stage SMEs were in the European Union in 2014, entrepreneurs can struggle to navigate the emerging alternative finance market. With each platform focusing on one type of finance, for example peer-to-peer lending or equity crowdfunding, a capital search is a costly and time-consuming process for entrepreneurs. The lack of standardized SME financial data, plus the sometimes limited financial skills of entrepreneurs, creates a mismatch between small business and investors. Furthermore, there are currently no platforms which offer both alternative financing and traditional financing options, such as bank loans. 

&#160;

Increasingly, entire industries are being concentrated into single online destinations &#8211; termed &#8216;go-to&#8217; platforms. Online platforms based on horizontal, peer-to-peer models continue to revolutionize the music, hospitality and personal transportation industries. The financial industry has remained particularly resilient to digital technologies and, as yet, not one go-to platform exists which provides small businesses with access to various types of funding, alternative and traditional. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Because we have developed products and services that serve various sectors of the alternative finance industry, we believe that we are in a good position to take advantage of the growth of the entire industry rather than simply relying on sales to one particular sector &#8211; such as crowdfunding. Additionally, because of the versatility of our proprietary products which have application outside the crowdfunding and alternative finance domain, we believe we will be able to address the needs of the online corporate funding industry as a whole, thus strengthening our competitive position. The alternative finance market is still emerging, but it is also maturing. we predict a shakedown of the alternative finance industry in the short- to mid-term future as the market consolidates and smaller platforms exit. However, we believe there still is plenty of unsatisfied demand due to the continued poor availability of bank finance. Banks are currently not lending enough money to small- and medium-sized businesses and they&#8217;re not offering high-growth investment opportunities to small retail investors. 

&#160;

We believe we are placed to take advantage of the large potential for alternative finance platforms, including equity crowdfunding, due to our readily adaptable fiscal-legal framework, the fact that we are already well-established as one of the leading European platforms, and our intention to offer multiple alternative finance products. 

&#160;

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of March 3, 2016 we had 25 employees involved through contractual relationships with the Company. Our contractual relationships with employees consist of management agreements, service agreements, employee agreements and internship agreements. We have never experienced a work stoppage and believe our relationship with our employees is good.

Description of Properties 

&#160;

Our principal executive offices are located at Marconistraat 16, 3029 AK Rotterdam, The Netherlands, where we occupy approximately 1,075 square feet (100 square meters). We have signed a two-year lease for this space effective as of January 1, 2014 under which we pay monthly rent of &#8364;1,700 (approximately US$1,900). &#160; After the expiration of the two-year lease agreement, we are c urrently leasing this property on a monthly basis. Also our offices in Amsterdam are being rented on a month-by-month basis for a monthly rent of &#8364;1,700 (approximately $1,900). 

&#160;

Regulatory Framework 

&#160;

During the development of the Symbid crowdfunding platform in 2010, we were in close contact with the Authority Financial Markets in The Netherlands (the &#8220;AFM&#8221;) to discuss the Symbid crowdfunding model, the structure of our crowdfunding platform and its relationship to the Dutch regulatory framework. In our correspondence with the AFM, we primarily focused on the equity based crowdfunding model rather than the pledge or donation based models which do not implicate securities law considerations. In an email correspondence to Symbid, the AFM acknowledged that, although it is Symbid&#8217;s responsibility to identify activities requiring government authorization, as described to the AFM by Symbid, the AFM saw, on the basis of the information provided, no indication that the crowdfunding activities of Symbid would require permission under the Dutch Act on Financial Supervision. Although we did not specifically address our partnering/affiliate programs in our correspondence with the AFM, it is our understanding and belief that the same AFM considerations would apply to these activities to the extent that they make use of Symbid&#8217;s legal structure and model. The activities of Symbid have not materially changed in comparison with the information provided to the AFM in 2010. During the expansion of our product offerings to include debt based crowdfunding, we have been in discussions with AFM regarding the classification of our activities. In agreement with the AFM, Symbid applied for an exemption for its activities under the Dutch financial regulatory framework at the AFM, which was provided in the second quarter of 2015. Additional changes in the regulatory framework are expected in the future whereby crowdfunding will become a regulated business and whereby we will continue to comply with these Dutch financial regulations. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Symbid&#8217;s restructuring in 2013 in which it established Symbid Holding B.V. as a holding company for its crowdfunding activities and transferred its intellectual property to Stichting Symbid IP Foundation did not have an impact on Symbid&#8217;s legal structure at the operating level. Symbid established its operational model in The Netherlands such that all crowdfunding activities would be conducted at the Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. level with management control exercised by Symbid Foundation. This operational structure was designed to function independently from the legal structure and changes in the ownership structure of Symbid B.V. or Symbid Holding B.V. Because of this operation versus ownership structure, Symbid believes that its corporate reorganization will have no impact on the application of the AFM&#8217;s considerations or other aspects of the Dutch regulatory framework. 

&#160;

Our crowdfunding platform encompasses other activities which, in The Netherlands, could require a license or specific regulatory compliance under certain circumstances. These activities relate to (i) the holding of redeemable funds and (ii) securities offerings to the public without a prospectus. 

&#160;

Redeemable funds &#8211; Our financial partner InterSolve (FEET EGI B.V.) holds a license from the Dutch Central Bank as an Electronic Money Institution, is supervised by the Authority Financial Markets (&#8220;AFM&#8221;) , being the Dutch equivalent of the SEC, and the Dutch Central Bank and is, therefore, allowed to redeem funds to the public. On the Symbid crowdfunding platform, investors can re-claim, i.e., redeem, their electronic money at any time prior to the funding target having been reached of a business idea to which they have allocated their electronic money. InterSolve will exchange upon request by such an investor the amount of electronic money being redeemed into scriptural money on the bank account of the investor. Symbid partners with InterSolve to ensure that Symbid cannot be deemed to hold redeemable funds of investors itself. Because an investor&#8217;s funds are held in an electronic wallet with Intersolve and released to a particular project only when that project actually funds, and any funds that an investor allocates to a project that the investor redeems prior to a project funding remain in that investor&#8217;s account (electronic wallet) with Intersolve, which, in effect, acts as an escrow agent for the investor&#8217;s funds and particular project fundings, Symbid does not record any success fee revenues on its books until a project funding actually closes and Symbid&#8217;s earned fees are transferred to it. As a result of this structure, any funds that may be redeemed by an investor prior to a project funding and returned to that investor&#8217;s electronic wallet do not appear, and are not reported, on the financial statements of Symbid. If, however, an investor decides to remove funds from his electronic wallet and return them to his personal bank account, effectively taking these funds out of the Symbid crowdfunding system, Symbid pays Intersolve a fee of approximately $16.50 (&#8364;15). 

&#160;

Offerings to the public without a prospectus &#8211; Under Dutch law, as long as the target capital raised for a particular business over a period of 12 consecutive months remains below &#8364;2.5 million (approximately $2.75 million), there is an exemption from the prospectus delivery requirements. Under the current regulations, a prospectus must be prepared and approved by the AFM for capital raises planned or expected to exceed the &#8364;2.5 million (approximately $2.75 million) within a 12 month period. Currently, none of the entrepreneurs raising capital on the Symbid crowdfunding platform is raising capital in excess of &#8364;2.5 million. If our entrepreneurs begin to raise capital amounts greater than the current AFM maximum limit or if that maximum is dropped to a lower amount, we will be required to comply with the AFM prospectus regulations for these offerings. 

&#160;

Separately, membership interests in a Dutch cooperative, if not freely tradable, are not considered securities under Dutch law. Symbid has taken the business decision to ensure that all membership interests in Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. are not freely tradable; thus Symbid Co&#246;peratie U.A. is not required to be licensed to sell securities under the Dutch Act on Financial Supervision 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Because of the considerations discussed above with Symbid&#8217;s operational activities being conducted in the Netherlands through a Dutch cooperative structure and with the partnering of Intersolve, Symbid itself is not deemed to be offering or selling securities to the public. 

&#160;

Regulatory Considerations Relating to the European Union 

&#160;

In the European Union (the &#8220;EU&#8221;), there are a number of EU wide directives that could apply to Symbid&#8217;s planned crowdfunding expansion initiative in a number of different ways. These directives include the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), the Prospectus Directive, the Payment Services Directive (PSD), the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directives (UCITS), the Alternative Investment Fund Manager&#8217;s Directive (AIFMD) and the Anti-Money laundering Directive. In addition, local regulations might apply in each country within the EU. In some European countries (e.g., Italy, France, UK and Spain) local crowdfunding specific regulations have not yet been implemented but are expected to be enacted in the near future. These new crowdfunding regulations might affect the roll-out of our operations in the EU in terms of our potential market reach, time to market, legal costs and business model. 

&#160;

The impact of the above listed EU directives and local regulations on the Company's proposed business in Europe is dependent on the legal structure (or structures) we adopt for the roll-out of our business in the various European countries. We are currently in the process of investigating potential legal structures for our crowdfunding roll out in the various EU countries. Since this process is in an early stage and the impact of the EU directives or local crowdfunding regulations may differ from country to country, we believe that it is too speculative at this time to provide a detailed description of the different directives applicable per country to our possible local business models, their potential impact on our business or the different legal structures we may adopt in the future. 

&#160;

Legal Proceedings 

&#160;

From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm business. 

&#160;

We are currently not aware of any pending legal proceedings to which we are a party or of which any of our property is the subject, nor are we aware of any such proceedings that are contemplated by any governmental authority.
