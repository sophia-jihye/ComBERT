History and Business 

&#160; 

National Bankshares, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;NBI&#8221;) is a financial holding company that was organized in 1986 under the laws of Virginia and is registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. It conducts most of its operations through its wholly-owned community bank subsidiary, the National Bank of Blacksburg (&#8220;NBB&#8221;). It also owns National Bankshares Financial Services, Inc. (&#8220;NBFS&#8221;), which does business as National Bankshares Insurance Services and National Bankshares Investment Services. 

&#160; 

The National Bank of Blacksburg 

&#160; 

The National Bank of Blacksburg, which does business as National Bank, was originally chartered in 1891 as the Bank of Blacksburg. Its state charter was converted to a national charter in 1922 and it became the National Bank of Blacksburg. In 2004, NBB purchased Community National Bank of Pulaski, Virginia. In May, 2006, Bank of Tazewell County, a Virginia bank which since 1996 had also been a wholly-owned subsidiary of NBI, was merged with and into NBB. 

NBB is community-oriented and offers a full range of retail and commercial banking services to individuals, businesses, non-profits and local governments from its headquarters in Blacksburg, Virginia and its twenty-five branch offices throughout southwest Virginia. NBB has telephone and internet banking and it operates twenty-five automated teller machines in its service area. 

The Bank focuses lending on small and mid-sized businesses and individuals. Loan types include commercial and agricultural, commercial real estate, construction for commercial and residential properties, residential real estate, home equity and various consumer loan products. Each loan category requires underwriting and documentation suited to unique characteristics and inherent risks. 

The Bank&#8217;s loan policy is updated and approved by the Board of Directors annually, and disseminated throughout the Bank to ensure consistent lending practices. The policy communicates the Company&#8217;s risk tolerance by prescribing underwriting guidelines and procedures, including approval limits and hierarchy, documentation standards, requirements for collateral and loan-to-value limits, debt coverage and overall credit-worthiness, and guarantor support. 

Of primary consideration is the repayment ability of the borrowers and (if secured) the collateral value in relation to the principal balance. Collateral lowers risk and may be used as a secondary source of repayment. The credit decision must be supported by documentation appropriate to the type of loan, including current financial information, income verification or cash flow analysis, tax returns, credit reports, collateral information, guarantor verification, title reports, appraisals (where appropriate), and other documents. A discussion of underwriting policies and procedures specific to the major loan products follows. 

Commercial Loans . Commercial and agricultural loans primarily finance equipment acquisition, expansion, working capital, and other general business purposes. Because these loans have a higher degree of risk, the Bank generally obtains collateral such as inventories, accounts receivables or equipment, and personal guarantees from the borrowing entity&#8217;s principal owners. The Bank&#8217;s policy limits lending to 60% of the appraised value for inventory and equipment and up to 70% for accounts receivables less than 90 days old. Credit decisions are based upon an assessment of the financial capacity of the applicant, including the primary borrower&#8217;s ability to repay within proposed terms, a risk assessment, financial strength of guarantors and adequacy of collateral. Credit agency reports of individual owners&#8217; credit history supplement the analysis. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans . Commercial mortgages and construction loans are offered to investors, developers and builders, primarily within the Bank&#8217;s market area in southwest Virginia. These loans are secured by first mortgages on real estate. The loan amount is generally limited to 80% of the collateral value, and is individually determined based on the property type, quality, location and financial strength of any guarantors. Commercial properties are predominantly non-residential in nature, and include retail centers, apartments, and industrial properties. 

Underwriting decisions are based upon an analysis of the economic viability of the collateral and creditworthiness of the borrower. The Bank obtains appraisals from qualified certified independent appraisers to establish the value of collateral properties. The property&#8217;s projected net cash flows compared to the debt service requirement (the &#8220;debt service coverage ratio&#8221; or &#8220;DSC&#8221; ratio) is required to be 110% or greater, and is computed after deduction for a vacancy factor and property expenses, as appropriate. Borrower cash flow may be supplemented by a personal guarantee from the principal(s) of the borrower, and guarantees from other parties. The Bank requires title insurance, fire, and extended coverage casualty insurance, and flood insurance, if appropriate, in order to protect the security interest in the underlying property. In addition, the Bank may employ stress testing techniques on higher balance loans to determine repayment ability in a changing rate environment before granting loan approval. 

Construction loans are underwritten against projected cash flows from rental income, business and/or personal income from an owner-occupant or the sale of the property to an end-user. Associated risks may be mitigated by requiring fixed-price construction contracts, performance and payment bonding, controlled disbursements, and pre-sale contracts or pre-lease agreements. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Consumer Real Estate Loans . The Bank offers a variety of first mortgage and junior lien loans secured by primary residences to individuals within our markets. Credit decisions are primarily based on loan-to-value (&#8220;LTV&#8221;) ratios, debt-to-income (&#8220;DTI&#8221;) ratios, liquidity, and net worth. Income and financial information is obtained from personal tax returns, personal financial statements and employment documentation. A maximum LTV ratio of 80% is generally required, although higher levels are permitted with mortgage insurance. The DTI ratio is limited to 43% of gross income. 

Consumer real estate mortgages may have fixed interest rates for the entire term of the loan or variable interest rates subject to change yearly after the first, third, or fifth year. Variable rates are based on the weekly average yield of United States Treasury Securities and are underwritten at fully-indexed rates. We do not offer interest-only consumer mortgage loans, sub-prime loans, or any variation on subprime lending including hybrid loans and payment option ARMs, or any product with negative amortization. Sub-prime loans involve extending credit to borrowers who exhibit characteristics indicating a significantly higher risk of default than traditional bank lending customers. Hybrid loans are loans that start out as a fixed rate mortgage but after a set number of years they automatically adjust to an adjustable rate mortgage. Payment option ARMs usually have adjustable rates, for which borrowers choose their monthly payment of either a full payment, interest only, or a minimum payment which may be lower than the payment required to reduce the balance of the loan in accordance with the originally underwritten amortization. 

Home equity loans are secured primarily by second mortgages on residential property. The underwriting policy for home equity loans generally permits aggregate (the total of all liens secured by the collateral property) borrowing availability up to 80% of the appraised value of the collateral. We offer both fixed rate and variable rate home equity loans, with variable rate loans underwritten at fully-indexed rates. Decisions are primarily based on LTV ratios, DTI ratios, liquidity, and credit history. We do not offer home equity loan products with reduced documentation. 

Automobile loans include loans secured by new or used automobiles. We originate automobile loans either on a direct basis or on an indirect basis through selected dealerships. We require borrowers to maintain collision insurance on automobiles securing consumer loans. Our procedures for underwriting automobile loans include an assessment of an applicant&#8217;s overall financial capacity, including credit history and the ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although an applicant&#8217;s creditworthiness is the primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral security to the proposed loan amount. 

Other Products and Services . Deposit products offered by the Bank include interest-bearing and non-interest bearing demand deposit accounts, money market deposit accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposit, health savings accounts and individual retirement accounts. Deposit accounts are offered to both individuals and commercial businesses. Merchant credit card services and business and consumer debit and credit cards are available. NBB offers other miscellaneous services normally provided by commercial banks, such as letters of credit, night depository, safe deposit boxes, travelers checks, utility payment services and automatic funds transfer. NBB conducts a general trust business that has wealth management, and trust and estate services for individual and business customers. 

At December 31, 2015, NBB had total assets of $1,197,804 and total deposits of $1,019,268. NBB&#8217;s net income for 2015 was $16,229, which produced a return on average assets of 1.41% and a return on average equity of 9.54%. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for NBB&#8217;s risk-based capital ratios. 

&#160; 

National Bankshares Financial Services, Inc. 

&#160; 

In 2001, National Bankshares Financial Services, Inc. was formed in Virginia as a wholly-owned subsidiary of NBI. NBFS offers non-deposit investment products and insurance products for sale to the public. NBFS works cooperatively with Infinex Investments, Inc. to provide investments and with Bankers Insurance, LLC for insurance products. NBFS does not significantly contribute to NBI&#8217;s net income.

Market Area 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s market area in southwest Virginia is made up of the counties of Montgomery, Giles, Pulaski, Tazewell, Wythe, Smyth and Washington. It includes the independent cities of Radford and Galax, and the portions of Carroll and Grayson Counties that are adjacent to Galax. The Company also serves those portions of Mercer County and McDowell County, West Virginia that are contiguous with Tazewell County, Virginia. Although largely rural, the market area is home to two major universities, Virginia Tech and Radford University, and to three community colleges. Virginia Tech, located in Blacksburg, Virginia, is the area&#8217;s largest employer and is the Commonwealth&#8217;s second largest university. A second state supported university, Radford University, is located nearby. State support for public colleges and universities, like Virginia Tech and Radford University, has been adversely affected by the recession and State budget considerations. In recent years, Virginia Tech&#8217;s Corporate Research Center has brought a number of technology related companies to Montgomery County. 

In addition to education, the market area has a diverse economic base, with manufacturing, agriculture, tourism, healthcare, retail and service industries all represented. Large manufacturing facilities in the region include Celanese Acetate, the largest employer in Giles County, and Volvo Heavy Trucks, the largest company in Pulaski County. Both of these firms have experienced cycles of hiring and layoffs within the past several years. Pulaski and Galax have in the past been centers for furniture manufacturing. However, this industry has been declining because of growing furniture imports and the loss of demand. Several furniture companies have gone out of business in the recent past. Tazewell County is largely dependent on the coal mining industry and on agriculture for its economic base. Coal production is a cyclical industry that was negatively affected by the economic decline. Montgomery County, Bluefield in Tazewell County and Abingdon in Washington County are regional retail centers and have facilities to provide basic health care for the region. 

NBI&#8217;s market area offers the advantages of a good quality of life, scenic beauty, moderate climate and historical and cultural attractions. The region has some recent success attracting retirees, particularly from the Northeast and urban northern Virginia. 

Because NBI&#8217;s market area is economically diverse and includes large public employers, it has historically avoided the most extreme effects of past economic downturns. If the economic recovery wavers or reverses, it is likely that unemployment will rise and that other economic indicators will negatively impact the Company&#39;s trade area. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The banking and financial services industry in NBI&#8217;s market area is highly competitive. The competitive business environment is a result of changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems and competition from other financial institutions as well as non-traditional financial services. NBB competes for loans and deposits with other commercial banks, credit unions, securities and brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, retailers, automobile companies and other nonbank financial service providers. Many of these competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization, have greater access to capital markets and offer a broader array of financial services than NBB. In order to compete, NBB relies upon a deep knowledge of its markets, a service-based business philosophy, personal relationships with customers, specialized services tailored to meet customers&#8217; needs and the convenience of office locations. In addition, the bank is generally competitive with other financial institutions in its market area with respect to interest rates paid on deposit accounts, interest rates charged on loans and other service charges on loans and deposit accounts. 

&#160; 

Organization and Employment 

&#160; 

NBI, NBB and NBFS are organized in a holding company/subsidiary structure. Functions that serve both subsidiaries, including audit, compliance, loan review and human resources, are at the holding company level, and fees are charged to the respective subsidiary for those services. 

At December 31, 2015, NBI employed 19 full time employees, NBB had 202 full time equivalent employees and NBFS had 4 full time equivalent employees. 

&#160; 

Regulation, Supervision and Government Policy 

&#160; 

NBI and NBB are subject to state and federal banking laws and regulations that provide for general regulatory oversight of all aspects of their operations. As a result of substantial regulatory burdens on banking, financial institutions like NBI and NBB are at a disadvantage to other competitors who are not as highly regulated, and NBI and NBB&#8217;s costs of doing business are accordingly higher. Legislative efforts to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis culminated in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act of 2010. This legislation, together with existing and planned regulations, has dramatically increased the regulatory burden on commercial banks. The burden falls disproportionately on community banks like NBB, which must devote a higher proportion of their human and other resources to compliance than do their larger competitors. The financial crisis has also heightened the examination focus by banking regulators, particularly on real estate related assets and commercial loans. In the current environment, the potential for additional laws and regulations that will impact the Company, as well as heightened examination standards with regard to asset quality, cannot be ruled out. The following is a brief summary of certain laws, rules and regulations that affect NBI and NBB. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

National Bankshares, Inc. 

&#160; 

NBI is a bank holding company qualified as a financial holding company under the Federal Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA), which is administered by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;). NBI is required to file an annual report with the Federal Reserve and may be required to furnish additional information pursuant to the BHCA. The Federal Reserve is authorized to examine NBI and its subsidiaries. With some limited exceptions, the BHCA requires a bank holding company to obtain prior approval from the Federal Reserve before acquiring or merging with a bank or before acquiring more than 5% of the voting shares of a bank unless it already controls a majority of shares. 

&#160; 

The Bank Holding Company Act. Under the BHCA, a bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in nonbanking activities unless the Federal Reserve has found those activities to be incidental to banking. Bank holding companies also may not acquire more than 5% of the voting shares of any company engaged in nonbanking activities. Amendments to the BHCA that were included in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (see below) permitted any bank holding company with bank subsidiaries that are well-capitalized, well-managed and which have a satisfactory or better rating under the Community Reinvestment Act (see below) to file an election with the Federal Reserve to become a financial holding company. A financial holding company may engage in any activity that is (i) financial in nature (ii) incidental to a financial activity or (iii) complementary to a financial activity. Financial activities include insurance underwriting, insurance agency activities, securities dealing and underwriting and providing financial, investment or economic advising services. NBI is a financial holding company that currently engages in insurance agency activities and providing financial, investment or economic advising services. 

&#160; 

The Virginia Banking Act. The Virginia Banking Act requires all Virginia bank holding companies to register with the Virginia State Corporation Commission (the &#8220;Commission&#8221;). NBI is required to report to the Commission with respect to financial condition, operations and management. The Commission may also make examinations of any bank holding company and its subsidiaries and must approve the acquisition of ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any Virginia bank or bank holding company. 

&#160; 

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (&#8220;GLBA&#8221;) permits significant combinations among different sectors of the financial services industry, allows for expansion of financial service activities by bank holding companies and offers financial privacy protections to consumers. GLBA preempts most state laws that prohibit financial holding companies from engaging in insurance activities. GLBA permits affiliations between banks and securities firms in the same holding company structure, and it permits financial holding companies to directly engage in a broad range of securities and merchant banking activities. 

&#160; 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (&#8220;SOX&#8221;) enacted major reforms of the federal securities laws intended to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures. It impacts all companies with securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including NBI. SOX creates increased responsibility for chief executive officers and chief financial officers with respect to the content of filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Section 404 of SOX and related Securities and Exchange Commission rules focused increased scrutiny by internal and external auditors on NBI&#8217;s systems of internal controls over financial reporting, which is designed to insure that those internal controls are effective in both design and operation. SOX sets out enhanced requirements for audit committees, including independence and expertise, and it includes stronger requirements for auditor independence and limits the types of non-audit services that auditors can provide. Finally, SOX contains additional and increased civil and criminal penalties for violations of securities laws. 

&#160; 

Capital and Related Requirements. The Federal Reserve has adopted risk-based capital guidelines that are applicable to NBI. The guidelines provide that the Company must maintain a minimum ratio of 8% of qualified total capital to risk-weighted assets (including certain off-balance sheet items, such as standby letters of credit) and a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6%. In addition, the Federal Reserve has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines of 4% for banks that meet certain specified criteria. The leverage ratio is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to total average assets, less intangibles. NBI is expected to be a source of capital strength for its subsidiary bank, and regulators can undertake a number of enforcement actions against NBI if its subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. NBI&#8217;s bank subsidiary is well capitalized and fully in compliance with capital guidelines. &#160;

On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve voted to adopt final Basel III capital rules for U.S. banking organizations. The final rules establish an integrated regulatory capital framework and will implement in the United States the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the final rule, minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations. Consistent with the international Basel framework, the final rule includes a new minimum ratio of common equity tier 1 capital (Tier I Common) to risk-weighted assets and a common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets that will apply to all supervised financial institutions. The rule also raises the minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and includes a minimum leverage ratio of 4% for all banking organizations. These new minimum capital ratios became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015 and will be fully phased-in on January 1, 2019. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

The final rule emphasizes common equity tier 1 capital, the most loss-absorbing form of capital, and implements strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments. The final rule also improves the methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity. Banks and regulators use risk weighting to assign different levels of risk to different classes of assets. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of the Basel III final rule on the Company&#8217;s regulatory capital ratios. 

Failure to meet statutorily mandated capital guidelines or more restrictive ratios separately established for a financial institution could subject NBB or the Company to a variety of enforcement remedies, including issuance of a capital directive, the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, a prohibition on accepting or renewing brokered deposits, limitations on the rates of interest that the institution may pay on its deposits and other restrictions on its business. As described above, significant additional restrictions can be imposed on NBB if it would fail to meet applicable capital requirements. 

&#160; 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law on July 21, 2010. Its wide ranging provisions affect all federal financial regulatory agencies and nearly every aspect of the American financial services industry. Among the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that directly impact the Company is the creation of an independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;), which has the ability to write rules for consumer protections governing all financial institutions. All consumer protection responsibility formerly handled by other banking regulators is consolidated in the CFPB. It oversees the enforcement of all federal laws intended to ensure fair access to credit. For smaller financial institutions such as NBI and NBB, the CFPB will coordinate its examination activities through their primary regulators. 

The Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions designed to reform mortgage lending, which includes the requirement of additional disclosures for consumer mortgages. The CFPB has begun implementing mortgage lending regulations to carry out its mandate. In addition, the Federal Reserve issued new rules, effective October 1, 2011, which had the effect of limiting the fees charged to merchants by credit card companies for debit card transactions. The Dodd-Frank Act also contains provisions that affect corporate governance and executive compensation. 

Although the Dodd-Frank Act provisions themselves are extensive, the ultimate impact on the Company of this massive legislation is unknown. The Act provides that several federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the CFPB and the Securities and Exchange Commission, shall issue regulations implementing major portions of the legislation, and this process is ongoing. 

&#160; 

Source of Strength. Federal Reserve policy has historically required bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. The Dodd-Frank Act codified this policy as a statutory requirement. Under this requirement, the Company is expected to commit resources to support NBB, including at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the event of a bank holding company&#39;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The National Bank of Blacksburg 

&#160; 

NBB is a national banking association incorporated under the laws of the United States, and the bank is subject to regulation and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;). NBB&#8217;s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) up to the limits of applicable law. The OCC, as the primary regulator, and the FDIC regulate and monitor all areas of NBB&#8217;s operation. These areas include adequacy of capitalization and loss reserves, loans, deposits, business practices related to the charging and payment of interest, investments, borrowings, payment of dividends, security devices and procedures, establishment of branches, corporate reorganizations and maintenance of books and records. NBB is required to maintain certain capital ratios. It must also prepare quarterly reports on its financial condition for the OCC and conduct an annual audit of its financial affairs. OCC requires NBB to adopt internal control structures and procedures designed to safeguard assets and monitor and reduce risk exposure. While appropriate for the safety and soundness of banks, these requirements add to overhead expense for NBB and other banks. 

&#160; 

The Community Reinvestment Act. NBB is subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;), which imposes an affirmative obligation on financial institutions to meet the credit needs of the communities they serve, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The OCC monitors NBB&#8217;s compliance with the CRA and assigns public ratings based upon the bank&#8217;s performance in meeting stated assessment goals. Unsatisfactory CRA ratings can result in restrictions on bank operations or expansion. NBB received a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; rating in its last CRA examination by the OCC. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act . In addition to other consumer privacy provisions, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (&#8220;GLBA&#8221;) restricts the use by financial institutions of customers&#8217; nonpublic personal information. At the inception of the customer relationship and annually thereafter, NBB is required to provide its customers with information regarding its policies and procedures with respect to handling of customers&#8217; nonpublic personal information. GLBA generally prohibits a financial institution from providing a customer&#8217;s nonpublic personal information to unaffiliated third parties without prior notice and approval by the customer. 

&#160; 

The USA Patriot Act. The USA Patriot Act (&#8220;Patriot Act&#8221;) facilitates the sharing of information among government entities and financial institutions to combat terrorism and money laundering. The Patriot Act imposes an obligation on NBB to establish and maintain anti-money laundering policies and procedures, including a customer identification program. The bank is also required to screen all customers against government lists of known or suspected terrorists. There is additional regulatory oversight to insure compliance with the Patriot Act. 

&#160; 

Consumer Laws and Regulations. There are a number of laws and regulations that regulate banks&#8217; consumer loan and deposit transactions. Among these are the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and the Service Members Civil Relief Act. NBB is required to comply with these laws and regulations in its dealings with customers. In addition, the CFPB has begun adopting rules regulating consumer mortgage lending pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. There are numerous disclosure and other compliance requirements associated with the consumer laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

Deposit Insurance. NBB has deposits that are insured by the FDIC. FDIC maintains a Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) that is funded by risk-based insurance premium assessments on insured depository institutions. Assessments are determined based upon several factors, including the level of regulatory capital and the results of regulatory examinations. FDIC may adjust assessments if the insured institution&#8217;s risk profile changes or if the size of the DIF declines in relation to the total amount of insured deposits. Beginning April 1, 2011, an institution&#39;s assessment base became consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity as defined by the FDIC. The FDIC has authority to impose (and has imposed during the recent financial crisis) special measures to boost the deposit insurance fund such as prepayments of assessments and additional special assessments. 

After giving primary regulators an opportunity to first take action, FDIC may initiate an enforcement action against any depository institution it determines is engaging in unsafe or unsound actions or which is in an unsound condition, and the FDIC may terminate that institution&#8217;s deposit insurance. NBB has no knowledge of any matter that would threaten its FDIC insurance coverage. 

&#160; 

Capital Requirements. The same capital requirements that are discussed above with relation to NBI are applied to NBB by the OCC. The OCC guidelines provide that banks experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions well above minimum levels, without reliance on intangible assets. In addition, implementation of the BASEL III requirements could increase required capital minimums as well as compliance costs due to their complexity. 

&#160; 

Limits on Dividend Payments. A significant portion of NBI&#8217;s income is derived from dividends paid by NBB. As a national bank, NBB may not pay dividends from its capital, and it may not pay dividends if the bank would become undercapitalized, as defined by regulation, after paying the dividend. Without prior OCC approval, NBB&#8217;s dividend payments in any calendar year are restricted to the bank&#8217;s retained net income for that year, as that term is defined by the laws and regulations, combined with retained net income from the preceding two years, less any required transfer to surplus. 

The OCC and FDIC have authority to limit dividends paid by NBB if the payments are determined to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Any payment of dividends that depletes the bank&#8217;s capital base could be deemed to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. 

&#160; 

Branching. As a national bank, NBB is required to comply with the state branch banking laws of Virginia, the state in which the bank is located. NBB must also have the prior approval of OCC to establish a branch or acquire an existing banking operation. Under Virginia law, NBB may open branch offices or acquire existing banks or bank branches anywhere in the state. Virginia law also permits banks domiciled in the state to establish a branch or to acquire an existing bank or branch in another state. The Dodd-Frank Act permits the OCC to approve applications by national banks like NBB to establish de novo branches in any state in which a bank located in that state is permitted to establish a branch. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Ability-to-Repay and Qualified Mortgage Rule. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB issued a final rule on January 10, 2013 (effective on January 10, 2014), amending Regulation Z as implemented by the Truth in Lending Act, requiring mortgage lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. Mortgage lenders are required to determine consumers&#8217; ability to repay in one of two ways. The first alternative requires the mortgage lender to consider the following eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision: (i) current or reasonably expected income or assets; (ii) current employment status; (iii) the monthly payment on the covered transaction; (iv) the monthly payment on any simultaneous loan; (v) the monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations; (vi) current debt obligations, alimony, and child support; (vii) the monthly debt-to-income ratio or residual income; and (viii) credit history. Alternatively, the mortgage lender can originate &#8220;qualified mortgages,&#8221; which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. In general, a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; is a mortgage loan without negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years. In addition, to be a qualified mortgage the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed 3% of the total loan amount. Qualified mortgages that are &#8220;higher-priced&#8221; (e.g. subprime loans) create a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay rules, while qualified mortgages that are not &#8220;higher-priced&#8221; (e.g. prime loans) are given a safe harbor of compliance. The Company is predominantly an originator of compliant qualified mortgages.

Monetary Policy 

&#160; 

The monetary and interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve, as well as general economic conditions, affect the business and earnings of NBI. NBB and other banks are particularly sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. The spread between the interest paid on deposits and that which is charged on loans is the most important component of the bank&#8217;s earnings. In addition, interest earned on investments held by NBI and NBB has a significant effect on earnings. As conditions change in the national and international economy and in the money markets, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s actions, particularly with regard to interest rates, can impact loan demand, deposit levels and earnings at NBB. It is not possible to accurately predict the effects on NBI of economic and interest rate changes. 

&#160; 

Other Legislative and Regulatory Concerns 

&#160; 

Particularly because of uncertain economic conditions and the current political environment, federal and state laws and regulations are regularly proposed that could affect the regulation of financial institutions. New regulations could add to the regulatory burden on banks and other financial service providers and increase the costs of compliance, or they could change the products that can be offered and the manner in which financial institutions do business. We cannot foresee how regulation of financial institutions may change in the future and how those changes might affect NBI.
