&#160; 

MARKETS 

&#160; 

Microwave Filter Company, Inc. (MFC) 

&#160; 

RF and Microwave - This market encompasses both commercial and military applications. Filters in defense applications are used for such purposes as air to ground communications, radar and land communications. In commercial areas, filters are used to protect such equipment as receivers, transmitters, transceivers and any other electronics used for signal processing. In addition to filters, this market is also served with MFC&#8217;s Ferrosorb product line. Ferrosorb is a microwave absorbing material available in sheets, loads and a variety of other shapes. The product is used to offer protection by shielding signals or absorbing selective bands. 

&#160; 

MFC&#8217;s RF/Microwave products are sold primarily to Original Equipment Manufacturers that serve the mobile radio, commercial communications and defense electronics markets. The Company continues to invest in production engineering and infrastructure development to penetrate OEM market segments as they become popular. MFC is concentrating its technical resources and product development efforts toward potential high volume customers as part of a concentrated effort to provide substantial long-term growth. The Company is also actively sourcing complimentary products to distribute to augment sales. 

&#160; 

Satellite - Microwave filters for removing interference are provided for commercial antennas. A variety of products are available that offer protection and or solutions to interference that affects the feedhorn, downconverter and receiver. An extensive offering of filters are also available for satellite services utilizing the higher KU and KA frequency bands. Management expects the demand for these types of filters to continue with the proliferation of earth stations world wide and increased sources of interference. 

&#160; 

Mobile Radio and Data Links - MFC provides filters to a variety of mobile radio services such as cellular telephone, two way radio and paging to eliminate interference in transmit or receive equipment. More recently there has been demand for filters and diplexers for broadband microwave applications for Voice Over Internet Protocol (&#8220;VOIP&#8221;) with the number of services increasing and ISP use. The advent of license exempt applications has increased the need for interference filtering. With the number of services increasing and our air waves becoming more congested, filters are increasingly important to many transmit operations. 

&#160; 

Cable Television (CATV) - The CATV marketplace continues to change as cable operators begin the process of migrating to the latest DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) standard, DOCSIS 3.1. 

&#160; 

DOCSIS 3.1 continues the evolution of digital CATV systems with the focus of improving spectrum efficiency and providing greater programming flexibility to benefit consumers. These changes move CATV systems from one that is channelized to one segmented into larger frequency blocks. The ultimate goal of DOCSIS 3.1 is to expand the operating frequency capabilities beyond 1700MHz. DOCSIS 3.1 will provide substantial increases in internet speed and allow for increased TV picture resolution; i.e., Ultra High Definition (UHD) or 4K TV and beyond. DOCSIS 3.1 allows CATV operators to remain competitive with their fiber optic counterparts. 

&#160; 

MFC primarily serves this market with standard and custom filters used at the headend to process signals and remove interference. A very popular application involves removing or re-routing TV channels to organize programming line ups in multi-dwelling facilities (i.e. hospitals, senior living facilities.) 

&#160; 

Since all cable operators initially receive substantial programming via satellite, products from our satellite market cross over into the cable television market. C-band satellite receive systems are prone to various types of terrestrial interference which are curable in many cases by applying MFC bandpass filters. 

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Broadcast &#8211; MFC continues to develop and expand its series of wireless diplexers which has accounted for an increase in Broadcast sales. Management expects this demand to remain steady over the foreseeable future. 

&#160; 

Due to analog to digital conversion within the TV (UHF/VHF) broadcast industry, Microwave Filter Company has developed new filter products to accommodate the wider bandwidths necessary for the digital transmission. In order to accommodate the wider digital TV signal bandwidths, customers have been forced to replace their existing (narrower bandwidth) analog filters with (wider bandwidth) digital filters. 

&#160; 

Another result of this analog to digital conversion was the elimination of the uppermost UHF channels (52-69) that operated between 698 - 806 MHz. Subsequently, part of this vacated frequency band was allocated for Public Safety communication use, while much of the remaining band has been auctioned off for Internet Service Provider (ISP) operations (e.g. - Verizon, AT&#38;T, etc.) Now referred to as the &#8220;700 MHz Band&#8221; - many of these new applications utilize newly developed MFC filter products. 

&#160; 

MFC also continues to serve other segments of the Broadcast industry such as FM radio, STL (TV Studio-to-Transmitter Links) and the BAS (Broadcast Auxiliary Service) band (formerly known as the ENG (Electronic News Gathering) band.) 

&#160; 

WORLD TRADE 

&#160; 

Management believes that international marketing is a route to the expansion of sales for MFC. Significant efforts have been made over the last few years to identify key international markets and to establish distributors with appropriate technical backgrounds to represent our products in those regions. The Company&#8217;s international sales increased $315,841 or 72.1% to $753,930 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 when compared to international sales of $438,089 during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. The increase in international sales can primarily be attributed to an increase in sales of the Company&#8217;s filters which suppress strong out-of-band interference caused by military and civilian radar systems and other sources. 

&#160; 

SUPPLIERS 

&#160; 

The Company depends on outside suppliers for raw materials, components and parts, and services. Although items are generally available from a number of suppliers, the Company purchases certain raw materials and components from a single supplier. If such a supplier should cease to supply an item, the Company believes that new sources could be found to provide the raw materials and components. However, manufacturing delays and added costs could result. The Company has not experienced significant delays of this nature in the past, but there can be no assurance that delays in delivery due to supply shortages will not occur in the future. Substantial periods of lead time for delivery of certain materials are sometimes experienced by the Company, making it necessary to inventory varied quantities of materials. 

&#160; 

PATENTS AND LICENSES 

&#160; 

The Company has no patents, trademarks, copyrights, licenses or franchises of material importance. 

&#160; 

SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS 

&#160; 

There are no significant seasonal fluctuations in the Company&#8217;s business. 

&#160; 

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS 

&#160; 

The Company is not dependent in any material respect on government contracts. 

&#160; 

SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS 

&#160; 

Sales to one customer represented approximately 28% of total sales for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 compared to approximately 33% of total sales for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. A loss of this customer or programs related to this customer could materially impact the Company.

&#160; 

BACKLOG 

&#160; 

At September 30, 2016, the Company&#8217;s total backlog of orders, which represents firm orders from customers, was $314,717 compared to $431,287 at September 30, 2015. The total Company backlog at September 30, 2016 is scheduled to ship during fiscal 2017. However, backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales. Accordingly, the Company does not believe that its backlog as of any particular date is representative of actual sales for any succeeding period. 

&#160; 

EMPLOYEES 

&#160; 

At September 30, 2016, the Company employed 37 full-time and 5 part-time employees.
