History 

The Company was formed by NRG as a Delaware corporation on December 20, 2012. On July 22, 2013, the Company closed the initial public offering of 22,511,250 shares of its Class A common stock at an offering price of $22.00 per share. In connection with the offering, the Company&#8217;s shares of Class A common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol &#8220;NYLD&#8221;. The net proceeds to the Company from the offering, after deducting underwriting discounts, were approximately $468 million, of which the Company used $395 million to purchase 19,011,250 NRG Yield LLC Class A units from NRG and $73 million to purchase 3,500,000 NRG Yield LLC Class A units directly from NRG Yield LLC. At the time of the offering, NRG owned 42,738,750 NRG Yield LLC Class B units. 

On July 29, 2014, the Company issued 12,075,000 &#32;shares of Class A common stock for net proceeds, after underwriting discount and expenses, of $630 million . The Company utilized the proceeds of the offering to acquire 12,075,000 &#32;additional Class A units of NRG Yield LLC. 

Effective May 14, 2015, the Company completed a stock split in connection with which each outstanding share of Class A common stock was split into one share of Class A common stock and one share of Class C common stock, and each outstanding share of Class B common stock was split into one share of Class B common stock and one share of Class D common stock. The stock split is referred to as the Recapitalization and all references to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the Recapitalization. Following the Recapitalization, the Company's Class A common stock continued trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the new ticker symbol "NYLD.A" and the Class C common stock began trading under the ticker symbol "NYLD". In addition, on June 29, 2015, the Company completed the issuance of 28,198,000 &#32;shares of Class C common stock for net proceeds of $599 million &#32;and utilized the proceeds of the offering to acquire 28,198,000 Class C units of NRG Yield LLC. 

NRG, through its holdings of Class B common stock and Class D common stock, has a 55.1% &#32;voting interest in the Company and receives distributions from NRG Yield LLC through its ownership of Class B units and Class D units. The holders of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class C common stock are entitled to dividends as declared and have 44.9% &#32;of the voting power in the Company. 

As of December 31, 2015 , NRG owned 42,738,750 &#32;NRG Yield LLC Class B units and 42,738,750 NRG Yield LLC Class D units and the Company owned 34,586,250 &#32;NRG Yield LLC Class A units and 62,784,250 NRG Yield LLC Class C units. As of December 31, 2015, the Company and NRG have 53.3% &#32;and 46.7% &#32;economic interests in NRG Yield LLC, respectively. The Company is the sole managing member of NRG Yield LLC and operates and controls all of its business and affairs and consolidates the financial results of NRG Yield LLC and its subsidiaries. NRG Yield LLC is a holding company for the companies that directly and indirectly own and operate the Company's business. As a result of the current ownership of the Class B common stock and Class D common stock, NRG continues at the present time to control the Company, and the Company in turn, as the sole managing member of NRG Yield LLC, controls NRG Yield LLC and its subsidiaries.

Business Strategy 

The Company's primary business strategy is to focus on the acquisition and ownership of assets with predictable, long-term cash flows in order that it may be able to increase the cash dividends of Class A and Class C common stock over time without compromising the ongoing stability of the business. The Company's plan for executing this strategy includes the following key components: 

Focus on contracted renewable energy and conventional generation and thermal infrastructure assets. The Company owns and operates utility scale and distributed renewable energy and natural gas-fired generation, thermal and other infrastructure assets with proven technologies, low operating risks and stable cash flows. The Company believes by focusing on this core asset class and leveraging its industry knowledge, it will maximize its strategic opportunities, be a leader in operational efficiency and maximize its overall financial performance. 

Growing the business through acquisitions of contracted operating assets. &#32;The Company believes that its base of operations and relationship with NRG provide a platform in the conventional and renewable power generation and thermal sectors for strategic growth through cash accretive and tax advantaged acquisitions complementary to its existing portfolio. In connection with its initial public offering, the Company entered into a Right of First Offer Agreement with NRG, which was amended and restated in connection with the Recapitalization, or as amended and restated, the ROFO Agreement. Under the ROFO Agreement, NRG has granted the Company and its affiliates a right of first offer on any proposed sale, transfer or other disposition of certain assets of NRG for a period of seven years from the completion of the Recapitalization. In addition to the assets described in the table below which reflects the remaining assets subject to sale, the ROFO Agreement also provides the Company with a right of first offer with respect to up to $250 million of equity in one or more residential or distributed solar generation portfolios developed by affiliates of NRG, together with the assets listed in the table below, the NRG ROFO Assets.

(f) &#32;&#32;Includes Bingham Lake, Eastridge, and Westridge projects. 

NRG is not obligated to sell the remaining NRG ROFO Assets to the Company and, if offered by NRG, the Company cannot be sure whether these assets will be offered on acceptable terms, or that the Company will choose to consummate such acquisitions. In addition, NRG may offer additional assets to the Company, as described in Item 7 &#8212; Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . The Company may also have opportunities to acquire other generation and thermal infrastructure assets from third parties where the Company believes its knowledge of the market and operating expertise provides it with a competitive advantage. 

Primary Focus on North America. The Company intends to primarily focus its investments in North America (including the unincorporated territories of the U.S.). The Company believes that industry fundamentals in North America present it with significant opportunity to acquire renewable, natural gas-fired generation and thermal infrastructure assets, without creating significant exposure to currency and sovereign risk. By primarily focusing its efforts on North America, the Company believes it will best leverage its regional knowledge of power markets, industry relationships and skill sets to maximize the performance of the Company. 

Maintain sound financial practices to grow the dividend. The Company intends to maintain a commitment to disciplined financial analysis and a balanced capital structure to enable it to increase its quarterly dividend over time and serve the long-term interests of its stockholders. The Company's financial practices include a risk and credit policy focused on transacting with credit-worthy counterparties; a financing policy, which focuses on seeking an optimal capital structure through various capital formation alternatives to minimize interest rate and refinancing risks, ensure stable long-term dividends and maximize value; and a dividend policy that is based on distributing a significant portion of CAFD each quarter that the Company receives from NRG Yield LLC, subject to available capital, market conditions, and compliance with associated laws, regulations and other contractual obligations. The Company intends to evaluate various alternatives for financing future acquisitions and refinancing of existing project-level debt, in each case, to reduce the cost of debt, extend maturities and maximize CAFD. The Company &#32; believes it has additional flexibility to seek alternative financing arrangements, including, but not limited to, debt financings at a holding company level. 

&#32;8 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Competition 

Power generation is a capital-intensive business with numerous and diverse industry participants. The Company competes on the basis of the location of its plants and on the basis of contract price and terms of individual project. Within the power industry, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identity of the companies with whom the Company competes with depending on the market. Competitors for energy supply are utilities, independent power producers and other providers of distributed generation. The Company also competes to acquire new projects with solar developers who retain solar power plant ownership, independent power producers, financial investors and other dividend, growth-oriented companies. Competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and regulation considered by federal, state and local legislatures and administrative agencies. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of acquiring, constructing and operating projects, and it could be difficult for the Company to adapt to and operate under such laws and regulations. 

The Company's thermal business has certain cost efficiencies that may form barriers to entry. Generally, there is only one district energy system in a given territory, for which the only competition comes from on-site systems. While the district energy system can usually make an effective case for the efficiency of its services, some building owners nonetheless may opt for on-site systems, either due to corporate policies regarding allocation of capital, unique situations where an on-site system might in fact prove more efficient, or because of previously committed capital in systems that are already on-site. Growth in existing district energy systems generally comes from new building construction or existing building conversions within the service territory of the district energy provider. 

Competitive Strengths 

Stable, high quality cash flows. The Company's facilities have a highly stable, predictable cash flow profile consisting of predominantly long-life electric generation assets that sell electricity under long-term fixed priced contracts or pursuant to regulated rates with investment grade and certain other credit-worthy counterparties. Additionally, the Company's facilities have minimal fuel risk. For the Company's five conventional assets, fuel is provided by the toll counterparty or the cost thereof is a pass-through cost under the CfD. Renewable facilities have no fuel costs, and most of the Company's thermal infrastructure assets have contractual or regulatory tariff mechanisms for fuel cost recovery. The offtake agreements for the Company's conventional and renewable generation facilities have a weighted-average remaining duration of approximately 17 &#32;years as of December 31, 2015 , based on CAFD, providing long-term cash flow stability. The Company's generation offtake agreements with counterparties for whom credit ratings are available have a weighted-average Moody&#8217;s rating of A3 &#32;based on rated capacity under contract. All of the Company's assets are in the U.S. and accordingly have no currency or repatriation risks. 

High quality, long-lived assets with low operating and capital requirements. &#32;The Company benefits from a portfolio of relatively newly-constructed assets, other than thermal infrastructure assets. The Company's assets are comprised of proven and reliable technologies, provided by leading original solar and wind equipment manufacturers such as General Electric, Siemens AG, SunPower Corporation, or SunPower, First Solar Inc., or First Solar, Vestas, Suzlon and Mitsubishi. Given the modern nature of the portfolio, which includes a substantial number of relatively low operating and maintenance cost solar and wind generation assets, the Company expects to achieve high fleet availability and expend modest maintenance-related capital expenditures. The Company estimates each of its solar and wind portfolios have weighted average remaining expected lives based on CAFD of approximately 20 years . Additionally, with the support of services provided by NRG, the Company expects to continue to implement the same rigorous preventative operating and management practices that NRG uses across its fleet of assets. In 2015 , NRG achieved a 0.71 &#32;OSHA recordable rate, which is within the top quartile plant operating performance for its entire fleet, based on applicable OSHA standards. 

Significant scale and diversity. The Company owns and operates a large and diverse portfolio of contracted electric generation and thermal infrastructure assets. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company's 4,435 &#32;net MW contracted generation portfolio benefits from significant diversification in terms of technology, fuel type, counterparty and geography. The Company's thermal business consists of twelve &#32;operations, seven &#32;of which are district energy centers that provide steam and chilled water to approximately 695 &#32;customers, and five &#32;of which provide generation. The Company believes its scale and access to best practices across the fleet improves its business development opportunities through enhanced industry relationships, reputation and understanding of regional power market dynamics. Furthermore, the Company's diversification reduces its operating risk profile and reliance on any single market. 

&#32;9 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Relationship with NRG. The Company believes its relationship with NRG, including NRG&#8217;s expressed intention to maintain a controlling interest in the Company, provides significant benefits, including management and operational expertise, and future growth opportunities. The Company's executive officers have considerable experience in owning and operating, as well as developing, acquiring and integrating, generation and thermal infrastructure assets: 

&#8226; NRG Management and Operational Expertise. The Company has access to the significant resources of NRG, the largest competitive power generator in the U.S., to support the operational, finance, legal, regulatory and environmental aspects, and growth strategy of its business. As such, the Company believes it avails itself of best-in-class resources, including management and operational expertise. 

&#8226; NRG Asset Development and Acquisition Track Record. NRG's development and strategic teams are focused on the development and acquisition of renewable and conventional generation assets. They have successfully helped grow NRG's power generation portfolio from 24,365 net MWs at the end of 2009 to 49,324 &#32;net MWs as of December 31, 2015 . 

&#8226; NRG Financing Experience. The Company believes NRG has demonstrated a successful track record of sourcing attractive low-cost, long duration capital to fund project development and acquisitions. The Company expects to realize significant benefits from NRG&#8217;s financing and structuring expertise as well as its relationships with financial institutions and other lenders. 

Environmentally well-positioned portfolio of assets. On a net capacity basis, the Company's portfolio of electric generation assets consists of 2,490 &#32;net MW of renewable generation capacity that are non-emitting sources of power generation. The Company's conventional assets consist of the dual fuel-fired GenConn assets as well as the Marsh Landing and Walnut Creek simple cycle natural gas-fired peaking generation facilities and the El Segundo combined cycle natural gas-fired peaking facility. The Company does not anticipate having to expend any significant capital expenditures in the foreseeable future to comply with current environmental regulations applicable to its generation assets. Taken as a whole, the Company believes its strategy will be a net beneficiary of current and potential environmental legislation and regulatory requirements that may serve as a catalyst for capacity retirements and improve market opportunities for environmentally well-positioned assets like the Company's assets once its current offtake agreements expire. 

Thermal infrastructure business has high entry costs. Significant capital has been invested to construct the Company's thermal infrastructure assets, serving as a barrier to entry in the markets in which such assets operate. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company's thermal gross property, plant, and equipment was approximately $452 million . The Company's thermal district energy centers are located in urban city areas, with the chilled water and steam delivery systems located underground. Constructing underground delivery systems in urban areas requires long lead times for permitting, rights of way and inspections and is costly. By contrast, the incremental cost to add new customers in existing markets is relatively low. Once thermal infrastructure is established, the Company believes it has the ability to retain customers over long periods of time and to compete effectively for additional business against stand-alone on-site heating and cooling generation facilities. Installation of stand-alone equipment can require significant modification to a building as well as significant space for equipment and funding for capital expenditures. The Company's system technologies often provide economies of scale in terms of fuel procurement, ability to switch between multiple types of fuel to generate thermal energy, and fuel conversion efficiency. The Company's top ten thermal customers, which make up approximately 7% &#32;of the Company's consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 , have had a relationship with the Company for an average of over 20 years. 

Segment Review 

The following table summarizes the Company's operating revenues, net income and assets by segment for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , as discussed in Item 15 &#8212; Note 12 , Segment Reporting , to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to that footnote for additional information about the Company's segments. In addition, refer to Item 2 &#8212; Properties , for information about the facilities in each of the Company's segments. All amounts have been recast to include the effect of the acquisitions of the Drop Down Assets, which were accounted for as transfers of entities under common control. The accounting guidance requires retrospective combination of the entities for all periods presented as if the combination has been in effect since the inception of common control. Accordingly, the Company prepared its consolidated financial statements to reflect the transfers as if they had taken place from the beginning of the financial statements period or from the date the entities were under common control (if later than the beginning of the financial statements period).

Government Incentives 

Government incentives can enhance the economics of the Company's generating assets and investments by providing, for example, loan guarantees, cash grants, favorable tax treatment, favorable depreciation rules, or other incentives. Certain recent government approvals have enhanced federal incentives for renewable generation &#8212; including through the extension of the wind power Production Tax Credit and the extension of the solar Investment Tax Credit as further described in Regulatory Developments &#32;and could incentivize the development of additional renewable energy projects that would fit within the Company&#8217;s asset portfolio. In addition, direct cash incentives may encourage additional renewable energy development by entities that cannot presently benefit from tax credits. 

Regulatory Matters 

As owners of power plants and participants in wholesale and thermal energy markets, certain of the Company's subsidiaries are subject to regulation by various federal and state government agencies. These agencies include FERC and the PUCT, as well as other public utility commissions in certain states where the Company's assets are located. Each of the Company's U.S. generating facilities qualifies as an EWG or QF. In addition, the Company is subject to the market rules, procedures and protocols of the various ISO and RTO markets in which it participates. Likewise, the Company must also comply with the mandatory reliability requirements imposed by NERC and the regional reliability entities in the regions where the Company operates. &#32;&#32; The Company's operations within the ERCOT footprint are not subject to rate regulation by FERC, as they are deemed to operate solely within the ERCOT market and not in interstate commerce. These operations are subject to regulation by PUCT. 

CFTC 

The CFTC, among other things, has regulatory oversight authority over the trading of swaps, futures and many commodities under the Commodity Exchange Act, or CEA. Since 2010, there have been a number of reforms to the regulation of the derivatives markets, both in the U.S. and internationally. These regulations, and any further changes thereto, or adoption of additional regulations, including any regulations relating to position limits on futures and other derivatives or margin for derivatives, could negatively impact the Company&#8217;s ability to hedge its portfolio in an efficient, cost-effective manner by, among other things, potentially decreasing liquidity in the forward commodity and derivatives markets or limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to utilize non-cash collateral for derivatives transactions. 

FERC 

FERC, among other things, regulates the transmission and the wholesale sale of electricity in interstate commerce under the authority of the FPA. The transmission of electric energy occurring wholly within ERCOT is not subject to FERC&#8217;s jurisdiction under Sections 203 or 205 of the FPA. Under existing regulations, FERC determines whether an entity owning a generation facility is an EWG, as defined in the PUHCA. FERC also determines whether a generation facility meets the ownership and technical criteria of a QF under the PURPA. Each of the Company&#8217;s non-ERCOT U.S. generating facilities qualifies as an EWG. 

The FPA gives FERC exclusive rate-making jurisdiction over the wholesale sale of electricity and transmission of electricity in interstate commerce of public utilities (as defined by the FPA). Under the FPA, FERC, with certain exceptions, regulates the owners of facilities used for the wholesale sale of electricity or transmission in interstate commerce as public utilities, and establishes market rules that are just and reasonable. 

&#32;11 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Public utilities are required to obtain FERC&#8217;s acceptance, pursuant to Section 205 of the FPA, of their rate schedules for the wholesale sale of electricity. All of the Company&#8217;s non-QF generating entities located outside of ERCOT make sales of electricity pursuant to market-based rates, as opposed to traditional cost-of-service regulated rates. Every three years FERC will conduct a review of the Company&#8217;s market based rates and potential market power on a regional basis. 

In accordance with the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC has approved the NERC as the national Energy Reliability Organization, or ERO. As the ERO, NERC is responsible for the development and enforcement of mandatory reliability standards for the wholesale electric power system. In addition to complying with NERC requirements, each NRG entity must comply with the requirements of the regional reliability entity for the region in which it is located. 

The PURPA was passed in 1978 in large part to promote increased energy efficiency and development of independent power producers. The PURPA created QFs to further both goals, and FERC is primarily charged with administering the PURPA as it applies to QFs. Certain QFs are exempt from regulation, either in whole or in part, under the FPA as public utilities. 

The PUHCA provides FERC with certain authority over and access to books and records of public utility holding companies not otherwise exempt by virtue of their ownership of EWGs, QFs, and Foreign Utility Companies. The Company is exempt from many of the accounting, record retention, and reporting requirements of the PUHCA. 

Regulatory Developments 

U.S. Supreme Court Agrees to Consider the Constitutionality of Maryland's Generator Contracting Programs &#32;&#8212; On October 19, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear challenges to one of two cases involving the rights of states to enter into long-term contracts for power generation facilities. The case involves the right of the Maryland Public Service Commission to award long-term power purchase contracts to a generation developer to encourage the construction of new generation capacity in Maryland. The constitutionality of the long-term contracts was challenged in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, which, in an October 24, 2013, decision, found that the contract violated the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution and was invalid. On June 30, 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the Maryland District Court's decision. A companion case alleging similar facts in New Jersey will be decided in accordance with the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision in the Maryland case. NRG filed a friend-of-the-court brief urging the Supreme Court to uphold the right of states to enter into long-term contracts, which play an important role in financing new generation resources. The Supreme Court heard oral argument on February 24, 2016, and the outcome of this litigation could have broad impacts on how states contract with new generation resources, as well as how such contracted resources interact with the wholesale markets. 

Solar ITC and Wind PTC Extensions &#32;&#8212; In December 2015, the U.S. Congress enacted an extension of the 30% solar ITC so that projects that begin construction in 2016 through 2019 will continue to qualify for the 30% ITC. Projects beginning construction in 2020 and 2021 will be eligible for the ITC at the rates of 26% and 22%, respectively. The same legislation also extended the 10-year wind PTC for wind projects that begin construction in years 2016 through 2019. Wind projects that begin construction in the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 are eligible for PTC at 80%, 60% and 40% of the statutory rate per kWh, respectively. The extension of the ITC and PTC could promote additional development of solar and wind energy resources. 

Environmental Matters 

The Company is subject to a wide range of environmental laws in the development, construction, ownership and operation of projects. These laws generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained before construction and during operation of facilities. The Company is also subject to laws regarding the protection of wildlife, including migratory birds, eagles and threatened and endangered species. Environmental laws have become increasingly stringent and the Company expects this trend to continue. 

In October 2015, the EPA promulgated a GHG emissions rule for existing fossil-fuel-fired electric generating units. The rule is called the Clean Power Plan, or CPP. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the CPP. The CPP faces numerous legal challenges that likely will take several years to resolve. If the CPP is eventually upheld, it may take several more years for the impacts of this rule to be clear as states would be required to develop and put in place plans to implement the rule to achieve state-specific goals. 

Customers 

The Company sells its electricity and environmental attributes, including RECs, primarily to local utilities under long-term, fixed-price PPAs. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , the Company derived approximately 43% &#32;of its consolidated revenue from Southern California Edison, or SCE, and approximately 17% &#32;of its consolidated revenue from Pacific Gas and Electric, or PG&#38;E.
