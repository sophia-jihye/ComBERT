Overview 

Inovio is a bio-pharmaceutical company which is developing active DNA immunotherapies and vaccines focused on treating and preventing cancers and infectious diseases. Our DNA-based immunotherapies, in combination with our proprietary electroporation delivery devices, are intended to generate robust immune responses, in particular T cells, in the body to fight target diseases. In 2014 we reported that in a controlled phase II clinical study we generated significant, functional antigen-specific T cells that correlated to clinically relevant efficacy against HPV-associated cervical precancer. This data was published in The Lancet &#32;in September 2015. We plan to launch a phase III study of this product in 2016 and are advancing multiple cancer clinical studies. 

Our novel SynCon &#174; &#32;immunotherapy design has shown the ability to help break the immune system&#8217;s tolerance of cancerous cells. Our SynCon &#174; &#32;product design approach is also intended to facilitate cross-strain protection against known as well as new unmatched strains of pathogens such as influenza. Given the recognized role of killer T cells in eliminating cancerous or infected cells from the body and our published phase II results, our scientists believe our active immunotherapies may play an important role in helping fight multiple cancers and infectious diseases. Human data to date have shown a favorable safety profile of our DNA immunotherapies delivered using electroporation. 

We have completed, current or planned clinical programs of our proprietary SynCon &#174; immunotherapies for HPV-caused pre-cancers and cancers (cervical, head and neck, anal), prostate cancer, breast/lung/pancreatic cancer, hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), HIV, influenza, Ebola, MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and Zika virus. 

Our corporate strategy is to advance and protect a differentiated immunotherapy platform and use its unique capabilities to design and develop an array of cancer and infectious disease products. We aim to advance products through to commercialization. We continue to leverage third party resources through collaborations and partnerships including product license agreements. Our partners and collaborators include MedImmune, LLC, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (&#8220;Roche&#8221;), University of Pennsylvania, GeneOne Life Science Inc., Drexel University, National Microbiology Laboratory of the Public Health Agency of Canada, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (&#8220;NIAID&#8221;), United States Military HIV Research Program (&#8220;USMHRP&#8221;), U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (&#8220;USAMRIID&#8221;), HIV Vaccines Trial Network (&#8220;HVTN&#8221;), and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (&#8220;DARPA&#8221;). 

Inovio&#8217;s Differentiated Immunotherapy Platform 

The idea of stimulating the immune system to prevent or treat infections and cancers has been and continues to be a compelling concept. In recent years immuno-oncology products have achieved tremendous momentum in the world of cancer. Today the opportunity for immune activating technologies with the potential to fight cancers and chronic infectious diseases has never appeared more promising, with notable technology advancements such as checkpoint inhibitors leading the way in oncology. Yet, while yielding promising results, in many respects the surface has been barely scratched. There remains a significant need and opportunity for further advancements. 

Our immunotherapy platform comprising our DNA-based immunotherapy and electroporation delivery technologies has an important fundamental capability with a multitude of possible disease/product opportunities. The basic goal of our platform is to enable in vivo (in the body) generation of useful immune components to achieve desired therapeutic and preventive outcomes. We have historically been primarily focused on in vivo generation of disease-specific antigens in the body in order to stimulate prophylactic or therapeutic immune responses. More recently we have embarked on a new application: in vivo generation of monoclonal antibodies to achieve preventive and therapeutic outcomes complementary to our antigen-generating immunotherapies. 

The essence of our platform is that we can genetically encode a DNA plasmid for an antigen or monoclonal antibody specific to a targeted disease. We can combine multiple such plasmids into a &#8220;product,&#8221; inject the plasmids into tissue of the body, use electroporation to facilitate significant cellular uptake of the plasmids, and then enhance the ability of the intracellular machinery that is intended to produce useful proteins for the functioning of the body to temporarily produce the target antigen or monoclonal antibody. An antigen produced in this manner will then induce the immune system to generate polyclonal antibodies or T cells with the ability to perform their preventive or therapeutic functions. Similarly, monoclonal antibodies generated in this manner can then also perform their intended functions. 

With our core technologies we have developed a rich pipeline of pre-clinical and clinical stage products that have generated, in vivo (in the body), best-in-class immune responses, in particular T cells fundamental to eliminating cancerous or infected cells. They are showing their potential to be used against potentially any targeted cancer or infectious disease. Our lead immunotherapy (for treating HPV-associated precancer) met its primary and secondary endpoints in a controlled phase II clinical study, achieving statistically significant and clinically relevant efficacy in association with robust T cell activation. This data was published in The Lancet &#32;in a paper entitled, &#8220;Safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of VGX-3100, a therapeutic synthetic DNA vaccine targeting human papillomavirus 16 and 18 E6 and E7 proteins for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2b trial.&#8221; These results were achieved without serious adverse events. The only statistically significant adverse event was injection site redness. (Our immunotherapies are non-live and non-replicating therefore they cannot cause the disease; compared to other technologies, our immunotherapies work most naturally with the immune system and within its controls to reduce or minimize the risk of unwanted inflammatory responses.) These results suggest significant market potential not only for our lead product but for our existing and emerging cancer products as well as the broad spectrum of infectious disease products that may be created based on our technology platform. 

The Next Generation of Cancer and Infectious Disease Treatment: Inovio's SynCon &#174; &#32;Immunotherapies 

Our SynCon immunotherapies are designed to treat an existing disease (therapeutic) or prevent a disease (prophylactic) by activating and magnifying an immune response to one or more disease-specific antigens (proteins associated with a cancer or infectious disease that the body will recognize as foreign or not normal). Without the quality control and manufacturing challenges and costs of specifically personalized medicines, we can direct the immune response directly in the patient&#8217;s own body to fight specific organisms or cells. We do this simply by introducing the genetic code for a target antigen(s) into tissue of the body that will serve as a temporary antigen production facility. 

Our immunotherapies consist of one or more DNA plasmids (circular string of DNA) encoding one or more selected antigens that are introduced into cells of humans or animals. Our approach uniquely enables dramatic uptake of the DNA plasmids by the cells in a local tissue area. After the DNA code for the targeted antigen(s) is introduced to cells, the cells&#8217; natural machinery for making their own proteins useful to the body temporarily produces the selected antigen(s) encoded by the DNA sequences delivered to the cell. The antigenic protein manufactured through this process is then presented to the immune system and triggers one or both of two arms of the immune system: the production of preventive antibodies, known as a humoral immune response, and/or the activation of therapeutic CD8+ T-cells, known as a cellular or cell-mediated immune response. These responses are then ready to neutralize or eliminate infectious agents (e.g. viruses, bacteria, and other microorganisms) or abnormal cells (e.g. malignant tumor or infected cells). T cells can be immediately &#8220;trafficked&#8221; to parts of the body where cells are displaying the target antigen. Memory cells are created for durable effects. 

Our SynCon &#174; &#32;DNA immunotherapies are designed to generate specific antibody and T cell responses. First we identify one or more antigens that we believe are the best targets to help direct the immune system toward a particular cancer or infectious disease. We then apply our SynCon &#174; &#32;design process, which employs the extensive data available from genomic databases. This SynCon &#174; &#32;design uses the genetic make-up of the selected antigen(s) from multiple variants of a cancer or strains of a virus. 

We synthetically create a new genetic sequence of the antigen that represents a consensus of the slightly different DNA from multiple variants or strains of the targeted antigen. We can create a differentiated SynCon variant to help the immune system better recognize a cancer self-antigen (a cell and antigen grown in the body), i.e. to &#8220;break tolerance.&#8221; Alternatively, we have proof of principle in human studies that we can generate immune responses with SynCon immunotherapies not matched to different strains of an infectious disease, e.g. influenza, creating more universal protective capabilities against unmatched strains of a circulating virus. These SynCon &#174; &#32;constructs may provide a solution to the genetic &#8220;shift&#8221; and &#8220;drift&#8221; 

that is typical of many infectious diseases. This new synthetically engineered sequence is similar to the originating sequences but does not match any. It does not exist in nature and is patentable. 

The SynCon sequence is inserted into a circular DNA plasmid. The plasmid is optimized at the DNA level for codon usage, improved mRNA stability, and provided with enhanced leader sequences for ribosome loading; it is optimized at the genetic level for high expression capability particularly in human cells. We believe these design capabilities allow us to better target appropriate immune system mechanisms and produce a higher level of the coded antigen to enhance the overall ability of the immunotherapy to induce the desired immune response. 

The plasmids are manufactured in a bacterial fermentation process using proven scalable technology. These DNA-based immunotherapies can be stable under normal environmental conditions for extended periods of time. 

Inovio&#8217;s immunotherapies are injected in a local area of selected tissue (muscle or skin) and then electroporated (see next section) to facilitate significant cellular uptake of the plasmid and expression (production) of the encoded DNA. The resulting immune response to the produced antigens results in significant production of antibodies or T cells. 

Published human data from three different SynCon &#174; &#32;DNA immunotherapies--two for treating HPV-caused pre-cancers and cancers as well as one for treating HIV infection--have generated best-in-class T cell responses in terms of magnitude, durability, and killing effect, providing evidence (demonstrated in three peer-reviewed clinical study publications) of their potential to provide preventive and therapeutic capabilities against cancers and infectious diseases. This best-in-class T cell generation has also been correlated to efficacy (as referenced above). 

Electroporation Delivery Technology 

Despite how compelling the idea of delivering DNA encoding an antigen has been, delivering the DNA or nucleic acids directly into a cell through the cell&#8217;s protective membrane has been a significant challenge to the broad field of DNA and RNA vaccines. Our immunotherapies are delivered into cells of the body in a small local area of tissue using our highly efficient, proprietary electroporation (EP) DNA delivery technology. EP uses brief, locally applied electric fields to create temporary and reversible permeability, or pores, in the cell membrane. Using this method increases the cellular uptake of the DNA plasmids by a thousand-fold or more compared to just delivering &#8220;naked DNA&#8221; alone. This extent of cellular uptake has proven to enable the best-in-class immune responses that we have reported, along with the efficacy results generated by these immune responses. 

Alternative delivery approaches based on the use of viruses and lipids are complex and expensive and have in the past created concerns regarding safety. Because the vector itself possesses many additional antigens specific to the vector it can attract unwanted immune responses against itself (believed to compromise such vectors&#8217; ability to deliver their DNA &#8220;payload&#8221; and provide protection). In contrast, DNA possesses no antigens of its own: the plasmid results in production of only the target antigen. 

We have published data showing superior immune responses generated by our SynCon &#174; &#32;immunotherapies delivered using our CELLECTRA &#174; &#32;electroporation technology compared to a leading viral vector (Adenovirus type 5) based approach. We have not seen any published data indicating the capability of alternative technologies focused on using genetic code to generate preventive or therapeutic antigens to exceed Inovio&#8217;s immune response data obtained to date, nor match the efficacy and immune responses data generated in our controlled phase II study based on in vivo production of such immune responses. 

We believe electroporation provides a relatively straightforward, cost effective method for delivering DNA and RNA into cells with high efficiency, minimal complications, and importantly the ability to enable what we believe to be clinically relevant levels of gene expression, immune responses, and efficacy.

Cancer Vaccines/Immunotherapies 

Previous Immune Therapy Successes Point to the Potential of Inovio&#8217;s Immunotherapy Approach 

In recent years there have been multiple technology advancements and product approvals that have highlighted the potential of immunotherapies to usher in a new era of cancer therapeutics. Monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) such as Herceptin &#174; &#32;and dendritic cell therapy Provenge &#174; &#32;for prostate cancer have had their varying degrees of success. Herceptin has been used to treat over 420,000 women (Genentech Inc., 2010). While a significant step forward, suitable monoclonal antibodies with desired characteristics have been difficult to design or identify and expensive to produce, and the technology does not lend itself to designing Mabs for many diseases. Dendritic or other cell-based therapy is a highly personalized medicine involving removing cells from the patient, modifying them, multiplying them, then returning them to the body. Besides the high cost and complex processes to manufacture the product, one of the glaring weaknesses of this approach is that it has not been shown to generate high levels of cancer-specific T cells. 

More recently, progress in the field of immune checkpoint inhibitors (CIs) has created further optimism regarding the potential for new immunotherapies against a spectrum of cancers. The immune system relies on a safeguard system of checkpoint mechanisms to prevent excessive or incorrectly directed immune responses. Many cancer cells have the ability to &#8220;hijack&#8221; these checkpoints and neutralize T cells sent by the immune system to eliminate them. Checkpoint inhibitors prevent cancer cells&#8217; ability to interfere with these checkpoints and enable T cells (especially CD8 killer T cells) to complete their appropriate and intended killing function against the cancer cell. Clinical studies by multiple companies of different checkpoint inhibitors have shown notable therapeutic impact against melanoma and other cancers - yet, with response rates in the 20 - 50% range, there remains an important opportunity to further improve these results. They have also been associated with certain undesirable side effects. Observations suggest that CIs may be less effective if there is not a high enough pre-existing level of antigen-specific CD8 T cells. Nevertheless, they provide significant encouragement that a strong T cell generating &#8220;active&#8221; immunotherapy used as a monotherapy or in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor may possess significant therapeutic potential. The first PD-1 CI therapies were approved for commercial use in 2014. 

More recently, a new category of immunotherapies called adoptive cell transfer, for example CAR-T technology, has provided further evidence of the merit of providing an enhanced T cell presence to fight cancer. CAR-T has achieved dramatic results in B cell cancers. Unfortunately it has also been associated with significant side effects. When this technology has been applied to solid tumors it has generated significant cytokine storms that have resulted in severe side effects including deaths. Moreover, adoptive cell transfer such as CAR-T, like dendritic cell therapy, involves removing T cells from a patient, modifying them to better target a cancer cell, multiplying the T cells, then returning them to the patient. This is a highly personalized approach and as such this very complex therapeutic product needs to be manufactured and released for each patient, leading to expensive manufacturing and increased supply chain complexity. Moreover, this technology is still in early clinical development. 

So while the last two decades have yielded promising technology advancements that better harness or activate capable killer T cells, there is significant untapped potential to develop &#8220;ideal&#8221; immunotherapies to fight cancers and infectious diseases. 

What is an &#8220;ideal&#8221; active immunotherapy? To state the obvious, we want products that are effective, efficient, and safe. More specifically, we want immunotherapies that: 

&#8226; 

Target disease-specific antigens (i.e. proteins unique to a cancer or infectious disease) 

&#8226; 

Do not depend upon being patient-specific and personalized (why remove from, modify, and reintroduce cells to a patient if you can do the most important work in the patient?) 

&#8226; 

Activate functional &#32; killer T cells with the necessary killing tools (e.g. granzyme and perforin) 

&#8226; 

Generate robust T cell responses (e.g. a significant number of T cells) that are persistent and durable over time (memory response) 

&#8226; 

Do not induce unwanted immune responses 

&#8226; 

Do not induce toxic inflammatory responses 

&#8226; 

Are capable of &#8220;breaking tolerance&#8221; of cancer cells grown in the body. 

Our phase II data (discussed under HPV Immunotherapy-VGX-3100) show we are achieving these ideal characteristics with our active immunotherapy approach to activating highly capable, antigen-targeted T cells in vivo (in the body) and we are advancing a growing pipeline of pre-clinical and clinical immunotherapies products. 

HPV Immunotherapy-VGX-3100 

&#160; Late Stage Cervical Dysplasia (CIN 2/3) 

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a causative agent responsible for cervical pre-cancers (cervical dysplasia), cervical cancer, other anogenital cancers, and one of the most rapidly growing cancers in men - head &#38; neck cancer. At any given time, approximately 11% of the world&#8217;s population is infected with HPV. 

HPV is the most common viral infection of the reproductive tract and is recognized as the major cause of cervical cancers. Almost 300 million women globally are estimated to be infected with HPV, with another 30 million additional cases that have progressed to the pre-cancerous stage. Every year over 500,000 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed world-wide and approximately half of these women die. Virtually all cases are linked with persistent infection with HPV. Challenges with acceptance, accessibility, and compliance of preventive vaccines have resulted in only a third of young women being vaccinated in the US, and even less in other countries around the world. 

While roughly 90% of HPV infections are cleared by the body on its own (i.e. by the person&#8217;s immune system), persistent HPV infection can lead to high grade cervical dysplasia (CIN 3) and, if untreated, eventually invasive cervical cancer. Researchers have estimated the global prevalence of clinically pre-cancerous HPV infections at between 28 and 40 

million. HPV 16/18 are the two most prevalent high-risk types of HPV worldwide, causing the vast majority of HPV-related cancers. HPV 16/18 are found in 52% of all high grade pre-cancerous cervical lesions and 70% of cervical cancers. 

There is an annual incidence rate of CIN 1 caused by HPV types 16 and 18 of 1.4M in the US and 1.3M in the top 5 European countries. There is an annual incidence rate of CIN 2/3 caused by HPV types 16 and 18 of 270.8K in the US and 267.4K in the top 5 European countries. These represent a significant market opportunity. CIN 1 has no treatment. CIN 2/3 is served only by an invasive surgical procedure. 

There are currently two FDA approved preventive vaccines, Gardasil &#174; &#32;and Cervarix &#174; , that protect against HPV types 16 and 18, as well as types 6 and 11(Gardasil). Preventive HPV vaccines cannot treat or protect those already infected with HPV, which is a large population. In addition, not all girls and women eligible to be vaccinated are receiving these vaccines. In 2013, a US national survey found that 57% of girls aged 13-17 years had received at least one dose of the HPV vaccine series, but only 38% had received all 3 doses in the series. Currently there is no viable immunotherapy or drug to fight established HPV infection or treat cervical dysplasia and/or cancer caused by HPV. 

Current treatment options for cervical dysplasia are unappealing. The &#8220;watch-and-wait&#8221; process associated with low grade dysplasia (CIN 1) is a stressful approach. The only available treatment option for high grade cervical dysplasia (CIN 2/3) is surgery, which involves ablating or cutting a women&#8217;s cervix to remove the pre-cancerous lesions. While surgical procedures are generally effective in removing lesions, they can lead to cervical scarring and longer-term reproductive risks such as pre-term birth, miscarriage, and infertility. Anticipation of these procedures produces significant anxiety for patients, despite their doctor&#8217;s reassurances, and full recovery from surgery can take up to several weeks. Because surgery does not clear the underlying HPV infection, pre-cancer lesions can recur as a result of persistent infection or incomplete removal of the lesion during surgery. 

Inovio's VGX-3100 is an immunotherapy designed to significantly increase immune responses (humoral and cell mediated) against the E6 and E7 antigens of HPV types 16 and 18 that are present in both pre-cancerous and cancerous cells transformed by these HPV types. E6 and E7 are oncogenes that play an integral role in transforming HPV-infected cells into pre-cancerous and cancerous cells. The goal of the immunotherapy is to stimulate the body's immune system to mount a killer T cell response strong enough to cause the killing of cells producing the E6/E7 protein. The potential of such an immunotherapy would be to treat pre-cancerous dysplasias as well as cancers caused by these HPV types. 

Phase I Study Results 

We completed a phase I study of our cervical precancer immunotherapy (VGX-3100) in 2010. This dose escalation study tested the safety and immunogenicity of VGX-3100 in women previously treated for moderate or severe cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/3), a high grade premalignant lesion that is a precursor to cervical cancer. The trial enrolled patients in three cohorts of six subjects each with VGX-3100 doses of 0.6 mg (0.3 mg each of two DNA plasmids), 2.0 mg, and 6.0 mg. Each subject was dosed at months 0, 1 and 3. 

In September 2010, we presented top-line data showing achievement of best-in-class immune responses in this dose escalation study. Data from the trial included: 

&#8226; 

Antigen-specific, dose-related T cell responses across the three dose groups; 

&#8226; 

Strong antigen-specific antibody responses in all three dose groups; 

&#8226; 

VGX-3100 delivered using Inovio&#8217;s proprietary CELLECTRA &#174; &#32;intramuscular electroporation delivery device was generally safe and well tolerated at all dose levels; and 

&#8226; 

No immunotherapy-related serious adverse events (SAEs). Reported adverse events and injection site reactions were mild to moderate and required no treatment. 

Immunological analyses of blood samples collected before and after treatment indicate that antigen-specific immune responses were induced against the target proteins produced by Inovio's immunotherapy. We assessed the cellular immune responses by different analytical assays that measure the production of antigen specific T cells as well as their ability to kill in an antigen specific manner. Overall, 17/18 (94%) patients, including 6/6 (100%) of the high dose group, demonstrated vaccine induced antigen (E6 and E7 proteins for HPV types 16 and 18) specific T cell responses. 

In July 2011 we reported data demonstrating long-term durability of T cell immune responses of up to two years (at the latest time measured) in 7 of 8 evaluated patients following a fourth vaccination of VGX-3100. 

In October 2012 we reported that the immune responses generated in this study displayed a powerful killing effect on cells changed by HPV into precancerous dysplasias. These results appeared in the peer-reviewed journal, Science-Translational Medicine , in an article entitled, "Immunotherapy against HPV 16/18 generates potent Th1 and cytotoxic cellular immune responses." In this study, 91% of patients who developed T cell responses showed the presence of CD8 T cells capable of the desired killing activity. Direct killing by CTLs was observed in all immunized subjects (6 of 6) in the 6 mg cohort. 

Antibody responses to E6 and E7 antigens were also measured. Specific antibody responses to tumor antigens can function as an important surrogate potency marker for determining the immunogenicity (immune response characteristics) of an immunotherapy, i.e. its ability to induce an immune response. Antibodies were generated against all four antigens, as tested by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Overall, 100% of the study participants (18 of 18) reported antibody positivity to at least two immunotherapy antigens, and 94% (17 of 18) reported positivity to three antigens; 56% (10 of 18) were positive to all four antigens. 

Phase II &#32; Study Results 

Based on the successful results from our phase I study, in March 2011 we initiated a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase II study of VGX-3100 delivered using our CELLECTRA &#174; &#32;intramuscular electroporation device in women with HPV type 16 or 18 and diagnosed with, but not yet treated for, high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/3). The women in the study received either 6 mg of VGX-3100 (the highest dose used in our phase I study) or a placebo using the CELLECTRA &#174; &#32;in vivo electroporation device at months 0, 1, and 3. The study assessed efficacy by measuring regression of cervical lesions from CIN 2/3 to CIN 1 or normal in the treated versus control subjects. Immunological responses were also measured in this clinical study to assess the ability of this therapy to generate strong T cell responses in a larger, controlled study. Safety was also assessed (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01304524). 

In July 2014 Inovio released top line efficacy data from this phase II clinical trial (HPV-003) for VGX-3100. The primary endpoint, histologic regression, was evaluated 36 weeks after the first treatment. In the per protocol analysis of this three-immunization regimen, CIN2/3 resolved to CIN1 or no disease in 53 of 107 (49.5%) women treated with VGX-3100 compared to 11 of 36 (30.6%) who received placebo. This difference was statistically significant (p=0.017). Intent to treat results were also statistically significant. 

There was also a high level of complete clearance of CIN 2/3. In a post-hoc analysis, CIN 2/3 resolved to no disease in 43 of 107 (40.2%) women treated with VGX-3100 compared to 6 of 36 (16.7%) who received placebo (p=0.006). 

This trial also demonstrated virological clearance of HPV 16 or 18 from the cervix in conjunction with histopathological regression of cervical dysplasia to CIN1 or no disease, a secondary endpoint of the trial, in 43 of 107 (40.2%) VGX-3100 recipients compared to 5 of 35 (14.3%) placebo recipients (p=0.001). This is an important outcome as persistence of the virus is associated with recurrence of the disease. 

In September 2015 this data was published in The Lancet &#32;in a paper entitled, &#8220;Safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of VGX-3100, a therapeutic synthetic DNA vaccine targeting human papillomavirus 16 and 18 E6 and E7 proteins for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2b trial.&#8221; 

This paper reported further details regarding the characteristics of T cells generated and their association with efficacy outcomes. Analyses of patient immune responses showed that overall antigen-specific T cell levels in women treated with VGX-3100 were greater than those treated by placebo at all observation periods. At week 14, levels of CD8 T cells specific to the E6 and E7 HPV antigens in women treated with VGX-3100 were ten times greater than those in the placebo group. This response increased with each of the three immunizations, then declined modestly to a sustained and durable level of T cells (memory T cells) measured through 36 weeks (24 weeks post-treatment). 

Patients who regressed their lesions had higher frequencies of HPV-specific CD8+T cells which co-expressed key molecules important in T cell killing cascade and directly correlated with clinical efficacy. Specifically, we determined that higher levels of CD8+ killer T cells which co-expressed checkpoint molecule CD137 on their surface as well as the cytolytic protein perforin could be a predictive tool for efficacy. As a strong activation marker for CD8+ T cells, stimulation through CD137 has been shown in some systems to confer resistance of CD8+ T cells to the suppressive activity of regulatory T cells and its presence can identify tumor reactive T cells. Perforin is a pore-forming protein deployed by killer T cells to bore holes into the target cell's plasma membrane and destroy the cell. In fact, the difference in frequencies of CD8+ cells expressing CD137 and perforin was greatest in patients who had both regressed their lesions and cleared HPV compared to patients who did not. 

This is the first publication to our knowledge that demonstrates the correlation of antigen-specific CD8 T cells generated in vivo directly to clinical efficacy. Inovio has successfully identified several key biomarkers of killer T cells which can be used to predict the clinical efficacy of VGX-3100 as well as other immunotherapies in future clinical studies. 

Importantly, this study highlights the ability of a DNA-based immunotherapy to be locally administered in tissue distant from the diseased tissue target, generate robust functional CD8+ killer T cells, traffic those T cells to the diseased tissue, infiltrate a diseased cells displaying the target antigen, and facilitate the elimination of these cells both in &#8220;healthy&#8221; tissue and in diseased tissue (a lesion) with a statistically significant, clinically relevant outcome. These results have significant implications in displaying the broad therapeutic and preventive potential of Inovio&#8217;s existing and future cancer and infectious disease products. 

Preparation and launch of VGX-3100 registration phase III study 

Based on the phase II results we have stated our intention to advance VGX-3100 into a phase III study in 2016. Following is an update on the steps we are taking toward launching this clinical study. 

We are compiling and analyzing follow-up data from the study (week 88) which extends a full 52 weeks after the primary endpoint visits that were reached in the spring of 2014. We intend to obtain alignment with the FDA and various global regulatory agencies on the details of the pivotal phase III program to support an indication in CIN2/3. 

In preparation for pivotal phase III development and commercialization, we have scaled up manufacturing for both our VGX-3100 product and our proprietary electroporation device to support higher volume production requirements associated with commercial use while continuing to meet the highest quality assurance standards, to which we already adhere. We have already identified highly qualified manufacturing partners and are currently working with them to establish manufacturing for phase III and beyond. 

We have conducted additional market research with physicians and patients that have further characterized the unmet medical needs relating to the treatment of high grade cervical dysplasia (CIN 2/3). These include a preference for a non-invasive, non-surgical procedure for removing cervical lesions; a treatment that can clear HPV, the cause of the pre-cancer, throughout the body and not just in the limited area of the lesion; and a treatment that has no risk of causing pre-term births or infertility. CIN 2/3 represents a unique market opportunity for a novel therapy capable of providing a first-line alternative to surgery. This market research will help guide our communication and interaction with the physician, patient, and support communities. 

VGX-3100 has the potential to be a less-invasive first-line treatment option that spares women from the anxiety of surgery and the risks it poses to their reproductive health. It strengthens the body&#8217;s immune response to clear the underlying HPV infection that causes cervical cancer. It can eliminate pre-cancerous lesions that, left untreated, would evolve to cancer. 

In short, VGX-3100 has potential to offer women the first non-surgical treatment for pre-cancerous cervical dysplasia. As a novel therapy advancing toward commercialization, we are pleased that the various steps necessary to launch the phase III study in early 2016 are advancing in a timely and successful manner. 

Inovio also plans to expand VGX-3100 to treat other dysplasia conditions caused by HPV infections such as vulvar and anal intraepithelial neoplasias. 

HPV Immunotherapy-INO-3112 (VGX-3100 +DNA-Based IL-12 Cytokine INO-9012) 

Head &#38; Neck Cancer &#32;and Cervical Cancer 

HPV is also associated with head and neck cancers, especially those in the oropharynx and larynx but also the oral cavity and nose/nasal passages. The incidence of HPV-caused oropharyngeal cancer has increased significantly within the last 20 years and has been increasing at an epidemic rate. In the US, approximately 12,000 new cases of HPV-associated head and neck cancer are diagnosed annually. The estimated prevalence of HPV-caused oropharyngeal cancer in the U.S. in 2012 was nearly 212,000. 

By 2020, scientists estimate that HPV will cause more cases of oropharyngeal cancer than cervical cancer and by 2025 HPV will be the causative factor of 90% of all head &#38; neck cancers (HPV currently causes 63% of head &#38; neck cancers). Greater than 70% of cancers of the oropharynx are linked to HPV, with HPV16 being the most prevalent serotype. 

Improvements in primary treatment modalities (surgery and radiation) have produced significant improvements in morbidity but intensive radiation has a profound long-term impact on mortality and quality of life. Based on these factors, we believe there is a significant opportunity for an effective immunotherapy. 

In June 2014 we initiated a phase I/IIa clinical study assessing the immunogenicity and safety of INO-3112 (VGX-3100 in combination with a DNA-based IL-12 cytokine (INO-9012)) in head &#38; neck cancer patients. We added our DNA-based IL-12 immune activator to VGX-3100 for this cancer study because our HIV immunotherapy clinical study (HVTN-080) showed that the addition of IL-12 to our DNA immunotherapy can enhance the activation of CD8 T cells. 

Up to 25 adults with HPV16 and/or HPV18-positive head &#38; neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) will be treated with INO-3112 and followed for safety, immune and clinical responses in an open-label phase I study called HPV-005 (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02163057). In one part of the study, at least 5 patients will be treated with INO-3112 before and after resection of their tumor. In the second part of the study, at least 15 patients will be treated with INO-3112 after completion of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Each INO-3112 treatment will be administered using Inovio's CELLECTRA &#174; &#32;delivery system. In addition to assessing safety, this study will analyze T cell immune responses to INO-3112. Pre- and post-immunotherapy tumor tissue will be analyzed to evaluate infiltration of T cells into the tumor and tumor area. Clinical responses characterized by anti-tumor effects including progression free survival will also be assessed. 

In November 2015 we reported interim data showing that INO-3112 generated robust HPV16/18 specific CD8+ T cell responses and antibodies against HPV16/18 in all 10 tested patients for whom data analyses were complete at that time. The treatment was well tolerated in all evaluable patients. 

Cervical cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer among women in developing countries and is the second most commonly occurring cancer amongst women worldwide. Without consistent HPV vaccination or improvements in screening and treatments, current incidence trends suggest that the incidence of cervical cancer could rise from roughly 530,000 cases per year to approximately 1 million cases per year in 2050. The prognosis for advanced cervical cancer patients is characteristically poor and treatment options are palliative at best. 

In June of 2014 we initiated a phase I/IIa clinical study called HPV-004 (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02172911) assessing the immunogenicity and safety of INO-3112 (VGX-3100 in combination with INO-9012) in cervical cancer patients. Thirty patients with HPV16 and/or HPV18-caused inoperable invasive cervical cancer or recurrent or persistent cervical cancer will be evaluated in an open-label study called HPV-004. Women will receive four treatments of INO-3112 every four weeks after completion of a standard chemoradiation or salvage therapy regimen. Each INO-3112 treatment will be a combination of 6 mg of VGX-3100 and 1 mg of INO-9012 delivered together intramuscularly with the CELLECTRA &#174; &#32;delivery system. The study team will evaluate clinical responses and assess disease-free survival and disease recurrence up to 18 months after the initial immunotherapy with Inovio's INO-3112. T cell immune responses will be analyzed pre- and post-immunotherapy in the tumor tissue as well as in the periphery blood samples. 

Depending on the intentions of our partner, MedImmune (see below and under Corporate Development), additional interim data from these studies may be reported in 2016 and/or at a later date. 

In July 2015 we announced a collaboration with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) to evaluate INO-3112 in combination with traditional chemo-radiotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced stage cervical cancer. The EORTC carries out clinical studies throughout Europe for all types of cancer. 

The initial agreement contemplated a prospective, randomized, three arm phase II study in which INO-3112 would be administered during standard chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) or during and after standard CRT as an adjuvant in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer. The primary endpoint would be to demonstrate sufficient activity in the experimental combination arms to warrant a further pivotal phase III trial based on progression free survival (PFS) at 18 months. Efficacy would be assessed within each experimental arm while the standard arm will serve as a reference arm to check the reliability of the results. PFS at 18 months would be determined via Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria as assessed by the local investigator. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, clinical response, immunogenicity, tolerability and safety. We expect this study to be initiated in 2016. 

In August 2015 we formed a strategic partnership with MedImmune, LLC focused on cancer immunotherapies (see Corporate Development). Under this agreement MedImmune licensed INO-3112, which it intends to study in combination with selected immunotherapy molecules within its pipeline in HPV-driven cancers. Emerging evidence suggests that the benefits from immuno-oncology molecules, such as those in MedImmune's portfolio, can be enhanced when they are used in combination with cancer vaccines that generate tumor-specific T-cells. We expect to see a combination study in humans potentially launched in 2016. 

HPV Immunotherapy-INO-3106 +/- DNA-Based IL-12 Cytokine 

Aerodigestive Cancer 

In September 2014 we launched a compassionate phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02241369) in patients with HPV-caused aerodigestive cancer. Aerodigestive cancer is a condition that affects the lips, mouth, tongue, nose, throat, vocal cords, larynx, and parts of the esophagus and windpipe. Current treatment for HPV-associated aerodigestive cancers includes chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery, all of which have negative side effects. 

This phase I study was designed to test INO-3106 alone or in combination with INO-9012 (DNA-based IL-12) in subjects with HPV-6 associated invasive aerodigestive malignancies who have exhausted other treatment options (chemotherapy, radiation and surgery). This is a physician initiated Investigational New Drug application (IND) and is open to suitable patients for compassionate use. &#32; 

Prostate Cancer Immunotherapy-INO-5150 

The development of a new treatment for prostate cancer would be a significant medical advance given that present treatment options (surgery, radiation and hormone deprivation), while somewhat effective, all carry deleterious side effects and often do not confer long-term cure. Across the United States, there were 238,000 new cases of prostate cancer and more than 29,000 deaths in 2013. 

In January 2011 we announced the publication of a scientific paper in the journal Human Vaccines &#32;detailing potent immune responses in a pre-clinical study of our SynCon &#174; &#32;immunotherapy for prostate cancer targeting two antigens, prostate specific antigen (&#8220;PSA&#8221;) and prostate specific membrane antigen (&#8220;PSMA&#8221;). While current prostate cancer therapies target single antigens, in this study we tested the hypothesis in mice that a multi-antigen immunotherapy administered with Inovio's electroporation delivery technology would improve the breadth and effectiveness of a prostate cancer immunotherapeutic. 

This study, conducted by our scientists and collaborators, is described in the published paper entitled, &#8220;Co-delivery of PSA and PSMA DNA vaccines with electroporation induces potent immune responses.&#8221; The SynCon &#174; &#32;immunotherapy evaluated in this study consists of PSA and PSMA synthetic consensus immunogens based on human and macaque amino acid sequences, which enabled the sequences for these antigens to differ slightly from the native proteins associated with prostate cancer in humans. In humans, this difference may help overcome self-tolerance of cancer cells displaying these prostate-related proteins and enable the generation of an anti-tumor immune response. Mice received two immunizations of highly optimized immunotherapy delivered by electroporation. Immunogenicity was evaluated one week after the second immunization. The resultant data showed the induction of strong PSA and PSMA-specific cellular immune responses and also significant antigen specific seroconversion, illustrating that both humoral and cellular immune responses can be generated by this approach. 

In July 2015 we initiated a phase I trial ( ClinicalTrials.gov: &#32; NCT02514213) to evaluate our DNA immunotherapy for prostate cancer, INO-5150, in men with biochemically relapsed prostate cancer. This study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of INO-5150 alone or in combination with INO-9012, Inovio's DNA-based IL-12 immune activator. The multi-centered study will also evaluate changes in PSA levels, an important biomarker in prostate cancer. This study is intended to enroll 60 patients across 4 dose cohorts. 

&#32; hTERT Immunotherapy-INO-1400 

Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is an attractive cancer immunotherapy target. High levels of hTERT have been detected in more than 85% of all human cancers, including breast, lung, and pancreatic cancers, while normal cells showed undetectable levels of telomerase expression. Immunological analysis indicated that hTERT is a widely applicable target recognized by T-cells and can be potentially used as a universal cancer immunotherapy. 

In July 2013, we announced that our hTERT DNA cancer immunotherapy administered with our CELLECTRA &#174; &#32;electroporation delivery device generated robust and broad immune responses, induced T cells with a tumor-killing function, and increased the rate of survival in pre-clinical studies. 

In December 2014 we initiated a phase I clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02327468 ) for our hTERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase) DNA immunotherapy (INO-1400) alone or in combination with our DNA IL-12 immune activator (INO-9012) in adults with breast, lung, or pancreatic cancer at high risk of relapse after surgery and other cancer treatments. This open label, dose escalation study in approximately 54 subjects is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of INO-1400. 

Infectious Disease Vaccines/Immunotherapies 

Hepatitis B Virus-INO-1800 

Although an effective preventive vaccine against hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has existed for over three decades, HBV remains a major epidemic, especially among people of Asian and African descent. The World Health Organization estimates that 2 billion people globally have been infected with HBV, with over 350 million people chronically infected with the virus and at risk of developing cirrhosis or liver cancer. It is estimated that upwards of 1.4 million people in the US are infected with the virus. Currently, the only therapies available for chronically infected individuals are interferon-alpha and nucleoside analog treatments, which function by controlling viral replication but unfortunately do not clear infection. Interferon can prevent viral replication in only 30% of patients and does so with undesirable side effects. 

Liver cancer is the second most common cause of death from cancer worldwide, killing most patients within five years of diagnosis. About 782,000 new cases arise each year. One of the major causes and risk factors for liver cancer is infection by hepatitis B. Chronically infected individuals may develop a permanent scarring of the liver (a condition called cirrhosis). Liver cirrhosis can evolve into hepatocellular carcinoma, which claims 746,000 lives annually. 

In November 2012 we announced data indicating that our HBV immunotherapy generated strong T cell responses that eliminated targeted liver cells in mice. Results from this pre-clinical study appeared in the peer-reviewed journal, Cancer Gene Therapy, in an article entitled, "Synthetic DNA immunogen encoding hepatitis B core antigen drives immune response in liver." 

INO-1800 is encoded for the HBcAg antigen and represents a consensus of the unique HBcAg DNA sequences of all major HBV genotypes (A through E). When delivered by electroporation, our researchers first demonstrated that this therapy elicited strong HBcAg-specific T cell and antibody responses in the periphery (outside of the liver) by ELISpot, ICS and cell proliferation assays. Researchers observed that the immunization could also induce antigen-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells that produced both IFN-y and TNF-a in the liver, indicating a strong immunotherapy-induced T cell response was also present in the liver. 

In the study the antigen-specific T cells exhibited a killing function, and could migrate to and stay in the liver and cause clearance of target cells without any evidence of liver injury. Taken together, this was the first study to provide evidence that intramuscular immunization could induce killer T cells that can migrate to the liver and eliminate target cells. 

In September, 2013, Roche exclusively licensed this SynCon &#174; &#32;immunotherapy in conjunction with the use of Inovio&#8217;s CELLECTRA &#174; &#32;electroporation technology for this immunotherapy (see Corporate Development). 

In April 2015 we initiated a phase I trial called HBV-001 (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02431312 ) to evaluate INO-1800 in patients chronically infected with hepatitis B. This phase I, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, dose escalation study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of INO-1800 alone or in combination with INO-9112, Inovio's IL-12-based immune activator. This international study is enrolling patients in the United States and Asia Pacific region with a primary endpoint of safety and tolerability of the therapy. The secondary endpoints will evaluate the cellular and humoral immune response to INO-1800 and investigate the therapy's effect on several viral and antiviral parameters. All trial subjects are also medicated with standard-of-care antiviral therapies. This trial initiation triggered a milestone payment from Roche to Inovio. This study may enroll up to 126 patients in 8 arms including an active comparator. 

Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)-INO-8000/VGX-6150 

Hepatitis C virus is a major cause of acute hepatitis. HCV is spread primarily by direct contact with human blood, the major causes worldwide being the use of unscreened blood transfusions and re-use of needles and syringes that have not been adequately sterilized. As many as 75% -85% of newly infected patients may progress to develop chronic infection. Of those with chronic liver disease, 5% - 20% may develop cirrhosis. About 1%-5% of infected people may die from the consequences of long term infection (due to liver cancer or cirrhosis). Globally, an estimated 150 million people are chronically infected with HCV, which represents a reservoir sufficiently large for HCV to persist, and 3 to 4 million people are newly infected each year. In the US, while new incidences of HCV have dropped dramatically, an estimated 3.2 million Americans are chronically infected. People with chronic HCV infection face an increased risk of developing hepatocellular cancer, a difficult-to-treat cancer with a poor prognosis. More than 350,000 deaths each year are attributed to HCV-caused liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer. 

The HCV therapy market has been recently transformed by the launch and rapid adoption of Sovaldi&#174; and other combo drugs in its class. Yet prices for these products remain high and out of reach for most of the patients in the world. Furthermore, there is no immune system stimulating approach that may provide a better solution for many HCV-infected people. 

In April, 2010, we announced, along with our collaborators from Drexel University, Cheyney University, and the University of Pennsylvania, that we received a combined $2.8 million grant from the PA Commonwealth Universal Research Enhancement Program (CURE), &#32; to advance our proprietary immunotherapy to treat HCV using our CELLECTRA &#174; &#32;electroporation delivery system. The grant funded pre-clinical studies using an expanded set of SynCon &#174; &#32;immunogens to test the safety and effect on the immune system of our novel immunotherapy designed to treat persons who are chronically infected with HCV and have not responded to currently available therapies. 

At the end of 2011 we announced positive pre-clinical results from our HCV immunotherapy, INO-8000, which were published in Molecular Therapy . This multi-antigen DNA immunotherapy covers hepatitis C virus genotypes 1a and 1b and targets the antigens NS3/4A, which includes HCV nonstructural proteins 3 (NS3) and 4A (NS4A), as well as NS4B and NS5A proteins. Following immunization, rhesus macaques mounted strong HCV-specific T cell immune responses strikingly similar to those reported in patients who have cleared the virus on their own. The responses included strong NS3-specific interferon-gamma (IFN-g) induction, robust CD4 and CD8 T cell proliferation, and induction of polyfunctional T cells. Importantly, we also observed functional T cells in the liver. 

In October 2013 our partner GeneOne (formerly VGX International Inc.) launched a phase I study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02027116 ) of this HCV immunotherapy. Under a 2011 development agreement GeneOne is fully funding IND-enabling, phase I, and phase II studies for this immunotherapy. They are currently testing VGX-6150 (INO-8000 with DNA-based IL-28 cytokine) in phase I testing in Korea. 

We are also planning to evaluate INO-8000 at additional clinical study sites in the U.S. 

HIV Preventive and Therapeutic Immune Therapies-PENNVAX &#174; -GP 

Since its discovery in 1981, HIV, the virus which causes AIDS, has killed more than 36 million people. In 2011, there were roughly 2.5 million new cases of HIV diagnosed. In 2012, approximately 35 million people were living with HIV worldwide. Each year in the United States, about 50,000 people become newly infected with HIV. At the end of 2010, 1.1 million people in the US were living with HIV. 

Effective vaccines have been actively pursued for over 20 years, without success. HIV represents one of the most confounding targets in medicine. The virus' high mutagenicity (ability to mutate) has made effective vaccine development very challenging. Its outer envelope, swathed in sugar molecules, is difficult to attack, and HIV strikes the very cells that the 

immune system launches to thwart such an infection. Although several drugs (anti-retrovirals) are available to treat the patients once they are infected, vaccines and immunotherapies are necessary to stop the spread of disease and perhaps reduce the need for anti-retroviral treatment. 

Noting that many long-term survivors have high counts of killer CD8 T cells, the HIV vaccine and immunotherapy field has turned to stimulating the immune system to generate those cells. Recent HIV vaccine candidates used an adenovirus (a common human cold virus) genetically modified to contain code for HIV antigens to prevent viral replication. These vaccines have proven to not be effective. More recently the RV-144 trial, which employed an ALVAC&#8482; (canary pox) vaccine prime followed by a protein vaccine boost, demonstrated 30% efficacy in preventing acquisition of infection amongst the vaccinated population compared to the control group. Although the efficacy was relatively modest, the finding for the first time showed that an immunotherapy may be able to combat spread of HIV and has spurred the development of newer immunotherapy candidates. We believe, however, that a different approach is needed to develop an effective vaccine or immunotherapy for HIV. 

In October 2009, along with the HIV Vaccines Trial Network (&#8220;HVTN&#8221;) we initiated a phase I study (HVTN-080) of PENNVAX &#174; -B (with and without a DNA cytokine, DNA IL-12) with the CELLECTRA &#174; &#32;electroporation delivery device in healthy, uninfected individuals. The SynCon&#174;vaccine was encoded for HIV antigens gag, pol, and env from HIV subtype, or clade, B. This randomized, double-blind, multi-center study was sponsored by the NIAID, an agency of the National Institutes of Health (the &#8220;NIH&#8221;), conducted by the NIAID-funded HVTN, and was designed to assess safety and levels of immune responses. 

Of 48 healthy, HIV-negative volunteers, eight received placebo, 10 received a 1 mg dose of PENNVAX &#174; -B immunotherapy, and 30 received a 1 mg dose of PENNVAX &#174; -B along with IL-12 DNA. All volunteers received vaccine or placebo administered with electroporation at months 0, 1, and 3. T-cell immune responses were detected using a validated flow cytometry-based intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay. 

This data was published in July 2013 in the peer-reviewed Journal of Infectious Diseases &#32;in the article, &#8220;Safety and comparative immunogenicity of an HIV-1 DNA vaccine in combination with plasmid IL-12 and impact of intramuscular electroporation for delivery.&#8221; Overall, CD4, CD8 or both T-cell responses were observed against at least one of the immunotherapy antigens in 88.9% (24 of 27) of evaluated subjects after three immunizations with electroporation plus DNA-based IL-12. The magnitude of cellular immune responses were equal to or greater than those reported from vector-based HIV vaccines such as adenovirus. These results represented best-in-class immune responses that had not previously been observed with other platforms. 

Other specific results included: 

&#8226; 

Antigen-specific CD4 T cell responses were generated in 80.8% of evaluated immunotherapy recipients (21 of 26). 

&#8226; 

Significant antigen-specific CD8 T cell responses were generated in 51.9% of evaluated immunotherapy recipients (14 of 27). 

&#8226; 

Compared to a previously conducted HVTN 070 phase I study, which assessed PENNVAX &#174; -B with cytokine adjuvant IL-12 at double the dose, with four immunizations, but without electroporation delivery, response rates in HVTN 080 with electroporation were significantly higher than HVTN 070 CD4 responses (40.7%) and CD8 T cell responses (3.6%). Samples from eight placebo recipients and pre-vaccine samples were negative for both CD4 T cell responses and CD8 T cell responses. 

&#8226; 

PENNVAX &#174; -B delivered using the CELLECTRA &#174; &#32;intramuscular electroporation delivery device with or without IL-12 was safe and generally well tolerated. There were no immunotherapy-related serious adverse events. Reported adverse events and injection site reactions were mild to moderate and required no treatment. 

A second clinical study testing PENNVAX &#174; -B in a therapeutic setting was conducted in collaboration with the University of Pennsylvania. The HIV-001 open label, phase I study enrolled 12 adult HIV-positive volunteers to assess safety and levels of immune responses generated by PENNVAX &#174; -B delivered with our CELLECTRA &#174; &#32;electroporation device. Study volunteers were required to be on a highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen, have undetectable plasma viral load (&#60;75 copies/mL), and have CD4 T lymphocyte counts above 400 cells/&#181;L with nadirs over 200 cell/&#181;L. Twelve (12) eligible subjects were administered a four dose series (day 0, weeks 4, 8 and 16) of PENNVAX &#174; -B containing 3 mg of DNA/dose via intramuscular electroporation. 

T cell responses were measured using a validated ELISpot assay. Overall, significant immunotherapy-specific T cell responses were observed in 75% (9 out of 12) of subjects against at least one of the three immunotherapy antigens (gag, pol, or env) following immunization. Fifty percent of the subjects (6 out of 12) had strong immunotherapy induced antigen-specific responses above the pre-immunization levels to at least two of the antigens. Importantly, the responses induced by immunization were predominantly antigen-specific (i.e. gag, pol and env) CD8 T-cells, which are considered to be paramount 

in clearing chronic viral infections and an important measurement of the performance of an immunotherapeutic. These results are in stark contrast to previously reported studies with other DNA immunotherapies delivered without electroporation that yielded poor overall T cell immune responses. 

In December 2014 the results from this clinical study appeared in the peer-reviewed journal Molecular Therapy &#32;in the article, "Synthetic consensus HIV-1 DNA induces potent cellular immune responses and synthesis of granzyme B, perforin in HIV infected individuals," authored by Inovio researchers and collaborators. 

Our HIV immunotherapy was found to have significantly increased antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in all 12 patients. We observed that these activated CD8+ killer T cells produced the cell-killing substances granzyme B and perforin (both necessary to kill targeted cells and viruses) in quantities and with characteristics similar to those of long-term non-progressors (i.e. HIV-infected individuals who, without treatment, do not progress to further stages of the disease). It is believed that in these extremely rare individuals who self-regulate their HIV infection, part of their ability to control the infection may lie in their unique immune responses. 

Another striking result of this HIV study was that PENNVAX &#174; -B increased the number of HIV-specific CD8+ killer T cells displaying the receptor integrin, which is associated with the ability to carry T cells to the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), the most important target organ for HIV. 

We believe these positive results demonstrate the potency of our immunotherapy technology platform and raise the potential for the development of immunotherapies against HIV. 

The valuable proof of concept data achieved with the PENNVAX &#174; -B (targeting clade B envelope viruses) clinical studies provided a strong and positive basis with which to advance our HIV immunotherapy development program via an HIV Vaccine Design and Development Teams &#32;(HVDDT) contract for PENNVAX &#174; -GP (discussed below). 

In September 2010 the United States Military HIV Research Program (MHRP) initiated a phase I trial (RV262) using one of our prophylactic HIV immunotherapies in a unique prime-boost strategy. This program was developed to protect against diverse subtypes of HIV-1 prevalent in North America, Europe, Africa, and South America. The study is being conducted by the United States MHRP through its clinical research network in the US and East Africa. The prime was a DNA immunotherapy, Inovio's PENNVAX &#174; -G, and the boost was delivered using a vaccinia viral vector, Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Chiang Mai Double Recombinant (MVA-CMDR). Together, the vaccines were designed to deliver a diverse mixture of antigens for HIV-1 subtypes A, B, C, D and E. The study tested PENNVAX &#174; -G delivered with electroporation in conjunction with the MVA-CMDR boost. The NIAID sponsored the study, which was designed to enroll up to 92 participants and assess safety and immune responses. Interim data presented at the HIV R4P meeting in Capetown in October 2014 showed that the vaccine administration was generally safe and well tolerated. Antigen specific T cell responses were detected by interferon gamma ELISpot assay in 12/27 subjects and antibody responses were noted by ELISA in 10/11 subjects whose samples had been analyzed up to that point. 

Based on the proof-of-concept established with PENNVAX &#174; -B, we were awarded a contract under the NIAID's HIV Vaccine Design and Development Teams program to advance a more optimized preventive HIV DNA vaccine, PENNVAX &#174; -GP, delivered using intradermal electroporation delivery. The contract provided for up to $25.3 million of funding over seven years. The funding and development program covered pre-clinical optimization, immunogenicity and challenge studies in animal models, IND-enabling toxicology studies, cGMP (current good manufacturing practices) manufacturing of all components of the immunotherapy and intradermal CELLECTRA &#174; &#32;electroporation device, and the conduct of a phase I human clinical trial. 

In September 2015 the first patient was dosed in a phase I trial (HVTN-098, ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02431767) &#32; to evaluate safety and tolerability of PENNVAX &#174; -GP, Inovio's "universal" DNA vaccine for HIV. This human study is in collaboration with the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN). The trial will measure immune responses following administration of the vaccine in four groups of healthy subjects receiving the vaccine with and without an immune activator (IL-12) and delivered into muscle or skin using Inovio's CELLECTRA &#174; delivery technology. 

In 2015 Inovio and its collaborators were awarded an additional $16 million Integrated Preclinical/Clinical AIDS Vaccine Development (IPCAVD) grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). This new five-year program grant was awarded based on a peer-reviewed meritorious proposal by Dr. David Weiner, from the University of Pennsylvania and chair of Inovio's scientific advisory board, and Inovio. New PENNVAX &#174; &#32;envelope constructs will be designed and tested with Inovio's DNA-based immune activator encoding novel cytokine genes and will be studied in a prime-boost strategy with recombinant HIV envelope proteins. The collaborators will assess different combinations in preclinical models with the goal of generating high levels of neutralizing antibodies mirroring the robust CD8+ T cell responses generated by Inovio's PENNVAX &#174; -B DNA vaccine in previously published clinical studies. The overall goal of this project is to further build upon this important HIV vaccine approach as well as to gain fundamental insight into new technologies to improve vaccination outcomes. 

Inovio is working with NIH/DAIDS and collaborators to also launch a phase I clinical study of PENNVAX &#174; -GP in a therapeutic setting. 

HIV remains a challenging and tremendously important area of medical research, and we value the NIH's support to further evaluate the immunogenicity and efficacy of our electroporation delivery system and novel preventive HIV immunotherapy candidate. 

Avian Influenza Immunotherapies 

Influenza is one of the most communicable diseases and typically affects children and elderly most severely. Complications from influenza cause more than 200,000 hospitalizations and cause between 3,000-49,000 deaths each year in the United States alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control. The world is annually subjected to two influenza sessions (one per hemisphere), between three and five million cases of severe illness, and up to 500,000 deaths. A pandemic occurs every ten to twenty years, which infects a large proportion of the world's population and can kill tens of millions of people as the &#8220;Spanish Flu&#8221; did in just two years (50-100 million deaths during 1918-1919). 

New influenza viruses are constantly produced by mutation or reassortment, and can develop resistance to standard antiviral drugs. The H5N1 flu virus has been spreading from Asia despite the belief that it was under control immediately after outbreaks there in 2004. In 2005, there were reports of H5N1 in wild birds in Europe. In 2006, there were reports of an H5N1 strain in wild birds and poultry in Africa and the Near East. According to the World Health Organization, the H5N1 bird flu has infected 650 people and resulted in 386 deaths (approximately 60% death rate) in 15 countries since 2003 (WHO, February 2014). While H5N1 has never been passed person-to-person and has not spread widely, one concern is the potential for the lethal H5N1 to &#8220;reassort&#8221; with another of the influenza sub-types that have been prone to spread more rapidly in humans, possibly creating a more dangerous influenza strain. Through 2006, over 140 million birds had been killed and over $10 billion spent to try to contain H5N1 avian influenza, which has a death rate of 90%-100% in birds. 

Our VGX-3400X candidate targets H5N1. The immunotherapy consists of three distinct DNA plasmids coded for a consensus hemagglutinin (HA) antigen derived from different H5N1 virus strains; a consensus neuraminidase (NA) antigen derived from different N1 sequences; and a consensus nucleoprotein (NP) fused to a small portion of the m2 protein (m2E) based on a broader cross-section of influenza viruses in addition to H5N1 and H1N1. 

In our first proof of principle study of our universal flu immunotherapy program, VGX-3400X was delivered with intramuscular electroporation using our CELLECTRA &#174; &#32;electroporation device. The primary objectives of this clinical trial were to assess safety and tolerability. The secondary objective was the measurement of antigen-specific T cell and antibody responses, including binding and hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) responses, i.e. a measure of protection, against multiple strains of H5N1 influenza. 

The study assessed a total of 60 healthy volunteers, 30 in the US and 30 in Korea (in a separate, parallel clinical trial sponsored by Inovio affiliate GeneOne. Three dose cohorts of 10 subjects were each given two injections of 0.2 mg, 0.67 mg, or 2.0 mg of each plasmid at months 0 and 1. 

In a report in July, 2011 of interim data, VGX-3400X was found to be generally safe and well tolerated at all dose levels. There were no vaccine-related serious adverse events. Reported adverse events and injection site reactions were mild to moderate and required no treatment. 

We tested for antibody responses against the target antigens and observed high levels of binding antibodies in 26 of 27 evaluated subjects (96%). Antibodies were generated against all three antigens, as tested by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Positive antibody responses persisted to seven months, the latest time point tested. 

In testing for HAI responses against the Vietnam (A/H5N1/1203/04) strain, 3 of 27 subjects (11%) showed HAI titers greater than 1:40, which is considered to be an indicator of protection against influenza in humans. Two of the three subjects with HAI titers exceeding 1:40 against the Vietnam strain also demonstrated greater than 1:40 titers against the Indonesia (A/H5N1/5/2005) strain, demonstrating cross-reactive responses in these volunteers. 

Significantly, antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses were also observed against all three antigens (HA, NA and NP). After two vaccinations, 13 of 18 vaccinated subjects (72%) from the first two cohorts developed strong CTL responses to at least one of the immunotherapy components. After cohort 3 samples were analyzed, 20 of 29 immunized subjects (69%) in all 3 cohorts developed strong CTL responses to at least one of the immunotherapy components. These positive T cell responses were measured up to seven months after the first immunization. Generation of influenza antigen-specific T cell responses is believed to be important for generating universal, long-lasting immunity against influenza as well as to generate a stronger immune response against flu in elderly people. 

In another component of the study, participants received a booster vaccination using just the H5 HA immunotherapy component of VGX-3400X delivered using intradermal (rather than intramuscular) electroporation. The intradermal (ID) part of the study was the first flu study using ID electroporation delivery in humans. ID electroporation delivers our SynCon &#174; &#32;immunotherapies into skin, which contains large amounts of immune cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages considered 

most important for generating protective antibodies. Our new ID electroporation device uses a patented miniaturized needle array which creates electroporation conditions uniquely optimized for skin delivery. The goal of this booster vaccination was to determine if ID delivery of the H5 HA construct can increase HAI titers beyond those achieved by the initial intramuscular immunizations. Twenty-two participants received the ID booster immunization. 

Immune response data measured one month after this boost were reported in November 2011. Ten of 20 subjects (50%) exhibited a four-fold or greater rise in geometric mean titers (GMT) in the HAI assay (ranging from 1:20 to 1:80 HAI titers) against the Clade 1 A/Vietnam/1203/04 strain. Significantly, a four-fold or greater rise in GMT titers against five other Clade 2 (Clade 2.1, 2.2; 2.3.2; 2.3.4) and Clade 0 H5N1 viruses was also noted in 10-25% of the vaccinated subjects, further demonstrating cross-reactive immune responses in these volunteers. One subject displayed greater than 1:40 HAI titers against all six different H5N1 viruses tested. ID immunization was found to be generally safe and well tolerated. 

HAI measurements from the blood of an immunized subject are used to assess the generation of protective antibody responses. A four-fold rise in HAI titers (compared to pre-vaccination) is considered to be an important indicator of immune activation. Generating an HAI titer of 1:20 is generally regarded as a positive vaccine response, with a titer of 1:40 or higher in the blood of immunized subjects generally associated with protection against influenza in humans. 

Seventeen subjects boosted with the minimally invasive ID vaccination were subsequently given a second ID booster vaccination. In May 2012 we reported that 100% and 89% of immunized subjects demonstrated high-titer binding antibody responses against the more common Clade 1 A/Vietnam/1203/04 and Clade 2 A/Indo/5/05 strains, respectively, demonstrating vaccine-specific immune activation. We also tested the immunotherapy's ability to generate protective HAI responses against six distinct H5N1 virus strains (Clades 0, 1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3.2 and 2.3.4), representing all major genetic branches of the H5N1 genetic tree. Of the 17 subjects who completed the full immunization regimen: 

&#8226; 

Eight of 17 (47%) immunized subjects had an HAI titer of 1:40 or higher against at least one of the tested H5N1 viruses. 

&#8226; 

Twelve of 17 (71%) vaccinated subjects had an HAI titer of 1:20 or higher against at least one H5N1 strain. 

&#8226; 

Seven of 17 (41%) had an HAI titer of 1:40 or higher against the Clade 2.2 A/Turkey/1/05 strain. 

&#8226; 

Five of 17 immunized subjects (29%) displayed an HAI titer of 1:20 or higher against at least three different H5N1 viruses tested. 

&#8226; 

In an unprecedented result, two immunized subjects demonstrated an HAI titer of 1:20 or higher against all six strains tested. 

Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) measurements from the blood of an immunized subject are used to assess the generation of protective HA antibody responses generated by a vaccine. All HAI titer data are presented in geometric mean titers (GMT). Generating an HAI titer of 1:20 is generally regarded as a positive response to the vaccine; a titer of 1:40 or higher in the blood of immunized subjects is generally associated with protection against seasonal influenza viruses and has been observed in multiple subtypes. 

Although a number of companies have well-developed avian influenza programs and lead vaccine candidates have entered into national stockpiles (US and EU), we believe there exists a need for broadly protective and easily scalable technologies to prepare for the as yet unknown target presented by the next form of avian influenza. Our SynCon &#174; &#32;technology provides protection from known avian influenza viruses (in animal studies) and has also shown the ability to protect against newly emergent, unmatched strains. 

Responding to the 2013 H7N9 influenza outbreak, we completed the design, optimization, and manufacturing of an H7N9 DNA immunotherapy within two weeks. A pre-clinical study of this DNA therapy showed that 100% of vaccinated mice were protected against sickness and death when they were challenged with a lethal dose of H7N9 virus. This study further highlights the ability of Inovio's SynCon &#174; &#32;immunotherapies to create cellular immune responses that could reduce the severity of H7N9 infection in a person that acquires the virus and limit the spread of the virus in a pandemic setting. Data from this study was published in Vaccine &#32;in a paper titled &#8220;Protective immunity to H7N9 influenza viruses elicited by DNA vaccine.&#8221; 

We are seeking additional grant funding to advance this program further. 

Universal Influenza Immunotherapy 

Conventional vaccines are strain-specific and have limited ability to protect against genetic shifts in the influenza strains they target. They are therefore modified annually in anticipation of the next flu season&#8217;s new strain(s). If a significantly different, unanticipated new strain emerges, such as the 2009 swine-origin pandemic strain, then the current vaccines provide little or no protective capability. In contrast, we believe that our design approach to characterize a broad consensus of antigens across variant strains of each influenza sub-type creates the ability to protect against new strains that have common genetic roots, even though they are not perfectly matched. By formulating a single immunotherapy with some or all of the key sub- 

types, protection may be achieved against seasonal as well as pandemic strains such as swine flu or pandemic-potential strains such as avian influenza noted above. We are focused on developing DNA-based influenza immunotherapies able to provide broad protection against known as well as newly emerging, unknown seasonal and pandemic influenza strains. 

Instead of targeting a specific strain or strains, we have developed a universal vaccine strategy to deal with the ever-changing flu threats. Using our SynCon &#174; &#32;process, our scientists designed immunotherapies targeting an optimal consensus of HA, NA, and NP proteins derived from multiple strains of each of the Type A sub-types H1N1, H2N2, H3N2 (these three influenza sub-types having been responsible for the majority of seasonal and pandemic influenza outbreaks in humans during the last century), as well as H5N1. In theory, consensus HA vaccine constructs from each sub-type, delivered using our electroporation device, could potentially protect immunized subjects from 90-95% of all human seasonal and pandemic influenza concerns. Additionally, we have also developed an optimal consensus of HA sequences derived from influenza Type B strains. Type B is one of three components of current seasonal influenza vaccinations. Thus, using our SynCon &#174; &#32;constructs, we have now developed immunotherapy elements that can target both pandemic-risk (H5N1, H7N9, H1N1) as well as seasonal influenza strains (H3N2, H1N1, influenza B). 

&#160; Moreover, using our approach the immunotherapies might not have to be administered annually after the first few priming sessions. Rather, the same combination could be used to boost the immune system every few years. 

In September 2012 we announced that an interim analysis of a SynCon &#174; &#32;universal H1N1 influenza vaccine showed that it generated protective HAI titers against some of the most prevalent strains of H1N1 influenza from the past 100 years in a phase I clinical trial. The open label phase I study evaluated two H1N1 hemagglutinin (HA) plasmids designed to broadly protect against unmatched influenza strains within different branches of the H1N1 subtype. These plasmids were delivered in healthy adults with Inovio's CELLECTRA &#174; &#32;intradermal electroporation device up to three times. The delivered immunotherapy was well tolerated; reported adverse events and injection site reactions were mild to moderate and required no treatment. 

Researchers exposed blood samples from the vaccinated subjects to each of the nine key H1N1 viruses in circulation over the last 100 years: eight were H1N1 strains used to formulate the seasonal vaccines of the last 25 years; one was the H1N1 strain that caused the 1918 Spanish flu. These unmatched influenza strains were used to assess the generation of hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers meeting or exceeding 1:40. Demonstrating Inovio's vaccine's broad cross-reactive coverage, a significant percentage of subjects immunized with Inovio's SynCon &#174; &#32;immunotherapy had an HAI titer of 1:40 or higher against each of the nine H1N1 strains tested, ranging from a 30% response rate to the A/Brisbane/59/07 strain to a 100% response rate to the A/Beijing/262/95 strain. The benchmark for the current licensed seasonal flu vaccines, which are based on matching the vaccine HA sequence to that of the circulating strain, is to have greater than 65% of vaccinees generate an HAI titer of 1:40 or higher against the matched vaccine strain. 

By design, our SynCon &#174; &#32;universal flu immunotherapy is not matched to any single virus and was not matched to any of the strains tested in this study. The immunotherapy recipients generated protective HAI responses against the H1N1 A/South Carolina/1/18 strain from the 1918 Spanish flu as well as all the H1N1 strains which were part of the annual seasonal trivalent inactivated flu vaccines (TIV) since 1986, including: A/Taiwan/1/86, A/Texas/36/91, A/Bayern/07/95, A/Beijing/262/95, A/New Caledonia/20/99, A/Solomon Islands/03/06, A/Brisbane/59/07, A/California/07/09. The HAI titers in the positive responders ranged from 1:40 to greater than 1:1280. 

Compared to the seasonal TIV (trivalent influenza vaccine)-immunized control group, which was matched to the current H1N1 seasonal flu strain (A/California/07/09), those immunized with our immunotherapy generated a higher or similar percentage of positive HAI titer responders against all of the strains except for A/California/07/09. As anticipated, the TIV recipients generated the best HAI titers against the matched strain, but did not generate vaccine-induced response rates against the unmatched strains. 

We are conducting optimization studies in animal models to further strengthen our H1N1 immunotherapy's potency against all strains, especially the current circulating strain, A/California/07/09, as well as to reduce the number of injections needed to generate protective responses against multiple strains. 

In December 2012 we reported interim results of a phase I trial that showed that a single dose of our H1N1 universal SynCon &#174; &#32;flu immunotherapy followed with a dose of a seasonal flu vaccine generated protective immune responses in 40% of trial subjects compared with a 20% response rate in elderly patients who received the seasonal flu vaccine alone. 

People over 65 years of age represent about 90% of annual influenza deaths in the US. Older people's immune systems typically mount much weaker protective immune responses to seasonal vaccines, often in only 10 to 20% of this population. In younger adults, the same flu vaccines generate protective immune responses in at least 65% of the vaccine recipients. Other approaches, such as the use of higher vaccine doses and novel adjuvants, have not significantly improved the seasonal vaccine's impact in the older population. Thus, there is a significant need for a new approach to provide better protection in this more vulnerable population. 

With the vulnerability of the elderly in mind, this phase I study evaluated the ability of Inovio's SynCon &#174; &#32;immunotherapy alone, as well as in combination with the 2012 seasonal influenza vaccine, to generate protective levels of antigen-specific antibody immune responses in a greater proportion of the elderly population as well as to assess the potential for more universal protection against both matched and unmatched seasonal influenza strains. 

In the trial, conducted at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, 50 healthy elderly patients were divided into three groups: one group of 20 subjects received a two-dose regimen of Inovio's H1N1 universal SynCon &#174; &#32;flu immunotherapy delivered using Inovio's proprietary CELLECTRA &#174; &#32;intradermal electroporation device 16 weeks apart; a second group of 20 subjects received one dose of Inovio's SynCon &#174; &#32;immunotherapy delivered using electroporation followed by a dose of seasonal flu vaccine 16 weeks later; a third group of 10 subjects received placebo delivered by electroporation followed by a dose of the seasonal flu vaccine 16 weeks later. The study's objectives were to assess the tolerability, safety, and immune responses of these different immunization regimens. 

Serum samples from the immunized subjects were used to assess the generation of hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers meeting or exceeding a dilution of 1:40 to the current H1N1 seasonal flu strain (A/California/07/09). An HAI titer of 1:40 is the level recognized as a protective immune response against influenza in humans. Because of generally high HAI titer background rates to the A/California/07/09 strain, immunotherapy-specific, protective response rates were determined by assessing the number of patients in each group who had HAI titers greater than 1:40 and HAI titers at least 4-fold higher than the background value at the start of the trial. In reported interim data, immunization with the H1N1 universal SynCon &#174; &#32;flu immunotherapy followed with a dose of a seasonal flu vaccine generated protective immune responses in 40% (8 of 20) of trial subjects compared with a 20% (2 of 10) response rate in elderly patients who received the seasonal flu vaccine alone. We are analyzing the final data with the intent to prepare a paper for submission to a peer-reviewed scientific publication. 

Finally, on our path to develop a universal seasonal flu immunotherapy we are completing tests in animal models of our immunotherapy constructs for A/H3N2 and Type B influenza. Our goal is to develop immunotherapies that can also generate HAI titers exceeding 1:40 against unmatched strains within the H3N2 and Type B subtypes. In January 2012, we reported that our immunotherapies for influenza Type A H3N2 and Type B achieved protective antibody responses in immunized animals against multiple unmatched strains. 

In the study of our SynCon &#174; &#32;H3N2 immunotherapy, investigators immunized small animals (mice and guinea pigs) with a vaccine designed to produce the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigen in the animals. Inovio investigators have to date tested blood samples from the animals for immune responses against unmatched strains from several clades of H3N2. (Like the branches of a tree, there are dozens of distinct strains within each of these clades). The animals immunized with the SynCon &#174; &#32;H3N2 immunotherapy developed HI titers exceeding the 1:40 level commonly associated with protective immunity against several clades of H3N2 tested. These included strains circulating in the 2000-01, 2006-07, and 2008-09 influenza seasons, which had necessitated a change in the composition of the seasonal flu vaccine for those years. Additional animal testing of the remaining few H3N2 clades continued through 2012 and was to include a new strain, H3N2v (A/Indiana/10/2011 X203), which was selected in January 2012 by the CDC as a pandemic vaccine target. 

Similarly, in the study of our SynCon &#174; &#32;Type B immunotherapy, investigators tested blood samples from immunized mice for immune responses against multiple, unmatched strains of Type B influenza. All the animals immunized with the SynCon &#174; &#32;Type B immunotherapy developed HI titers exceeding the 1:40 level against all of the strains of Type B tested, including those circulating and consequently a part of the vaccine formulation in 2001-02, 2008-09, and 2011-12. Type B influenza mutates more slowly than Type A, but enough to preclude lasting immunity. Type B influenza can lead to life-threatening complications, including pneumonia, in young children, persons over 50, those with chronic diseases (e.g. diabetes) or suppressed immune systems, and others at risk for complications. 

We are seeking additional grant and/or partner funding to advance this program further. 

Ebola 

The Ebola virus has been described as one of the most virulent viral diseases known to man with lethality rates approaching 90%. Ebola can spread through human-to-human transmission by direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or bodily fluids of an infected individual and with surfaces or materials that contain the contaminated fluids of an infected person, such as bedding and clothing. It is capable of causing death within two to twenty-one days of exposure. There are no approved preventive vaccines or effective therapeutic treatments for Ebola. In addition, various experimental approaches have already been associated with undesirable side effects and limited ability to scale manufacturing. 

According to the CDC, the 2014 Ebola epidemic was the largest in history, resulting in 28,603 suspected and confirmed cases and 11,301 deaths (as of January 31, 2016). 

In 2014 we announced our intent to advance our DNA immunotherapy for Ebola into a phase I clinical trial in collaboration with GeneOne Life Science Inc. In the collaboration, Inovio and GeneOne agreed to co-develop Inovio's DNA-based Ebola immunotherapy through a phase I clinical trial. The decision to advance our Ebola immunotherapy was based on 

positive results achieved in preclinical studies. We observed that 100% of immunized guinea pigs and mice were protected from death after being exposed to the Ebola virus. Unlike the non-immunized animals, immunized animals were also protected from weight loss, a measure of morbidity. Researchers found significant increases in neutralizing antibody titers and strong and broad levels of immunotherapy-induced T-cells, including "killer" T-cells, suggesting that this product could provide both preventive and treatment benefits. This data was published in 2013 in the peer-reviewed journal Molecular Therapy &#32;in a paper, "Induction of Broad Cytotoxic T Cells by Protective DNA Vaccination Against Marburg and Ebola." 

In April 2015 the company received a grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to lead a collaborative team to develop multiple treatment and prevention approaches against Ebola. Other collaborators are MedImmune, the global biologics research and development arm of AstraZeneca; GeneOne Life Sciences and its manufacturing subsidiary, VGXI, Inc.; and David B. Weiner, PhD, executive vice president at the Wistar Institute and retired professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at The Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Emory University and Vanderbilt University. The previous collaboration agreement with GeneOne for Ebola was incorporated into this consortium funded by DARPA. 

The Inovio-led consortium is taking a multi-faceted approach to develop products to prevent and treat Ebola infection. These programs include development and early clinical testing of: 

&#8226; 

A therapeutic DNA-based monoclonal antibody product dMAb &#8482; &#32;against the Ebola virus infection. This promising new technology has properties that best fit a response to the outbreak in that they could be designed and manufactured expediently on a large scale using common fermentation technology, are thermal-stable, and may provide more rapid therapeutic benefit. 

&#8226; 

A highly potent conventional protein-based therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) product against Ebola virus infection. 

&#8226; 

A DNA-based vaccine against Ebola. 

Pathogen specific mAbs have emerged as a viable approach for immunoprophylaxis against Ebola and other pathogens where anti-viral drugs or vaccinations are not currently available. mAbs can be administered either just before or just after exposure to the pathogen and serve to combat the immediate effects of the pathogen. Unlike vaccines, immunoprophylaxis by mAbs does not develop long term immune memory. Therefore an ideal approach would include the administration of a mAb for immediate protection and a vaccine to train the immune system for longer term protection. 

Previous Ebola research studies have shown that monoclonal antibodies (such as ZMapp) could be useful in treating patients who have been infected with Ebola virus by selectively binding and neutralizing the virus in the body. 

The award covers pre-clinical development costs for the dMAb products and protein mAb candidates as well as GMP manufacturing costs and the phase I clinical study costs with the three product candidates. The academic partners are leading Ebola research and medical centers at the front edge of the discovery efforts for highly potent anti-Ebola mAbs. The funding period is over two years and covers a base award of $21 million and an option award of $24 million, which was exercised in September 2015. The development proposal includes a second option of $11 million to support additional product supply and clinical development activities. The options are contingent upon the successful completion of certain pre-clinical development milestones. 

The aim of the research is to evaluate a DNA vaccine and conventional or DNA based monoclonal antibody. In May 2015 the collaborators initiated a phase I trial (EBOV-001, ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02464670) &#32; for the Ebola DNA vaccine to evaluate safety, tolerability and immune responses in 75 healthy subjects. The study is evaluating INO-4212 and its components INO-4201 and INO-4202, alone or in combination with INO-9012 (DNA-based IL-12), delivered into muscle or skin using Inovio's proprietary DNA delivery technology. Enrollment and treatment has been completed and we expect to report data in 2016. 

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) 

MERS is a viral respiratory illness first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. MERS appears to have been transmitted from an animal reservoir to humans but human to human transmission has been confirmed. The virus has not been shown to spread in a sustained way in communities, but the situation is still evolving. Like the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, which infected 8,000 people and was fatal in nearly 10% of cases, MERS is caused by a coronavirus and appears to cause a severe lung infection. MERS differs in that it also causes rapid kidney failure. Its extremely high death rate has caused serious concern among global health officials. There is no vaccine or effective treatment against MERS. Since 2012 MERS has infected over 1,500 people and killed almost 600 (40%). Recently, the largest outbreak outside of Saudi Arabia of this emergent global health concern infected 186 people with 36 fatalities in South Korea. MERS is considered to have pandemic potential. 

In November 2013 Inovio announced that preclinical testing of its SynCon &#174; &#32;MERS vaccine (GLS-5300) induced robust and durable immune responses, demonstrating the potential for such a vaccine to prevent and treat this deadly virus. 

DNA vaccine constructs targeting multiple MERS antigens were designed using Inovio's SynCon &#174; &#32;vaccine platform with the goal to universally protect against multiple strains of MERS, which has been shown to have diverse genetic variants. These SynCon &#174; &#32;constructs were administered via Inovio's CELLECTRA &#174; &#32;electroporation-based delivery technology. 

A consensus MERS "spike" protein vaccine construct was created based on multiple strains of the MERS virus. Inovio's MERS DNA vaccine was immunogenic in mice and seroconversion, or the development of detectable specific antibodies in the blood as a result of immunization, was observed in all animals. Furthermore, the antibodies generated by the vaccine in 100% of mice (20 of 20) were able to neutralize or completely block actual infection of MERS virus in the cells, demonstrating the protective potential of this vaccine. In contrast, none of the unvaccinated mice in the control group (10) generated neutralizing antibodies. 

The vaccinations were also highly T-cell immunogenic, generating robust and broad T cell responses as extensively analyzed by the standardized T cell ELISPOT assay. The vaccine produced robust CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses against multiple epitopes of the MERS spike protein. This increased diversity and magnitude of cellular responses may be critical for effectively mitigating MERS infection. 

These findings are vital given the importance of neutralizing antibodies in preventing infection and the role T cells play in clearing infection by killing cells that harbor the virus. 

In May 2015 Inovio announced it would advance its MERS vaccine into a phase I clinical trial in healthy volunteers in a collaboration with GeneOne Life Science Inc. 

In August 2015 Inovio announced that its MERS vaccine induced 100% protection from a live virus challenge in a preclinical study in mice, camels and monkeys, or non-human primates. In all three species, the vaccine induced robust immune responses capable of preventing the virus from infecting cells. The data from camels is an important finding because camels represent not only a host reservoir of the disease but act as a mode of transmission to humans. In monkeys, all vaccinated animals in the study were protected from symptoms of MERS disease when challenged with a live MERS virus. 

The results appeared in the peer-reviewed journal Science Translational Medicine in an article entitled, "A synthetic consensus anti-spike protein DNA vaccine induces protective immunity against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus in non-human primates." Inovio's collaborators for this study included researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, Public Health Agency of Canada, NIH, University of Washington, and University of South Florida. 

Vaccinations of GLS-5300 in this phase I study of 75 healthy subjects began in February 2016 at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) in Maryland, where the trial is being conducted. The primary and secondary goals of this first-in-man phase I trial are to obtain safety and immunogenicity data. This trial represents the first MERS vaccine to be tested in humans for this disease that has no approved vaccines or treatments. 

Zika Virus 

First identified in Uganda, Zika virus subsequently spread to equatorial Asia and over the past two years has rapidly spread through the South Pacific, including Hawaii, and to South America, Central America, and the Caribbean. Zika virus is a flavivirus, a family of viruses including yellow fever, dengue, and West Nile virus, which are introduced to people through mosquito bites. Because the Aedes species of mosquitoes that spread Zika virus is found throughout the world there is concern that outbreaks will spread to new countries. There is also concern that Zika can spread sexually, as has been reported for some returning travelers. In February 2016 WHO stated that 39 countries had reported locally acquired circulation of the Zika virus since January 2007. Geographical distribution of the virus has steadily expanded. No vaccine or therapy currently exists for the Zika virus. 

The most common symptoms of Zika virus are fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis. More seriously, health authorities have observed neurological and autoimmune complications potentially associated with Zika virus, including microcephaly in newborn children and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Microcephaly is a rare condition marked by an abnormally small head and incomplete brain development. There may also be a link with Guillain-Barr&#233; syndrome, a disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks peripheral nerves. Symptoms start with muscle weakness. In severe cases the person is almost totally paralyzed and the disorder can be life threatening. 

In January 2016 Inovio and GeneOne Life Sciences announced a joint research collaboration with academic collaborators of a SynCon &#174; Zika virus vaccine (GLS-5700). In February 2016 the companies announced preclinical results indicating that the vaccine administered using Inovio's CELLECTRA &#174; electroporation delivery technology induced robust and durable immune responses, demonstrating potential to prevent and treat infections from this harmful pathogen. The vaccine resulted in seroconversion, or the development of detectable specific antibodies in the blood, in all vaccinated mice. The vaccinations generated robust and broad T cell responses as analyzed by the standardized T cell ELISPOT assay. 

Inovio and GeneOne plan to initiate phase I human testing of the Zika vaccine before the end of 2016. 

Immunotherapies for Biodefense and Biosecurity 

A number of infectious agents that are relatively rare today are poised for an upsurge in incidence by either &#8220;natural&#8221; or terrorism-related means. For example, natural threats are posed by the influenza strains H5N1 and H7N9. At the same time, an engineered influenza virus for intentional release would pose a significant human threat. 

Since 2001, the United States government has spent or allocated over a billion dollars in funding to address the threat of biological weapons. United States funding for bioweapons-related activities focuses primarily on research for and acquisition of medicines for defense. Biodefense funding also goes toward stockpiling protective equipment, increased surveillance and detection of biological agents, and improving state and hospital preparedness. The increase in this type of funding recently is mainly due to the Project BioShield Act adopted in 2004. 

There are opportunities to secure development funding and for proof-of principle immunotherapy studies for biowarfare pathogens. Over the past five years, we have been successful at securing funding from the US government for such projects. 

The company continues to actively pursue grant and contract funding from the NIH, Department of Defense and other government funding agencies as an important source of non-dilutive funding to support development of specific technologies that are broadly applicable across multiple product development programs in the areas of cancer, infectious diseases and biodefense. Based on various initiatives and with the support of NIH funding we are an active collaborator with the Department of Defense (U.S. Army) and continue research and development of DNA-based immunotherapies delivered via our proprietary electroporation system. Specifically, our projects are focused on identifying immunotherapy candidates with the potential to provide rapid, robust immunity to protect against bio-warfare and bioterror attacks as well as development of our electroporation devices. 

In March 2011 we received a U.S. Department of Defense Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant to test the feasibility of delivering DNA vaccines by intradermal electroporation simultaneously to two or more spatially distinct sites on the body. The purpose of such a prototype device would be to mitigate potential immune interference that may result from combination vaccines that are formulated together. The device design would also facilitate rapid vaccination against multiple emerging infectious disease or pandemic threats and better meet the demands of quickly vaccinating U.S. troops stationed around the world. 

In April 2012 we received a U.S. Department of Defense SBIR grant to advance the development of a low-cost, non-invasive surface electroporation delivery device and test its utility in combination with our novel DNA immunotherapies against viruses with bioterrorism potential, including hanta, puumala, arenavirus and pandemic influenza. This project is a continuation of a first-stage DOD grant in 2011 that initiated Inovio's development of this skin delivery system. 

In the first phase of this project, Inovio focused on optimizing the device design of our current minimally invasive surface EP device. In this second phase, the objective was to further advance and validate this device and the resulting immune responses in appropriate animal models. We also investigated the development and manufacture of low-cost sterile disposables for the device and the possibility of integrating dermal injection capabilities into a combined inject/EP device platform. 

Subsequent to year end, in January 2016 Inovio was selected to receive a $500,000 grant from the U.S. Army&#8217;s SBIR program to further advance the development of Inovio&#8217;s next generation delivery device capable of simultaneously administering multiple vaccines via a skin-surface, needle-free electroporation delivery. The primary goal of this effort is to further advance and commercialize a needle and pain-free electroporation device to deliver products from Inovio&#8217;s portfolio of biodefense and commercial infectious disease vaccines including those for MERS, Ebola, HIV, influenza, and RSV, particularly for prophylactic vaccination. Such a device could facilitate rapid vaccination of U.S. troops stationed around the world against multiple infectious diseases and protect civilian populations from pandemic threats. Initial testing of a prototype design has already yielded excellent antigen expression and immunogenicity from the dermal tissue being accessed using this novel non-invasive electroporation delivery concept. 

Synthetic Monoclonal Antibodies dMAb TM &#160; 

Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have become one of the most valuable therapeutic technologies of recent years. In 2012, global sales of monoclonal antibodies exceeded $50 billion. Among the top 10 best-selling drugs in 2012, six of them were monoclonal antibodies, each with annual sales exceeding $5 billion. 

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are designed to enhance the immune system's ability to regulate cell functions. They are designed to bind to a very specific epitope (area) of an antigen or cell surface target and can bind to almost any selected target. They have the unique ability to alert the immune system to attack and kill specific cancer cells (as in the case of Yervoy&#174;) or block certain biochemical pathways (such as those leading to rheumatoid arthritis, as in the case of Remicade &#174; ). However, mAb technology has limitations. As a passive immunotherapy, meaning they are manufactured outside the body, mAbs require costly large-scale laboratory development and production. Additional limitations include high cost to develop and manufacture, their limited duration of in vivo potency, and a pharmacokinetic profile that can result in toxicity. We have 

created DNA based monoclonal antibodies that overcome many of the limitations associated with conventional mAb technology. 

Using our core platform technology, we encode the DNA sequence for a specific monoclonal antibody in a DNA plasmid. We deliver the plasmid directly into cells of the body using electroporation, enabling these cells to manufacture the mAbs in vivo - not outside of the body like conventional mAb technology. This approach provides potentially significant production costs advantages. More importantly, we believe our dMAbs can target a pharmacokinetic profile that provides significant control and advantages in terms of dosing regimen, peak responses, duration of responses, and toxicity. 

We expect to design dMAbs not only for new disease targets not currently addressable with conventional mAbs; we can also target existing, commercially successful mAb products. This new application of our core technology platform represents another potentially paradigm-shifting transformation in the immunotherapy field with very significant business potential. We have already designed and produced dMAbs targeting cancer mechanisms including checkpoint inhibition, anti-cancer pathways, e.g. like Herceptin, and anti-Tregs, as well as prophylactic and therapeutic dMAbs for infectious diseases including Ebola, influenza, antibiotic resistant bacteria, dengue and Chikungunya. When the Mab binds to an infectious disease receptor, the immune system then generates natural killer cells and macrophages to clear the virus or bacteria-bound Mabs. 

Proof of Concept 

Our first published research on a DNA-based on monoclonal antibody was presented in October 2013 in Human Vaccines &#38; Immunotherapeutics &#32;in a paper entitled, &#8220;Optimized and enhanced DNA plasmid vector based in vivo construction of a neutralizing anti-HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein Fab.&#8221; The results demonstrated that delivery by this method of a single administration of the optimized Fab expressing constructs resulted in generation of Fab molecules in mouse sera possessing high antigen binding and HIV neutralization activity for at least 7 days against diverse HIV isolates. Importantly, this delivery strategy resulted in a rapid increase (i.e., in as little as 48 h) in Fab levels when compared with protein-based immunization. 

In a second preclinical study, we demonstrated that animals transfected with our DNA-based mAb targeting Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) exhibited the specific ability to bind to the CHIKV envelope antigen and this serum possessed CHIKV-neutralizing activity. The treatment of the animals with anti-CHIKV mAb plasmids protected 100% of the treated animals from a lethal injection of CHIKV virus while 100% of the control animals died. The treated animals were also spared virus-related morbidity, as measured by dramatic weight loss and lethargy. Results from this study were presented as a poster at the 17th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Gene &#38; Cell Therapy in Washington, DC. 

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a serious mosquito-borne alpha-virus responsible for several recent epidemics in tropical Africa and Asia. In mid-2015 the CDC reported that suspected or confirmed cases of Chikungunya had reached 1.74 million in 45 countries or territories in the Americas. There is currently no vaccine or therapeutic against this virus. 

A second paper was published in July 2016 in Scientific Reports, a Nature Publishing Group journal, in the paper, "Protection against dengue disease by synthetic nucleic acid antibody prophylaxis/immunotherapy." In this study, a single intramuscular injection of a DNA plasmid encoding a monoclonal antibody targeting dengue protected mice subsequently exposed to the dengue virus. The protection conferred by the monoclonal antibodies expressed by these dMAbs was very rapid, with 100% survival in mice challenged with lethal enhanced dengue disease less than a week after dMAb administration. While conventional vaccine and monoclonal antibody technologies have shown limited ability to provide an effective solution to dengue to date, the unique attributes and data generated by dMAbs show their potential to provide a needed solution. Furthermore, this short time frame to achieve full protection is significantly more rapid than vaccine-driven protection, which can take weeks to months to reach peak efficacy levels. 

Next Steps 

In October 2014 we announced that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) awarded $12.2 million to scientists from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Inovio Pharmaceuticals, and MedImmune to develop and assess dMAbs in preclinical studies. 

This collaboration aims to demonstrate that the DNA plasmids containing optimized DNA sequences encoded to generate disease-specific dMAbs can activate sufficient quantities of specific monoclonal antibodies in the body to be protective against a pathogen challenge. Using the capabilities and advantages of DNA plasmids delivered using electroporation, the team is constructing and evaluating multiple dMAbs focused on influenza virus and antibiotic resistant bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus). Successful completion of the initial preclinical activities under the DARPA grant would lead to clinical studies on selected product candidates to be funded under a future increment to the award. 

In April 2015 the company received a grant from DARPA to lead a collaborative team to develop multiple treatment and prevention approaches against Ebola. Other collaborators are MedImmune, the global biologics research and development arm 

of AstraZeneca; GeneOne Life Sciences and its manufacturing subsidiary, VGXI, Inc.; and David B. Weiner, PhD, Emory University and Vanderbilt University. 

The consortium is taking a multi-faceted approach to develop products to prevent and treat Ebola infection. These programs include development and early clinical testing of: 

&#8226; 

A therapeutic DNA-based monoclonal antibody product dMAb &#8482; &#32;against the Ebola virus infection. This promising new technology has properties that best fit a response to the outbreak in that they could be designed and manufactured expediently on a large scale using common fermentation technology, are thermal-stable, and may provide more rapid therapeutic benefit. 

&#8226; 

A highly potent conventional protein-based therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) product against Ebola virus infection. 

&#8226; 

A DNA-based vaccine against Ebola. 

The aim of this research is to compare combinations of a DNA vaccine with conventional or DNA-based monoclonal antibodies. 

Of further significance to Inovio, this research will help build the base of knowledge with which to advance other dMAb product candidates with significant market potential against multiple types of infection as well as cancer. 

Electroporation Delivery Technology 

The essence of our platform is to design and inject a DNA plasmid encoded for a target antigen or monoclonal antibody into tissue of the body and most pertinently, into cells, to enable the intracellular machinery that normally produces useful proteins for the functioning of the body to temporarily produce the target antigen or monoclonal antibody. An antigen will then induce the immune system to produce polyclonal antibodies or T cells with the ability to perform their preventive or therapeutic functions. Monoclonal antibodies generated in this manner can bind to targeted cells and enable the immune system to clear these cells. Fundamental to this mechanism functioning well and providing clinical utility is that there be significant cellular uptake of the DNA plasmids. 

Inovio is the leader in refining the methods and conditions for using in vivo electroporation to enable cellular transfection and significant uptake of a locally injected biologic material. Our electroporation technology has shown a preeminent ability to safely and effectively deliver DNA-based immunotherapies. Numerous human studies have to date demonstrated best-in-class immune responses from DNA immunotherapies delivered using electroporation. 

Electroporation uses controlled, millisecond electrical pulses to create temporary pores in the cell membrane and allow significant cellular uptake of a synthetic DNA immunotherapy previously injected into muscle or skin. The uptake is up to 1000 fold greater than the injection of a DNA plasmid alone without other delivery mechanisms (&#8220;Electroporation delivery of DNA vaccines: prospects for success,&#8221; Current Opinion in Immunology , June 2011, Niranjan Y Sardesai and David B Weiner). The cellular machinery then uses the DNA&#8217;s instructions to produce the encoded antigen or monoclonal antibody. 

The combination of Inovio's synthetic DNA immunotherapies delivered using its electroporation devices has to date shown a favorable safety profile, without serious adverse events and only mild local injection-related side effects such as redness and swelling; it is tolerable without anesthetic; and because it does not induce unwanted immune responses, it can be repeatedly administered for booster vaccinations. 

Choice of Tissue for DNA Delivery 

Skeletal muscle has been a core focus for delivery of DNA-based immunotherapies via electroporation because it is mainly composed of large elongated cells with multiple nuclei. Muscle cells are non-dividing, hence long-term expression can be obtained without integration of the gene of interest into the genome. Muscle cells have been shown to have a capacity for secretion of proteins into the blood stream. Secreted therapeutic proteins may therefore act systemically and produce therapeutic effects in distant tissues of the body. In this respect, the muscle functions as a factory for the production of the biopharmaceutical needed by the body. As observed in our phase II study (HPV-related cervical dysplasia), intramuscular delivery by electroporation of DNA encoded antigens has been shown to induce both humoral (antibody) and cellular (T cell) immune responses. We envision that delivery of DNA by electroporation to muscle cells will circumvent the costly and complicated production procedures of viral gene delivery vectors, bacterial gene delivery vectors protein-based drugs, conventional vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. This approach may provide long-term stable expression of a therapeutic protein or monoclonal antibody at a sustained level. 

While we have generated pre-clinical and clinical evidence that intramuscular electroporation-based DNA delivery will be effective for a number of immunotherapies, electroporation of the skin may also be a relevant route of administration. Skin or intradermal administration is important and is becoming an attractive site for immunization given its high density of antigen 

presenting cells (APCs). Unlike muscle, skin is the first line of defense against most pathogens and is therefore very rich in immune cells and molecules. Skin specifically contains certain cells that are known to help in generating a robust immune response. With intradermal administration of electroporation, we may be able to demonstrate a comparable immune response to muscle delivery. Drug delivery into skin, or dermal tissue, is attractive given that the skin is the largest, most accessible, and most easily monitored organ of the human body, and it is highly immuno-competent (able to recognize antigens and mount an immune response to them). 

Our CELLECTRA &#174; &#32;Electroporation Systems 

There are several configurations in the CELLECTRA &#174; &#32;device family. The first configuration covers intramuscular (IM) delivery of DNA; the second covers intradermal/subcutaneous delivery (ID) of DNA. Devices with these configurations have been validated, manufactured under Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and are being used in human clinical trials. We have filed a device master file (MAF) with the FDA covering the use of the CELLECTRA &#174; -IM EP device in human clinical trials. These devices are intended to be used in combination with a DNA plasmid-based immunotherapy. 

Our past electroporation systems consisted of an electrical pulse generator box the size of a large laptop attached by a cord to a separate needle-electrode applicator. More recently we designed and have completed engineering, manufacturing, quality control, and regulatory steps to introduce a new series of devices. Bringing together groundbreaking advancements, the new CELLECTRA &#174; - SP products combine the functionality of our current generation of skin and intramuscular electroporation devices in clinical testing with enhanced form, design, and portability. All components of the pulse generator and applicator are integrated into a cordless, rechargeable device. The rechargeable battery can enable immunization of several hundred subjects, making the device highly amenable to mass vaccination. The devices are designed to accommodate different electrode arrays to meet the requirements of the particular immunotherapy and targeted tissue for delivery (ie skin or muscle). 

The new CELLECTRA&#174;-5PSP device has been designed and developed to support the VGX-3100 phase III study, which we expect to start in 2016, and commercial product development. 

Next Generation Electroporation Research and Devices 

All of our electroporation delivery systems noted above can increase levels of gene expression (i.e. production of the immune-stimulating protein the immunotherapy was coded to produce) of DNA immunotherapies by 1000-fold or more compared to delivery of DNA immunotherapies via conventional injection alone. Delivery of our SynCon &#174; &#32;immunotherapies into muscle or skin tissue with our electroporation systems have generated robust immune responses in humans against cervical dysplasia, influenza (H5N1 and H1N1), and HIV, as well as against other diseases in animal models. 

While our current intramuscular (IM) delivery technologies are well tolerated, we are also advancing next generation, minimally invasive intradermal electroporation delivery devices. One intradermal (ID) device penetrates no more than 3 mm into the target tissue, compared to intramuscular devices that go deeper. The positive immunological effects in preclinical animal models of the optimized electroporation parameters of this minimally invasive ID EP delivery device were highlighted in September 2012 in Human Gene Therapy &#32;in a paper entitled, &#8220;Intradermal DNA vaccination enhanced by low-current electroporation improves antigen expression and induces robust cellular and humoral immune responses.&#8221; The optimized conditions decreased required immunotherapy dose levels, increased tolerability of the vaccination, and increased the breadth of viable vaccine targets. This research was funded in part by a $25 million HIV vaccine development contract from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a $3.1 million National Institutes of Health Director's Transformative Research Award for universal flu vaccine development. 

In March 2011 we received a U.S. Department of Defense Small Business Innovation Research Grant to test the feasibility of delivering unique DNA vaccines by intradermal electroporation simultaneously to two or more spatially distinct sites on the body. Results from this research revealed that this device could allow for the delivery of multi-plasmid formulations without the risk of interference of immune responses from combination vaccines that are formulated together. This could be useful for combination immunotherapies that are rapidly formulated such as in response to emerging infectious disease threats or pandemics and could overcome the issue of limited dosing often associated with intradermal delivery. Results from this study were published in Human Vaccines Immunotherapeutics &#32;in a paper titled, &#8220;A multi-head intradermal electroporation device allows for tailored and increased dose DNA immunotherapy delivery to the skin.&#8221; 

A second ID approach is surface electroporation (SEP) using a device that sits on the skin and uses a virtually undetectable scratch to facilitate electroporation and intracellular delivery of the immunotherapy. 

In October 2010 research on this minimally-invasive DNA vaccine delivery device was published in Gene Therapy &#32;in the paper, "Prototype development and preclinical immunogenicity analysis of a novel minimally invasive electroporation device." Using voltages averaging roughly seven times less than our current devices, this very low voltage device, which does not penetrate the skin, further enhances the previously established tolerability of Inovio's electroporation devices. DNA vaccines delivered using this device produced strong antibody and T-cell immune responses and achieved protection from lethal challenge in multiple animal models including non-human primates. 

In April 2012 we received an SBIR grant to advance the development of a low-cost, non-invasive surface electroporation delivery device and test its utility in combination with Inovio's novel synthetic DNA vaccines against viruses with bioterrorism potential, including hanta, puumala, arenavirus and pandemic influenza. This project was a continuation of the DOD grant awarded in 201l. The objective was to further advance and validate this device and the resulting immune responses in appropriate animal models. The research also investigated the development and manufacture of low-cost sterile disposables for the device and the possibility of integrating dermal injection capabilities into a combined inject/EP device platform. 

Subsequent to year end, in January 2016 we received a $500,000 grant from the U.S. Army&#8217;s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program to further advance the development of a device capable of simultaneously administering multiple vaccines via skin-surface, needle-free electroporation delivery. 

We have also been researching other avenues for needle-free, contactless electroporation technology for immunotherapy delivery. In February 2011 Human Vaccines &#32;published our paper entitled, &#8220;Piezoelectric permeabilization of mammalian dermal tissue for in vivo DNA delivery leads to enhanced protein expression and increased immunogenicity.&#8221; This innovative electroporation method is based on the generation of an electric field or electric potential by certain materials in response to applied mechanical stress. 

With the advancement of these devices our aim is to make electroporation delivery amenable to mass prophylactic vaccination by decreasing dose levels, increasing tolerability of the vaccination, increasing the breadth of viable immunotherapy targets, and enhancing portability. Our data related to influenza, HIV, malaria, and smallpox antigens demonstrate that DNA delivery with this newer generation of ID delivery including SEP devices yields levels of immunogenicity in terms of both antibody and T cell responses and/or efficacy against a virus challenge that is comparable to intramuscular electroporation devices currently in the clinic. 

Corporate Development 

We have entered into various arrangements with corporate, academic, and government collaborators, licensors, licensees and others. These arrangements are summarized below and elsewhere in this annual report. In addition, we conduct ongoing discussions with potential collaborators, licensors and licensees. 

Strategic Partnerships and Collaborations 

Inovio has two significant strategic partnerships with pharmaceutical companies and a development collaboration covering multiple disease programs. 

In August 2015 we entered into a strategic cancer vaccine collaboration and license agreement with MedImmune, the global biologics research and development arm of AstraZeneca. Under the agreement, MedImmune acquired exclusive rights to Inovio's INO-3112 immunotherapy, which targets cancers caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18. MedImmune intends to study INO-3112 in combination with selected immunotherapy molecules within its pipeline in HPV-driven cancers. 

Under the terms of the agreement, MedImmune made an upfront payment of $27.5 million to Inovio in the third quarter of 2015. MedImmune will fund all development costs. The agreement also calls for potential future payments totaling up to $700 million upon reaching development and commercial milestones. Inovio is entitled to receive up to double-digit tiered royalties on INO-3112 product sales. 

Within the broader collaboration, MedImmune and Inovio will develop up to two additional DNA-based cancer vaccine products not included in Inovio's current product pipeline, which MedImmune will have the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize. Inovio will receive development, regulatory and commercialization milestone payments and will be eligible to receive royalties on worldwide net sales for these additional cancer vaccine products. 

This partnership represents an important step in executing Inovio&#8217;s immuno-oncology combination strategy and advancing Inovio's cancer vaccine R&#38;D pipeline. This agreement builds on the existing partnership between Inovio and MedImmune on two research and development collaborations funded by DARPA focused on developing DNA-based monoclonal antibodies for Ebola, influenza, and bacterial infections. 

In September 2013 we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Roche to research, develop and commercialize our multi-antigen DNA immunotherapies targeting prostate cancer (INO-5150) and hepatitis B (INO-1800). Under the terms of the agreement, Roche made an upfront payment of $10 million to Inovio and agreed to pay for all ongoing development costs and certain development, regulatory and commercial event based payments. Roche also agreed to potentially pay additional development event based payments if Roche pursues other indications with INO-5150 or INO-1800. 

In November 2014 Roche terminated the agreement to co-develop INO-5150 as well as their research collaboration in prostate cancer. All of Roche's rights to INO-5150, including the right to license the product to other parties, were returned to 

Inovio. Due to the termination the potential future event based milestone payments payable to Inovio by Roche were reduced. Inovio independently initiated a phase I clinical trial of INO-5150 in July 2015. 

Inovio and Roche continue to collaborate and co-develop Inovio&#8217;s DNA immunotherapy (INO-1800) against hepatitis B virus under the existing license agreement. The partners launched the phase I study of INO-1800 in April 2015. 

In March 2010 we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with GeneOne Life Science Inc. (formerly VGX International Inc.). Under the Agreement, we granted GeneOne an exclusive license to our SynCon &#174; &#32;universal influenza vaccine (the &#8220;Product&#8221;) delivered with electroporation to be developed in certain countries in Asia. 

As consideration for this license we have received a research and development initiation fee, as well as research support and annual license maintenance fees, and will receive royalties on net product sales. In addition, contingent upon achievement of clinical and regulatory milestones, we will receive development payments over the term of the Agreement. The Agreement also provides us with exclusive rights to supply devices for clinical and commercial purposes (including single use components) to GeneOne for use in the Product. 

The term of the Agreement commenced upon execution and will extend on a country by country basis until the last to expire of all Royalty Periods for the territory (as such term is defined in the Agreement) for any Product in that country, unless the Agreement is terminated earlier in accordance with its provisions as a result of breach, by mutual agreement, or by GeneOne's right to terminate without cause upon prior written notice. 

In October 2011, we entered into a product development collaboration agreement with GeneOne to co-develop our SynCon &#174; &#32;immunotherapies for hepatitis B and C infections. Under the terms of the agreement, GeneOne received marketing rights for these immunotherapies in Asia, excluding Japan, and in return was to fully fund IND-enabling and initial phase I and II clinical studies. We will receive payments based on the achievement of clinical milestones and royalties based on sales in the licensed territories and will retain all commercial rights in all other territories. 

In conjunction with our announcement of our Roche partnership we also announced that we reacquired the rights, title and interest to the SynCon &#174; &#32;hepatitis B immunotherapy in Asia from GeneOne. 

In September 2014 Inovio and GeneOne announced a collaboration in which the companies will co-develop Inovio&#8217;s DNA-based Ebola vaccine through a phase I clinical trial. In April 2015 the collaborators received an award from DARPA to further advance the Ebola project. The previous collaboration agreement with GeneOne for Ebola vacine was incorporated into this consortium funded by DAPRA. In May 2015 a phase I study of the DNA vaccine part of the project was initiated. Enrollment of this study has been completed. Details of this project are provided under Ebola above. 

In May 2015 Inovio announced it will advance its DNA vaccine for MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) into a phase I clinical trial in healthy volunteers in a collaboration with GeneOne. The agreement called for GeneOne to earn milestone-based co-ownership of the immunotherapy. In January 2016 the collaborators announced the initiation of recruitment for the phase I study in partnership with the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) in Maryland, where the trial is being conducted. 

In January 2016 Inovio and GeneOne announced the initiation of a collaborative research program to test and advance Inovio&#8217;s DNA-based vaccine for preventing and treating Zika virus. 

Core DNA Immunotherapy Technology and Product License 

Inovio has a core license agreement that secures the DNA-based immunotherapy technology and multiple products developed at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). The technology was developed in the UPenn laboratory of Professor David B. Weiner, a pioneer in the field of DNA-based vaccines and chairman of our scientific advisory board. 

Under the terms of an original license agreement with the UPenn completed in 2007 we obtained exclusive worldwide rights to develop multiple DNA plasmids and constructs with the potential to treat and/or prevent HIV, HCV, HPV and influenza. The agreement also included molecular adjuvants. This agreement and subsequent amendments provide for royalty payments, based on future sales, to UPenn. 

In January 2010, we announced that we expanded our existing license agreement with UPenn, adding exclusive worldwide licenses for technology and intellectual property for novel immunotherapies against pandemic influenza, Chikungunya, and FMD. The amendment also encompassed new chemokine and cytokine molecular adjuvant technologies. 

In July 2011, we expanded this license agreement by adding exclusive worldwide licenses for technology and intellectual property for novel immunotherapies against prostate cancer, herpes viruses, including CMV (cytomegalovirus), malaria, hepatitis B, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), and MRSA (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus). The amendment also encompassed a new optimized IL-12 cytokine gene adjuvant. 

In November 2012, we expanded this license agreement by adding worldwide rights to technology and intellectual property for novel vaccines against intestinal infections including Clostridium difficile, or C. difficile; cancer therapeutic 

vaccines targeting Wilms' tumor gene or WT1; and biodefense pathogens including Ebola and the family of Filovirus such as Marburg. 

In 2014 we added to our license agreement with UPenn by in-licensing expanded patents covering candidate products for DNA based antibodies and those covering dengue fever, H7N9 influenza, additional HPV serotypes, as well as certain other undisclosed cancer antigen targets. In addition, the amended agreement provides us global rights to DNA-based antibodies, immune activators (IL-21, IL-23 &#38; IL-33), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and tuberculosis. 

Other Collaborations and Grants 

Inovio has been successful in securing many different collaborations and grants to assist the research and advancement of its DNA based immunotherapies in multiple disease. 

In 2014 we acquired worldwide rights (excluding China) for early preclinical therapies addressing Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis based on the academic research of Dr. Bin Wang, a professor at Fudan University's Shanghai Medical College. These newly licensed technologies are based on patent-protected and published discoveries from Dr. Wang and his collaborator, who found a novel way to generate inducible regulatory T cells, or iTregs. These novel approaches could be used to develop therapies targeting major inflammatory diseases. 

In 2014 we along with the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and MedImmune were awarded $12.2 million from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to develop DNA-based monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for infectious disease treatment. Together we will develop and assess the dMAbs in preclinical studies using technology developed by Penn and licensed by Inovio. The collaboration will focus on influenza virus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Successful completion of the initial preclinical activities under the DARPA grant aims to lead to clinical studies on selected product candidates to be funded under a future increment to the award. 

In 2014 VGX Animal Health, Inc. (VAH), Inovio&#8217;s 85% owned subsidiary, concluded an agreement for the sale of its animal health assets to Plumbline Life Sciences, Inc. (PLS) of Korea. The assets transferred included an exclusive license with Inovio for animal applications of our growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) technology and animal DNA vaccines plus a non-exclusive license to our electroporation delivery systems. In May 2015, VGX Animal Health received payment of $1.0 million from PLS and is scheduled to receive an additional $1.0 million payment in 2016. VGX Animal Health received 20% of the outstanding shares of PLS and received additional shares to maintain its 20% equity ownership position in PLS until equity fund-raising by PLS reached $10.0 million in June 2015. In July 2015 Inovio's ownership in VGX Animal Health decreased from 91% to 85%. After the ownership changed, VGX Animal Health distributed its 465,364 shares of PLS to its shareholders in a pro-rata distribution. After the distribution, we held 395,758 shares, or approximately 16.9% of PLS common stock. We will receive milestone payments and royalties on product sales as well as retain the human applications of our GHRH technology. 

In March 2015 the company and its academic collaborators, including the University of Pennsylvania, were awarded a new five-year $16 million Integrated Preclinical/Clinical AIDS Vaccine Development Program grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The grant will fund research to expand PENNVAX &#174; &#32;coverage of HIV strains as well as to further enhance antibody responses generated by the vaccine. Inovio will couple its expertise in constructing, developing and manufacturing HIV vaccines with researchers from four world-leading academic institutions (University of Pennsylvania, Emory University, Duke University and the University of Massachusetts) along with VGXi, a contract DNA plasmid manufacturer, and Waisman Biomanufacturing, a contract protein manufacturer. (See the above section, HIV Preventive and Therapeutic Immune Therapies, for more details.) 

In April 2015 the company received a grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to lead a collaborative team to develop multiple treatment and prevention approaches against Ebola. Other collaborators are MedImmune, the global biologics research and development arm of AstraZeneca; GeneOne Life Sciences and its manufacturing subsidiary, VGXI, Inc.; and Professor David B. Weiner, PhD, professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at The Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Emory University and Vanderbilt University. (See the above section, Ebola, for more details.) 

In July 2015 we established a collaboration with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) to evaluate Inovio's immunotherapy, INO-3112, in combination with traditional chemo-radiotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced stage cervical cancer. The trial, primarily funded by the EORTC, is expected to begin in 2016. 

Various additional grants that have been awarded to Inovio to advance research for next-generation electroporation delivery technology are described in the above section, Electroporation Delivery Technology. 

Competition 

We face competition at two levels. At the highest level we face competition by an array of existing or development-stage drug and immunotherapy approaches targeting diseases we are pursuing. We are aware of various established enterprises, including major pharmaceutical companies, which are broadly engaged in vaccine/immunotherapy research and development. These include Crucell N.V (now part of J&#38;J), Sanofi-Aventis, Novartis, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Merck, Pfizer, and MedImmune, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca, Inc. There are also various development stage biotechnology companies involved in different immunotherapy technologies. As these companies develop their technologies, they may develop proprietary technologies which may materially and adversely affect our business. 

A number of companies are developing products to specifically address diseases we are also targeting. Merck and GlaxoSmithKline have commercialized preventive vaccines against HPV to protect against cervical cancer; some companies are seeking to treat early HPV infections or low grade cervical dysplasias; LEEP is the current standard of care for treating high grade cervical dysplasia; Advaxis and Kite have therapeutic cervical cancer product candidates under development. Many companies are pursuing different approaches to prostate, breast, lung and other cancers we are targeting. 

At another level we compete more specifically with companies seeking to utilize antigen-encoding DNA delivered with electroporation or other DNA delivery technologies such as viral vectors or lipid vectors to induce in vivo generated antigen production and immune responses to prevent or treat various diseases. These competitive technologies have shown promise but they each also have their unique obstacles to overcome. We believe our electroporation system is strongly positioned to succeed as the dominant delivery method for DNA-based immunotherapies. 

Viral DNA Delivery 

This technology utilizes a virus as a carrier to deliver genetic material into target cells. The method is very efficient for delivering immunotherapy antigens and has the advantage of mimicking real viral infection so that the recipient will mount a broad immune response against the immunotherapy. The greatest limitation of the technology stems from problems with unwanted immune responses against the viral vector, limiting its use to patients who have not been previously exposed to the viral vector and making repeated administration difficult. In addition, complexity and safety concerns increase their cost and complicate regulatory approval. 

Lipid DNA Delivery 

A number of lipid formulations have been developed that increase the effect of DNA/RNA immunotherapies. These work by either increasing uptake of the DNA/RNA into cells or by acting as an adjuvant, alerting the immune system. While there has been progress in this field, lipid delivery tends to be less efficient than viral vectors and is hampered by concerns regarding toxicity and increased complexity. 

DNA Immunotherapy Delivery With Electroporation 

There are other companies with electroporation intellectual property and devices. We believe we have significant competitive advantages over other companies focused on electroporation for multiple reasons: 

&#8226; 

We have an extensive history and experience in developing the methods and devices that optimize the use of electroporation in conjunction with DNA-based agents. This experience has been validated with multiple sets of interim data from multiple clinical studies assessing DNA-based immunotherapies and vaccines against cancers and infectious disease. Together with our partners and collaborators, we have been the leader in establishing proof-of-principle of electroporation-delivered immunotherapies. 

&#8226; 

We have a broad product line of electroporation instruments designed to enable DNA delivery in tumors, muscle, and skin. 

&#8226; 

We have been very proactive in filing for patents, as well as acquiring and licensing additional patents, to expand our global patent estate. 

If any of our competitors develop products with efficacy or safety profiles significantly better than our products, we may not be able to commercialize our products, and sales of any of our commercialized products could be harmed. Some of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater product development capabilities and financial, scientific, marketing and human resources than we do. Competitors may develop products earlier, obtain FDA approvals for products more rapidly, or develop products that are more effective than those under development by us. We will seek to expand our technological capabilities to remain competitive; however, research and development by others may render our technologies or products obsolete or noncompetitive, or result in treatments or cures superior to ours. 

Our competitive position will be affected by the disease indications addressed by our product candidates and those of our competitors, the timing of market introduction for these products and the stage of development of other technologies to address these disease indications. For us and our competitors, proprietary technologies, the ability to complete clinical trials on a timely basis and with the desired results, and the ability to obtain timely regulatory approvals to market these product candidates are likely to be significant competitive factors. Other important competitive factors will include the efficacy, safety, 

ease of use, reliability, availability and price of products and the ability to fund operations during the period between technological conception and commercial sales. 

The FDA and other regulatory agencies may expand current requirements for public disclosure of DNA-based product development data, which may harm our competitive position with foreign and United States companies developing DNA-based products for similar indications. 

Government Regulation 

DNA Vaccine Product Regulation 

Any pharmaceutical products we develop will require regulatory clearances prior to clinical trials and additional regulatory approvals prior to commercialization. New gene-based products for vaccine or therapeutic applications are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and comparable agencies in other countries. Our potential products will be regulated as biological products that are used to treat or prevent disease. In the United States, drugs are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act. Biological products, in addition to being subject to provisions of the FDC Act, are regulated in the United States under the Public Health Service Act. Both statutes and related regulations govern, among other things, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, and other promotional practices. 

Obtaining FDA approval or comparable approval from similar agencies in other countries is a costly and time-consuming process. Generally, FDA approval requires that pre-clinical studies be conducted in the laboratory and in animal model systems to gain preliminary information on efficacy and to identify any major safety concerns. In the United States, the results of these studies are submitted as a part of an IND application which the FDA must review and allow before human clinical trials can start. The IND application includes a detailed description of the proposed clinical investigations. 

A company must submit an IND application or equivalent application in other countries for each proposed product and must conduct clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product necessary to obtain FDA approval or comparable approval from similar agencies in other countries. For example, in the United States, the FDA receives reports on the progress of each phase of clinical testing and may require the modification, suspension, or termination of clinical trials if an unwarranted risk is presented to patients. 

To obtain FDA approval prior to marketing a pharmaceutical product in the United States typically requires several phases of clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. Clinical trials are the means by which experimental treatments are tested in humans, and are conducted following pre-clinical testing. Clinical trials may be conducted within the United States or in foreign countries. If clinical trials are conducted in foreign countries, the products under development as well as the trials are subject to regulations of the FDA and/or its counterparts in the other countries. Upon successful completion of clinical trials, approval to market the treatment for a particular patient population may be requested from the FDA in the United States and/or its counterparts in other countries. 

Clinical trials for therapeutic products are normally done in three phases. Phase I clinical trials are typically conducted with a small number of patients or healthy subjects to evaluate safety, determine a safe dosage range, identify side effects, and, if possible, gain early evidence of effectiveness. Phase II clinical trials are conducted with a larger group of patients to evaluate effectiveness of an investigational product for a defined patient population, and to determine common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase III clinical trials involve large scale, multi-center, comparative trials that are conducted to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling. In some special cases where the efficacy testing of a product may present a special challenge to testing in humans, such as in the case of a vaccine to protect healthy humans from a life-threatening disease that is not a naturally occurring threat, effectiveness testing may be required in animals. 

After completion of clinical trials of a new product, FDA marketing approval must be obtained or equivalent approval in comparable agencies in other countries. For the FDA, if the product is regulated as a biologic, a Biologics License Application, or BLA, is required. The BLA must include results of product development activities, pre-clinical studies, and clinical trials in addition to detailed chemistry, manufacturing and control information. 

Applications submitted to the FDA are subject to an unpredictable and potentially prolonged approval process. Despite good-faith communication and collaboration between the applicant and the FDA during the development process, the FDA may ultimately decide, upon final review of the data, that the application does not satisfy its criteria for approval or requires additional product development or further pre-clinical or clinical studies. Even if FDA regulatory clearances are obtained, a marketed product is subject to continual review, and later discovery of previously unknown problems or failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. 

Before marketing clearance for a product can be secured, the facility in which the product is manufactured must be inspected by the FDA and must comply with cGMP regulations. In addition, after marketing clearance is secured, the manufacturing facility must be inspected periodically for cGMP compliance by FDA inspectors. 

In addition to the FDA requirements, the NIH has established guidelines for research involving human genetic materials, including recombinant DNA molecules. The FDA cooperates in the enforcement of these guidelines, which apply to all recombinant DNA research that is conducted at facilities supported by the NIH, including proposals to conduct clinical research involving gene therapies. The NIH review of clinical trial proposals and safety information is a public process and often involves review and approval by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, of the NIH. 

Sponsors of clinical trials are required to register and report results for all controlled clinical investigations, other than phase I investigations, of a product subject to FDA regulation. Trial registration may require public disclosure of confidential commercial development data resulting in the loss of competitive secrets, which could be commercially detrimental. 

Medical Device Manufacturing Regulation 

In addition, we are subject to regulation as a medical device manufacturer. We must comply with a variety of manufacturing, product development and quality regulations in order to be able to distribute our electroporation devices commercially around the world. In Europe, we must comply with the Medical Device Directives. We have a Quality System certified by its international Notified Body to be in compliance with the international Quality System Standard, ISO13485, and meeting the Annex II Quality System requirements of the MDD. We completed Annex II Conformity Assessment procedures to allow for the CE Mark of our electroporation devices. 

In the United States, we are required to maintain facilities, equipment, processes and procedures that are in compliance with quality systems regulations. Our systems have been constructed to be in compliance with these regulations and our ongoing operations are conducted within these systems. Commercially distributed devices within the United States must be developed under formal design controls and be submitted to the FDA for clearance or approval. All development activity is performed according to formal procedures to ensure compliance with all design control regulations. 

We employ modern manufacturing methods and controls to optimize performance and control costs. Internal capabilities and core competencies are strategically determined to optimize our manufacturing efficiency. We utilize contract manufacturers for key operations, such as clean room assembly and sterilization, which are not economically conducted in-house. We outsource significant sub-assemblies, such as populated printed circuit boards, for which capital requirements or manufacturing volumes do not justify vertical integration. 

Other Regulations 

We also are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations, and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research. The extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted. 

Commercialization and Manufacturing 

Because of the broad potential applications of our technologies, we intend to develop and commercialize products both on our own and through our collaborators and licensees. We intend to develop and commercialize products in well-defined specialty markets, such as infectious diseases and cancer. Where appropriate, we intend to rely on strategic marketing and distribution alliances. 

We believe our plasmids can be produced in commercial quantities through uniform methods of fermentation and processing that are applicable to all plasmids. We believe we will be able to obtain sufficient supplies of plasmids for all foreseeable clinical investigations. 

Relationship with GeneOne 

In March 2014, the Company's affiliated entity VGX International Inc. changed its name to GeneOne Life Sciences 

("GeneOne"). 

We acquired an equity interest in GeneOne in 2005. As of December 31, 2015, we owned 10.2% of the outstanding capital stock of GeneOne and GeneOne owned 73,590 shares of our common stock. To our knowledge, none of our current officers, directors, or key employees beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, any securities of GeneOne. 

In 2008 we sold our manufacturing operations (including patent rights to certain manufacturing technology) to VGXI, Inc., a wholly-owned United States subsidiary of GeneOne. In connection with this transfer we entered into a Supply Agreement pursuant to which VGXI, Inc., a cGMP contract manufacturer, produces and supplies the DNA plasmids for all of 

our research and early clinical trials. The price of the plasmids we purchase from VGXI, Inc. is determined by us and GeneOne at the time of order placement or, with respect to product supplied in connection with a grant contract, based on the contracted bid provided by the applicable agency. We agreed to treat GeneOne and its subsidiary as our most favored supplier for DNA plasmids and GeneOne and its subsidiary agreed to treat us as their most favored customer. Before we can manufacture DNA plasmids on our own behalf or engage a third party other than GeneOne or its subsidiary to manufacture DNA plasmids for us, we must first offer such manufacturing work to GeneOne or its subsidiary. 

We have also entered into license and collaboration agreements pursuant to which we have granted GeneOne exclusive rights to certain of our product candidates in certain jurisdictions. For example, GeneOne has exclusive rights in countries in Asia including Korea to our VGX-3400X and INO-3510 for treatment of flu and our hepatitis C program. In exchange for these rights, GeneOne shares the development costs for some of our product candidates. Prior to signing the Roche Agreement, we reacquired the rights, title and interest to hepatitis B in Asia previously licensed to GeneOne. As a result, we paid $300,000 to GeneOne as of December 31, 2013 based on the up-front payment received from Roche. 

On September 23, 2014, we entered into a Collaborative Development Agreement with GeneOne to co-develop an Ebola vaccine through phase I clinical trials. In July 2015, we amended the Agreement with an effective date of April 2015 to change control of development in return for the payment of certain development fees. 

On May 26, 2015, we entered into a Collaborative Development Agreement with GeneOne to co-develop a DNA vaccine for MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) through phase I clinical trials. 

In January 2016 Inovio and GeneOne announced the initiation of a collaborative research program to test and advance Inovio&#8217;s DNA-based vaccine for preventing and treating Zika virus. 

For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized revenue from GeneOne of $450,000 &#32;and $479,000 , respectively, which consisted of licensing, collaborative research and development arrangements and other fees. Operating expenses related to GeneOne for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $6.9 million &#32;and $4.2 &#32;million, respectively, primarily related to biologics manufacturing. At December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;the Company had an accounts receivable balance of $4,000 &#32;and $2,000 , respectively, and an accounts payable and accrued liability balance of $165,000 &#32;and $28,000 , respectively, related to GeneOne and its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014, $373,000 &#32;and $260,000 &#32;of prepayments made to GeneOne were classified as long-term other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. 

Intellectual Property 

Patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. We file patent applications to protect our technologies, inventions and improvements to our inventions that we consider important to the development of our business. We file for patent registration extensively in the United States and in key foreign markets. Although our patent filings include claims covering various features of our products and product candidates, including composition, methods of manufacture and use, our patents do not provide us with complete protection, or guarantee, against the development of competing products. In addition, some of our know-how and technology are not patentable. We thus also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. We also require employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements, but such agreements may provide limited protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information. 

Our intellectual property portfolio covers our proprietary technologies, including electroporation delivery and vaccine related technologies. As of December 31, 2015, our patent portfolio included over 121 issued United States patents and 398 issued foreign counterpart patents.

If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately our competitors might gain access to our technology and our business would thus be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense. Any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative processes or litigation through the courts. In addition, our patents, or any other patents that may be issued to us in the future, may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in each country where we operate. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States, and domestic and international mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights in those countries may be inadequate. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or otherwise gaining access to our technology. We may be required to expend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any such litigation, whether or not it is ultimately resolved in our favor, would result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. 

There may be rights we are not aware of, including applications that have been filed but not published that, when issued, could be asserted against us. These third-parties could bring claims against us, and that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us, we could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or biologic drug candidate that is the subject of the suit. As a result of patent infringement claims, or in order to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be required to seek a license from the third-party. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or royalties or both, and the rights granted to us might be non-exclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses 

on acceptable terms. All of the issues described above could also impact our collaborators, which would also impact the success of the collaboration and therefore us. 

Important legal issues remain to be resolved as to the extent and scope of available patent protection for biologic products, including vaccines, and processes in the United States and other important markets outside the United States, such as Europe and Japan. Foreign markets may not provide the same level of patent protection as provided under the United States patent system. We recognize that litigation or administrative proceedings may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of certain of our and others&#8217; proprietary rights. Any such litigation or proceeding may result in a significant commitment of resources in the future and could force us to interrupt our operations, redesign our products or processes, or negotiate a license agreement, all of which would adversely affect our revenue. Furthermore, changes in, or different interpretations of, patent laws in the United States and other countries may result in patent laws that allow others to use our discoveries or develop and commercialize our products. 

We cannot guarantee that the patents we obtain or the unpatented technology we hold will afford us significant commercial protection.

Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has been a leader in advancing the capabilities of DNA-based immunotherapies to treat infectious diseases and cancers going back to the original incorporation of Viral Genomix, Inc. under the laws of Delaware on April 17, 2000.
