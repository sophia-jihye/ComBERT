 Item 1. Business. 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160;

We are a biotechnology company focused on commercializing our proprietary technologies and product candidates and providing product development and manufacturing services to clients and collaborators. The Company&#8217;s technologies constitute a proprietary, transformative platform for development and production of biologics in hydroponically grown green plants.

&#160;

Stated simply, iBio&#8217;s technologies harness the natural protein production capability that plants use to sustain their own growth, and direct it instead to produce proteins for a range of applications including for vaccines and biopharmaceuticals. The Company&#8217;s technologies can be used to produce a wide array of biologics and also to create and produce proprietary derivatives of preexisting products with improved properties. The Company has used its technologies and its collaborative relationships to demonstrate the applicability of its technologies to a diverse range of product candidates including products against fibrotic diseases, vaccines, enzyme replacements, monoclonal antibodies, and recombinant versions of marketed products that are currently derived from human blood plasma.

&#160;

In addition to the broad array of biological products that can be produced with the Company&#8217;s technologies we believe our technologies offer other advantages that are not available with conventional manufacturing systems. These anticipated advantages may include reduced production time and lower operating costs. Further, we believe that the capital investment required to create facilities that will manufacture proteins using the Company&#8217;s technologies will be substantially less than the capital investment which would be required for the creation of similar capacity facilities utilizing conventional manufacturing methods dependent upon animal cells, bacterial fermenters and chicken eggs. Additionally, operating costs in a manufacturing facility using iBio&#8217;s platform are expected to be reduced significantly in comparison to conventional manufacturing processes due to the rapid nature of our production cycle and the elimination of the expenses associated with the operation and maintenance of bioreactors, fermenters, sterile liquid handling systems and other expensive equipment which is not required in connection with the use of the Company&#8217;s technologies.

&#160;

Among the Company&#8217;s proprietary technologies are the patented iBioLaunch technology &#8482;, the patented iBioModulator &#8482; technology, and additional newer and more advanced technologies. Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz, or Fiocruz, a unit of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, a central agency of the Ministry of Health of Brazil, is sponsoring the development an iBioLaunch-produced yellow fever vaccine to replace the vaccine it currently makes in chicken eggs for the populations of Brazil and more than 20 other nations. These advances are occurring subsequent to the demonstration of safety of iBioLaunch-produced vaccine candidates against each of the H1N1 &#8220;Swine&#8221; flu virus and the H5N1 avian flu virus in successfully completed Phase 1 clinical trials.

&#160;

We developed our iBioModulator technology based on the use of a modified form of the cellulose degrading enzyme lichenase, from Clostridium thermocellum, a thermophilic and anaerobic bacterium. iBioModulator enables an adjuvant component to be fused directly to preferred recombinant antigens to create a single protein for use in vaccine applications.

&#160;

The iBioModulator platform has been shown to be applicable to a range of vaccine proteins and can significantly modify the immune response to a vaccine in two important ways. Animal efficacy studies have demonstrated that it can increase the strength of the initial immune response to a vaccine antigen (as measured by antibody titer) and also extend the duration of the immune response. These results suggest the possibility that use of the iBioModulator platform may lower vaccine antigen requirements and enable fewer doses to establish prolonged protective immunity.

&#160;

In addition to technology developed for iBio pursuant to agreements with Fraunhofer U.S.A., Inc., iBio&#8217;s more recently developed technologies provide the Company with higher expression yields of certain proteins and increased efficiency in adapting gene sequences to achieve specific product objectives. In addition, iBio is developing improved, proprietary manufacturing processes that the Company expects to protect as trade secrets.

&#160;

Our near-term focus is to realize two key objectives: (1) the establishment of additional business arrangements pursuant to which commercial, government and not-for-profit licensees will utilize the Company&#8217;s technologies in connection with the development and manufacturing of therapeutic proteins and vaccine products; and (2) the further development of select product candidates based upon or enhanced by our technology platforms. These objectives are the core components of our strategy to commercialize the proprietary technologies we have developed and validated.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our strategy to engage in partnering and out-licensing of our technologies seeks to preserve the opportunity for iBio to share in the successful development and commercialization of product candidates by our licensees while enhancing our own capital and financial resources for development, alone or through commercial alliances with others, of high-potential product candidates based upon our technologies. In addition to financial resources we may receive in connection with the license of our technologies, we believe that successful development by third party licensees of iBio technology-enhanced product candidates will further validate our technologies, increase awareness of the advantages that may be realized by the use of such platforms and promote broader adoption of our technologies by additional third parties.

&#160;

The advancement of iBio technology-enhanced product candidates is a key element of our strategy. We believe that selecting and developing products which individually have substantial commercial value and are representative of classes of pharmaceuticals that can be successfully produced using our technology platforms will allow us to maximize the near and longer term value of our technologies while exploiting individual product opportunities. To realize this result, we are currently internally advancing through preclinical IND enabling studies a proprietary recombinant protein we call IBIO-CFB03 for treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, systemic sclerosis, and potentially other fibrotic diseases. To the extent that we anticipate the opportunity to realize additional value, we may elect to further the development of this or other product candidates through the early stages of clinical development before seeking to license the product candidate to other industry participants for late stage clinical development and if successful, commercialization.

&#160;

On December 16, 2015, we formed iBio CMO LLC (&#8220;iBio CMO&#8221;), a Delaware limited liability corporation, to develop and manufacture plant-made pharmaceuticals. As of December 31, 2015, we owned 100% of iBio CMO. On January 13, 2016, we entered into a contract manufacturing joint venture with an affiliate of Eastern Capital Limited (&#8220;Eastern&#8221;), a stockholder of the Company (the &#8220;Eastern Affiliate&#8221;). The Eastern Affiliate contributed $15 million in cash for a 30% interest in iBio CMO. We retained a 70% interest in iBio CMO and contributed a royalty bearing license which grants iBio CMO a non-exclusive license to use our proprietary technologies for research purposes and an exclusive U.S. license for manufacturing purposes. We retained the exclusive right to grant product licenses to those who wish to sell or distribute products made using our technology.

&#160;

iBio CMO&#8217;s operations take place in Bryan, Texas in a facility controlled by another affiliate of Eastern (the &#8220;Second Eastern Affiliate&#8221;) as sublandlord. The facility is a Class A life sciences building on the campus of Texas A&#38;M University, designed and equipped for plant-made manufacture of biopharmaceuticals. The Second Affiliate granted iBio CMO a 34-year sublease for the facility. Commercial operations commenced in January 2016. iBio CMO expects to operate on the basis of three parallel lines of business: (1) Development and manufacturing of third party products; (2) Development and production of iBio&#8217;s proprietary product(s) for treatment of fibrotic diseases; and (3) Commercial technology transfer services.

&#160;

Proprietary iBio technologies have been used to advance development of certain products that have been commercially infeasible to develop with conventional technologies such as Chinese hamster ovary cell systems and microbial fermentation methods. They can be used to create and operate manufacturing facilities at substantially lower capital and operating costs. These include development and manufacture of both vaccine and therapeutic product candidates. iBio CMO is promoting commercial collaborations with third parties on the basis of these technology advantages and plans to work with customers to achieve laboratory scale technical milestones that can form the basis of longer-term manufacturing business arrangements. iBio itself is a client of iBio CMO for further IND advancement of its proprietary products beginning with IBIO-CFB03 for the treatment of a range of fibrotic diseases. iBio will work with iBio CMO on the production of IBIO-CFB03 for clinical trials and, with clinical success, for commercial launch.

&#160;

Due to the lower capital and operating cost requirements for pharmaceutical production via iBio technology versus legacy methods, certain corporations and governments that have not already established manufacturing capacity for biologic products are client prospects for both development and for commercial technology transfer services to enable autonomous manufacturing in the market being served. For example, in Brazil, iBio has been collaborating with the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) to develop a recombinant yellow fever vaccine based on iBio technology. iBio&#8217;s contract with Fiocruz provides for commercial technology transfer services as the product candidates enters human clinical trials. Over time, iBio expects to work closely with iBio CMO to provide such technology transfer services for a variety of both commercial and government clients.

&#160; 

Our Business 

&#160; 

Our Technology Platforms &#8211; iBioLaunch, iBioModulator, and iBio Advanced Technologies 

&#160; 

iBioLaunch 

&#160;

iBioLaunch is the name iBio uses to describe iBio&#8217;s proprietary, transformative platform comprising multiple technologies for the development and production of therapeutic proteins and vaccines using transient gene expression in green plants. Based upon the results of successful Phase 1 clinical trials demonstrating the safety of vaccine candidates against H1N1 influenza and H5N1 influenza, immunogenicity data from in vivo preclinical studies in well-established highly predictive animal models and results from feasibility studies and other discovery and development work we have performed, we believe that the iBioLaunch platform can produce therapeutic proteins and vaccines more efficiently, as measured by time, cost and yield, than current conventional biologics manufacturing methods. As awareness of these advantages increases, we expect broader adoption of the iBioLaunch platform by biologics market participants.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

An additional advantage of the iBioLaunch platform includes successful production of proteins that are difficult or impossible to produce on a commercially practical basis with conventional systems. This unique capability has been demonstrated by production of antigens for vaccine candidates for both hookworm and malaria, each of which requires production and purification of proteins that could not be feasibly made with other systems. For companies developing proprietary product opportunities, challenges often include overcoming obstacles to efficient production of complex or multiple proteins with simultaneous control of enzymes that modify the properties of the desired end product. iBioLaunch technology offers the flexibility and sophistication necessary to enable practical development of such complex products.

&#160;

With iBioLaunch, it is possible to manufacture product candidates in less than a month from identifying the protein of interest. This rapid production cycle makes iBioLaunch particularly well-suited for producing treatments and vaccines for pandemic diseases and for bioterror response. The rapid production cycle is also advantageous to researchers and others seeking to develop new products as a greater number of experiments can be conducted in any time period at a cost less than that associated with conventional expression systems.

&#160;

Utilizing expression technology which is transient, occurring over a period of four to seven days after introducing a foreign gene, iBioLaunch eliminates the initial steps upon which other conventional expression technologies are dependent &#8211; namely the need to isolate a high producing cell clone from millions of non-productive cells and then grow the clonal cells in a sterile fermenter to start the manufacturing process. This saves the year of process development time commonly associated with mammalian cell systems and eliminates the need for expensive fermenters and a sterile liquid-handling system to prevent bacterial, fungal, or viral contamination of the protein drug. In the iBioLaunch system, no animal- or human-derived materials are used, eliminating the risk of contamination by human infectious agents. In place of such materials, normal green plants, grown under clean and controlled conditions, provide the biomass for pharmaceutical protein manufacturing. Because this entire process uses commonly available materials, we are not dependent on unique sources of raw material, nor are we limited to purchasing from single suppliers.

&#160;

The iBioLaunch process begins with robotic seeding into an inert matrix for hydroponic growth, followed by automated infiltration of the young seedlings for gene expression and protein production. The innovation of the iBioLaunch technology is typified by its proprietary vector technology. The iBioLaunch vectors are designed to bring foreign DNA to the nucleus of cells in the leaves of plants by allowing a vector and bacterial host to be introduced into the plant by &#8220;infiltrating&#8221; the bacterial vector host under a slight vacuum. The bacterial vector &#8220;launches&#8221; the foreign DNA into the plant nucleus, where it is coded into instructions that direct the plant&#8217;s own protein manufacturing apparatus to make foreign proteins. A clever arrangement of genes for plant viral enzymes causes these protein production instructions to be copied hundreds of thousands of times in each plant cell. Our proprietary gene transfer vectors combine the desirable features of the DNA mobilization plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens with gene control elements taken from single-stranded RNA plant viruses.

&#160;

&#160;

Subsequent to the incorporation of the iBioLaunch vector in the plant tissues, the following steps lead to target protein synthesis:

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; The vector is transported to the nucleus of each cell, where RNA polymerase II transcribes viral-related sequences and the gene(s) of interest into messenger RNA. &#160;

&#183; The viral-related messenger RNA moves to the plant cell cytoplasm, and is translated on ribosomes to make proteins representing the viral replicase gene, movement protein, and our protein of interest. &#160;

&#183; The viral replicase protein causes the production of hundreds of additional messenger RNA molecules encoding the production of our protein of interest, and these messengers dominate the plant protein production machinery. &#160;

&#183; Large amounts of the protein of interest accumulate and await purification. &#160;

The net effect of applying the iBioLaunch system is that the natural plant protein production capability becomes devoted to the expression of the desired gene, and the target protein rapidly accumulates to extremely high levels suitable for commercial use.

&#160; 

iBioModulator 

&#160;

In addition to iBioLaunch, we have developed iBioModulator, a technology platform that is designed to improve the potency and duration of effect of both prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines produced with any recombinant expression technology including iBioLaunch. We developed our iBioModulator technology based on the use of a modified form of the cellulose degrading enzyme lichenase from Clostridium thermocellum , a thermophilic and anaerobic bacterium.

&#160;

iBioModulator technology enables an adjuvant component to be fused directly to preferred recombinant antigens to create a single protein for use in vaccine applications.

&#160;

The iBioModulator platform has been shown to be applicable to a range of vaccine proteins, and can significantly modify the immune response to a vaccine in two important ways. Animal efficacy studies have demonstrated that it can increase the strength of the initial immune response to a vaccine antigen (as measured by antibody titer) and also extend the duration of the immune response. These results suggest the possibility that use of the iBioModulator platform may lower vaccine antigen requirements and enable fewer doses to establish prolonged protective immunity. We believe that the ability to provide better immune response and longer-term protection with fewer or zero booster inoculations would add significant value to a vaccine by reducing the overall costs and logistical difficulties of its use.

&#160;

iBio Advanced Technologies 

&#160;

iBio has developed and acquired rights to additional proprietary technologies that are superior to our earlier technologies for certain applications and that in some cases are associated with individual products such as our IBIO-CFB03 product candidate for fibrotic diseases. iBio Advanced Technologies include rights to certain patented and unpatented technologies developed by Novici Biotech LLC, patents and unpatented inventions licensed from the University of Pittsburgh, and novel manufacturing methods and processes developed by iBio CMO LLC.

&#160;

Application of iBio Technologies - Target Markets and Product Candidates 

&#160; 

Target Markets and Commercialization Activities 

&#160;

Based on the scientific data that have been derived from the successful Phase 1 clinical trials of the iBioLaunch-derived influenza vaccine candidates and the results of the feasibility and preclinical studies conducted to date evaluating iBioLaunch-produced and iBioModulator-enhanced product candidates, we believe that we have demonstrated the suitability and applicability of these platform technologies to a broad range of therapeutic protein classes and both prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines.

&#160;

Currently, we are engaged in efforts to commercialize our technology platforms. Our strategy is to enter important markets through license agreements, commercial collaborations, and manufacturing contracts. Our current marketing efforts focus on those decision makers whom we expect will be attracted to the cost and efficiency advantages that may be obtained through use of our platforms. We believe that the advantages of our platforms will enable us to compete effectively against the providers of other manufacturing systems that may be slower, more capital intensive and more costly to operate. We anticipate realizing revenues in connection with licenses we may grant and technology transfer services we may provide.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In all geographic regions, including the U.S. and Western Europe, the robust ability of our technology platforms to favorably produce a wide range of protein types, including our ability to produce product candidates that are otherwise not feasible to commercially manufacture, offers us the opportunity to obtain value through exclusive, individual product licenses which can be worldwide or geographically limited. In other geographic regions, such as Brazil, India and China where the economies and middle classes are growing rapidly and decision-makers are building domestic biologics infrastructures, we anticipate entering into and deriving revenues from licenses that may include multiple product categories to which our technology applies.

&#160;

Additionally, we believe that governments and state corporations seeking to establish and maintain autonomous biodefense capabilities will also be attracted to the advantages realizable with our platforms. The market for biodefense countermeasures reflects continued awareness of the threat of global terror and biowarfare activity as well as the need to have capacities to quickly manufacture both vaccines and therapeutics to a numerous and ever evolving list of biological agents that could be used to harm populations.

&#160;

To enhance our success in the commercialization of our multiple technologies, we are engaging in efforts to advance select iBio sponsored product candidates. Our current internal efforts focus on the further development of a proprietary recombinant protein product candidate, IBIO-CFB03, for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, systemic sclerosis, and other fibrotic diseases. We have selected this product candidate for further advancement on the basis of its individual commercial value and its value as representative of a class of products in an attractive market that may be successfully derived from the iBio platform. We believe that demonstration of successful utilization of technologies by each of us and our license partners will enhance market awareness of the broad applicability and potential advantages realizable with the platforms and generate increased opportunities for us to realize value from these assets.

Therapeutic Protein Product Candidates 

&#160;

Using our proprietary technologies, we have expressed and demonstrated the feasibility of production of many classes of therapeutic proteins. The proteins that we have successfully produced range from large and complex monoclonal antibodies to smaller proteins such as interferons, growth factors, and enzymes.

&#160;

IBIO-CFB03, a Proprietary Product for Treatment of Fibrosis 

&#160;

iBio has exclusively licensed and is developing, on its iBioLaunch&#8482; platform and with its more advanced technology, an innovative new product we have designated &#8220;IBIO-CFB03&#8221; for treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and systemic sclerosis (SSc), both fatal and incurable diseases. The total number of people affected by systemic sclerosis and IPF, while large in comparison to many biotechnology target markets, is small enough for iBio&#8217;s drug to qualify for the regulatory and financial benefits available under U.S. and European Orphan Drug incentives.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

iBio&#8217;s candidate product has demonstrated efficacy in both animal disease models and through the reversal of fibrosis in human skin organ culture. Preclinical studies have established a strong safety profile for IBIO-CFB03 with no toxicity seen at concentrations well above the predicted effective doses. The drug is readily diffusible into organs and tissues and can reach its target site via several modes of administration. Systemic administration is effective at reducing skin and lung fibrosis. The anti-fibrotic effects of IBIO-CFB03 are observed even after the onset of fibrosis, suggesting that it is capable of reversing fibrosis&#8212;an effect not observed with any of the potential anti-fibrotic therapies that are currently in clinical use. Patients with existing fibrosis enter the clinic long after the onset of their disease, and thus do not benefit significantly from a drug used to prevent fibrosis rather than treat existing fibrosis.

&#160;

Experimental drugs demonstrating efficacy against life-threatening diseases in early clinical trials are given higher priority review for marketing approval by regulatory agencies in the U.S. and Europe. In addition, both the U.S. and Europe offer financial and regulatory incentives for the development of new drugs for the treatment of smaller patient populations (Orphan Drugs), and such drugs can be approved for marketing faster and with less total investment than drugs that are intended to treat major diseases. iBio has obtained Orphan Drug designation for its drug candidate for systemic sclerosis.

&#160;

Recombinant forms of Plasma Derived Products 

&#160;

Using iBioLaunch, we have successfully produced human C1 esterase inhibitor and human alpha 1-antitrypsin, each of which is an important therapeutic product that has been traditionally derived from human blood plasma. The production via the iBioLaunch system of plasma-sparing recombinant forms of these products offers an alternative process that may lessen reliance on human blood supplies and eliminate the safety concerns that may be associated with use of animal and human cells or other tissue components.

&#160;

Other Therapeutic Proteins 

&#160;

In addition to the recombinant form of plasma derived products, using iBioLaunch, we have been able to express and demonstrate the feasibility of production of substantially all other classes of therapeutic proteins. The therapeutic proteins that we have successfully produced range from large and complex monoclonal antibodies to smaller proteins such as interferons, growth factors, and enzymes. All the candidate therapeutic proteins manufactured using iBioLaunch have assembled correctly assembled and demonstrated full activity in relevant bioassays. We are currently evaluating several potential proprietary iBioLaunch produced therapeutic protein candidates for further development internally at iBio or together with collaborators.

&#160;

Vaccine Candidates 

&#160;

We have used iBioLaunch to successfully express and demonstrate the feasibility of production of a broad array of vaccine candidates, including vaccine candidates that have to date been impossible to produce on a commercially practical basis using conventional manufacturing systems. Additionally, we have used iBioModulator to improve the performance of therapeutic vaccine candidates.

&#160;

The ability of the iBioLaunch platform to manufacture proteins that are difficult or impossible to produce on a commercially practical basis with conventional manufacturing systems has been demonstrated by the production of antigens for vaccine candidates for both hookworm and malaria. These iBioLaunch-produced vaccine candidates are being developed by the Sabin Institute and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, respectively, and each is being advanced to Phase 1 clinical trials that are expected to commence in the next 12 months, subject availability of funding at each respective organization and satisfaction of other conditions.

&#160;

The safety of an iBioLaunch-produced H1N1 influenza vaccine candidate and an iBioLaunch H5N1 influenza vaccine has been demonstrated in successfully completed Phase 1 human clinical trials and the efficacy of these iBioLaunch derived vaccine candidates has been demonstrated in well established, highly predictive animal models. We have also demonstrated the efficiencies of our iBioLaunch technology at the laboratory level by producing candidate influenza vaccines in weeks versus the months required for commercially used chicken egg methods. The rapid production of an iBioLaunch derived vaccine candidate for the recently emerged new strain of influenza, H7N9, demonstrates the flexibility and responsiveness of the platform. This speed of production is an advantage that we believe may be particularly attractive to public health authorities seeking to protect citizens in the case of a pandemic outbreak.

&#160;

Our collaborator, Fiocruz, is advancing the development of an iBioLaunch-produced yellow fever vaccine candidate. In addition to furthering preclinical IND enabling studies of this vaccine candidate, in April 2013, Fiocruz committed to the design of a new plant-based multipurpose manufacturing facility in Brazil and anticipates construction of such facility in the next few years. This multipurpose facility is being designed in manner that will enable the incorporation and utilization of our iBioLaunch platform.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Biodefense Countermeasures 

&#160;

Our technology platforms have advantages that we believe are particularly well suited for the biodefense market. Speed of production and capability to produce both vaccines and therapeutic proteins using the iBioLaunch platform and the potential to improve performance of vaccines through the application of the iBioModulator platform are each key features of biologics manufacturing systems that may be sought by governments and state corporations seeking to establish autonomous capabilities to protect their populations from bioterrorism threats. In addition to our demonstration of the feasibility of iBioLaunch produced monoclonal antibody candidates for the treatment of anthrax, next generation anthrax vaccine candidates derived from the iBioLaunch platform have been evaluated by our collaborator, Fraunhofer, pursuant to a funding award granted to Fraunhofer in December 2012 by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. With Fraunhofer, we are evaluating opportunities and seeking funding from additional sources to further demonstrate the applicability and advantages of our platforms in connection with the development of biodefense countermeasures.

&#160; &#160; 

Strategic Alliances and Collaborations 

&#160;

A significant component of our business plan is to enter into strategic alliances and collaborations with other for-profit entities, governments, foundations, and others as appropriate to gain access to funding, capabilities, technical resources and intellectual property to further our development efforts, commercialize our technology and to generate revenues.

&#160;

Collaboration with Fraunhofer Center for Molecular Biology (&#8220;Fraunhofer&#8221;) 

&#160;

In 2003, we engaged Fraunhofer to perform research and development activities to develop the iBioLaunch platform and to create our first product candidate. Pursuant to the Technology Transfer Agreement (&#8220;TTA&#8221;) between our company and Fraunhofer, effective in January 2004, we paid $3.6 million to Fraunhofer to acquire the exclusive rights to intellectual property owned by Fraunhofer which, as subsequently enhanced and improved, constitutes the iBioLaunch platform.

&#160;

Following this initial engagement, we expanded our relationship with Fraunhofer to include additional and continuing research and development activities and we benefited from the establishment of numerous non-commercial arrangements among the Company, certain government entities, a non-governmental organization (which we refer to as a &#8220;NGO&#8221;) and Fraunhofer which allowed us to further advance the development of our technology platforms and select product candidates through indirect access to non-dilutive funding.

&#160;

To evidence these expanded activities, at various times, we entered into additional agreements with Fraunhofer and periodically amended the TTA, including most recently a settlement agreement we entered into with Fraunhofer in September 2013 (the &#8220;Settlement Agreement&#8221;). The amendments to the TTA include a commitment by Fraunhofer to further develop exclusively for and transfer to us rights to proprietary technology and intellectual property rights in the fields defined in the agreements comprising principally plant-based human vaccines, human antibodies, and human therapeutic proteins and veterinary applications of plant-based influenza vaccines. Additionally the TTA provides that Fraunhofer will pay to us a royalty payment equal to 9% of all receipts, if any, realized by Fraunhofer from sales, licensing or commercialization of the intellectual property licensed from us.

&#160;

Prior to the effective date of the Settlement Agreement, we were obligated to make non-refundable payments to Fraunhofer aggregating $10,000,000, in installments of $2,000,000 per year over a five year period commencing in November 2009 and expiring in November 2014, and Fraunhofer was required to expend an amount at least equal to the amounts payable by us for the purpose of engaging in services to further the development of our technology. In addition to the annual research service payments, we were required to make royalty payments to Fraunhofer equal to 1% of all receipts derived by us from sales of products utilizing our proprietary technology and 15% of all receipts derived by us from licensing our propriety technology to third parties for a period of fifteen years. Additionally, beginning in 2010 and continuing until 2024, the TTA provided that we remit minimum annual royalty payments to Fraunhofer in the amount of $200,000 (the &#8220;Minimum Annual Payment&#8221;).

&#160;

The Settlement Agreement, which was intended to better align the mutual interests of iBio and Fraunhofer, has the following effects:

&#160;

&#183; Our liabilities to Fraunhofer in the amount of approximately $2.9 million as of June 30, 2013 were released and terminated; &#160;

&#183; Our obligation under the TTA, prior to the Settlement Agreement, to make three $1 million payments to Fraunhofer in April 2013, November 2013, and April 2014 (&#8220;Guaranteed Annual Payments&#8221;) was terminated and replaced with an undertaking to engage Fraunhofer for at least $3 million in work requested and directed by iBio before December 31, 2015. We believed that our right to select and direct specific projects would improve the efficiency of our product development activities and that the extension of the period over which this commitment must be fulfilled would enhance our ability to manage our cash outflow; &#160;

&#183; We terminated and released Fraunhofer from the obligation to make further financial contributions toward the enhancement, improvement and expansion of our technology in an amount at least equal to the Guaranteed Annual Payments, because we believed our technology development phase was completed and prospectively would be focusing on product development. In addition, we terminated and released Fraunhofer from the obligation to further reimburse us for certain past and future patent-related expenses; &#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Our obligation to remit to Fraunhofer minimum annual royalty payments in the amount of $200,000 was terminated. Instead we will be obligated to remit royalties to Fraunhofer only on technology license revenues that we actually receive and on revenues from actual sales by us of products derived from our technology until the later of November 2023 or until such time as the aggregate royalty payments total at least $4 million; &#160;

&#183; The rate at which we will be obligated to pay royalties to Fraunhofer on iBioLaunch and iBioModulator license revenues we receive was reduced from 15% to 10%; and &#160;

&#183; Any and all other claims of each party to any other amounts due at June 30, 2013 were mutually released. &#160;

Additionally, we and Fraunhofer entered into research and development service agreements with respect to two projects, specifically the further development of the recombinant form of C1 esterase inhibitor and additional development services in connection with the transfer of our technology related to facility design to Fiocruz. The technology transfer for facility design was completed for $97,767. The C-1 program was suspended after payment of $544,687.

Alliance with GE Healthcare 

&#160;

In July 2012, we formed a global alliance with GE Healthcare (&#8220;GEHC&#8221;) to commercialize our plant-based technologies for the manufacture of biopharmaceuticals and vaccines. The alliance builds on the development and marketing agreement which we entered into with GEHC in 2010 and seeks to combine the iBioLaunch platform with GEHC&#8217;s capabilities in start-to-finish technologies for biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Under the terms of global alliance agreement, iBio will be the preferred provider of vaccine or therapeutic product manufacturing technology incorporating a plant based protein expression system, while GEHC will be the preferred provider of engineering services and bioprocess solutions, to any customers that may be interested in a bio-manufacturing facility incorporating a plant-based expression system. The global alliance agreement further specifies allocation of responsibilities for product development, process scale-up, facilities design and development, and technology transfer among iBio, Fraunhofer, and GEHC. Additionally, the global alliance agreement also sets forth the terms of a non-exclusive commercial license to iBio&#8217;s technology that we have agreed to offer to any customer referred to it by GEHC as a part of the global alliance.

&#160;

In April 2013, together with GEHC, we announced that Fiocruz had committed to build and had recently contracted with GEHC for the design of new plant-based manufacturing facility that would use our iBioLaunch technology.

&#160;

Although the Fiocruz project is proceeding, and was the subject of a recent visit of the Fiocruz team to the iBio CMO facility and discussions with senior iBio management, political and economic conditions in Brazil have affected the original schedule and may continue to affect the prospective schedule for development and completion. 

&#160; 

Fiocruz Collaboration and License 

&#160;

In January 2011, we entered into collaboration and granted a commercial, royalty-bearing license to Fiocruz for the use of our proprietary technology in connection with the development, manufacture and commercialization by Fiocruz of certain vaccine products. Fiocruz, a unit of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, a central agency of the Ministry of Health of Brazil, is a leader in the production, development and commercialization in Latin America of vaccines, reagents and biopharmaceuticals. Additionally, Fiocruz, a certified World Health Organization provider to United Nations agencies, is a global leader in the manufacture of yellow fever vaccine. Fiocruz manufactures and exports yellow fever vaccine to over 60 countries. The World Health Organization has estimated that 200,000 unvaccinated people contract yellow fever each year, and approximately 30,000 die from the disease.

&#160;

Pursuant to the terms of the collaboration and license agreement among iBio, Fraunhofer and Fiocruz, Fiocruz has the right to develop and commercialize yellow fever vaccine derived from the use of our iBioLaunch technology in Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa. Fiocruz will fund development of this vaccine product and if successfully developed and commercialized, iBio will receive royalty payments from the sales of the product in those territories. iBio has retained the right, which is sublicenseable, to commercialize the product in all other territories subject to payment of a royalty back to Fiocruz. Additionally, Fiocruz has engaged iBio to perform certain research and development activities associated with the yellow fever vaccine project. Based upon the expertise possessed by Fraunhofer, we engaged Fraunhofer as a subcontractor to perform these research and development services.

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In April 2013, Fiocruz committed to the design of a new plant-based multipurpose manufacturing facility in Brazil and anticipates construction of such facility in the next few years. This multipurpose facility is being designed in manner that will enable the incorporation and utilization of our iBioLaunch platform.

&#160;

On June 12, 2014, Fiocruz, Fraunhofer and iBio executed an amendment to the Agreement (the &#8220;Amended Agreement&#8221;) which provides for revised research and development, work plans, reporting, objectives, estimated budget, and project billing process. The effect of the amendment resulted in a charge of approximately $1.007 million to general and administrative expenses for the noncollectibility of an accounts receivable from Fiocruz for revenues recorded for the year ended June 30, 2013 and a credit of approximately $1.007 million to research and development expenses and a corresponding adjustment to accounts payable relating to expenses accrued at June 30, 2013 owed to Fraunhofer.

&#160;

For the year ended June 30, 2014, under the Amended Agreement, the Company recognized revenue of $205,000 for work performed for Fiocruz pursuant to the Amended Agreement by the Company&#8217;s subcontractor, Fraunhofer, and recognized research and development expenses of the same amount &#8212; $205,000 &#8211; due Fraunhofer for that work.

&#160; 

For the year ended June 30, 2015, under the Amended Agreement, the Company recognized revenue of $1,851,000 for work performed for Fiocruz pursuant to the Amended Agreement by the Company&#8217;s subcontractor, Fraunhofer, and recognized research and development expenses of the same amount &#8212; $1,851,000 - due Fraunhofer for that work.

&#160;

For the year ended June 30, 2016, under the Amended Agreement, the Company recognized revenue of $758,000 for work performed for Fiocruz pursuant to the Amended Agreement by the Company&#8217;s subcontractor, Fraunhofer, and recognized research and development expenses of the same amount &#8212; $758,000 &#8211; due Fraunhofer for that work.

&#160;

License and Collaboration with Caliber Biotherapeutics LLC 

&#160;

In February 2013, we entered into a license with Caliber Biotherapeutics LLC, a for-profit biotechnology company that is focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutic proteins. This license to Caliber is for use of the iBioLaunch platform in connection with the development of an undisclosed monoclonal antibody-based therapeutic protein for an oncology indication. Caliber will conduct and fund the development of the product candidate and if successfully developed and commercialized, iBio will receive royalties on the sale of such product and other revenues. Although the license is still valid, product development and other activities by Caliber have been suspended without a disclosed plan for resumption.

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160;

Our research and development activities are directed and led by our President and by our Chief Scientific Officer. Excepting such direction and management, we outsource all our research and development activities. Outsourcing our research and development work allows us to develop our product candidates, and thereby promote the value of such product candidates and our technology platforms for licensing and product development purposes, without bearing the full risk and expense of establishing and maintaining our own research and development staff and facilities.

&#160;

Fraunhofer was our principal research and development contractor and provided research and development services to us and our predecessor company from 2003 through 2014. As a part of our collaboration with Fraunhofer, we established a business structure that allowed us to enlarge and broaden the scope of applications of our platform technology and enhance the value of our retained commercial rights by leveraging certain funding received by Fraunhofer from governmental entities, NGOs and other similar organizations.

&#160;

We achieved this result by granting licenses (a) to the government and NGO entities for not-for-profit applications of the intellectual property for which they have provided funding, and (b) to Fraunhofer for research purposes and applications in fields other than those retained by iBio or granted to the governmental entity or NGO. iBio retained ownership of the intellectual property and exclusive worldwide commercial rights in the fields of human health and veterinary influenza applications of the intellectual property. At this time, we are not pursuing development of such intellectual property in the field of veterinary influenza.

&#160;

Through June 30, 2016, Fraunhofer has been awarded a total of approximately $33 million in grants from the Bill &#38; Melinda Gates Foundation for development of product candidates based on the iBioLaunch platform and for research and development of vaccines against influenza, including H5N1 avian influenza, malaria and African sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis). To facilitate the grant and continuing support by the Bill &#38; Melinda Gates Foundation of the activities undertaken by Fraunhofer, we agreed to make our iBioLaunch platform available to various programs to complete development and provide &#8220;Global Access&#8221; to vaccines against influenza, rabies virus, malaria and trypanosomiasis, provided that if the Bill &#38; Melinda Gates Foundation and Fraunhofer do not pursue such programs to completion, the subject rights revert to us. The term &#8220;Global Access&#8221; means access for people most in need within the developing world in low income and lower-middle-income countries, as identified by the World Bank. Because we have exclusive commercial rights to the technology and these products for human health applications, this grant and any further similar grants benefit us by enabling the enhancement of Fraunhofer to enhance our platform technology and expansion of the information about the technical performance of product candidates derived from our technology. We may decide to commercially license such technology to collaborators for advancement into human clinical evaluation and eventual commercial development.

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

DoD has also provided funding to Fraunhofer for advanced development of our technology platform and for preclinical and clinical studies of an anthrax-plague combination vaccine and for an H1N1 influenza vaccine project. Through June 30, 2015, Fraunhofer received funding and funding commitments for these projects totaling approximately $34 million. This funding is similarly beneficial to us because we have retained the commercial rights to any technology improvements resulting from those projects.

&#160;

In December 2012, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a part of the National Institutes of Health, awarded a contract to Fraunhofer, for the development of a new generation anthrax vaccine. Fraunhofer is developing this new generation vaccine using the iBioLaunch platform and the funding it receives pursuant to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. We expect funded work to advance our technology.

&#160;

In summary, the advancement of our technology has indirectly benefited from the funding and funding commitments of research and development activities at Fraunhofer in recent years by U.S. government and non-governmental organizations in aggregate amounts exceeding $67 million.

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160;

In addition to the platform and product development engagements, in 2006, we engaged Fraunhofer to create a prototype production module for products made through the use of the iBioLaunch platform. The purpose of this engagement was to attract grants for the improvement of the prototype to become a pilot plant and to demonstrate the ease and economy with which iBioLaunch-derived products could be manufactured in order to attract potential licensees and increase the value of our share of business arrangements entered into with entities. The prototype design, which encompassed the entire production process from seeding, pre-infiltration plant growth, infiltration of plants with agrobacteria, harvesting of plant tissue and purification of target proteins, was completed in May 2008. A pilot plant based upon this prototype funded substantially by DARPA was subsequently constructed by Fraunhofer at its facility in Newark, Delaware. The physical assets consisting of the pilot plant, and the equipment in it, are owned by Fraunhofer and have been validated for current Good Manufacturing Practices (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;) production, but all the proprietary intellectual property pertaining to those physical assets is property of iBio. We are not limited to the use of this facility and have also contracted with Caliber Biotherapeutics LLC for certain manufacturing services. We also expect to contract with other third party providers for development, manufacturing, fill and finish services.

&#160;

In January 2016, we entered into a contract manufacturing joint venture operated through our subsidiary iBio CMO, which is owned 70% by iBio and 30% by an affiliate of Eastern Capital Limited (&#8220;Eastern&#8221;), a stockholder of the Company. iBio CMO expects to operate on the basis of three parallel lines of business: (1) Development and manufacturing of third party products; (2) Development and production of iBio&#8217;s proprietary product(s) for treatment of fibrotic diseases; and (3) Commercial technology transfer services. We contributed to iBio CMO a royalty bearing license which grants iBio CMO a non-exclusive license to use our proprietary technologies for research purposes and an exclusive U.S. license for manufacturing purposes.

&#160;

iBio CMO&#8217;s operations take place in Bryan, Texas in a facility controlled by another affiliate of Eastern, as sublandlord. The facility is a Class A life sciences building on the campus of Texas A&#38;M University, designed and equipped for plant-made manufacture of biopharmaceuticals. iBio CMO has been granted a 34-year sublease for the facility. Commercial operations commenced in January 2016.

&#160;

Proprietary iBio technologies have been used to advance development of certain products that have been commercially infeasible to develop with conventional technologies such as Chinese hamster ovary cell systems and microbial fermentation methods. They can be used to create and operate manufacturing facilities at substantially lower capital and operating costs. These include development and manufacture of both vaccine and therapeutic product candidates. iBio CMO plans to promote commercial collaborations with third parties on the basis of these technology advantages and to work with customers to achieve laboratory scale technical milestones that can form the basis of longer-term manufacturing business arrangements. iBio itself will be a client of iBio CMO for further IND advancement of its proprietary products beginning with IBIO-CFB03 for the treatment of a range of fibrotic diseases. iBio will work with iBio CMO on the production of IBIO-CFB03 for clinical trials and, with clinical success, for commercial launch.

&#160;

Due to the lower capital and operating cost requirements for pharmaceutical production via iBio technology versus legacy methods, certain corporations and governments that have not already established manufacturing capacity for biologic products are client prospects for both development and for commercial technology transfer services to enable autonomous manufacturing in the market being served. For example, in Brazil, iBio has been collaborating with the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) to develop a recombinant yellow fever vaccine based on iBio technology. iBio&#8217;s contract with Fiocruz provides for commercial technology transfer services as the product candidates enters human clinical trials. Over time, iBio expects to work closely with iBio CMO to provide such technology transfer services for a variety of both commercial and government clients.

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We exclusively control intellectual property developed at Fraunhofer for human health applications. We also exclusively control the veterinary field for plant-made influenza vaccines. In addition, we have an exclusive worldwide license agreement with the University of Pittsburgh covering U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications and related intellectual property owned by the University of Pittsburgh pertinent to the use of endostatin peptides for the treatment of fibrosis. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technologies and products and to preserve our trade secrets. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary rights, by among other methods, filing patent applications in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to cover certain aspects of our technology.

&#160;

We currently own 20 U.S. patents and 47 international patents. We have an exclusive license to three U.S. patents and one application. Additionally, we have one U.S. and one international patent application allowed, as well as four U.S. and 15 international applications pending. International patents and applications include numerous foreign countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Korea, and several countries in Europe. We continue to prepare patent applications relating to our expanding technology in the U.S. and abroad.

Competition 

&#160;

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than any products that we or our collaborators may develop based on the use of our platform technology.

&#160;

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

While we believe that the potential advantages of our technologies will enable us to compete effectively against other providers of technology for biologic product manufacturing, many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, clinical trials, regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through arrangements with large and established companies, and this may reduce the value of our platform technologies for the purposes of establishing license agreements. In addition, these third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies and technology licenses complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business.

&#160;

We expect to rely upon licensees, collaborators or customers for support in advancing certain of our drug candidates and intend to rely on additional work with our collaborators during our efforts to commercialize our product candidates. Our licensees, collaborators or customers may be conducting multiple product development efforts within the same disease areas that are the subjects of their agreements with us. Agreements with collaborators may not preclude them from pursuing development efforts using a different approach from that which is the subject of our agreement with them. Any of our drug candidates, therefore, may be subject to competition with a drug candidate under development by a customer.

&#160;

There are currently approved vaccines and therapies for many of the diseases and conditions addressed by the product candidates in our pipeline. There are also a number of companies working to develop new drugs and other therapies for diseases of commercial interest to us that are undergoing various stages of testing including clinical trials. The key competitive factors affecting the success of our platforms for commercial product candidates are likely to be efficacy, safety profile, price, and convenience.

&#160;

Government Regulation and Product Approval 

&#160;

Regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical drugs and vaccines. All of the vaccine and therapeutic products developed from our platform technologies will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, pharmaceutical drugs and vaccines are subject to rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and other pre-marketing approval requirements by the FDA and regulatory authorities in other countries. In the U.S., various federal, and, in some cases, state statutes and regulations, also govern or impact the manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, record-keeping and marketing of vaccines and pharmaceutical products. The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Regulatory approval, if and when obtained for any of our product candidates, may be limited in scope, which may significantly limit the indicated uses for which our product candidates may be marketed. Further, approved vaccines and drugs are subject to ongoing review and discovery of previously unknown problems that may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale or use or in their withdrawal from the market.

&#160;

Before any product candidates with potential immunization or therapeutic value may be tested in human subjects, we must satisfy stringent government requirements for preclinical studies. Preclinical testing includes both in vitro and in vivo laboratory evaluation and characterization of the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. &#8220; In vitro &#8221; refers to tests conducted with cells in culture and &#8220; in vivo &#8221; refers to tests conducted in animals. Preclinical testing results obtained from studies in several animal species, as well as data from in vitro studies, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND and are reviewed by the FDA prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. These preclinical data must provide an adequate basis for evaluating both the safety and the scientific rationale for the initial clinical trials. In the case of vaccine candidates, animal immunogenicity and immune protection tests must establish a sound scientific basis to believe that the product candidate may be beneficial when administered to humans.

&#160;

An IND becomes effective automatically 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concern or questions about the conduct of the clinical trials as outlined in the IND prior to that time. In such an event, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. For additional information on the most recent FDA regulations and guidance on vaccine and therapeutic product testing and approval, visit its website at http://www.fda.gov.

&#160;

Any products we or a licensee manufactures or distributes under FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register with the FDA and, where appropriate, state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with current cGMPs, which are the standards the FDA requires be met during the manufacturing of drugs and biologic products, and which impose procedural and documentation requirements upon us and any third party manufacturers we utilize.

&#160;

&#160; 15 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

To the extent we conduct vaccine or therapeutic product development activities outside the United States, we will also be subject to a wide variety of foreign regulations governing the development, manufacture and marketing of our product candidates. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must still be obtained prior to manufacturing or marketing the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time needed to secure approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. We cannot assure you that clinical trials conducted in one country will be accepted by other countries or that approval in one country will result in approval in any other country. The product testing and clinical trial requirements that must be met before a product candidate can be marketed are substantial, time-consuming, and require investments of millions of dollars per product candidate.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of October 13, 2016, we had eight employees in iBio and eighteen employees in iBio CMO. Our employees are not represented by any union and are not the subject of a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. Since our business strategy is based on outsourcing some of our development and clinical trial work to third parties, we believe this staffing level will be sufficient to meet our needs.

&#160;
