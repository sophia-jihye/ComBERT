INFORMATION REGARDING INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETS, INC. 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are a financial services company specializing in fixed income markets. We were founded in 1999 as an investment firm focused on small-cap banking institutions, but have grown to provide an expanding range of capital markets &#160; and asset management services . Our business segments are Capital Markets, Principal Investing, and Asset Management. Our Capital Markets business segment consists of fixed income sales, trading, and financing as well as new issue placements in corporate and securitized products and advisory services, operating primarily through our subsidiaries, JVB in the United States and CCFL in Europe. In January 2014 the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;) approved the consolidation of our two domestic broker-dealer subsidiaries, CCPR and JVB, into a single broker-dealer subsidiary, which resulted in one broker-dealer subsidiary in the United States operating as JVB. Our Principa l Investing business segment historically was comprised primarily of our investments in the investment vehicles we manage d . In 2014, our Principal Investing segment invested available capital outside of the investment vehicles that we manage, which consisted primarily of investments in collateralized loan obligations (&#8220;CLOs&#8221;). These investments in CLOs were marked down significantly in 2015 but continue to make routine distributions. We intend to continue to hol d these investments but have made no new investments in CLO positions since July 2014. Our Asset Management business segment manages assets through investment vehicles, such as collateralized debt obligations (&#8220;CDOs&#8221;), permanent capital vehicles, managed accounts, and investment funds. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $3.91 billion of assets under management (&#8220;AUM&#8221;) in fixed income assets in a variety of asset classes including United States and European bank and insurance trust preferred securities (&#8220;TruPS&#8221;) and European corporate loans. Almost all of our AUM, 95.8%, was in CDOs we manage, which were all securitized prior to 2008. 

&#160; 

On August 19, 2014, we entered into a definitive agreement (the &#8220;European Sale Agreement&#8221;) to sell our European operations to C&#38;Co Europe Acquisition LLC, an entity controlled by Daniel G. Cohen, president and chief executive of our European operations and vice chairman of our board of directors, for approximately $8.7 million. The transaction was subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval from the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;). On March 26, 2015, the parties to the European Sale Agreement agreed to extend the deadline for the closing of the transactions contemplated by the European Sale Agreement from March 31, 2015 to June 30, 2015. In addition, the parties to the European Sale Agreement amended the date which C&#38;Co Europe Acquisition LLC was obligated to cause the settlement of intercompany accounts of CCFL and our subsidiaries, Cohen &#38; Compagnie, SAS and Unicum Capital, S.L., owed to the Operating LLC (the &#8220;Intercompany Payables&#8221;) from March 31, 2015 to June 30, 2015. 

Further, on June 30, 2015, the parties to the European Sale Agreement agreed to extend the deadline for the closing from June 30, 2015 to December 31, 2015 and the settlement date of the Intercompany Payables from June 30, 2015 to December 31, 2015 (the &#8220;Second Extension&#8221;). In connection with the Second Extension, the parties to the European Sale Agreement agreed that, if the transaction was terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the closing, then (i) Mr. Cohen would pay $0.6 million in respect of a portion of the legal and financial advisory fees and expenses incurred by us and the special committee of our board of directors in connection with the transaction since April 1, 2014 and (ii) an amendment (the &#8220;Employment Agreement Amendment&#8221;) to the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement, dated as of May 9, 2013, among the Operating LLC, the Company, Mr. Cohen and J.V.B. Financial Group Holdings, LP (formerly known as C&#38;Co/PrinceRidge Holdings LP) (the &#8220;Employment Agreement&#8221;), would become effective. The Cohen Employment Agreement Amendment would provide that if Mr. Cohen&#8217;s employment was terminated by the Operating LLC without cause or by Mr. Cohen for good reason (as such terms are defined in the Cohen Employment Agreement), the Operating LLC would pay Mr. Cohen a maximum of $1 million as a severance benefit. The Cohen Employment Agreement currently provides that, in the event of such termination, the Operating LLC will pay Mr. Cohen a minimum of $3 million as a severance benefit. 

The European Sale Agreement provides that either party may terminate the agreement after December 31, 2015. On February 18, 2016, C&#38;Co Europe Acquisition LLC provided notice to the Operating LLC that it continues to evaluate the transaction. To date, neither party has terminated the European Sale Agreement, and the Company and the Operating LLC continue to evaluate the transaction. 

Financial information concerning our business segments is set forth in &#8220;Item 7 &#8212; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; beginning on page 41 and note 27 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information regarding our geographic locations, see Item. 2 Properties, below, and note 27 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160;

Capital Markets 

Our Capital Markets business segment consists primarily of fixed income sales, trading, and financing as well as new issue placements in corporate and securitized products and advisory services operated through our subsidiaries, JVB in the United States and CCFL in Europe. At the beginning of 2011, we closed our acquisition of JVB Holdings, the parent company of JVB, a Boca Raton, Florida-based fixed income broker-dealer that specializes in small size transactions in certificates of deposit (&#8220;CDs&#8221;), corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;MBS&#8221;), structured products, municipal securities, and U.S. government agency securities primarily within the dealer market. In May 2011, we contributed a substantial part of our non-JVB Capital Markets business segment to PrinceRidge, CCPR&#8217;s parent company, in exchange for an approximate 70% ownership interest in PrinceRidge, a New York-based financial services firm comprised of an investment banking group and a sales and trading group. During 2012 and 2013, our ownership interest in PrinceRidge increased to 100% with the repurchase of all of PrinceRidge&#8217;s minority partner ownership interests therein. Through the acquisitions of JVB and PrinceRidge, we acquired complementary businesses. In the later part of 2013, we made the decision to combine CCPR and JVB into one broker-dealer. The combination was completed in January 2014. As a result, our combined broker-dealer subsidiary in the United States now operates under the JVB brand. 

Historically, our Capital Markets business segment has included the following U.S. broker-dealers: Cohen &#38; Company Securities, LLC (&#8220;CCS&#8221;), Cohen &#38; Company Capital Markets, LLC (&#8220;CCCM&#8221;), CCPR, and JVB. We acquired CCCM (formerly known as Fairfax, LLC) in 2010 primarily to avail ourselves of an existing clearing relationship. In May 2011, CCCM became a wholly-owned subsidiary of PrinceRidge and in February 2012, PrinceRidge merged CCCM into CCPR. CCPR operated under our PrinceRidge subsidiary until the merger with JVB became effective in January 2014. JVB operates under our JVB Holdings subsidiary. CCS was our legacy broker-dealer that was registered under the Exchange Act and was a member of FINRA and the Securities Industry Protection Corporation (&#8220;SIPC&#8221;) until it filed a Form BDW in September 2012 seeking to withdraw all of its registrations with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) and from each jurisdiction in which it was licensed or registered as a securities broker-dealer, as well as its membership in FINRA, the NASDAQ Stock Market, and the International Securities Exchange. CCS&#8217; withdrawal from all such regulatory authorities became effective in November 2012. CCS has conducted no securities-related business activities since May 2011. Currently, JVB is our sole operating U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary. In addition, our European subsidiary, CCFL, is regulated by the FCA in the United Kingdom. 

&#160; 

Our fixed income sales and trading group provides trade execution to corporate investors, institutional investors, and other smaller broker-dealers. We specialize in a variety of products, including but not limited to: corporate bonds and loans, asset-backed securities (&#8220;ABS&#8221;), MBS, commercial mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;CMBS&#8221;), residential mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;RMBS&#8221;), CDOs, CLOs, collateralized bond obligations (&#8220;CBOs&#8221;), collateralized mortgage obligations (&#8220;CMOs&#8221;), municipal securities, Small Business Administration loans (&#8220;SBA loans&#8221;), U.S. government bonds, U.S. government agency securities, brokered deposits and CDs for small banks and, hybrid capital of financial institutions including TruPS, whole loans, and other structured financial instruments. We had offered execution and brokerage services for equity derivative products until December 31, 2012, when we sold our equity derivatives brokerage business to a new entity owned by two of our former employees. 

In addition, JVB has a funding desk that acts as an intermediary between borrowers and lenders of short-term funds and provides funding for various inventory positions through the use of repurchase agreements. In 2012, a trading desk for &#8220;to-be-announced&#8221; securities (&#8220;TBAs&#8221;) was established. TBAs are forward mortgage-backed securities whose collateral remain unknown until just prior to the trade settlement. The forward collateral types are exclusively issued by United States government agencies, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (&#8220;Fannie Mae&#8221;), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (&#8220;Freddie Mac&#8221;), and the Government National Mortgage Association (&#8220;Ginnie Mae&#8221;) . The objective of the TBA business is to provide liquidity to institutional mortgage originators who hedge their mortgage pipelines. In addition to providing credit for MBS trading lines, JVB offers execution services, trading of specified pools, and financing for qualified originators. The TBA desk offers a wide range of solutions for institutional clients seeking to enhance mortgage pipeline execution and overall portfolio profitability. 

We have been in the Capital Markets business since our inception. Our Capital Markets business segment has transformed over time in response to market opportunities and the needs of our clients. The initial focus was on sales and trading of listed equities of small financial companies with a particular emphasis on bank stocks. Early on, a market opportunity arose for participation in a particular segment of the debt market, the securitization of TruPS. We began assisting small banks in the issuance of TruPS through securitized pools. These investment vehicles were structured and underwritten by large investment banks while our broker-dealer typically participated as a co-placement agent or selling group member. We also participated in the secondary market trading of these securities between institutional clients. 

In early 2008, our management team made the strategic decision to restructure our Capital Markets business model from exclusively focusing on TruPS and structured credit products to a more traditional fixed income broker-dealer platform with more diversified revenue streams primarily from trading activity. In the ensuing years, we have hired many sales and trading professionals with expertise in areas that complement our core competency in structured credit. In 2011, our acquisitions of JVB and PrinceRidge further expanded our Capital Markets platform. As a result of these acquisitions, offset by subsequent downsizings, our Capital Markets staffing increased from six sales and trading professionals at the beginning of 2008, to over 230 professionals in mid-2011, and decreased to approximately 65 professionals as of December 31, 2015. We continue to explore opportunities to add 

&#160;

complementary distribution channels, hire experienced talent, expand our presence across asset classes, and bolster the service capabilities of our Capital Markets business segment. 

Our Capital Markets business segment generates revenue through the following activities: (1) trading activities, which include execution and brokerage services, securities lending activities, riskless trading activities as well as gains and losses (unrealized and realized), and income and expense earned on securities classified as trading, and (2) new issue and advisory revenue comprised of (a) origination fees for newly created financial instruments originated by us, (b) revenue from advisory services, and (c) new issue revenue associated with arranging and placing the issuance of newly created financial instruments. Our Capital Markets business segment has offices in Boca Raton, Charlotte, Cold Spring Harbor (New York), Hunt Valley (Maryland), London, New York, Paris, and Philadelphia. 

Trades in our Capital Markets business segment can be either &#8220;riskless&#8221; or risk-based. &#8220;Riskless trades&#8221; are transacted with a customer order in hand, resulting in limited risk to us. &#8220;Risk-based trades&#8221; involve us owning the securities and thus placing our capital at risk. Such risk-based trading activity may include the use of leverage. In recent years, we began to utilize more leverage in our Capital Markets business segment. We believe that the prudent use of capital to facilitate client orders increases trading volume and profitability. Any gains or losses on trading securities that we have purchased in the secondary market are recorded in our Capital Markets business segment, whereas any gains or losses on securities that we retained in our sponsored investment vehicles or other principal investments are recorded in our Principal Investing business segment. 

During the first quarter of 2014, we stopped providing investment banking and advisory services in the United States as a result of the loss of certain of JVB&#8217;s former employees. Currently, JVB&#8217;s primary source of new issue revenue is our SBA group&#8217;s participation in COOF Securitizations, defined as SBA Confirmation of Originator Fee Certificates (&#8220;COOF&#8221;). The SBA secondary market program allows for the purchaser of a SBA loan certificate to &#8220;strip&#8221; a portion of the interest rate from a guaranteed loan portion, creating what is called an originator fee or interest only strip. This enhances the ability of SBA pool assemblers to securitize the guaranteed portion of loans that do not have the same interest rate. Our SBA group&#8217;s participation in this area has grown over recent years. 

Principal Investing 

Our Principal Investing business segment has historically been comprised of investments in the investment vehicles we manage, as well as investments in certain other structured products, and the related gains and losses that they generate. After the sale of our interests in the Star Asia Finance, Limited (&#8220;Star Asia&#8221;), Star Asia Management Ltd. (&#8220;Star Asia Manager&#8221;), Star Asia Japan Special Situations LP (the &#8220;Star Asia Special Situations Fund&#8221;), Star Asia Advisors, Ltd. (&#8220;SAA Manager&#8221;), Star Asia Partners Ltd. (&#8220;SAP GP&#8221;), and Star Asia Capital Management, LLC (&#8220;Star Asia Capital Management&#8221; and together with Star, Asia, Star Asia Manager, Star Asia Special Situations Fund, SAA Manager, and SAP GP, the &#8220;Star Asia Group&#8221;) in February 2014, we refocused our Principal Investing portfolio on products that we do not manage, which has consisted primarily of investments in CLO securities. During 2014, we made investments in ten separate CLOs that were not sponsored by us. During 2014 and 2015, we sold three of these CLO investments. These investments in CLOs were marked down significantly in 2015 but continue to make routine distributions. We intend to continue to hold these investments but have made no any new investments in CLO positions since July 2014. As of December 31, 2015, our Principal Investing portfolio was valued at $14.9 million and included investments in seven CLOs (valued at $11.6 million), EuroDekania (Cayman) Ltd. (&#8220;EuroDekania&#8221;) (valued at $2.5 million), Tiptree Financial Inc. (&#8220;Tiptree&#8221;) (valued at $0.4 million), and other securities (valued at $0.5 million). 

A description of our Principal Investments as of December 31, 2015 is set forth below. 

Investments in CLO Securities. After the sale of our interests in the Star Asia Group, we refocused our Principal Investing portfolio on products that we do not manage, which has consisted primarily of investments in CLO securities. Our focus on CLO investments capitalizes on our strengths in structured credit and leveraged finance. During 2014, we made investments in ten separate CLOs that were not sponsored by us, which aggregated to over $25 million. Each of our 2014 purchases of CLO securities ranged in size from approximately $1.75 million to $3.0 million. Of these ten CLO investments, nine represented investments in equity, the most junior tranche of the CLO. We sold one of the CLO investments for a small gain during 2014 and we sold two of the CLO investments for a small loss during 2015. The value of these investments is impacted by the performance of the underlying loans in these CLOs as well as the overall CLO market. During 2015, we recorded $1.5 million of investment losses on our investments in these CLO securities. As of December 31, 2015, our investments in seven CLO securities had approximately $11.6 million in fair value. We intend to continue to hold these investments but have made no new investments in CLO positions since July 2014. 

EuroDekania. EuroDekania is a Cayman Islands exempted company that is externally managed by CCFL. EuroDekania has invested in hybrid capital securities of European banks and insurance companies, CMBS, RMBS, and widely syndicated leverage loans. We made an initial investment of &#8364;5.3 million in EuroDekania in its initial private offering of securities in March 2007. In August 2010, May 2011, June 2011, November 2012, December 2013, and December 2015, we purchased an additional $0.3 million, $0.4 million, $0.1 million, $15 thousand, $1.0 million, and $0.1 million, respectively, in secondary trades. In addition to changes in the net asset value (&#8220;NAV&#8221;) of the entity, the value of our investment is impacted by changes in the U.S. dollar-Euro currency exchange rate due to the fact that our investment in EuroDekania is denominated in Euros. During 2014, we put in place Euro-based foreign currency forward contracts to partially hedge fluctuations in the investment value of EuroDekania. As December 31, 2015, we 

&#160;

had outstanding Euro-based foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of 2.75 million Euros. We recorded $0.4 million of investment gains related to our investment in these forward contracts during 2015. During 2015, we recorded $12 thousand of investment losses on our investment in EuroDekania. As of December 31, 2015, we owned approximately 17% of EuroDekania, and our 2.7 million shares of EuroDekania were valued at $2.5 million. 

&#160; 

MFCA/Tiptree. Muni Funding Company of America, LLC (&#8220;MFCA&#8221;) was a Delaware limited liability company that we managed until March 18, 2009, when we assigned our management agreement with MFCA to a third party. MFCA primarily invested in securities exempt from United States federal income taxes directly or through structured tax-exempt pass-through vehicles, which are similar in nature to CDOs, as well as other structured credit entities. MFCA began operations in June 2007 when it raised approximately $159 million of net proceeds from a private offering of securities, of which we invested $5.0 million. In June 2009, MFCA completed a rights offering in which we invested $0.6 million. In June 2011, MFCA was merged into Tiptree Financial Partners, L.P., and our investment in MFCA was converted into an interest in Tiptree Financial Partners, L.P. In mid-2013, Tiptree Financial Partners, L.P. completed a transaction with its publicly-traded, majority-owned subsidiary, Care Investment Trust Inc., which combined their businesses into a single operating company. In connection with the closing of this transaction, the company, formerly known as Care Investment Trust Inc., changed its name to &#8220;Tiptree Financial Inc.&#8221; Tiptree Financial Inc. (&#8220;Tiptree&#8221;) (NASDAQ: TIPT), a Maryland corporation, is a diversified financial services holding company that was organized in 2007 and primarily focuses on the acquisition of majority control equity interests in financial services businesses. During the third quarter of 2014, we exchanged the units we held in Tiptree Financial Partners, L.P. into 310,950 shares of Tiptree Financial, Inc. 

As of December 31, 2015, we owned 57,544 shares of Tiptree that were valued at $0.4 million. During 2015, we sold a significant portion of our Tiptree investment and recorded $0.4 million of investment losses on our investment in Tiptree. 

Other Securities. We have invested in various original issuance securities of the deals we have sponsored and certain other deals that we have not sponsored. We have also received options or warrants in publicly traded securities as payment for certain investment banking services that we have provided. During 2015, we recorded $0.1 million of investment gains on these other legacy securities. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $0.5 million in fair value of these other legacy securities. 

Asset Management 

Our Asset Management business segment has managed assets within a variety of investment vehicles, including CDOs, permanent capital vehicles, managed accounts, and investment funds. We earn management fees for our ongoing asset management services provided to these investment vehicles, which may include fees both senior and subordinate to the securities issued by the investment vehicles. Management fees are based on the value of the AUM or the investment performance of the vehicle, or both. As of December 31, 2015, we had $3.9 billion in AUM, of which 95.8% was in CDOs we manage. 

Our AUM increased from $965.8 million at December 31, 2003, to $3.9 billion at December 31, 2015, but has declined year-to-year since 2007. AUM refers to assets under management, and equals the sum of: (1) the gross assets included in the CDOs that we have sponsored and/or manage; plus (2) the NAV of the permanent capital vehicles and investment funds we manage; plus (3) the NAV of other managed accounts. Our calculation of AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers and, as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers. This definition of AUM is not necessarily identical to any definition of AUM that may be used in our management agreements. 

Currently, almost all of our AUM is in CDOs that we manage. A CDO is a form of secured borrowing. The borrowing is secured by different types of fixed income assets such as corporate or mortgage loans or bonds. The borrowing is in the form of a securitization, which means that the lenders are actually investing in notes secured by the assets. In the event of a default, the lender will have recourse only to the assets securing the loan. We have originated assets for, served as co-placement agent for, and continue to manage this type of investment vehicle, which is generally structured as a trust or other special purpose vehicle. In addition, we invested in some of the debt and equity securities initially issued by certain CDOs, gains and losses of which recorded in our Principal Investing business segment. 

These structures can hold different types of se curities. Historically, we focused on the following asset classes: (1) United States and European bank and insurance TruPS and subordinated debt; (2) United States ABS, such as MBS and commercial real estate loans; (3) United States and European corporate loans; and (4) United States obligations of non-profit entities. 

The credit crisis caused available liquidity, particularly through CDOs and other types of securitizations, to decline precipitously. Our ability to accumulate assets for securitization effectively ended with the market disruption. We securitized $14.8 billion of assets in 16 trusts during 2006; $17.8 billion of assets in 16 trusts during 2007; $400 million of assets in one trust during 2008; and zero assets in zero trusts during 2009 through 2015. 

We generate asset management revenue for our services as asset manager. Many of our sponsored CDOs, particularly those where the assets are bank TruPS and ABS, have experienced asset deferrals, defaults, and rating agency downgrades that reduce our management fees. In 16 out of 19 of our ABS deals, the extent of the deferrals, defaults, and downgrades caused credit-related coverage tests to trigger an event of default. Under an event of default, the senior debt holders in the structure can generally force a liquidation of the entity. To date, 15 of our ABS structures have been liquidated following an event of default, and we transferred the collateral management agreements of another five ABS deals to unrelated third parties, leaving us with no ABS structures under 

&#160;

management. In addition, many of the CDOs we manage have experienced high enough levels of deferrals, defaults, and downgrades to reduce our subordinated management fees to zero. In a typical structure, any failure of a covenant coverage test redirects cash flow to pay down the senior debt until compliance is restored. If compliance is eventually restored, the entity will resume paying subordinated management fees to us, including those that accrued but remained unpaid during the period of non-compliance. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had three subsidiaries that act as collateral managers and investment advisors to the CDOs that we manage. With the exception of CCFL, these entities are registered investment advisors under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the &#8220;Investment Advisers Act&#8221;). CCFL is regulated by the FCA.

(1) On July 29, 2010, we completed the sale of our Alesco X-XVII contracts to an unrelated third party. For more information see &#8220;Item 7 &#8212; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; beginning on page 41. During 2014, we entered into a sub-advisory agreement to employ Mead Park Advisors, LLC to render advice and assistance with respect to collateral management services to the Alesco portfolios. See note 29 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

(2) During 2014, the two Dekania U.S. deals liquidated after successful auctions. 

(3) Dekania Europe and Munda portfolios are denominated in Euros. For purposes of the table above they have been converted to U.S. dollars at the prevailing exchange rates at the points in time presented. 

(4) During the third quarter of 2012, we resigned as asset manager of the Xenon deal and agreed to forego certain collateral manager rights that were unique to this CDO, related to the auction provisions. 

(5) On March 29, 2011, we completed the sale of our investment advisory agreements relating to a series of closed-end distressed debt funds, known as the Deep Value funds, and certain separately managed accounts to a new entity owned by two of our former employees, known as Strategos Capital Management, LLC (&#8220;Strategos&#8221;). At the same time, we changed the name of our wholly owned subsidiary that previously served as the investment advisor from Strategos Capital Management, LLC to Cira SCM, LLC (&#8220;Cira SCM&#8221;). In connection with the transaction, we entered into a sub-advisory agreement to employ Strategos Capital Management, LLC to render advice and assistance with respect to collateral management services to the Kleros and Libertas portfolios, which was terminated during 2014. 

(6) During 2013 and 2014, we resigned as collateral manager of three of the Kleros deals and two of the Libertas deals. For the Kleros deals, our resignations were effective in August 2013, June 2014, and July 2014. For the Libertas deals, our resignations were effective in February 2014 and June 2014. 

(7) Prior to August 2012, we served only as the junior manager of the Munda CLO and we shared the management fees equally with the lead manager. In August 2012, we became lead manager (and remained as junior manager). Subsequent to becoming the lead manager, we earn all of the management fees related to the Munda CLO. 

(8) In February 2014, we announced the completion of the sale of our ownership interests in the Star Asia Group, which accounted for $282 million of our AUM as of December 31, 2013. 

A description of our CDO product lines that were under management as of December 31, 2015 is set forth below. 

Alesco and Dekania . As of December 31, 2015, we managed nine Alesco deals and three Dekania Europe deals, which were initially securitized during 2003 to 2007. Cohen &#38; Company Financial Management, LLC manages our Alesco platform. Dekania Capital Management, LLC manages the first two Dekania Europe deals that were issued. CCFL manages the third Dekania Europe deal that was issued. During 2014, the two Dekania U.S. deals, which were managed by Dekania Capital Management , LLC, were liquidated after successful auctions. During 2014, we entered into a sub-advisory agreement to employ Mead Park Advisors, LLC to render advice and assistance with respect to collateral management services to the Alesco portfolios. 

In general, our Alesco and Dekania Europe deals have the following terms. We receive senior and subordinate management fees, and there is a potential for incentive fees on certain deals if equity internal rates of return are greater than 15%. We can be removed as manager without cause if 66.7% of the rated note holders voting separately by class and 66.7% of the equity holders vote to remove us, or if 75% of the most senior note holders vote to remove us when certain over-collateralization ratios fall below 100%. We can be removed as manager for cause if a majority of the controlling class of note holders or a majority of equity holders vote to remove us. &#8220;Cause&#8221; includes unremedied violations of the collateral management agreement or indenture, defaults attributable to 

&#160;

certain actions of the manager, misrepresentations or fraud, criminal activity, bankruptcy, insolvency or dissolution. There is a non-call period for the equity holders, which ranges from three to six years. Once this non-call period expires, a majority of the equity holders can trigger an optional redemption as long as the liquidation of the collateral generates sufficient proceeds to pay all principal and accrued interest on the rated notes and all expenses. In ten years from closing, an auction call will be triggered if the rated notes have not been redeemed in full. In an auction call redemption, an appointee will conduct an auction of the collateral, which will only be executed if the highest bid results in sufficient proceeds to pay all principal and accrued interest on the rated notes and all expenses. If the auction is not successfully completed, all residual interest that would normally be distributed to equity holders will be sequentially applied to reduce the principal of the rated notes. Any failure of an over-collateralization coverage test redirects interest to paying down notes until compliance is restored. The securities mature up to 30 years from closing. An event of default will occur if certain over-collateralization ratios drop below 100%. While an event of default exists, a majority of the senior note holders can declare the principal and accrued and unpaid interest immediately due and payable. All of the Alesco CDOs we manage have reached their auction call redemption features which means the portfolio of collateral for each CDO is subject to an auction on either a quarterly or bi-annual basis. If an auction is successful, the management contract related to such CDO will be terminated in connection with the liquidation of the CDO and we will lose the related management fees. 

Munda . CCFL acts as lead and junior investment manager to the Munda CLO, a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands. In September 2012, CCFL assumed the lead investment management role from a large European bank. Munda CLO is comprised of broadly syndicated corporate loans primarily of European companies. Munda CLO was initially securitized in December 2007. 

In general, Munda CLO has the following terms. We receive senior and subordinate management fees, and there is no potential to earn incentive fees. We cannot be removed as investment manager without cause. We can be removed as investment manager for cause if 66.7% of the senior note holders and 66.7% of the equity holders vote to remove us. Cause includes unremedied violations of the collateral management agreement or trust deed, breach of the collateral management agreement that is not cured within 30-60 days, misrepresentations or fraud, criminal activity, bankruptcy, insolvency or dissolution, and certain key man provisions. There is a six year reinvestment period after closing during which the manager may sell and purchase collateral for the deal. After the last day of the reinvestment period, collateral principal collections will be applied to pay down the notes sequentially. There is a three year non-call period for the equity holders. Once this non-call period is over, a majority of the equity holders can trigger an optional redemption as long as the liquidation of collateral generates sufficient proceeds to cover all principal and accrued interest on the rated notes and all expenses. Any failure of over-collateralization coverage tests redirects interest to pay down notes until compliance is restored. Any failure of interest diversion tests during the reinvestment period redirects interest to purchasing collateral until compliance is restored. The maturity of the securities is 17 years from closing. An event of default will occur if certain over-collateralization ratios drop below 100%. While an event of default exists, a majority of the senior note holders can declare the principal and accrued and unpaid interest immediately due and payable. 

A description of our other investment vehicles that were under management as of December 31, 2015 is set forth below. 

&#160; 

EuroDekania . EuroDekania is a Cayman Islands exempted company that is externally managed by CCFL. In December 2013, as a cost savings measure, EuroDekania was restructured from a Guernsey closed end fund to a Cayman Islands exempted company. CCFL is entitled to receive an annual management fee of 0.50% of the gross equity of EuroDekania. This management fee is reduced, but not below zero, by EuroDekania&#8217;s proportionate share of the amount of any CDO collateral management fees that are paid to CCFL and its affiliates in connection with EuroDekania&#8217;s investment in CDOs managed by CCFL based on the percentage of equity EuroDekania holds in such CDOs. CCFL has not received any management fee since 2008, when EuroDekania invested in Munda CLO. Currently, EuroDekania is not making new investments, and has no plans to make new investments. As cash is received from current investments, it has been returned to EuroDekania&#8217;s shareholders. 

&#160; 

EuroDekania has invested in hybrid capital securities of European banks and insurance companies, CMBS, RMBS, and widely syndicated leverage loans. EuroDekania&#8217;s investments are denominated in Euros or British Pounds. EuroDekania began operations in March 2007 when it raised approximately &#8364;218 million in net proceeds from a private offering of securities, of which we invested &#8364;5.3 million. In addition, we made follow-on investments in EuroDekania through secondary trades of $0.3 million in August 2010, $0.4 million in May 2011, $0.1 million in June 2011, $15 thousand in November 2012, $1.0 million in December 2013, and $0.1 million in December 2015. 

As of December 31, 2015, we owned approximately 17% of EuroDekania&#8217;s outstanding shares, which were valued at $2.5 million. At December 31, 2015, EuroDekania had an estimated NAV of $15.0 million. 

Managed Accounts . We provide investment management services to a number of separately managed accounts. Part of our European CDO team has transitioned to providing investment management services primarily to European family offices, high net worth individuals, and asset managers. The investment focus is on CDO notes and debt instruments where the investment managers have relevant expertise. For these services, we are paid gross annual base management fees of approximately 1.5% plus a gross annual performance fee of 20% of cash-on-cash returns in excess of an 8% hurdle. There is also an early redemption fee if any of the clients 

&#160;

were to terminate their arrangement within the first five years of the relationship. AUM of these European managed accounts was $10.9 million at December 31, 2015. 

PriDe Fund . In July 2014, CCFL became the investment advisor of a newly created French investment fund with total commitments of &#8364;238 million (the &#8220;PriDe Fund&#8221;). The PriDe Fund earns investment returns by investing in a div ersified portfolio of debt securities issued by small and medium sized European insurance companies. The PriDe Fund has an initial investment period of two years and a maturity date of July 2026. CCFL earns management fees and performance fees if returns exceed certain thresholds. We have not made an investment, nor do we expect to make any investment, in the PriDe Fund. AUM of the PriDe Fund was $155.0 million at December 31, 2015. 

In addition, we receive revenue shares from certain asset management businesses that we initially sponsored or owned, and subsequently sold or spun-off. A description of our material asset management revenue shares as of December 31, 2015 is set forth below. 

Star Asia . On February 20, 2014, we completed the sale of all of our ownership interests in the Star Asia Group. As part of our consideration for the sale of the Star Asia Group, we receive contingent payments equal to 15% of certain revenues generated by Star Asia Manager, SAA Manager, SAP GP, Star Asia Capital Management, and certain affiliated entities for a period of at least four years. The Star Asia revenue share arrangement terminates the later of (i) January 2018 and (ii) the date certain incentive fees are paid. In 2015, we earned $2.2 million from the Star Asia revenue share. 

&#160; 

Alesco X-XVII . On July 29, 2010, we entered into an agreement with an unrelated third party whereby we sold the management rights and responsibilities related to the Alesco X through XVII securitizations. As part of the agreement, we will continue to receive certain incentive payments through February 2017 if the management fees earned by the third party exceed certain thresholds. The incentive payments are paid quarterly and 25% of the total amount due is subject to a hold-back that will be paid at the end of the term in February 2017. In 2015, we earned $0.8 million from the Alesco X-XVII revenue share, and ; as of December 31, 2015, the hold-back amount was $1.3 million. 

Infrastructure Finance Business . On March 12, 2012, we entered into an agreement with unrelated third parties whereby we agreed to assist in the establishment of an international infrastructure finance business (&#8220;Infrastructure Finance Business&#8221;). As consideration for our assistance in establishing the Infrastructure Finance Business, we receive 8.0% of certain revenues of the manager of the Infrastructure Finance Business. The Infrastructure Finance Business revenue share arrangement expires when we have earned a cumulative $20 million in revenue share payments or with the dissolution of the Infrastructure Finance Business&#8217; management company. Also, in any particular year, the revenue share earned by us cannot exceed $2.0 million. In 2015, we earned $0.4 million from the Infrastructure Finance Business revenue share. From inception through 2015, we earned $0.8 million and have received $0.5 million in cash. In addition, in March 2012, we issued 500,000 restricted units of the Company&#8217;s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the &#8220;Common Stock&#8221;) to the managing member of the Infrastructure Finance Business, which vest 1/3 when we receive $6.0 million of cumulative revenue share payments, 1/3 when we receive $12.0 million of cumulative revenue share payments, and 1/3 when we receive $18.0 million of cumulative revenue share payments. In certain circumstances, we retain the right to deliver fixed amounts of cash to the managing member of the Infrastructure Finance Business as opposed to vested shares of Common Stock. See note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed a total of 87 full time professionals and support staff. This number includes 58 employees of our JVB subsidiary, 7 employees of our European Capital Markets business segment, 1 employee of our U.S. Asset Management business segment, 6 employees of our European Asset Management business segment, 11 employees of our U.S. support services group, and 4 employees of our European support services group. We consider our employee relations to be good and believe that our compensation and employee benefits are competitive with t hose offered by other financial services firms. None of our employees is subject to any collective bargaining agreements. Our core asset is our professionals, their intellectual capital, and their dedication to providing the highest quality services to our clients. Prior to joining us, members of our management team held positions with other leading financial services firms, accounting firms, law firms, investment firms, or other public companies. Lester R. Brafman and Joseph W. Pooler, Jr. are our executive operating officers, and biographical information relating to each of these officers is incorporated by reference in &#8220;Part III &#8212; Item 10 &#8212; Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance&#8221; to the Company&#8217;s Proxy Statement, to be filed in connection with the Company&#8217;s 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 

&#160; 

Competition 

All areas of our business are intensely competitive and we expect them to remain so. We believe that the principal factors affecting competition in our business include economic environment, quality and price of our products and services, client relationships, reputation, market focus, and the ability of our professionals. 

Our competitors are other public and private asset managers, investment banks, brokerage firms, merchant banks, and financial advisory firms. We compete globally and on a regional, product or niche basis. Many of our competitors have substantially greater 

&#160;

capital and resources than we do and offer a broader range of financial products and services. Certain of these competitors continue to raise additional amounts of capital to pursue business strategies that may be similar to ours. Some of these competitors may also have access to liquidity sources that are not available to us, which may pose challenges for us with respect to investment opportunities. In addition, some of these competitors may have higher risk tolerances or make different risk assessments than we do, allowing them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish broader business relationships. 

In recent years, there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry, including among many of our former competitors. In particular, a number of large commercial banks have established or acquired broker-dealers or have merged with other financial institutions. Many of these firms have the ability to offer a wider range of products than we offer, including loans, deposit taking, and insurance. Many of these firms also have investment banking services, which may enhance their competitive position. They also have the ability to support investment banking and securities products with commercial banking and other financial services revenue in an effort to gain market share, which could result in pricing pressure in our business. This trend toward consolidation and convergence has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors. 

Competition is intense for the recruitment and retention of experienced and qualified professionals. The success of our business and our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend significantly upon our continued ability to retain and motivate our existing professionals and attract new professionals. See &#8220;Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors&#8221; beginning on page 17 . 

Regulation 

Certain of our subsidiaries, in the ordinary course of their business, are subject to extensive regulation by government and self-regulatory organizations both in the United States and abroad. As a matter of public policy, these regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets. The regulations promulgated by these regulatory bodies are designed primarily to protect the interests of the investing public generally and thus cannot be expected to protect or further the interests of our company or our stockholders and may have the effect of limiting or curtailing our activities, including activities that might be profitable. 

As of December, 31, 2015, our regulated subsidiaries include: JVB, a registered broker-dealer regulated by FINRA and subject to oversight by the SEC; CCFL (previously known as EuroDekania Management Limited), a U.K. company regulated by the FCA; and Cohen &#38; Company Financial Management, LLC, Dekania Capital Management, LLC, and Cira SCM, LLC, each of which is a registered investment advisor regulated by the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act. Since our inception, our businesses have been operated within a legal and regulatory framework that is constantly developing and changing, requiring us to be able to monitor and comply with a broad range of legal and regulatory developments that affect our activities. 

Certain of our businesses are also subject to compliance with laws and regulations of United States federal and state governments, foreign governments, their respective agencies and/or various self-regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to, among other things, the privacy of client information and any failure to comply with these regulations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage. Additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by financial authorities and self-regulatory organizations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, either in the United States or abroad, may directly affect our mode of operation and profitability. 

The United States and foreign government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the United States, are empowered to conduct periodic examinations and initiate administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, and/or the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer or its directors, officers, or employees. See &#8220;Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors&#8221; beginning on page 16. 

United States Regulation . As of December 31, 2015, JVB was registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC, was licensed to conduct business, and was a member of and regulated by FINRA. JVB is subject to the regulations of FINRA and industry standards of practice that cover many aspects of its business, including initial licensing requirements, sales and trading practices, relationships with customers (including the handling of cash and margin accounts), capital structure, capital requirements, record-keeping and reporting procedures, experience and training requirements for certain employees, and supervision of the conduct of affiliated persons, including directors, officers, and employees. FINRA has the power to expel, fine, and otherwise discipline member firms and their employees for violations of these rules and regulations. JVB is also registered as a broker-dealer in certain states, requiring us to comply with the laws, rules, and regulations of each state in which a broker-dealer subsidiary is registered. Each state may revoke the registration to conduct a securities business in that state and may fine or otherwise discipline broker-dealers and their employees for failure to comply with such state&#8217;s laws, rules, and regulations. 

The SEC, FINRA, and various other regulatory agencies within and outside of the United States have stringent rules and regulations with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by regulated entities. Generally, a broker-dealer&#8217;s net capital is net worth plus qualified subordinated debt less deductions for certain types of assets. The net capital rule under the Exchange Act requires that at least a minimum part of a broker-dealer&#8217;s assets be maintained in a relatively liquid form. The SEC and FINRA impose rules that require notification when net capital falls below certain predefined criteria. These rules also dictate the ratio of debt to equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer and constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business 

&#160;

under certain circumstances. If a firm fails to maintain the required net capital, it may be subject to suspension or revocation of registration by the applicable regulatory agency, and suspension or expulsion by these regulators could ultimately lead to the firm&#8217;s liquidation. Additionally, the net capital rule under the Exchange Act and certain FINRA rules impose requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to the SEC and FINRA for certain capital withdrawals. 

If these net capital rules are changed or expanded, or if there is an unusually large charge against our net capital, our operations that require the intensive use of capital would be limited. A large operating loss or charge against our net capital could adversely affect our ability to expand or even maintain current levels of business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 

Our investment advisor subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as investment advisers and are subject to the rules and regulations of the Investment Advisers Act. The Investment Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations, limitations on principal transactions between an adviser and its affiliates and advisory clients, and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Investment Advisers Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser&#8217;s registration. Investment advisers are also subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

We are also subject to the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the &#8220;Patriot Act&#8221;), which imposes obligations regarding the prevention and detection of money-laundering activities, including the establishment of customer due diligence, customer verification, and other compliance policies and procedures. These regulations require certain disclosures by, and restrict the activities of, research analysts and broker-dealers, among others. Failure to comply with these new requirements may result in monetary, regulatory and, in the case of the Patriot Act, criminal penalties. 

In July 2010, the federal government passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ( the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act &#8221;). The Dodd-Frank Act significantly restructures and intensifies regulation in the financial services industry, with provisions that include, among other things, the creation of a new systemic risk oversight body ( i.e. , the Financial Stability Oversight Council) , expansion of the authority of existing regulators, increased regulation of and restrictions on OTC derivatives markets and transactions, broadening of the reporting and regulation of executive compensation, expansion of the standards for market participants in dealing with clients and customers, and regulation of fiduciary duties owed by municipal advisors or conduit borrowers of municipal securities. In addition, Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (known as the &#8220;Volker Rule&#8221;) and section 716 of the Dodd-Frank Act (known as the &#8220;swaps push-out rule&#8221;) limit proprietary trading of certain securities and swaps by certain banking entities. Although we are not a banking entity and are not otherwise subject to these rules, some of our clients and many of our counterparties are banks or entities affiliated with banks and will be subject to these restrictions. These sections of the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations that are adopted to implement them could negatively affect the swaps and securities markets by reducing their depth and liquidity and thereby affect pricing in these markets. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act as a whole and the intensified regulatory environment &#160; will likely alter certain business practices and change the competitive landscape of the financial services industry, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We will continue to monitor all applicable developments in the implementation of Dodd-Frank and expect to adapt successfully to any new applicable legislative and regulatory requirements. 

Foreign Regulation . Our U.K. subsidiary, CCFL, is authorized and regulated by the FCA. CCFL has FCA permission to carry on the following activities: (1) advising on investments; (2) agreeing to carry on a regulated activity; (3) arranging (bringing about) deals in investments; (4) arranging safeguarding and administration of assets; (5) dealing in investments as agent; (6) dealing in investments as principal; (7) making arrangements with a view to transactions in investments; and (8) managing investments. An overview of key aspects of the U.K.&#8217;s regulatory regime, which apply to CCFL, is set out below. 

Ongoing regulatory obligations . As an FCA regulated entity, CCFL is subject to the FCA&#8217;s ongoing regulatory obligations, which cover the following wide-ranging aspects of its business: 

Threshold Conditions : The FCA&#8217;s Threshold Conditions Sourcebook sets out five conditions that all U.K. authorized firms, including CCFL, must satisfy in order to become and remain authorized by the FCA. These relate to having adequate legal status, an appropriate location for the firm&#8217;s registered or head office, fit and proper links, adequate financial and non-financial resources, and the suitability to be and to remain authorized. 

Principles for Businesses : CCFL is expected to comply with the FCA&#8217;s high-level principles, set out in the Principles for Businesses Sourcebook (the &#8220;Principles&#8221;). The Principles govern the way in which a regulated firm conducts business and include obligations to conduct business with integrity, due skill, care and diligence, to have appropriate regard for customers&#8217; interests, to ensure adequate and appropriate communication with clients, and to ensure appropriate dialogue with regulators (both in the U.K. and overseas). 

Systems and Controls : One of the FCA&#8217;s Principles requires a regulated firm to take reasonable care to organize and control its affairs responsibly effectively, with adequate risk management systems. Consequently, the FCA imposes overarching responsibilities 

&#160;

on the directors and senior management of a regulated firm. The FCA ultimately expects the senior management of a regulated firm to take responsibility for determining what processes and internal organization are appropriate to its business. Key requirements in this context include the need to have adequate systems and controls in relation to: (1) senior management arrangements and general organizational requirements; (2) compliance, internal audit, and financial crime prevention; (3) outsourcing; (4) record keeping; and (5) managing conflicts of interest. 

Conduct of business obligation. The FCA imposes conduct of business rules that set out the obligations to which regulated firms are subject in their dealings with clients and potential clients. CCFL has FCA permission to deal only with eligible counterparties and professional clients in relation to the regulated activities it conducts. The detailed level of the conduct of business rules with which CCFL must comply is dependent on the categorization of its clients, which should be considered in the context of the regulated activity being performed. These rules include requirements relating to the type and level of information that must be provided to clients before business is conducted with or for them, the regulation of financial promotions, procedures for entering into client agreements, obligations relating to the suitability and appropriateness of investments, and rules about managing investments and reporting to clients. 

&#160; 

Reporting. All authorized firms in the U.K. are required to report to the FCA on a periodic basis. CCFL&#8217;s reporting requirements are based on its scope of permissions. The FCA will use the information submitted by CCFL to monitor it on an ongoing basis. There are also high level reporting obligations under the Principles, whereby CCFL is required to deal with the FCA and other regulators in an open and co-operative way and to disclose to regulators appropriately anything relating to it of which the regulators would reasonably expect notice. 

FCA&#8217;s enforcement powers. The FCA has a wide range of disciplinary and enforcement tools that it can use should a regulated firm fail to comply with its regulatory obligations. The FCA is not only able to investigate and take enforcement action in respect of breaches of FCA rules, but also in respect of insider dealing and market abuse offenses and breaches of anti-money laundering legislation. Formal sanctions vary from public censure to financial penalties to cancellation of an authorized firm&#8217;s permissions or withdrawal of an approved person&#8217;s approval. 

Financial Resources . One of the FCA&#8217;s Principles requires a regulated firm to maintain adequate financial resources. Under the FCA rules, the required level of capital depends on CCFL&#8217;s prudential categorization, calculated in accordance with the relevant FCA rules. A firm&#8217;s prudential categorization is loosely based on the type of regulated activities that it conducts, as this in turn determines the level of risk to which a firm is considered exposed. CCFL is classified as a full scope BIPRU 730K Investment firm. In broad terms, this means that it would be subject to a base capital requirement of the higher of (1) &#8364;730,000; or (2) its credit risk plus its market risk plus its operational risk. There are also detailed ongoing regulatory capital requirements applicable to a regulated firm, including those relating to limits on large exposures, settlement and counterparty risk, client monies, and client relationships. 

Anti-money Laundering Requirements . A U.K. financial institution is subject to additional client acceptance requirements, which stem from anti-money laundering legislation that requires a firm to identify its clients before conducting business with or for them and to retain appropriate documentary evidence of this process. 

The key U.K. anti-money laundering rules and regulation are: (1) the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (as amended); (2) the Terrorism Act 2000 (as amended); (3) the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 (as amended); (4) the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001; and (5) the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008. For an FCA regulated firm such as CCFL, there are additional obligations contained in the FCA&#8217;s rules. Guidance is also set out in the U.K. Joint Money Laundering Steering Group Guidance Notes, which the FCA may consider when determining compliance by a regulated firm with U.K. money laundering requirements. 

As an FCA regulated entity, CCFL is required to ensure that it has adequate systems and controls to enable it to identify, assess, monitor, and manage financial crime risk. CCFL must also ensure that these systems and controls are comprehensive and proportionate to the nature, scale, and complexity of its activities. 

In addition to potential regulatory sanctions from the FCA, failure to comply with the U.K.&#8217;s anti-money laundering requirements is a criminal offense; depending on the exact nature of the offense, such a failure is punishable by an unlimited fine, imprisonment, or both. 

Approved Persons Regime . Individuals performing certain functions within a regulated entity (known as &#8220;controlled functions&#8221;) are required to be approved by the FCA. Once approved, the &#8220;approved person&#8221; becomes subject to the FCA&#8217;s Statements of Principle for Approved Persons, which include the obligation to act with integrity, and with due skill, care, and diligence. The FCA can take action against an approved person if it appears to it that such person is guilty of misconduct and the FCA is satisfied that it is appropriate in all the circumstances to take action against such person. 

Consequently, CCFL is required to have approved persons performing certain key functions, known as &#8220;required functions.&#8221; In addition, CCFL must have its senior management personnel approved to perform the appropriate &#8220;governing functions.&#8221; CCFL is required to ensure that it assesses and monitors the ongoing competence of its approved persons and their fitness and propriety. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Changes in Existing Laws and Rules . Additional legislation and regulations, changes in rules promulgated by the government regulatory bodies, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of laws and regulations may directly affect the manner of our operation, our net capital requirements, or our profitability. In addition, any expansion of our activities into new areas may subject us to additional regulatory requirements that could adversely affect our business, reputation, and results of operations.
