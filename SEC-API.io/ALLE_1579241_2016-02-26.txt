Allegion Principal Products 

Door closers and controls 

Door and door frames (steel) 

Electronic security products 

Electronic and biometric access control systems 

Exit devices 

Locks, locksets and key systems 

Time, attendance and workforce productivity systems 

Other accessories 

Access control security products and solutions are critical elements in every building. Most door openings are custom-configured to maximize a room&#8217;s particular form and function while also meeting local and national building and safety code requirements and end-user security needs. Most buildings have multiple door openings, each serving its own purpose and requiring different specific access-control solutions. Each door must fit exactly within its frame, be prepared precisely for its hinges, synchronize with its specific lockset and corresponding latch and align with a specific key to secure the door. Moreover, security products are increasingly linked electronically, creating additional functionality and complexity. 

We believe our ability to deliver a wide range of solutions that can be custom-configured to meet end-users&#8217; security needs is a key driver of our success. We accomplish this with: 

&#8226; 

Our extensive and versatile product portfolio, combined with our deep expertise, which enables us to deliver the right products and solutions to meet diverse security and functional specifications; 

&#8226; 

Our consultative approach and expertise, which enables us to develop the most efficient and appropriate building security and access-control specifications to fulfill the unique needs of our end-users and their partners, including architects, contractors, home-builders and engineers; and 

&#8226; 

Our enterprise excellence capabilities, including our global manufacturing operations and agile supply chain, which facilitate our ability to deliver specific product and system configurations to end-users worldwide, quickly and efficiently. 

Based on third party sources, we estimate that the size of the global markets we serve was approximately $30 billion in revenue in 2015 with compound annual growth of about 2 to 4% per year over the past three years. We believe that the security products industry will benefit from several global macroeconomic and long-term demographic trends, including: 

&#8226; 

stabilization of construction markets in key North American markets; 

&#8226; 

the convergence of mechanical and electronic security products; 

&#8226; 

heightened awareness of security requirements; 

&#8226; 

increased global urbanization; and 

&#8226; 

the shift to a digital, interconnected environment. 

We believe slowly improving institutional and cautious growth in commercial industrial markets and continued recovery in residential markets in the United States and slight growth in Europe will offset unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates overseas. Additionally, we expect growth in the global electronic product categories we serve to outperform the security products industry as end-users adopt newer technologies in their facilities. Two of our acquisitions in 2015 (SimonsVoss Technologies GmbH and Milre Systek Co., Ltd.) were made to capitalize on this trend. 

We operate in three geographic regions: Americas; Europe, Middle East, India and Africa ("EMEIA"); and Asia Pacific. We sell our products and solutions under the following brands:

History and Developments 

Allegion plc was incorporated in Ireland on May 9, 2013, to hold the commercial and residential security businesses of Ingersoll Rand plc ("Ingersoll Rand"). On December 1, 2013, Allegion became a stand-alone public company after Ingersoll Rand completed the separation of these businesses from the rest of Ingersoll Rand via the transfer of these businesses from Ingersoll Rand to Allegion and the issuance by Allegion of ordinary shares directly to Ingersoll Rand&#8217;s shareholders (the "Spin-off"). Our security businesses have long and distinguished operating histories. Several of our brands were established more than 75 years ago and many of our brands originally created their categories: 

&#8226; 

Von Duprin, established in 1908, was awarded the first exit device patent; 

&#8226; 

Schlage, established in 1920, was awarded the first patents granted for the cylindrical lock and the push button lock; 

&#8226; 

LCN, established in 1926, created the first door closure; 

&#8226; 

CISA, established in 1926, devised the first electronically controlled lock; and 

&#8226; 

Steelcraft Doors, established in 1927, developed the first mass-produced hollow metal door in 1942. 

We have built upon these founding legacies since our entry into the security products market through the acquisition of Schlage, Von Duprin and LCN in 1974. Today, we continue to develop and introduce innovative and market-leading products. Recent examples of successful product launches are illustrated in the table below:

Industry and Competition 

Based on third party sources, we estimate that the size of the global markets we serve was approximately $30 billion in revenue in 2015 with compound annual growth of about 2 to 4% per year over the past three years. This growth rate primarily reflects cyclical challenges in the commercial, institutional and residential construction markets throughout North America and Europe as certain developing economies experienced higher growth rates during this period. Additionally, growth in electronic security products and solutions continues to outperform the industry as a whole as end-users adopt newer technologies in their facilities. 

&#32;6 

We expect the security products industry will benefit from favorable long-term demographic trends such as continued urbanization of the global population, increased concerns about safety and security and technology-driven innovation. 

The security products markets are highly competitive and fragmented throughout the world, with a number of large multi-national companies and thousands of smaller regional and local companies. This high fragmentation primarily reflects local regulatory requirements and highly variable end-user needs. We believe our principal global competitors are Assa Abloy AB, dorma+kaba Group, and Stanley Black &#38; Decker Inc. We also face competition in various markets and product categories throughout the world, including from Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. in the North American residential market. As we move into more technologically-advanced product categories, we may also compete against smaller, more specialized competitors. 

Our success depends on a variety of factors, including brand and reputation, product breadth, quality and delivery capabilities, price and service capabilities. As many of our businesses sell through wholesale distribution, our success also depends on building and partnering with a strong channel network. Although price often serves as an important customer decision criterion, we also compete based on the breadth and quality of our products and solutions, our ability to custom-configure solutions to meet individual end-user requirements and our global supply chain. 

Our Reporting Segments 

We manufacture and sell mechanical and electronic security products and solutions in approximately 130 countries. Approximately 95% of our 2015 revenues were to customers in the North America, Western Europe and the Asia-Pacific regions.

Customers 

We sell most of our products and solutions through distribution and retail channels, ranging from specialty distribution to wholesalers. We have built a network of channel partners that help our customers choose the right solution to meet their security needs and help commercial and institutional end-users fulfill and install orders. We also sell through a variety of retail channels, ranging from large do-it-yourself home improvement centers to small, specialty showroom outlets. We work with our retail partners on developing marketing and merchandising strategies to maximize their sales per square foot of shelf space. Through our Interflex business, we provide products and solutions directly to end-users. 

Our 10 largest customers represented approximately 24% of our total revenues in 2015 . No single customer represented 10% or more of our total revenues in 2015 . 

Sales and Marketing 

In markets where we sell through commercial and institutional distribution channels, we employ sales professionals around the world who work with a combination of end-users, security professionals, architects, contractors, engineers and distribution partners to develop specific custom-configured solutions for our end-users&#8217; needs. Our field sales professionals are assisted by specification writers who work with architects, engineers and consultants to help design door openings and security systems to meet end-users&#8217; functional, aesthetic and regulatory requirements. Both groups are supported by dedicated customer care and technical sales-support specialists worldwide. We also support our sales efforts with a variety of marketing efforts, including trade-specific advertising, cooperative distributor merchandising, digital marketing, and marketing at a variety of industry trade shows. 

In markets in which we sell through retail and home-builder distribution channels, we have teams of sales, merchandising and marketing professionals who help drive brand and product awareness through our channel partners and to consumers. We utilize a variety of advertising and marketing strategies, including traditional consumer media, retail merchandising, digital marketing, retail promotions, and builder and consumer trade shows, to support these teams. 

We also work actively with several regulatory bodies around the world to help promote effective and consistent safety and security standards. For example, we are members of Builders Hardware Manufacturers Association, Security Industry Association, Smart Card Alliance, American Society of Healthcare Engineering, American Institute of Architects, Construction Specification Institute, ASSOFERMA (Italy), BHE (Germany) and UNIQ (France). We also have established the Safety and Security Institute in China, which helps to educate government officials, architects and builders and advocates for consistent building codes and standards that address end-users&#8217; safety and security. 

Production and Distribution 

We manufacture our products in our geographic markets around the world. We operate 27 &#32;production facilities, including twelve in the Americas region, ten in EMEIA and five in Asia Pacific. We own 13 of these facilities and lease the others. Our strategy is to produce in the region of use, wherever appropriate, to allow us to be closer to the end-user and increase efficiency and timely product delivery. 

In managing our network of production facilities, we focus on eliminating excess capacity, reducing cycle time through productivity, and harmonizing production practices and safety procedures. 

We distribute our products through a broad network of channel partners. In addition, third-party logistics providers perform storage and distribution services for us to support certain parts of our distribution network. &#32; 

&#32;8 

Raw Materials 

We support our region-of-use production strategy with corresponding region-of-use supplier partners, where available. Our global and regional commodity teams work with production leadership, product management and materials management teams to ensure adequate materials are available for production. 

We purchase a wide range of raw materials, including steel, zinc, brass and other non-ferrous metals, to support our production facilities. Where appropriate, we may enter into fixed-cost contracts to lower overall costs. We do not believe the loss of any particular supplier would be material to our business. 

Intellectual Property 

Intellectual property, inclusive of certain patents, trademarks, copyrights, know-how, trade secrets and other proprietary rights, is important to our business. We create, protect and enforce our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to try to ensure the protection and enforcement of our intellectual property rights. We use trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that such distinctive marks are an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying us and in distinguishing our products from others. We consider our Schlage, Von Duprin, CISA and other associated trademarks to be among our most valuable assets, and we have registered these trademarks in a number of countries. Although certain proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success, we do not believe we are materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. 

Facilities 

We operate through a broad network of sales offices, 27 &#32;production facilities and several distribution centers throughout the world. Our active properties represent approximately 5.5 million &#32;square feet, of which approximately 45% &#32;is leased.

Research and Development 

We are committed to investing in highly productive research and development capabilities, particularly in electro-mechanical systems. Our research and development ("R&#38;D") expenditures were approximately $ 45.2 million , $ 43.3 million &#32;and $ 39.6 million &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

We concentrate on developing technology innovations that will deliver growth through the introduction of new products and solutions, and also on driving continuous improvements in product cost, quality, safety and sustainability. 

We manage our R&#38;D team as a global group with an emphasis on a global collaborative approach to identify and develop new technologies and worldwide product platforms. We are organized on a regional basis to leverage expertise in local standards and configurations. In addition to regional engineering centers in each geographic region, we also operate a global engineering center of excellence in Bangalore, India. 

&#32;9 

Seasonality 

Our business experiences seasonality that varies by product line. Because more construction and do-it-yourself projects occur during the second and third calendar quarters of each year in the Northern Hemisphere, our security product sales, typically, are higher in those quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters. However, our Interflex business typically experiences higher sales in the fourth calendar quarter due to project timing. Revenue by quarter for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;are as follows:

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had more than 9,400 employees, approximately 26% of whom have the terms of their employment covered under collective bargaining agreements. This includes non-management European employees who are represented by national and local works councils. 

Environmental Regulation 

We have a dedicated environmental program that is designed to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process as well as to remediate identified environmental concerns. As to the latter, we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities. 

We are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") and similar state authorities. We have also been identified as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") for cleanup costs associated with off-site waste disposal at federal Superfund and state remediation sites. For all such sites, there are other PRPs and, in most instances, our involvement is minimal. 

In estimating our liability, we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other PRPs who may be jointly and severally liable. The ability of other PRPs to participate has been taken into account, based on our understanding of the parties&#8217; financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis. Additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future. 

We incurred $ 4.4 million , $ 2.9 million , and $2.1 million &#32;of expenses during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively, for environmental remediation at sites presently or formerly owned or leased by us. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , we have recorded reserves for environmental matters of $ 15.2 million &#32;and $ 8.8 million . Of these amounts $ 2.8 million &#32;and $ 2.4 million , respectively, relate to remediation of sites previously disposed by us. Given the evolving nature of environmental laws, regulations and technology, the ultimate cost of future compliance is uncertain.
