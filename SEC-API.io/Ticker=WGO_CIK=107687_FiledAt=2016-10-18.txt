Motorhomes, parts and service . &#32; A motorhome is a self-propelled mobile dwelling used primarily as temporary living quarters during vacation and camping trips, or to support some other active lifestyle. The RVIA classifies motorhomes into three types, all of which we manufacture and sell under the Winnebago brand name, which are defined as follows: Type 

Description 

Winnebago products offerings 

Class A 

Conventional motorhomes constructed directly on medium- and heavy-duty truck chassis, which include the engine and drivetrain components. The living area and driver's compartment are designed and produced by the motorhome manufacturer. 

Gas: Adventurer, Sightseer, Suncruiser, Sunova, Sunstar, Sunstar LX, Vista, Vista LX 

Diesel: Forza, Grand Tour, Journey, Tour, Via 

Class B 

(gas and diesel) 

Panel-type vans to which sleeping, kitchen, and/or toilet facilities are added. These models may also have a top extension to provide more headroom. 

Winnebago Touring Coach (Era, Paseo, Travato) 

Class C 

(gas and diesel) 

Motorhomes built on van-type chassis onto which the motorhome manufacturer constructs a living area with access to the driver's compartment. 

Aspect, Cambria, Fuse, Minnie Winnie, Navion, Spirit, Trend, View 

Motorhomes generally provide living accommodations for up to seven people and include kitchen, dining, sleeping and bath areas, and in some models, a lounge. Optional equipment accessories include, among other items, &#32; generators, home theater systems, king-size beds, and UltraLeather TM &#32;upholstery and a wide selection of interior equipment. With the purchase of any new motorhome, we offer a comprehensive 12-month/15,000-mile warranty on the coach and, for Class A and C motorhomes, a 3-year/36,000-mile structural warranty on sidewalls and floors. 

Our Class A, B and C motorhomes are sold by dealers in the retail market with manufacturer's suggested retail prices ranging from approximately $70,000 to $470,000, depending on size and model, plus optional equipment and delivery charges. Our motorhomes range in length from 21 to 44 feet. 

Unit sales of our motorhomes for the last five fiscal years were as follows: &#160;

Motorhome parts and service activities represent revenues generated by service work we perform for retail customers at our Forest City, Iowa and Junction City, Oregon facilities as well as revenues from sales of RV parts. As of August 27, 2016 , our parts inventory was approximately $3.5 million and is located in a 450,000-square foot warehouse with what we believe to be among the most sophisticated distribution and tracking systems in the industry. Our competitive strategy is to provide proprietary manufactured parts through our dealer network, which we believe increases customer satisfaction and the value of our motorhomes. 

&#32;2 

&#32;&#32; 

Towables. A towable is a non-motorized vehicle that is designed to be towed by passenger automobiles, pickup trucks, SUVs or vans and is used as temporary living quarters for recreational travel. The RVIA classifies towables in four types: conventional travel trailers, fifth wheels, folding camper trailers and truck campers; we manufacture and sell conventional travel trailers and fifth wheels under the Winnebago brand name, which are defined as follows: Type 

Description 

Winnebago product offerings 

Travel trailer 

Conventional travel trailers are towed by means of a hitch attached to the frame of the vehicle. 

Winnie Drop, Micro Minnie, Minnie, Ultralite, Instinct, Spyder (Toy Hauler) 

Fifth wheel 

Fifth wheel trailers are constructed with a raised forward section that is connected to the vehicle with a special fifth wheel hitch.

On October 2, 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we intend to acquire Grand Design, a fast-growing towables manufacturer in Middlebury, Indiana. Grand Design manufactures travel trailers and fifth wheel products. 

With this acquisition, we expect to have a broader and more balanced portfolio of motorized and towable products and intend to capitalize on the opportunities across the RV market and to drive improved profitability and long-term value for shareholders. 

Other Manufactured Products . As a result of our motorhome manufacturing capabilities, equipment and facilities, we use our incremental capacity to manufacture product for outside customers. To a limited extent, we manufacture other component parts sold to outside manufacturers. We also manufacture commercial vehicles which are motorhome shells, primarily custom designed for the buyer's special needs and requirements, such as law enforcement command centers, mobile medical clinics and mobile office space. These commercial vehicles are sold through our dealer network. In addition, we also provide commercial vehicles as bare shells to third-party upfitters for conversion at their facilities. 

Production 

We generally produce motorhomes and towables to order from dealers. We have some ability to increase our capacity by scheduling overtime and/or hiring additional production employees or to decrease our capacity through the use of shortened workweeks and/or reducing head count. We have long been known as an industry leader in innovation as each year we introduce new or redesigned products. These changes generally include new floor plans and sizes as well as design and decor modifications. 

Our motorhomes are primarily produced in the state of Iowa at four different campuses. Our Forest City facilities are vertically integrated and provide mechanized assembly line manufacturing for Class A and C motorhomes. We assemble Class B motorhomes in our Lake Mills facilities. Hardwood cabinet, countertop and compartment door products are manufactured at our Charles City campus. Our Waverly facility is used for wire harness fabrication. Beginning in 2016, we also began assembling motorhomes in our Junction City, Oregon facility. Our motorhome bodies are made from various materials and structural components which are typically laminated into rigid, lightweight panels. Body designs are developed with computer aided design and manufacturing and subjected to a variety of tests and evaluations to meet our standards and requirements. We manufacture a number of components utilized in our motorhomes, with the principal exceptions being chassis, engines, generators and appliances that we purchase from reputable manufacturers. 

Most of our raw materials such as steel, aluminum, fiberglass and wood products are obtainable from numerous sources. Certain parts, especially motorhome chassis, are available from a small group of suppliers. We are currently purchasing Class A and C chassis from Ford Motor Company, Mercedes-Benz USA (a Daimler company) and Mercedes-Benz Canada (a Daimler company) and Class A chassis from Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation (a Daimler company). Class B chassis are purchased from Mercedes-Benz USA, Mercedes-Benz Canada, FCA US, LLC and FCA Canada, Inc.. Class C chassis are also purchased from FCA US, LLC and FCA Canada, Inc. In Fiscal 2016 , only two vendors, Ford Motor Company and Mercedes-Benz (USA and Canada) individually accounted for more than 10% of our raw material purchases and approximating 35% in the aggregate. 

Our towables are produced at an assembly plant located in Middlebury, Indiana. The majority of components are comprised of frames, appliances and furniture and are purchased from suppliers. 

&#32;3 

&#32;&#32; 

Backlog 

We strive to balance timely order fulfillment to customers with the lead times suppliers require to efficiently source materials and manage costs. Production facility constraints at peak periods also lead to fluctuations in backlogged orders which we manage closely. The approximate revenue of our motorhome backlog was $107.6 million &#32;and $156.4 million &#32;as of August 27, 2016 &#32;and August 29, 2015 , respectively. The approximate revenue of our towable backlog was $8.4 million &#32;and $6.2 million &#32;as of August 27, 2016 &#32;and August 29, 2015 , respectively. A more detailed description of our motorhome and towable order backlog is included in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 

Distribution and Financing 

We market our RVs on a wholesale basis to a diversified independent dealer network located throughout the US and, to a limited extent, in Canada. Foreign sales, including Canada, were 8% or less of net revenues during each of the past three fiscal years. See Note 12 &#32;to our Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

As of August 27, 2016 , our RV dealer network in the US and Canada included 295 motorized and 161 towable physical dealer locations, 74 of these locations carried both Winnebago motorized and towable product. One of our dealer organizations, FreedomRoads, LLC, accounted for 16.6% &#32;of our net revenue for Fiscal 2016 , as this dealer sold our products in 78 &#32;of their dealership locations across 28 &#32;US states. A second dealer organization, La Mesa RV Center, Inc., accounted for 13.0% &#32;of our net revenue for Fiscal 2016 , as this dealer sold our products in 11 &#32;dealership locations across 4 &#32;US states. 

We have sales and service agreements with dealers which are subject to annual review. Many of the dealers are also engaged in other areas of business, including the sale of automobiles, trailers or boats, and many dealers carry one or more competitive lines of RVs. We continue to place high emphasis on the capability of our dealers to provide complete service for our RVs. Dealers are obligated to provide full service for owners of our RVs or, in lieu thereof, to secure such service from other authorized providers. 

We advertise and promote our products through national RV magazines, the distribution of product brochures, the Go RVing national advertising campaign sponsored by RVIA, direct-mail advertising campaigns, various national promotional opportunities and on a local basis through trade shows, television, radio and newspapers, primarily in connection with area dealers. 

RV sales to dealers are made on cash terms. Most dealers are financed on a "floorplan" basis under which a bank or finance company lends the dealer all, or substantially all, of the purchase price, collateralized by a security interest in the merchandise purchased. As is customary in the RV industry, we typically enter into a repurchase agreement with a lending institution financing a dealer's purchase of our product upon the lending institution's request and after completion of a credit check of the dealer involved. Our repurchase agreements provide that for up to 18 months after a unit is financed, in the event of default by the dealer on the agreement to pay the lending institution and repossession of the unit(s) by the lending institution, we will repurchase the financed merchandise from the lender at dealer invoice. Our maximum exposure for repurchases varies significantly from time to time, depending upon general economic conditions, seasonal shipments, competition, demand for RVs, dealer organization, gasoline availability and access to and the cost of financing. See Note 9 . 

Competition 

The RV market is highly competitive with many other manufacturers selling products which compete directly with our products. Some of our competitors are much larger than us, most notably in the towable RV market, which may provide these competitors additional purchasing power. The competition in the RV industry is based upon design, price, quality and service of the products. We believe our principal competitive advantages are our brand strength, product quality and our service after the sale. We also believe that our motorhome products have historically commanded a price premium as a result of these competitive advantages. 

Seasonality 

The primary use of RVs for leisure travel and outdoor recreation has historically led to a peak retail selling season concentrated in the spring and summer months and lower sales during winter months. Our sales of RVs are generally influenced by this pattern in retail sales, but sales can also be affected by the level of dealer inventory. As a result, RV sales are historically lowest during our second fiscal quarter, which ends in February. 

Regulations and Trademarks 

We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations, including the MVA, under which the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration may require manufacturers to recall RVs that contain safety-related defects, and numerous state consumer protection laws and regulations relating to the operation of motor vehicles, including so-called "Lemon Laws." We are also subject to regulations established by OSHA. Our facilities are periodically inspected by federal and state agencies, such as OSHA. We are a member of RVIA, a voluntary association of RV manufacturers which promulgates RV safety standards. We place an RVIA seal on each of our RVs to certify that the RVIA standards have been met. We believe that our products and facilities comply in all material respects with the applicable vehicle safety, consumer protection, RVIA and OSHA regulations and standards. 

&#32;4 

&#32;&#32; 

Our operations are subject to a variety of federal and state environmental laws and regulations relating to the use, generation, storage, treatment, emission, labeling, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and noise pollution. We believe that we currently are in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations in all material aspects. 

We have several domestic and foreign trademark registrations associated with our motorhome and towable products which include: Winnebago, Aspect, Brave, Cambria, Chalet, Destination, Ellipse, Era, Forza, Fuse, Glide &#38; Dine, Inlounge, Instinct, Intable, Itasca, Journey, Meridian, Micro Minnie, Minnie, Minnie Winnie, Sightseer, Solei, Spirit, Spyder, Suncruiser, Sunova, Sunstar, Travato, Trend, Tribute, View, Vista, Viva!, Voyage, W, Flying W (logo), WIT Club, Winnebago Ind (logo), Winnebago Towables (logo) and Winnebago Touring Coach. We believe that our trademarks and trade names are significant to our business and we have in the past and will in the future vigorously protect them against infringement by third parties. We are not dependent upon any patents or technology licenses of others for the conduct of our business. 

Research and Development 

Research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred. During Fiscal 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , we spent approximately $4.0 million , $3.9 million &#32;and $4.3 million, respectively on research and development activities. 

Human Resources 

At the end of Fiscal 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , we employed approximately 3,050, 2,900 and 2,850 persons, respectively. None of our employees are covered under a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our relations with our employees are good.
