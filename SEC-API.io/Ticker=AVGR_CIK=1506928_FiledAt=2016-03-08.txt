Overview 

&#160; 

We are a commercial-stage medical device company that designs, manufactures and sells image-guided, catheter-based systems that are used by physicians to treat patients with peripheral artery disease, or PAD. Patients with PAD have a build-up of plaque in the arteries that supply blood to areas away from the heart, particularly the pelvis and legs. Our mission is to dramatically improve the treatment of vascular disease through the introduction of products based on our Lumivascular platform, the only intravascular image-guided system available in this market. We manufacture and sell a suite of products in the United States and select European markets. Our current products include our Lightbox imaging console, as well as our Wildcat, Kittycat, and the Ocelot family of catheters, which are designed to allow physicians to penetrate a total blockage in an artery, known as a chronic total occlusion, or CTO, and Pantheris, our image-guided atherectomy device, designed to allow physicians to precisely remove arterial plaque in PAD patients. In October 2015, we received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for commercialization of Pantheris, and in March 2016 received FDA approval for an enhanced version of Pantheris, and promptly thereafter we commenced sales of Pantheris in the U.S. and in select European countries. We believe that Pantheris will significantly enhance our market opportunity within PAD and can expand the overall addressable market for PAD endovascular procedures.

&#160; 

According to an article published in The Lancet, the global prevalence of PAD was estimated at 202 million people in 2010. The prevalence of PAD in the United States alone was estimated at 18 million people in 2010 and is projected to grow to 21 million people by 2020 according to the Sage Group. Despite its prevalence, PAD is underdiagnosed and undertreated relative to many other serious vascular conditions, including coronary artery disease, or CAD, in part because many PAD patients are asymptomatic or dismiss their symptoms as normal signs of aging. Despite the relative undertreatment of PAD, Millennium Research Group estimates that over 570,000 catheter-based PAD procedures in the pelvis and legs were performed in the United States in 2013, which corresponded to a $1.0 billion market. Millennium Research Group also estimates that the number of catheter-based PAD procedures will grow to almost 700,000 in 2017, representing a $1.3 billion market in the United States. Higher diagnosis and intervention rates resulting from greater physician and patient awareness of PAD, as well as higher prevalence, may significantly expand the market opportunity for PAD treatments, according to the Millennium Research Group. 

&#160; 

Current treatments for PAD, including bypass surgery, can be costly and may result in complications, high levels of post-surgery pain and lengthy hospital stays and recovery times. Minimally invasive, or endovascular, treatments include stents, angioplasty, and atherectomy devices, which are catheter-based products for the removal of plaque. These treatments also have limitations in their safety or efficacy profiles and frequently result in recurrence of the disease, also known as restenosis. We believe one of the main contributing factors to high restenosis rates for PAD patients treated with endovascular technologies is the amount of vascular injury that occurs during an intervention. Specifically, these treatments often disrupt the membrane between the outermost layers of the artery, which is referred to as the external elastic lamina, or EEL. 

&#160; 

Our Lumivascular platform is the only technology that offers real-time visualization of the inside of the artery during PAD treatment. We believe this approach will significantly improve patient outcomes by providing physicians with a clearer picture of the artery using radiation-free image guidance during treatment, enabling them to better differentiate between plaque and healthy arterial structures. Our Lumivascular platform is designed to improve patient safety by enabling physicians to direct treatment towards the plaque, while avoiding healthy portions of the artery. 

&#160; 

In March 2015, we completed enrollment of 134 patients in VISION, a clinical trial designed to support our August 2015 510(k) filing with the FDA for our Pantheris atherectomy device. VISION was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Pantheris to perform atherectomy using intravascular imaging and successfully achieved all primary and secondary safety and effectiveness endpoints. We believe the data from VISION will also allow us to demonstrate that avoiding damage to healthy arterial structures, and in particular disruption of the EEL, reduces the likelihood of restenosis, or re-narrowing, of the diseased artery. We have recently commenced commercialization of Pantheris as part of our Lumivascular platform in the United States and in select European countries after obtaining the required marketing authorizations.

&#160; 

We have assembled a team with extensive medical device development and commercialization capabilities, including our founder, John B. Simpson, Ph.D., M.D., who founded Advanced Cardiovascular Systems, FoxHollow Technologies and Perclose, among other vascular medical device companies. We began commercializing our initial non-Lumivascular platform products in 2009 and introduced our Lumivascular platform products in the United States in late 2012. We generated revenues of $10.7 million in 2015, $11.2 million in 2014 and $13.0 million in 2013.

&#160; 

Overview of Peripheral Arterial Disease 

&#160; 

Atherosclerosis is a progressive, degenerative condition in which plaque, consisting of lipids, cholesterol, calcium and other substances found in the blood stream, accumulates on the arterial wall. The accumulation of plaque can result in the narrowing of an artery, which may lead to serious health problems. Plaque can occur in many areas of the body and may vary in composition, density and size. These blockages sometimes contain hard areas, characterized as calcified plaque, as well as softer deposits consisting of fibrous or fatty tissue. As plaque continues to accumulate, it can completely block the artery, making it particularly difficult for physicians to treat. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Comparison of a normal artery to an atherosclerotic artery 

&#160; 

&#160; 

PAD is atherosclerosis in the arteries that supply blood to areas other than the heart, particularly the pelvis and legs, and may lead to serious symptoms such as pain, fatigue or numbness. Genetic predisposition, diabetes, smoking, hypertension, physical inactivity, high cholesterol, obesity and aging all increase the risk of developing PAD. In extreme cases, PAD can lead to critical limb ischemia, or CLI, which, if left untreated, can result in ulceration, infection, or gangrene in the feet and legs and eventually limb amputation or death. The Transatlantic Intersociety Consensus for the Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease, or TASC II, estimates that 55% of CLI patients will undergo amputation or die within one year after the diagnosis. 

&#160; 

Current Treatments for PAD and Their Limitations 

&#160; 

Physicians have several options available to treat PAD. For mild cases, lifestyle changes or drug therapy may slow or stabilize progression of the disease and alleviate symptoms. For more advanced cases of PAD, a physician may employ minimally-invasive endovascular procedures, or surgical interventions such as bypass or amputation. 

&#160; 

Medical Management 

&#160; 

The large majority of cases of diagnosed PAD in the United States are medically managed, according to the Society of Interventional Radiology. For this population, lifestyle changes, including improved diet, regular exercise and smoking cessation, as well as drug treatment are often prescribed. Although these measures can be effective, many people are unable to sustain them. In addition, these measures may reduce the symptoms, but do not treat the underlying causes of the disease. Physicians may also prescribe medications that lower cholesterol and reduce blood pressure. These drug therapies are generally prescribed for the life of the patient and do not treat the obstruction, making them an ineffective treatment for many patients. As a result, many of these patients will ultimately require more aggressive treatments. 

&#160; 

Surgery 

&#160; 

Bypass Surgery. &#160; More severe cases of PAD may be treated by surgeons with bypass surgery. This procedure entails using a synthetic graft or harvesting a healthy vessel from another area of the body and grafting it around a blocked portion of an artery. This procedure diverts blood flow around the occluded area to ensure that the tissue supplied by these arteries receives sufficient blood flow. Given its invasive nature, bypass surgery is performed by physicians in an operating room with the patient under general anesthesia. Bypass surgery involves multi-day hospital stays for healing and rehabilitation. General anesthesia and the potential for surgical infections make this approach less suitable for patients with conditions such as high blood pressure, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or poor kidney function. We estimate there were over 150,000 lower extremity bypass surgeries performed in the United States in 2013.

&#160; 

Amputation. &#160; CLI is a serious form of PAD caused by severe lack of blood flow to the legs and often results in pain at rest and tissue breakdown. Physicians may recommend full or partial amputation of the leg or foot for patients with CLI. TASC II estimates that 30% of patients with CLI will require an amputation within one year of diagnosis, and 15% of patients who undergo amputation of one leg will undergo amputation of the other leg within two years of the first amputation. According to TASC II, the mortality rate for patients with CLI is 25% at one year from the development of the condition. The Sage Group estimates that approximately 200,000 amputations occur annually as a result of CLI.

&#160; 

Endovascular Interventions 

&#160; 

In recent years, technologies and techniques have improved such that many forms of PAD can now be treated by physicians with endovascular approaches. We believe PAD endovascular interventions will continue to increase due to improved safety and effectiveness of endovascular procedures relative to surgical alternatives, together with greater physician and patient awareness of the disease. The most common endovascular treatments include balloon angioplasty, stenting and atherectomy. These procedures involve a physician feeding a catheter over a guidewire through a small incision, typically while using fluoroscopy, or x-ray, as a visual guide. In the event that the patient has a CTO, the physician may require a specialized guidewire, support catheter or other device to cross the CTO prior to treatment consisting of balloon angioplasty, stenting, atherectomy or some combination thereof. 

&#160; 

Fluoroscopy is the primary imaging tool currently used during endovascular treatments but delivers limited information to physicians. This technology provides an external view of the artery and does not allow physicians to differentiate between plaque and healthy arterial structures. Additionally, fluoroscopy exposes physicians, hospital staff and patients to radiation, which can lead to cataracts, cancer and abnormal blood cell counts. In addition, physicians frequently perform angiography in combination with fluoroscopy to assess the location and severity of the blockage. Angiography requires the use of contrast dye, which can increase the risk of kidney damage and may lead to acute kidney failure. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Importance of the External Elastic Lamina. &#160; Scientific research has identified the importance of minimizing vascular injury during an endovascular intervention, and specifically the disruption of the membrane between the outer most layers of the artery, which is referred to as the external elastic lamina, or EEL. A study by the Sanford Burnham Institute concluded that disruption of the area around the EEL creates an inflammatory response significantly greater than when the EEL is not injured, ultimately leading to accelerated narrowing of the artery. This narrowing of the artery is known as restenosis, which can lead to the restriction of blood flow. EEL disruption can be caused by wire-based CTO crossing, dissection from balloon angioplasty, stent placement, or an atherectomy device cutting through this area.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

A study from New York&#146;s Mount Sinai Medical Center, published in the Journal of Endovascular Therapy in 2015, demonstrated the correlation between restenosis rates and vascular injury during directional atherectomy procedures. Specifically, the study examined the composition of the tissue removed during treatment of 116 patients and assessed restenosis rates after one year. The study found that in 53% of the patients, the extracted tissue contained evidence of vascular injury. In this group of patients the restenosis rate, one-year after treatment, was 97%, while in the group of patients without evidence of vascular injury, the restenosis rate was only 11%. 

&#160; 

The data from the Mount Sinai Medical Center study are summarized in the following chart: 

&#160; 

Atherectomy Procedures &#151; Restenosis Rates at 1-Year 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We believe balloon angioplasty, stenting and current atherectomy procedures often result in vascular injury, limiting their safety and efficacy, and increase restenosis rates associated with these treatments. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Balloon Angioplasty. &#160; In an angioplasty procedure, a miniature balloon attached to the tip of the treatment catheter opens the blood vessel by expanding the vessel and compressing plaque against the arterial wall. While angioplasty catheters are relatively easy to use, they stretch the arterial wall, often leading to dissections of, and damage to, the EEL. Furthermore, angioplasty does not actually remove the plaque, which remains in the artery. Different variations of balloon catheters have been developed for the treatment of PAD, claiming additional benefits compared to standard angioplasty. These include cutting or scoring balloons designed to treat blockages with lower inflation pressures, as well as drug-coated balloons designed to suppress the inflammatory response to minimize restenosis. According to TASC II, 35% of angioplasty treatments result in restenosis at one year and 52% at three years. Millennium Research Group estimates that 500,000 PAD angioplasty procedures in the pelvis and legs were performed in the United States in 2013, 62% of which required the additional use of a stent.

&#160; 

Stenting. &#160; A stent is a wire-mesh tube that acts as a scaffold inside the artery to maintain adequate blood flow. Stents are currently available in bare metal and drug-coated varieties, with the latter designed to inhibit restenosis. Since stents rely on a similar expansion mechanism as balloons, we believe they also cause injury to the arterial wall and damage healthy arterial structures during placement. According to TASC II, 27% of PAD stent treatments result in restenosis at one year and 36% at three years. Additionally, according to a study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, stents placed in the legs fracture in approximately 25% of cases and, in such cases, have one-year patency, or absence of restenosis, rates of 41%, compared to 84% in cases with no stent fractures. Stents placed in the legs are often longer than coronary stents due to the diffuse nature of the lesions and the arterial anatomy, and longer stents have significantly higher fracture rates. Once a stent is implanted, it cannot be removed, which may limit future treatment options such as angioplasty, additional stenting, atherectomy and bypass surgery. Millennium Research Group estimates that 370,000 PAD stent procedures in the pelvis and legs were performed in the United States in 2013.

&#160; 

Atherectomy. &#160; Atherectomy is a procedure in which plaque is cleared from the arterial walls using a catheter-based technology with a mechanism to remove or displace diseased tissue. There are several types of atherectomy devices, including directional, rotational and laser, each with different mechanisms of action to remove or displace plaque. Except for Pantheris, currently available atherectomy devices rely on fluoroscopy rather than on- board imaging to provide visual guidance throughout the entire procedure. These atherectomy treatments frequently require the use of a stent or balloon to achieve the desired outcome and cannot selectively target the removal of only diseased tissue. As a result, traditional atherectomy technologies can damage the blood vessel being treated, which we believe increases the risk of restenosis. According to an article published in the Journal of Invasive Cardiology reviewing published clinical data, one-year restenosis rates for existing atherectomy technologies range from 22% to 46%. According to Millennium Research Group, there were 80,000 atherectomy procedures performed in the pelvis and legs in the United States in 2013, 86% of which required the use of a stent or balloon.

&#160; 

Our Solution 

&#160; 

Our pioneering Lumivascular platform combines best-in-class interventional devices with optical coherence tomography, or OCT, a high resolution, light-based, radiation-free intravascular imaging technology. Our Lumivascular platform provides physicians with real-time OCT images from the inside of an artery, and we believe Ocelot and Pantheris are the first products to offer intravascular visualization during CTO crossing and atherectomy, respectively. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Visualization using our Lumivascular technology compared to standard fluoroscopy imaging 

&#160; 

We believe the combination of enhanced visualization and the ability to precisely target the diseased portion of an artery will allow physicians to access difficult-to-treat areas and significantly improve the safety and efficacy of endovascular procedures for patients. Market acceptance of our Lumivascular platform products may be hindered if physicians are not presented with compelling data from long-term studies of the safety and efficacy of our Lumivascular platform products as compared to alternative procedures such as angioplasty, stenting, bypass surgery or other atherectomy procedures. Physicians will also need to appreciate the value of real-time imaging in improving patient outcomes in order to change current methods for treating PAD patients. We believe that our Lumivascular platform provides the following benefits to physicians, hospitals and patients, as compared to balloons, stents and other atherectomy procedures: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Improved efficacy through reduced risk of restenosis. Clinical evidence supports the proposition that more desirable outcomes in treating PAD are achieved by minimizing injury to the vessel wall during treatment, thereby reducing the risk of restenosis. Our Lumivascular platform is designed to provide physicians with a clear picture from inside the artery during treatment. In addition, the directional nature of our catheters is designed to enable physicians to accurately target the diseased area, resulting in less damage to arterial structures and allowing for the precise removal of plaque. Our VISION clinical trial demonstrated that the average percent area of adventitial component was only 1% of the total tissue section from histopathological analysis of 162 lesion specimens in the primary cohort. We believe that the low level of adventitia excision means less EEL disruption and will correlate to lower restenosis rates and improved long-term outcomes for patients treated with Pantheris. Additionally, a study conducted at Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York involving 116 patients found one-year restenosis rates of 97% and 17% in patients with and without evidence of EEL disruption, respectively. The Mount Sinai Medical Center study was not conducted using our products. Although we believe that our products would achieve similar results to those achieved with existing atherectomy devices in which no EEL disruption occurred, we can provide no assurance that this would have been the case.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Safety of endovascular procedures. Serious adverse events such as perforations and dissections may be reduced during endovascular procedures using our Lumivascular platform. The results of our CONNECT II trial showed the benefit of our Lumivascular platform, as demonstrated by the 98% safety rates in CTO cases using Ocelot, and there were no clinically significant perforations or dissections caused by Pantheris in our VISION trial.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Expanded patient population eligible for endovascular treatment of PAD. Our Lumivascular platform is designed to allow physicians to treat complex PAD cases where a traditional guidewire may not be successful due to the high CTO crossing success rates of Ocelot in such cases. There are 150,000 peripheral bypass procedures and 200,000 amputations performed each year in the United States. We believe these procedures are frequently performed as a result of an inability to cross a CTO with endovascular techniques. In our CONNECT II trial, Ocelot demonstrated a 97% CTO crossing rate in cases where a traditional guidewire was not successful. This crossing effectiveness enables the endovascular treatment of patients who may have previously been required to undergo bypass surgery or amputation. In addition, due to improved safety of our Lumivascular platform products, we believe physicians will be more likely to use our products to treat patients who would otherwise be medically managed.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Decreased radiation exposure for physicians and patients. In current endovascular treatments for PAD, physicians use fluoroscopy as the primary means of imaging and navigating to the target vessel and assessing results of the treatment. This standard practice exposes physicians, hospital staff and patients to harmful x-ray radiation for a significant period of time. Radiation exposure can be especially high for physicians and hospital staff who may perform multiple endovascular PAD procedures per day. Our Lumivascular platform, which utilizes radiation-free OCT imaging, provides real-time visualization from the inside of the artery. When using our Lumivascular platform, physicians may elect to use less fluoroscopy during a procedure as a result of having an additional means of visualization that does not involve radiation.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Reduced use of balloons and stents and preservation of future treatment options. Pantheris is designed to enable physicians to successfully perform atherectomy procedures and remove plaque blockages in PAD patients using fewer balloons and stents. Current atherectomy procedures often require the use of balloons and stents, which may result in restenosis and limit future treatment options. In our VISION trial, balloon angioplasty was used following Pantheris in less than half of the lesions treated, and stents were used in just 4% of treated lesions. By avoiding the use of stents in atherectomy procedures, we believe that Pantheris better preserves future treatment options. We believe our Lumivascular platform can replace other endovascular technologies, lower restenosis rates and reduce overall healthcare costs.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Lumivascular platform designed for ease of adoption by physicians and hospitals. Our Lumivascular platform products, while providing image-guided assistance to physicians, are used in a similar fashion to traditional catheters. Consequently, we believe the more than 10,000 interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists in the United States that are trained in endovascular techniques can generally adopt our Lumivascular platform and products without extensive training. We are designing future products to be compatible with our Lumivascular platform, which we expect will enhance the value proposition for hospitals to invest in our technology. We also believe that Pantheris qualifies for existing reimbursement codes currently utilized by other atherectomy products, further facilitating adoption of our products.

&#160; 

Risks of using the Lumivascular platform include the risks that are common to endovascular procedures and generally may include perforation, dissection, embolization, bleeding, infection, restenosis and limb loss. We are aware of certain characteristics and features of our Lumivascular platform that may prevent widespread market adoption, including that in procedures using Pantheris, 

&#160; 

&#160; 

some physicians may prefer to have a technician or second physician assisting with the operation of the catheter and that training for technicians and physicians will be required to enable them to effectively operate our Lumivascular platform products. Our current products are contraindicated, and therefore should not be used, in the iliac, coronary, cerebral, renal and carotid arteries.

&#160; 

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

Our goal is to become the leading provider of image-guided medical devices for physicians to treat vascular diseases. The key elements of our strategy are to: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Increase the installed base and penetration of our Lumivascular platform. Our current sales efforts focus on establishing new Lumivascular platform sites by marketing our products to physicians and hospital administrators through our direct sales force in the United States. Additionally, we seek to increase the use of our Lumivascular platform products by our current customers through case coverage, clinical training and other programs. We expect to continue to grow our sales force in order to better support current customers and attract new users of our Lumivascular platform products. We believe that expanding our U.S. commercial infrastructure and establishing distributor relationships in select regions outside the United States will drive further adoption of our Lumivascular platform.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Perform additional post-market studies to demonstrate the clinical and economic benefits of our Lumivascular platform . We intend to initiate post-market studies that will examine clinical outcomes of our Lumivascular platform products. We plan to conduct observational registry studies as well as randomized trials comparing the safety, efficacy and cost of our Lumivascular platform products to other endovascular treatments for PAD. We may also conduct studies to support additional clinical indications.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Assist hospitals in raising awareness of our Lumivascular platform for patients suffering from PAD . We are focused on increasing the awareness of our Lumivascular platform and the benefits it offers to patients and physicians. We work with our hospital customers to build a Lumivascular platform-based program through clinical training, public relations and physician education. The main focus of our clinical value proposition is to demonstrate how the Lumivascular platform allows physicians to avoid injury to the healthy arterial structures during intervention, while addressing the other limitations of competing endovascular approaches. We plan to continue working with our customers to position our Lumivascular platform as an offering they can use to demonstrate their commitment to using the most advanced technologies in caring for their patients.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Leverage our technology platform to develop new products and further enhance our intellectual property portfolio . We intend to continue to invest in initiatives to improve the safety, efficacy and ease of use of our Lumivascular platform, as well as to reduce costs and procedure times. We have also identified a number of future expansion opportunities designed to position our Lumivascular platform as the standard of care for vascular disease. We expect our Pantheris atherectomy device to be an important addition to our Lumivascular platform. We also intend to explore the feasibility of seeking new indications for our Lumivascular platform to address unmet clinical needs within the CAD market. We believe we have a strong intellectual property portfolio and will continue to enhance this portfolio as we develop new technologies.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Optimize our manufacturing operations to achieve cost and production efficiencies while maintaining quality . We design, develop and manufacture all of our products in-house at our headquarters in Redwood City, California using some components and sub-assemblies provided by third-party suppliers. We believe that controlling the manufacturing and assembly of our products allows us to innovate more quickly and produce higher quality products than if we outsourced manufacturing. We have the capacity to significantly increase our manufacturing volume within our current facilities. We intend to use our design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities to further advance and improve the efficiency of our manufacturing processes, which we believe will reduce unit costs and increase our gross margins. To further reduce costs, we may seek to manufacture certain of our products or subassemblies outside the United States or through third-party contract manufacturers.

It may be used to facilitate placement and exchange of guidewires and other interventional devices. It may also be used to deliver saline or contrast.

&#160; 

(2) &#160; The Kittycat 2 catheter is intended to facilitate the intraluminal placement of conventional guidewires beyond stenotic lesions (including sub and chronic total occlusions) in the peripheral vasculature prior to further percutaneous intervention. The Kittycat 2 catheter is contraindicated for use in the iliac, coronary, cerebral, renal and carotid vasculature.

&#160; 

(3) &#160; This original clearance date is for the 7F version of Wildcat. The commercially available version of Wildcat is listed and was cleared in August 2010.

&#160; 

Lumivascular Platform Overview 

&#160; 

Our Lumivascular platform integrates OCT visualization with interventional catheters and is the industry&#146;s only system that provides real-time intravascular imaging during the treatment portion of PAD procedures. Our Lumivascular platform consists of a capital component, Lightbox, and a variety of disposable catheter products, including Ocelot, Ocelot PIXL, Ocelot MVRX and Pantheris. 

&#160; 

Lightbox 

&#160; 

Lightbox is our proprietary imaging console, which enables the use of Lumivascular catheters during PAD procedures. The console contains an optical transceiver that transmits light into the artery through an optical fiber and displays a cross-sectional image of the vascular tissue to the physician on a high definition monitor during the procedure. Lightbox is configured with two monitors, one for the physicians, and one for the Lightbox technician. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Lightbox displays a cross-sectional view of the vessel, which provides physicians with detailed information about the orientation of the catheter and the surrounding artery and plaque. Layered structures represent relatively healthy portions of the artery and non-layered structures represent the plaque that is blocking blood flow in the artery. Navigational markers allow the physician to orient the catheter toward the treatment area, helping to avoid damage to the black line during a procedure. Lightbox received FDA 510(k) clearance in November 2012 and CE Mark in Europe in September 2011. 

&#160; 

Pantheris 

&#160; 

We believe Pantheris is the first atherectomy catheter to incorporate real-time OCT intravascular imaging. Pantheris may be used alone or following a CTO crossing procedure using Ocelot or other products. Pantheris is a single-use product and will provide physicians with the ability to see a cross-sectional view of the artery throughout the procedure. The device restores blood flow by shaving thin strips of plaque using a high-speed directional cutting mechanism that specifically targets the portion of the artery where the plaque resides while minimizing disruption to healthy arterial structures. The excised plaque is deposited in the nosecone of the device and removed from the artery. We believe Pantheris represents a meaningful advancement in the treatment of PAD and will expand the existing treatable market. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

To perform atherectomy procedures using Pantheris, physicians advance Pantheris to the diseased portion of the vessel using fluoroscopy prior to activating the cutting tip. The OCT image provides the physician with a cross-sectional view of the treatment site and the relative orientation of the cutter. Visual cues are used to orient the cutting mechanism to target diseased sections of the artery and the plaque is removed by activating the cutter and advancing the catheter through the blockage. A balloon beneath the cutter is inflated to move the catheter closer to the plaque, enabling the physician to stabilize the device and adjust the cut depth into the plaque as necessary. Multiple cuts can be made with the same device until sufficient plaque has been removed to restore adequate blood flow in the artery. In July 2014, FDA granted us an investigational device exemption, or IDE, for Pantheris and we commenced enrollment of our 133-patient VISION trial. We completed enrollment of the VISION trial in March 2015 and we submitted for 510(k) clearance from FDA in August 2015. In October 2015, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for commercialization of Pantheris. We have made minor modifications to Pantheris since the VISION trial and have recently commenced U.S. sales following receipt of FDA approval this enhanced version of Pantheris in March, 2016. We received CE Mark for Pantheris in June 2015 and in August 2015 for the enhanced version of Pantheris.

&#160; 

Ocelot, Ocelot PIXL and Ocelot MVRX 

&#160; 

Ocelot is the first ever CTO crossing catheter to incorporate real-time OCT imaging, which allows physicians to see the inside of an artery during a CTO crossing procedure. Physicians have traditionally relied solely on fluoroscopy and tactile feedback to guide catheters through complicated blockages. Ocelot allows physicians to accurately navigate through CTOs by utilizing the OCT images to precisely guide the device through the arterial blockage, while minimizing disruption to the healthy arterial structures. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Ocelot crossing a chronic total occlusion, or CTO 

Lightbox visualization 

&#160; 

Ocelot has a corkscrew-like tip that rotates to facilitate advancement of the catheter through a CTO. Marker bands are displayed on the OCT image and allow the tip of the catheter to be steered towards the blockage and away from the arterial wall as it moves through the blockage. Once through the blockage, a guidewire can be extended and Ocelot is removed, leaving the wire in place for additional therapies such as the use of an atherectomy catheter like Pantheris. We received CE Mark for Ocelot in September 2011 and received FDA 510(k) clearance in November 2012. 

&#160; 

We also offer Ocelot PIXL, a lower profile CTO-crossing device for below-the-knee arteries and Ocelot MVRX, which offers a different tip design for above-the-knee arteries. We received CE Mark for Ocelot PIXL in October 2012 and received FDA 510(k) clearance in December 2012. We received FDA 510(k) clearance for Ocelot MVRX in December 2012. 

&#160; 

Other Products 

&#160; 

Our first-generation CTO-crossing catheters, Wildcat and Kittycat 2, employ a proprietary design that uses a rotational spinning technique, allowing the physician to switch between passive and active modes when navigating across a CTO. Once across the CTO, Wildcat and Kittycat 2 allow for placement of a guidewire and removal of the catheter while leaving the wire in place for additional therapies. Both products require the use of fluoroscopy rather than our Lumivascular platform for imaging. Wildcat was our first commercial product and has received both FDA 510(k) clearance in the United States and CE Mark in Europe for crossing peripheral artery CTOs. Kittycat 2 has FDA 510(k) clearance in the United States and CE Mark clearance in Europe for the treatment of peripheral artery CTOs. 

&#160; 

Clinical Development 

&#160; 

We have conducted several clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our products and we received FDA clearance for Wildcat and Ocelot for CTO crossing in 2011 and 2012, respectively, and for Pantheris in October 2015. 

&#160; 

CONNECT (Wildcat) 

&#160; 

Our clinical trial for the Wildcat catheter, known as the CONNECT trial, was a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of Wildcat in crossing CTOs in arteries of the upper leg. The CONNECT trial enrolled 88 patients with CTOs at 15 centers in the United States. Patients were followed for 30 days post-procedure and an independent group of physicians verified the results to determine crossing efficacy and safety endpoints. The CONNECT trial demonstrated that Wildcat was able to cross 89% of CTOs following unsuccessful attempts to cross with standard guidewire techniques. The trial demonstrated a 95% freedom from major adverse events, or MAEs. In the CONNECT trial, MAEs were defined as clinically significant perforations or embolizations and/or Grade C or greater dissections occurring within 30 days of the procedure. These results represent the second-highest reported CTO crossing rate of any published CTO clinical trial, exceeded only by our subsequent CONNECT II clinical trial results. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

CONNECT II (Ocelot) 

&#160; 

Our clinical trial for Ocelot, known as CONNECT II, was a prospective, multi- center, non-randomized trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of Ocelot in crossing CTOs in arteries of the upper leg using OCT intravascular imaging. The CONNECT II trial enrolled 100 patients with CTOs at 14 centers in the United States and two centers in Europe. Patients were followed for 30 days post-procedure and an independent group of physicians verified the results to confirm the primary efficacy and safety endpoints. Results from the CONNECT II trial demonstrated that Ocelot surpassed its primary efficacy endpoint by successfully crossing the CTO in 97% of the cases following unsuccessful attempts to cross with standard guidewire techniques. Ocelot achieved these rates with 98% freedom from MAEs. 

&#160; 

VISION (Pantheris) 

&#160; 

VISION was our pivotal, non-randomized, prospective, single-arm trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Pantheris across 20 sites within the United States and Europe. The objective of the clinical trial was to demonstrate that Pantheris can be used to effectively remove plaque from diseased lower extremity arteries while using on-board visualization as an adjunct to fluoroscopy. Two groups of patients were treated in VISION: (1) optional roll-ins, which are typically the first two procedures at a site, and (2) the primary cohort, which are the analyzable group of patients. The data for these two groups was reported separately in our 510(k) submission to FDA. Based on final enrollment, the primary cohort included 130 patients. In March 2015, we completed enrollment of patients in the VISION clinical trial and we submitted for 510(k) clearance from the FDA in August 2015. In October 2015, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for commercialization of Pantheris. We have made minor modifications to Pantheris subsequent to the completion of VISION and received 510(k) clearance on the enhanced version of Pantheris in March 2016.

&#160; 

VISON&#146;s primary efficacy endpoint requires that at least 87% of lesions treated by physicians using Pantheris have a residual stenosis of less than 50%, as verified by an independent core laboratory. The primary safety endpoint required that less than 43% of patients experience an MAE through six-month follow-up as adjudicated by an independent Clinical Events Committee, or CEC. MAEs as defined in VISION included cardiovascular-related death, unplanned major index limb amputation, clinically driven target lesion revascularization, or TLR, heart attack, clinically significant perforation, dissection, embolus, and pseudoaneurysm. Results from the VISION trial demonstrated that Pantheris surpassed its primary efficacy and safety endpoints; residual restenosis of less than 50% was achieved in 96.3% of lesions treated in the primary cohort, while MAEs were experienced in 17.6% of patients. 

&#160; 

Although not mandated by the FDA to support the market clearance of Pantheris, the protocol for the VISION trial allowed for routine histopathological analysis of the tissue extracted by Pantheris to be conducted. This process allowed us to determine the amount of adventitia present in the tissue, which in turn indicated the extent to which the external elastic lamina had been disrupted during Pantheris procedures. We completed histopathological analysis on tissue from 129 patients in the primary cohort, representing 162 lesions and determined that the average percent area of adventitia was only 1.0% of the total excised tissue. We believe the low level of EEL disruption will correlate to lower restenosis rates and improved long-term outcomes for patients treated with Pantheris, but we do not intend to make any promotional claims to that effect based on the data from this study. We published the results of the histopathological analysis in conjunction with the primary safety and efficacy endpoint data from the VISION trial. 

&#160; 

Final VISION trial data is summarized in the table below.

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

We focus our sales and marketing efforts primarily on the approximately 10,000 interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists in the United States that are potential users of our Lumivascular platform products. Our marketing efforts are focused on developing strong relationships with physicians and hospitals that we have identified as key opinion leaders based on their knowledge of our products, clinical expertise and reputation. We also use continuing medical education programs and other opportunities to train interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons, and interventional radiologists in the use of our Lumivascular platform products and educate them as to the benefits of our products as compared to alternative procedures such as angioplasty, stenting, bypass surgery or other atherectomy procedures. In addition, we work with physicians to help them develop their practices and with hospitals to market themselves as centers of excellence in PAD treatment by making our products available to physicians for treating patients. 

&#160; 

Our sales team consists of a vice president, directors, regional managers, sales representatives and clinical specialists. Our sales representatives are divided into two primary roles, one focused on sale and use of our disposable catheters and the other focused on sale and service of our Lightbox console. We have an extensive hands-on sales training program, focused on our technologies, Lumivascular image interpretation, case management, sales processes, sales tools and implementing our sales and marketing programs and compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations. Our sales team is supported by a highly specialized marketing team, which is divided into three areas of focus: clinical education, marketing program implementation and technology awareness and product development. We also have a small team of field engineers responsible for installation, service and maintenance of our Lightbox consoles. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 70 employees focused on sales and marketing. Our sales, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $29.2 million, $18.5 million and $25.8 million, respectively. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The medical device industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions, results of clinical research, corporate combinations and other factors relating to our industry. Because of the market opportunity and the high growth potential of the PAD treatment market, competitors and potential competitors have historically dedicated, and will continue to dedicate, significant resources to aggressively develop and commercialize their products. 

&#160; 

Our products compete with a variety of products or devices for the treatment of PAD, including other CTO crossing devices, stents, balloons and atherectomy catheters, as well as products used in vascular surgery. Large competitors in the CTO crossing, stent and balloon market segments include Abbott Laboratories, Boston Scientific, Cardinal Health, Cook Medical, CR Bard and Medtronic. Competitors in the atherectomy market include Boston Scientific, Cardiovascular Systems, Medtronic, Philips and Spectranetics. Some competitors have attempted to combine intravascular imaging with atherectomy and may have current programs underway to do so. These and other companies may attempt to incorporate on-board visualization into their products in the future. Other competitors include pharmaceutical companies that manufacture drugs for the treatment of symptoms associated with mild to moderate PAD and companies that provide products used by surgeons in peripheral and coronary bypass procedures. These competitors and other companies may introduce new products that compete with our solution. 

&#160; 

Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, manufacturing, marketing and technical resources than we do. Furthermore, many of our competitors have well-established brands, widespread distribution channels and broader product offerings, and have established stronger and deeper relationships with target customers. 

&#160; 

To compete effectively, we have to demonstrate that our products are attractive alternatives to other devices and treatments on the basis of: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; procedural safety and efficacy;

&#183; &#160; acute and long-term outcomes;

&#183; &#160; ease of use and procedure time;

&#183; &#160; price;

&#183; &#160; size and effectiveness of sales force;

&#183; &#160; radiation exposure for physicians, hospital staff and patients; and

&#183; &#160; third-party reimbursement.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Intellectual property 

&#160; 

In order to remain competitive, we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. 

&#160; 

It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also forbid them from using the proprietary rights of third parties in their work for us. We also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we held six issued U.S. patents and had 20 U.S. utility patent applications and 3 PCT applications pending. As of December 31, 2015, we also had 10 issued patents from outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2015, we had 39 pending patent applications outside of the United States, including in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India and Japan. As we continue to research and develop our Pantheris technology, we intend to file additional U.S. and foreign patent applications related to the design, manufacture and therapeutic uses of our atherectomy devices. Our issued patents expire between the years 2028 and 2032. 

&#160; 

Our patent applications may not result in issued patents and our patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any patents issued to us may be challenged by third parties as being invalid, or third parties may independently develop similar or competing technology that avoids our patents. The laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we held three registered U.S. trademarks and two pending U.S. trademark applications, one of which has been allowed. In Europe we hold two registered trademarks. In addition, we held one International Registration under the Madrid Protocol with pending extensions to China, Europe, Japan, and Korea. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Our ongoing research and development activities are primarily focused on improving and enhancing our Lumivascular platform, specifically our core competency of integrating OCT intravascular imaging onto therapeutic catheters. Our research objectives target areas of unmet clinical need, increase the utility of the Lumivascular platform and adoption of our products by healthcare providers. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Product line improvements and extensions. We are developing improvements to our Lumivascular platform, including additional catheters for use in different clinical applications. For example, we are developing versions of Pantheris designed to treat smaller vessels and with enhanced cutting capability. We are also developing a next-generation CTO crossing device to target both the peripheral and coronary CTO markets.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Additional treatment indications. We intend to seek additional regulatory clearances from FDA to expand the indications for which our products can be marketed within PAD, as well as in other areas of the body. This includes both expanding the marketed indications for our current products, as well as development of new products.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Next-generation console. We are focusing our console development efforts on miniaturization, equipment integration and increased processing power in anticipation of future catheter products. We may also develop a version of our Lumivascular platform that integrates OCT imaging into existing catheterization lab and operating room imaging systems.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Improved software and user interface. We are actively improving our software to provide more information and control to our end users during a procedure. We use physician and staff feedback to improve the features and user functionality of our Lumivascular platform.

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 25 employees focused on research and development. In addition to our internal team, we retain third-party contractors from time to time to provide us with assistance on specialized projects. We also work closely with experts in the medical community to supplement our internal research and development resources. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $15.7 million, $11.2 million and $16.0 million, respectively. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

Prior to the introduction of our Lumivascular platform, our non-imaging catheter products were manufactured by a third-party. All of our products are now manufactured in-house using components and sub-assemblies manufactured both in-house at our facilities in Redwood City, California and by outside vendors. We expect our current manufacturing facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated growth through at least 2017. We assemble all of our products at our manufacturing facility but certain critical processes such as coating and sterilization are done by outside vendors.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our manufacturing operations are subject to regulatory requirements of 21 CFR part 820 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA; the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, for medical devices sold in the United States, which is enforced by FDA; the Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC, which is required for doing business in the European Union; and applicable requirements relating to the environment, waste management and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, and the sale, labeling, collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of products containing hazardous substances. We cannot ensure that we will not incur material costs or liability in connection with our operations, or that our past or future operations will not result in claims by or injury to employees or the public. 

&#160; 

Order quantities and lead times for components purchased from outside suppliers are based on our forecasts derived from historical demand and anticipated future demand. Lead times for components may vary significantly depending on the size of the order, time required to fabricate and test the components, specific supplier requirements and current market demand for the components and subassemblies. To date, we have not experienced significant delays in obtaining any of our components or subassemblies. 

&#160; 

We rely on single and limited source suppliers for several of our components. For example, we rely on one vendor for, among other components, our torque shaft and drive cable. These components are critical to our products and there are relatively few alternative sources of supply for them. We do not carry a significant inventory of these components. Identifying and qualifying additional or replacement suppliers for any of the components used in our products could involve significant time and cost. Any supply interruption from our vendors or failure to obtain additional vendors for any of the components used to manufacture our products would limit our ability to manufacture our product and could therefore harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

Our suppliers have no contractual obligations to supply us with, and we are not contractually obligated to purchase from them, any of our supplies. Any supply interruption from our vendors or failure to obtain additional vendors for any of the components would limit our ability to manufacture our product and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

We have registered with FDA as a medical device manufacturer and have obtained a manufacturing license from the California Department of Health Services, or CDRH. We and our component suppliers are required to manufacture our products in compliance with FDA&#146;s QSR in 21 CFR part 820 of the FFDCA. The QSR regulates extensively the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. FDA enforces the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. Since we began manufacturing onsite, our Quality System has undergone 14 external audits, the last of which occurred on July 7 through July 9, 2015 and resulted in zero non-conformances. 

&#160; 

Our failure or the failure of our component suppliers to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shutdown of our manufacturing operations or the recall of our products, which would harm our business. In the event that one of our suppliers fails to maintain compliance with our or governmental quality requirements, we may have to qualify a new supplier and could experience manufacturing delays as a result. We have opted to maintain quality assurance and quality management certifications to enable us to market our products in the member states of the European Union, the European Free Trade Association and countries which have entered into Mutual Recognition Agreements with the European Union. Our Redwood City facilities meet the requirements set forth by ISO 13485:2003 Medical devices&#151;Quality management systems&#151;Requirements for regulatory purposes and MDD 93/42/EEC European Union Council Medical Device Directive. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

In general, medical device companies must navigate a challenging regulatory environment. The FDA regulates the medical device market to ensure the safety and efficacy of these products. The FDA allows for two primary pathways for a medical device to gain approval for commercialization: a successful pre-market approval, or PMA application or 510(k) clearance. A completely novel product must go through the more rigorous PMA process, or premarket approval, if it cannot receive authorization through a 510(k). The FDA has established three different classes of medical devices that indicate the level of risk associated with using a device and consequent degree of regulatory controls needed to govern its safety and efficacy. Level I and Level II devices are considered lower risk and often can gain approval for commercial distribution by submitting a notification request to the FDA, generally known as the 510(k) process. The devices regarded as the highest risk by the FDA are designated Class III status and generally require the submission of a PMA application for approval to commercialize a product. These generally include life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices or devices without a known predicate technology already approved by the FDA.

&#160; 

&#160; 

The 510(k) clearance path can be significantly less time-consuming and arduous than PMA approval, making this route preferable for a medical device company. Through a 510(k), a company must provide documentation that its device is substantially equivalent to a technology already approved through a 510(k) or in distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet required a PMA submission. The FDA has 90 days from the date of the premarket equivalence submission to authorize or decline commercial distribution of the device. However, similar to the PMA process, approval may take longer than this three-month window, as the FDA can request additional data. If the FDA resolves that the product is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, then the device acquires a Class III designation. All of our currently marketed products have received commercial clearance and associated indications for use through the 510(k) regulatory pathway with the FDA, some with the support of clinical data. 

&#160; 

A PMA application must be accompanied by substantial data that supports the safety and efficacy of the device, which includes the provision of preclinical, clinical, technical, manufacturing and labeling information. If the FDA deems the application acceptable to pass through the first level of scrutiny, it has 180 days to review the submission, but it can typically take longer (up to several years) as this regulatory body can request additional information or clarifications. The FDA may also impose additional regulatory hurdles for a PMA, including the institution of an outside advisory panel of experts to assess the application or provide recommendations as to whether to approve the device. Although the FDA in the end approves or disapproves the device, in nearly all cases the FDA follows the recommendation from the independent panel concerning approvability of the new device. As part of this process, the FDA will also inspect the manufacturing operations of the company requesting approval to verify compliance with quality control regulations. Significant changes in the fabrication of a device, or alterations in the labeling or design of a product require new PMA applications or PMA supplements for a product originally approved under a PMA. This creates substantial regulatory risk for devices undergoing the PMA route. 

&#160; 

Pervasive and Continuing Regulation 

&#160; 

After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; The FDA&#146;s QSR which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; clearance or approval of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; medical device reporting, or MDR, regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.

&#160; 

After a device receives 510(k) clearance or PMA approval, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new clearance or approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer&#146;s determination. If the FDA disagrees with the determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA, the FDA may retroactively require a new 510(k) clearance or premarket approval. The FDA could also require a manufacturer to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or premarket approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, it may be subject to significant regulatory fines, penalties, and warning letters. 

&#160; 

The MDR regulations require that we report to the FDA any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. 

&#160; 

We have registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer and have obtained a manufacturing license from the CDHS. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of CDHS to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers. BSI, our European Notified Body, inspected our facility in 2013 and 2015 and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

found zero non-conformances. Our current facility was inspected by the FDA in 2009, 2011 and 2013, and two, three and zero observations, respectively, were noted during those inspections. In the latest FDA audit, there were no findings that involved a material violation of regulatory requirements, and no non-conformances were noted. Our responses to these observations noted in 2009 and 2011 were accepted by the FDA, and we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the QSR. 

&#160; 

Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; refusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products, new intended uses or modifications to existing products;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; withdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted; and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; criminal prosecution.

&#160; 

Regulatory System for Medical Devices in Europe 

&#160; 

The European Union consists of 25 member states and has a coordinated system for the authorization of medical devices. The E.U. Medical Devices Directive, or MDD, sets out the basic regulatory framework for medical devices in the European Union. This directive has been separately enacted in more detail in the national legislation of the individual member states of the European Union. 

&#160; 

The system of regulating medical devices operates by way of a certification for each medical device. Each certificated device is marked with CE mark which shows that the device has a Certificat de Conformit&#233;. There are national bodies known as Competent Authorities in each member state which oversee the implementation of the MDD within their jurisdiction. The means for achieving the requirements for CE mark varies according to the nature of the device. Devices are classified in accordance with their perceived risks, similarly to the U.S. system. The class of a product determines the requirements to be fulfilled before CE mark can be placed on a product, known as a conformity assessment. Conformity assessments for our products are carried out as required by the MDD. Each member state can appoint Notified Bodies within its jurisdiction. If a Notified Body of one member state has issued a Certificat de Conformit&#233;, the device can be sold throughout the European Union without further conformance tests being required in other member states. 

&#160; 

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 

&#160; 

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, established for the first time comprehensive federal protection for the privacy and security of health information. The HIPAA standards apply to three types of organizations, or Covered Entities: health plans, healthcare clearing houses, and healthcare providers which conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically. Title II of HIPAA, the Administrative Simplification Act, contains provisions that address the privacy of health data, the security of health data, the standardization of identifying numbers used in the healthcare system and the standardization of certain healthcare transactions. The privacy regulations protect medical records and other protected health information by limiting their use and release, giving patients the right to access their medical records and limiting most disclosures of health information to the minimum amount necessary to accomplish an intended purpose. The HIPAA security standards require the adoption of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards and the adoption of written security policies and procedures. HIPAA requires Covered Entities to obtain a written assurance of compliance from individuals or organizations who provide services to Covered Entities involving the use or disclosure of protected health information (&#147;Business Associates&#148;). 

&#160; 

On February 17, 2009, Congress enacted Subtitle D of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. HITECH amends HIPAA and, among other things, expands and strengthens HIPAA, creates new targets for enforcement, imposes new penalties for noncompliance and establishes new breach notification requirements for Covered Entities and Business Associates. Regulations implementing major provisions of HITECH were finalized on January 25, 2013 through publication of the HIPAA Omnibus Rule, or the Omnibus Rule. The Omnibus Rule contained significant changes for Covered Entities and Business Associates with respect to permitted uses and disclosures of Protected Health Information. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Under HITECH&#146;s new breach notification requirements, Covered Entities must report breaches of protected health information that has not been encrypted or otherwise secured in accordance with guidance from the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or the Secretary. Required breach notices must be made as soon as is reasonably practicable, but no later than 60 days following discovery of the breach. Reports must be made to affected individuals and to the Secretary and in some cases, they must be reported through local and national media, depending on the size of the breach. We are currently subject to the HIPAA regulations. We are subject to audit under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, HITECH-mandated audit program. We may also be audited in connection with a privacy complaint. We are subject to prosecution and/or administrative enforcement and increased civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance, including a new, four-tiered system of monetary penalties adopted under HITECH. We are also subject to enforcement by state attorneys general who were given authority to enforce HIPAA under HITECH. To avoid penalties under the HITECH breach notification provisions, we must ensure that breaches of protected health information are promptly detected and reported within the company, so that we can make all required notifications on a timely basis. However, even if we make required reports on a timely basis, we may still be subject to penalties for the underlying breach. 

&#160; 

In addition to the federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws regarding the privacy and security of health information and personal data that are applicable to clinical laboratories. The compliance requirements of these laws, including additional breach reporting requirements, and the penalties for violation vary widely and new privacy and security laws in this area are evolving. Requirements of these laws and penalties for violations vary widely. We believe that we have taken the steps required of us to comply with health information privacy and security statutes and regulations in all jurisdictions, both state and federal. However, we may not be able to maintain compliance in all jurisdictions where we do business. Failure to maintain compliance, or changes in state or federal laws regarding privacy or security, could result in civil and/or criminal penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

&#160; 

If we or our operations are found to be in violation of HIPAA, HITECH or their implementing regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, fines, and exclusion from participation in U.S. federal or state health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. HITECH increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against Covered Entities, their Business Associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney&#146;s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. 

&#160; 

In addition to federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality of health information that are applicable to our operations. New laws governing privacy may be adopted in the future as well. We have taken steps to comply with health information privacy requirements that are applicable to us. 

&#160; 

Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse Laws 

&#160; 

Because of the significant federal funding involved in Medicare and Medicaid, Congress and the states have enacted, and actively enforce, a number of laws to eliminate fraud and abuse in federal healthcare programs. Our business is subject to compliance with these laws. In March 2010, the Recipient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, which we refer to collectively as the Affordable Care Act, was enacted in the United States. The provisions of the Affordable Care Act are effective on various dates. The Affordable Care Act expands the government&#146;s investigative and enforcement authority and increases the penalties for fraud and abuse, including amendments to both the Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, to make it easier to bring suit under these statutes. The Affordable Care Act also allocates additional resources and tools for the government to police healthcare fraud, with expanded subpoena power for HHS, additional funding to investigate fraud and abuse across the healthcare system and expanded use of recovery audit contractors for enforcement. 

&#160; 

Anti-Kickback Statutes. &#160; The federal healthcare programs&#146; Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid.

&#160; 

The definition of &#147;remuneration&#148; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, certain discounts, the furnishing of free supplies, equipment or services, credit arrangements, payment of cash and waivers of payments. Several courts have interpreted the statute&#146;s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered businesses, the statute has been violated. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. In addition some kickback allegations have been claimed to violate the Federal False Claims Act, discussed in more detail below. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are otherwise lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements, Congress authorized the Office of Inspector General, or OIG, of HHS to issue a series of regulations known as &#147;safe harbors.&#148; These safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities such as OIG. 

&#160; 

Many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of recipients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 

&#160; 

Government officials have focused their enforcement efforts on the marketing of healthcare services and products, among other activities, and recently have brought cases against companies, and certain individual sales, marketing and executive personnel, for allegedly offering unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business. 

&#160; 

Federal False Claims Act. &#160; Another development affecting the healthcare industry is the increased use of the federal False Claims Act, and in particular, action brought pursuant to the False Claims Act&#146;s &#147;whistleblower&#148; or &#147;qui tam&#148; provisions. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has violated the False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought against healthcare providers by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act, and many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not just a federal healthcare program.

&#160; 

When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate instance of false claim. As part of any settlement, the government may ask the entity to enter into a corporate integrity agreement, which imposes certain compliance, certification and reporting obligations. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The federal government has used the False Claims Act to assert liability on the basis of inadequate care, kickbacks and other improper referrals, and improper use of Medicare numbers when detailing the provider of services, in addition to the more predictable allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. In addition, the federal government has prosecuted companies under the False Claims Act in connection with off-label promotion of products. Our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesale or estimated retail prices of our products, the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement of our products and the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. 

&#160; 

While we are unaware of any current matters, we are unable to predict whether we will be subject to actions under the False Claims Act or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions. However, the costs of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could significantly affect our financial performance. 

&#160; 

The Sunshine Act. &#160; The Physician Payment Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, which was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, requires all entities that operate in the United States and manufacturers of a drug, device, biologic or other medical supply that is covered by Medicare, Medicaid or the Children&#146;s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the Secretary of HHS: (i) payments or other transfers of value made by that entity, or by a third-party as directed by that entity, to physicians and teaching hospitals or to third parties on behalf of physicians or teaching hospitals; and (ii) physician ownership and investment interests in the entity. The payments required to be reported include the cost of meals provided to a physician, travel reimbursements and other transfers of value, including those provided as part of contracted services such as speaker programs, advisory boards, consultation services and clinical trial services. The final rule implementing the Sunshine Act required data collection on payments to begin on August 1, 2013. The first annual report, comprised of data collected from August 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013, was due March 31, 2014. The statute requires the federal government to make reported information available to the public starting September 2014, which it has. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements can result in significant civil monetary penalties ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 for each payment or other transfer of value that is not reported (up to a maximum per annual report of $150,000) and from $10,000 to $100,000 for each knowing failure to report (up to a maximum per annual report of $1.0 million). Additionally, there are criminal penalties if an entity intentionally makes false statements in such reports. We are subject to the Sunshine Act and the information we disclose may lead to greater scrutiny, which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs. Additionally, similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with healthcare professionals.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. &#160; The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any United States individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.

&#160; 

International Laws. &#160; In Europe various countries have adopted anti-bribery laws providing for severe consequences, in the form of criminal penalties and/or significant fines, for individuals and/or companies committing a bribery offense. Violations of these anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation. For instance, in the United Kingdom, under the Bribery Act 2010, which went into effect in July 2011, a bribery occurs when a person offers, gives or promises to give a financial or other advantage to induce or reward another individual to improperly perform certain functions or activities, including any function of a public nature. Bribery of foreign public officials also falls within the scope of the Bribery Act 2010. Under the new regime, an individual found in violation of the Bribery Act of 2010, faces imprisonment of up to 10 years. In addition, the individual can be subject to an unlimited fine, as can commercial organizations for failure to prevent bribery.

&#160; 

There are also international privacy laws that impose restrictions on the access, use, and disclosure of health information. All of these laws may impact our business. Our failure to comply with these privacy laws or significant changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain required patient information could significantly impact our business and our future business plans. 

&#160; 

U.S. Healthcare Reform 

&#160; 

Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs and subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may interrupt commercialization of our current and future solutions. Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs, decrease our revenues and impact sales of and reimbursement for our current and future solutions. The Affordable Care Act substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts our industry. The Act contains a number of provisions that impact our business and operations, some of which in ways we cannot currently predict, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs and reimbursement changes. 

&#160; 

There will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and third-party payors to reduce costs while expanding individual healthcare benefits. Certain of these changes could impose additional limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for our current and future solutions or the amounts of reimbursement available for our current and future solutions from governmental agencies or third-party payors. While in general it is too early to predict specifically what effect the Affordable Care Act and its implementation or any future healthcare reform legislation or policies will have on our business, current and future healthcare reform legislation and policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 

&#160; 

Third-Party Reimbursement 

&#160; 

Payment for patient care in the United States is generally made by third-party payors, including private insurers and government insurance programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The Medicare program, the largest single payor in the United States, is a federal governmental health insurance program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, and covers certain medical care expenses for eligible elderly and disabled individuals. Because a large percentage of the population with PAD includes Medicare beneficiaries, and private insurers may follow the coverage and payment policies of Medicare, Medicare&#146;s coverage and payment policies are significant to our operations. 

&#160; 

Medicare pays PAD treatment facilities, including hospitals and physician office-based labs, pre-determined amounts for each procedure performed. These payment amounts differ based on a variety of factors, including: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Type of procedure performed&#151;angioplasty, stent or atherectomy;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Patient-specific complexities and comorbidities;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Type of facility&#151;hospital, teaching hospital or office-based lab;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Inpatient or outpatient status; and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Geographic region.

&#160; 

&#160; 

We receive payment from the treatment facility for our products, and the Medicare reimbursement to the facility is intended to cover the overall cost of treatment, including the cost of products used during the procedure as well as the overhead cost associated with the facility where the procedure is performed. For procedures performed in hospitals, the physician who performs the procedure is reimbursed separately under the Medicare physician fee schedule. Claims for PAD procedures are typically submitted by the treatment facility and physician to Medicare or other health insurers using established billing codes. These codes identify the procedures performed and are relied upon to determine third-party payor reimbursement amounts. 

&#160; 

Medicare reimbursement levels for fiscal year 2016 went into effect as of October 1, 2015. National average Medicare payment rates for PAD procedures for fiscal year 2016 are $10,175 - $19,410 for inpatient procedures and, $4,592 - $14,612 for outpatient procedures. These amounts include the cost of disposable catheters such as Ocelot and Pantheris. While reimbursement varies based on the type of procedure performed (i.e., angioplasty, stent or atherectomy), additional device-specific reimbursement is not available. The amount of reimbursement can vary substantially by geographical region and by facility. Payment rates of other third-party payors may follow Medicare rates, or they may be higher or lower, depending on their particular reimbursement methodology. Because of the wide variability, it is not possible to identify an average rate for third-party payors other than Medicare. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 186 employees, including 52 in manufacturing and operations, 69 in sales and marketing, 25 in research and development, 17 in clinical affairs, regulatory affairs, and quality assurance and 23 in finance, general administrative and executive administration. All 186 employees are full time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are parties to a collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our employee relations are good. 

&#160;
