Utilizing our powerful assets, brands and live event expertise, the Company delivers premium and unique experiences that set the standard for excellence and innovation while forging deep connections with diverse and passionate audiences. We manage our business through the following two operating segments:

In addition, the MSG Sports segment is home to a broad array of other live sporting events, including professional boxing, college basketball, professional bull riding, mixed martial arts, tennis and college wrestling , all of which the Company promotes, produces and/or presents. 

MSG Entertainment: &#32;This segment includes the Company&#8217;s live entertainment events &#8212; including concerts, family shows, performing arts and special events &#8212; which we present or host in our diverse collection of venues. Those venues include: Madison Square Garden (&#8220; The Garden &#8221;), The Theater at Madison Square Garden , Radio City Music Hall, the Beacon Theatre, the Forum, The Chicago Theatre and the Wang Theatre. Our MSG Entertainment segment also includes our original productions &#8212; the Christmas Spectacular Starring the Radio City Rockettes &#32;(&#8220; Christmas Spectacular &#8221;) &#32;and the &#32; New York Spectacular Starring the Radio City Rockettes &#32;( &#8220; New York Spectacular &#8221; ).

Our Strategy 

The Madison Square Garden Company pursues opportunities that strengthen our portfolio of live experiences and capitalize on our iconic venues, popular sports franchises and exclusive entertainment content, as well as our venue management, bookings, ticketing, marketing and sales expertise. We believe the Company&#8217;s unique assets and expertise, coupled with our deep relationships in the sports and entertainment industries and our strong connection with our diverse and passionate audiences, are what set the Company apart. We continue to look for ways to improve our core operations, while we explore new opportunities to grow and innovate. Specific initiatives we are focused on include: 

&#8226; 

Developing championship caliber teams. &#32;The core of our sports strategy is to develop teams that consistently compete for championships in their leagues and support and drive revenue streams across the Company. We continue to explore new ways to increase engagement and revenue opportunities across the teams&#8217; broad consumer and corporate customer bases. 

&#8226; 

Monetizing our exclusive sports content. &#32;The Company has media rights agreements with MSG Networks that provide a significant recurring and growing revenue stream to the Company, subject to the terms of such agreements. In addition, these agreements and our relationship with MSG Networks provide our fans with the ability to watch locally televised home and away games of the Knicks and Rangers, as well as other programming related to our teams, on MSG Networks&#8217; award-winning regional sports networks. 

&#8226; 

Utilizing our integrated approach to marketing and sales. &#32;The Company possesses powerful sports and entertainment assets that can create significant value for our business when used in a complementary manner. For example: 

&#9702; 

Our integrated approach to marketing partnerships allows us to use and sell our broad array of assets together in order to maximize their collective value, both for the Company and for our marketing partners. We believe this ability to offer compelling, broad-based marketing platforms, which we believe are unparalleled in sports and entertainment and enables us to attract world-class partners, such as our &#8220;Marquee&#8221; marketing partner, JPMorgan Chase, and our &#8220;Signature&#8221; marketing partners &#8212; Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola, Delta Airlines, Kia, Lexus, SAP and DraftKings. 

&#9702; 

We continue to forge deep direct-to-consumer relationships with customers and fans, with a focus on understanding how consumers interact with every aspect of the Company. A key component of this strategy is our large and growing proprietary customer database, which drives revenue and engagement across segments, benefiting the Company through ticket sales, merchandise sales and sponsorship activation. This database provides us with an opportunity to cross-promote our products and services, introducing customers to our wide range of assets and brands. For example, we have used our database to drive ticket sales to the &#32; Christmas Spectacular &#32;and the &#32; New York Spectacular &#32;from fans of our sports teams. 

&#8226; 

Utilizing a unique venue strategy. &#32;The Company has a collection of venues through which we deliver high-quality live entertainment. In addition to our New York venues: The Garden, The Theater at Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall and the Beacon Theatre, our portfolio includes: the Forum in Inglewood, CA and The Chicago Theatre, and we have a long-term booking agreement with respect to the Wang Theatre in Boston. These venues, along with our venue management capabilities, effective bookings strategy and proven expertise in sponsorships, marketing, ticketing and promotions, have positioned the Company as an industry leader in live entertainment. We intend to leverage our unique assets, expertise and approach to drive growth and stockholder value, and to ensure we continue to create unmatched experiences for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. 

&#9702; 

Maximizing the live entertainment experience for our customers. &#32;We use our first-class operations, coupled with new innovations and our ability to attract top talent, to deliver unforgettable experiences for our customers &#8212; whether they are first-time visitors, repeat customers, season ticket holders, or suite holders &#8212; ensuring they return to our venues. We have a track record of designing world-class facilities that exceed our customers&#8217; expectations. This includes our renovations of Radio City Music Hall, the Beacon Theatre, The Garden and the Forum, which now provide top-quality amenities such as state-of-the-art lighting, sound and staging, a full suite of hospitality offerings and enhanced premium products. In addition to better onsite 

amenities, we continue to explore new ways to utilize technology to improve the customer experience and create communities around our live events. From the way our customers buy their food and beverage; to how we market and process their tickets; to the content we provide them to enhance their sports and entertainment experience, we want to give our customers the best in-venue experience in the industry. 

&#9702; 

Leveraging our live entertainment expertise to increase productivity across our venues. &#32;Part of what drives our success is our &#8220;artist first&#8221; approach. This includes our renovation of the Forum, which has set a new bar for the artist experience by delivering superior acoustics and an intimate feel, along with amenities such as nine star-caliber dressing rooms and dedicated areas for production and touring crews. This talent-friendly environment, coupled with more date availability and our top-tier service, is not only attracting artists to our West Coast venue, but bringing them back for repeat performances. We will continue to use our &#8220;artist first&#8221; approach to attract the industry&#8217;s top talent with the goal of increasing utilization across all of our venues through more multi-night concerts and other events, and more recurring high-profile shows that help expand our base of events. Our residencies &#8212; Billy Joel at The Garden and Jerry Seinfeld at the Beacon Theatre &#8212; in which these legendary performers play monthly is an example of this strategy. 

&#9702; 

Selectively expanding our venues in key music and entertainment markets. &#32;With the renovation of the Forum, we created the country&#8217;s only arena-sized venue dedicated to music and entertainment, which quickly established a strong presence in the market. We believe that, similar to Los Angeles, there are other select markets where our proven ability to develop music and entertainment-focused venues &#8212; coupled with our unique capabilities, expertise and &#8220;artist first&#8221; approach &#8212; will deliver a differentiated experience for artists, fans and partners. In May 2016, the Company announced plans to build a ground-breaking new venue in Las Vegas. The 400,000 &#32;square foot venue will be the world&#8217;s largest venue built specifically for music and entertainment, with a unique scalable seating design that places all 17,500 &#32;seats in front of the stage. We intend to continue to capitalize on this growth opportunity by identifying additional key markets where we can selectively expand our network of owned and operated venues, and pursue strategic partnerships with third parties to enhance and operate venues not owned by the Company. Controlling and booking an expanding network of world-class venues provides us with a number of avenues for growth, including driving increased bookings, greater marketing and sponsorship opportunities, and economies of scale. 

&#8226; 

Growing our portfolio of proprietary content. The Company will continue to explore the creation of proprietary content that enables us to benefit from being both content owner and venue operator. This includes opportunities surrounding our existing product, such as our creation of the new large-scale &#32;theatrical production for Radio City Music Hall, the &#32; New York Spectacular , which builds on our hallmark Christmas Spectacular &#32; and Rockettes brands. We also see additional opportunity to use our venues as physical gathering places for communities that form and interact online and to expand our customers&#8217; experience through the creation of venues connected through technology that bring people together both inside and outside our venues. 

&#8226; 

Exploring adjacencies that strengthen our business. As part of our commitment to creating unmatched experiences, we explore adjacencies that strengthen our position in sports and entertainment. Potential opportunities include new types of events and festivals, and new opportunities in hospitality, clubs, and food and beverage. In July 2016, the Company broadened its live experience offerings by purchasing a controlling interest in &#32; BCE , the entertainment production company known for successfully creating and operating New England&#8217;s premier music festival &#8212; the Boston Calling Music Festival. BCE also owns and produces a number of other events, including the Boston Calling Block Parties, an annual series of outdoor events showcasing local music, and the Copenhagen Beer Celebration, a new festival showcasing world-class brewers and musical acts that will be held for the first time this September in Boston&#8217;s City Hall Plaza. &#32; 

&#8226; 

Continuing to explore external strategic opportunities . We continue to seek strategic opportunities to add compelling assets and brands that resonate with our customers and partners, fit with our core competencies and allow new opportunities for growth across the Company. One of the ways we try to capitalize on our unique combination of dynamic assets, established industry relationships and deep customer connections is through strategic partnerships that bring together the expertise and capabilities of each partner, and enable us to team with recognized leaders in their fields and benefit from growth in those businesses. For example, we own 50% &#32;of Azoff MSG Entertainment LLC (&#8220; AMSGE &#8221;) which is backed by one of the music and entertainment industry&#8217;s most respected and influential executives, Irving Azoff. The joint venture owns and operates existing music, media and entertainment businesses, while allowing us to pursue various businesses in the entertainment space. In addition, we own 50% &#32;of Tribeca Enterprises LLC (&#8220; Tribeca Enterprises &#8221;), bringing together two of New York&#8217;s cultural and entertainment icons to enhance the reach and impact of both brands, while creating new avenues for growth with one of the most respected teams in the film and entertainment industry. 

Our Business &#32; 

MSG Sports &#32; 

Our Company is synonymous with some of the greatest sporting events in history. Today that tradition continues with our commitment to delivering a broad array of world-class sporting events that create lasting and indelible memories for sports fans. Our MSG Sports segment includes some of the world&#8217;s most recognized sports franchises, as well as a diverse selection of other live sporting events, that the Company promotes, produces and/or presents, primarily at The Garden , The Theater at Madison Square Garden and the Forum. 

Our Sports Franchises 

The Knicks and Rangers are two of the most recognized franchises in professional sports, with storied histories and passionate, multi-generational fan bases. These teams are major occupants of The Garden, playing a combined total of 82 &#32;regular season home games, often to at or near capacity attendance. In addition, the Liberty currently play 17 &#32;regular season home games at The Garden each year. The number of home games increases if our teams qualify for the playoffs. 

New York Knicks 

As an original franchise of the NBA, the Knicks have a rich history that includes eight trips to the NBA Finals and two NBA Championships, as well as some of the greatest athletes to ever play the game. The Knicks enjoy the fierce allegiance of generations of passionate and knowledgeable fans and are focused on fielding a championship-caliber team over the long-term. The Knicks ranked in the top three &#32;in the NBA for ticket sales receipts for the 2015-16 regular season, which marked the sixth consecutive year that Knicks season tickets sold out. 

New York Rangers 

The Rangers hockey club is one of the &#8220;original six&#8221; franchises of the NHL. Winners of four Stanley Cup Championships, the Rangers have won 11 &#32;conference titles over their history. For the 2015-16 season, the Rangers reached 101 &#32;points in the regular season, advancing to the playoffs for the sixth consecutive year and the 10 th &#32;time in 11 &#32;years. The Rangers are known to have one of the most passionate, loyal and enthusiastic fan bases in all of sports and ranked in the top three &#32;in the NHL for ticket sales receipts for the 2015-16 regular season, which marked the ninth consecutive year that Rangers season tickets sold out. 

New York Liberty 

The Liberty was established in October 1996, when New York was selected as one of eight &#32;charter members of the WNBA. Supported by an enthusiastic and loyal fan base, the Liberty have won three &#32;conference championships and appeared in the playoffs 13 &#32;times. The Liberty&#8217;s 2015 season saw its best record in franchise history ( 23 - 11 ), and a trip to the Eastern Conference Finals, with Coach Bill Laimbeer honored as WNBA Coach of the Year. 

Westchester Knicks 

In March 2014 , the Company acquired the right to own and operate an NBADL team, which has been named the Westchester Knicks. The team plays its home games at the Westchester County Center in White Plains, NY and serves as the exclusive NBADL affiliate of the Knicks. 

Hartford Wolf Pack 

The Hartford Wolf Pack, a minor-league hockey team, is a player development team for the Rangers and is also competitive in its own right in the AHL. The Rangers send draft picks and other players to the Hartford Wolf Pack for skill development and injury rehabilitation, and can call up players for the Rangers roster to enhance the team&#8217;s competitiveness. The Hartford Wolf Pack have reached the playoffs 15 &#32;times out of 19 &#32;seasons. 

The Role of the Leagues in Our Operations &#32; 

As franchises in professional sports leagues, our teams are members of their respective leagues and, as such, may be subject to certain limitations, under certain circumstances, on the control and management of their affairs. The respective league constitutions, under which each league is operated, together with the collective bargaining agreements (each a &#8220; CBA &#8221;) each league has signed with its players&#8217; association, contain numerous provisions that, as a practical matter in certain circumstances, could impact the manner in which we operate our businesses. In addition, under the respective league constitutions, the commissioner of each league, either acting alone or with the consent of a majority (or, in some cases, a supermajority) of the other teams in the league, may be empowered in certain circumstances to take certain actions felt to be in the best interests of the league, whether or not such actions would benefit our teams and whether or not we consent or object to those actions. 

While the precise rights and obligations of member teams vary from league to league, the leagues have varying degrees of control exercisable under certain circumstances over the length and format of the playing season, including preseason and playoff schedules; the operating territories of the member teams; national and international media and other licensing rights; admission of new members and changes in ownership; franchise relocations; indebtedness affecting the franchises; and labor relations with the players&#8217; associations, including collective bargaining, free agency, and rules applicable to player transactions, luxury taxes and revenue sharing. See &#8220;Part II &#32;&#8212; Item &#32; 7 . &#32; Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#32;&#8212; Business Overview &#32;&#8212; MSG Sports &#32;&#8212; Expenses .&#8221; From time to time, we may disagree with or challenge actions the leagues take or the power and authority they assert, although the leagues&#8217; governing documents and our agreements with the leagues purport to limit the manner in which we may challenge decisions and actions by a league commissioner or the league itself. 

Other Sporting Events 

The Company&#8217;s MSG Sports segment also includes a broad array of live sporting events &#32;that the Company promotes, produces and/or presents, including professional boxing, college basketball, college hockey, professional bull riding, mixed martial arts, tennis and college wrestling. Many of these events are among the most popular in our history and are perennial highlights on our annual calendar, as well as some of The Garden&#8217;s longest-running associations. 

Professional boxing, beginning with John L. Sullivan in 1882, has had a long history with The Garden. The Arena famously hosted Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier&#8217;s 1971 &#8220;Fight of the Century,&#8221; considered among the greatest sporting events in modern history, as well as numerous bouts featuring dozens of other boxing greats. These have included: Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano, Sugar Ray Robinson, Willie Pep, Emile Griffith, George Foreman, Roberto Duran, Oscar De La Hoya, Sugar Ray Leonard, Lennox Lewis, Roy Jones, Jr., Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield, Miguel Cotto, Wladimir Klitschko and Gennady Golovkin, who in October 2015 knocked out David Lemieux in front of a sold-out crowd at The Garden , unifying the middleweight titles. 

College sports have been a mainstay at The Garden &#32;for decades, with college basketball&#8217;s longest running holiday showcase, the Holiday Festival, first tipping off more than 50 years ago. In addition to St. John&#8217;s University calling The Garden its &#8220;home away from home,&#8221; the highly-anticipated Big East Tournament celebrated its 34 th &#32;anniversary at The Garden in 2016. Popular college basketball events also include visits from Duke University&#8217;s Blue Devils, the annual Jimmy V Classic and the post-season NIT Finals. In 2007, The Garden &#32;sold out its first college hockey game &#8212; Red Hot Hockey featuring Cornell University versus Boston University &#8212; which has become a biennial event. College hockey has grown at The Garden over the last decade, with three hockey rivalry games held last year, including one that was part of a Big Ten Conference basketball and hockey doubleheader. Meanwhile, in 2016 the NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships made its Garden and New York City debut, hosting more than 100,000 &#32;fans over three &#32;days. Upcoming events include the return of the East Regional Finals of the NCAA Division I Men&#8217;s Basketball Championship in 2017 and Big Ten Conference basketball and hockey doubleheader in 2017 and 2018, as well as the Big Ten Men&#8217;s Basketball Tournament in 2018. 

Other world-class sporting events have included the NBA All-Star Game, which The Garden &#32;last hosted in 2015, marking the fifth time the arena has hosted the illustrious professional basketball event. Additionally, The Garden is home to the annual BNP Paribas Showdown tennis event, which, since debuting in 2009, has featured tennis luminaries such as Pete Sampras, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams. In August 2015, The Garden entered the world of e-sports as it welcomed the League of Legends Championship Series, a two-day event around the popular video game. League of Legends will return in October 2016 for the World Championships with The Chicago Theatre hosting the quarterfinals and The Garden the semifinals. 

MSG Entertainment &#32; 

Our Company delivers unforgettable entertainment experiences &#8212; including live events and spectacular productions &#8212; all in extraordinary settings that span some of the country&#8217;s largest entertainment markets. This creates a significant demand for an association with our brands &#8212; by artists, premier companies and the public. And with a foundation of iconic venues, our Company has a proven ability to leverage the strength of our industry relationships, marketing assets, customer database and live event expertise to create performance, promotion and distribution opportunities for artists, events and productions, and to increase utilization of our venues. 

Specifically, our MSG Entertainment segment includes concerts, family shows, performing arts events and special events that we present or host at our venues, which are: The Garden, The Theater at Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall, the Beacon Theatre, the Forum and The Chicago Theatre. In addition, we have a long-term exclusive booking agreement with respect to the Wang Theatre. With seating capacities and configurations that range from 2,800 &#32;to 21,000 , our collection of diverse venues enables us to showcase acts that cover a wide spectrum of genres and popular appeal. 

Our MSG Entertainment segment also houses our original live productions, which include the beloved holiday show, the Christmas Spectacular , and our latest large-scale &#32;theatrical production, the New York Spectacular &#32;&#8212; both of which were created for Radio City Music Hall and feature the world-famous Rockettes. 

In July 2016 , the Company took an important step forward with its plans to build a robust, diversified portfolio of live festival events by purchasing a controlling interest in BCE , the entertainment production company that owns and operates the Boston Calling Music Festival, which is included in our MSG Entertainment segment. 

Our Live Entertainment Bookings 

Our Company is an established industry leader that books a wide variety of live entertainment events in our venues, which perennially include some of the biggest names in music and entertainment. Over the last several years, our venues have been a key destination for artists such as the Eagles, U2, Pearl Jam, Foo Fighters, Justin Bieber, Dead and Company, Madonna, Taylor Swift, Mumford &#38; Sons, Phish, Elton John, Adele, Eric Clapton, The Allman Brothers Band, Bruce Springsteen, Maroon 5, Rihanna, Justin Timberlake, Katy Perry, Stevie Wonder, Sting and Peter Gabriel, One Direction, Ariana Grande, Louis C.K. and Dave Chappelle. &#32; 

Our efforts to find new ways to increase the utilization of our venues led to a unique partnership between our Company and Billy Joel that made the renowned performer a staple of The Garden, playing monthly performances since January 2014. This extraordinary residency has been a great success with 36 &#32;sold-out performances through December 2016 &#32;and has cemented Billy Joel&#8217;s record for the most performances by any artist at &#8220;The World&#8217;s Most Famous Arena.&#8221; &#32;In December 2015, we added a second residency with the announcement that legendary New Yorker and comedian Jerry Seinfeld would appear monthly at the Beacon Theatre, which has led to 12 sold-out shows through December 2016. &#32; 

Our venues also attract family shows and theatrical productions, which this past year included: Sesame Street Live, Disney Live, Elf The Musical, Peppa Pig Live and &#32;The Wizard of Oz . In addition, we frequently serve as the backdrop for special events such as the Tony Awards, &#8220;America&#8217;s Got Talent,&#8221; and the MTV Video Music Awards; appearances by luminaries such as His Holiness Pope Francis, His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi; graduations, television upfronts, product launches and film premieres . 

Although we primarily license our venues to third-party promoters for a fee, we also promote or co-promote shows where we have economic risk relating to the event. MSG Entertainment currently does not promote or co-promote events outside of our venues. 

Our Productions &#32; 

One of the Company&#8217;s core properties, the Christmas Spectacular Starring the Radio City Rockettes , has been performed at Radio City Music Hall for 83 &#32;years. The world-famous Rockettes, along with show-stopping performances, festive holiday scenes and state-of-the-art special effects, have played an important role in the critically-acclaimed show&#8217;s enduring popularity. During the 2015 holiday season, the Christmas Spectacular &#32;sold more than one million &#32;tickets. 

We acquired the rights to the &#32; Christmas Spectacular &#32;in 1997, and those rights are separate from, and do not depend on the continuation of, our lease of Radio City Music Hall. We also hold rights to the Rockettes brand in the same manner. 

In 2015, we further extended the Rockettes brand with a new theatrical production built specifically for Radio City Music Hall. Previously called the New York Spring Spectacular , the show has been renamed the New York Spectacular Starring the Radio City Rockettes &#32;and in 2016, moved to the summer months. With a creative team that includes three-time Emmy Award-winner Mia Michaels as director and choreographer, and Drama Desk Award-winner Douglas Carter Beane as the show&#8217;s writer, the New York Spectacular &#32;takes audiences on a heartwarming, wondrous journey through New York City, weaving together one-of-a-kind puppetry, state-of-the-art technology and dynamic dance numbers performed by the stars of the show &#8212; the legendary Rockettes. 

We continue to strengthen and broaden our Rockettes brand, targeting the most prominent and effective vehicles that elevate their visibility and underscore their reputation as beloved American cultural icons. The Rockettes have appeared or performed at high-profile events, including Presidential Inaugurations, the Macy&#8217;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, Macy&#8217;s 4th of July Fireworks event, the New Year&#8217;s Eve Times Square Ball Drop, the Super Bowl XLV numeral unveil, television shows (&#8220;America&#8217;s Got Talent,&#8221; &#8220;Project Runway,&#8221; &#8220;The Today Show&#8221; and &#8220;The Colbert Report&#8221;), and fashion events (Michael Kors Fashion&#8217;s Night Out and Capezio Anniversary Gala), among many others. We continue to pursue opportunities to generate greater brand awareness, including television and public appearances and dance education offerings. 

Our Festival Offerings 

In July 2016, the Company broadened its live experience offerings by purchasing a controlling interest in BCE , the entertainment production company known for successfully creating and operating New England&#8217;s premier music festival &#8212; the Boston Calling Music Festival. Starting in 2017, the festival, which traditionally has taken place over two weekends during the year, will now take place annually on Memorial Day weekend and relocate to a new location in nearby Allston with expanded capacity. Other BCE events include the Boston Calling Block Parties, an annual series of outdoor events showcasing local music, and the Copenhagen Beer Celebration, a new festival showcasing world-class brewers and musical acts that will be held for the first time this September in Boston&#8217;s City Hall Plaza. 

Our Venues &#32; 

The Company operates a mix of iconic venues that continue to build on their historic prominence as destinations for unforgettable experiences and events. Individually, these venues are each premier showplaces, with a passionate and loyal following of fans, performers and events. Taken together, we believe they represent an outstanding collection of venues. 

We own or operate under long-term leases a total of six &#32;venues in New York City, Chicago and Inglewood, CA and have a long-term booking agreement with respect to the Wang Theatre in Boston. Our New York City venues are the Madison Square Garden Complex (which includes both The Garden and The Theater at Madison Square Garden), Radio City Music Hall and the Beacon Theatre. Our portfolio of venues also includes the Forum in Inglewood, CA and the landmark Chicago Theatre. 

The Garden 

The Garden has been a celebrated center of New York life since it first opened its doors in 1879. Over its 137-year history, there have been four Garden buildings, each known for showcasing the best of the era&#8217;s live sports and entertainment offerings. We believe that The Garden has come to epitomize the power and passion of live sports and entertainment to people around the world, with an appearance at The Garden often representing a pinnacle of an athlete&#8217;s or performer&#8217;s career. Known as &#8220;The World&#8217;s Most Famous Arena,&#8221; The Garden has been the site of some of the most memorable events in sports and entertainment, and, along with The Theater at Madison Square Garden, has hosted hundreds of events and millions of visitors this past year. In 2009, Billboard Magazine ranked The Garden the number one venue of the decade in its respective class based upon gross ticket sales. Music industry subscribers of the trade magazine Pollstar have voted The Garden &#8220;Arena of the Year&#8221; 19 &#32;out of the last 24 years. The Garden is the highest-grossing entertainment venue of its size in the nation and the second highest in the world based on Billboard Magazine&#8217;s 2016 mid-year rankings. 

The Garden is home to the Knicks, Rangers and Liberty and is associated with countless &#8220;big events,&#8221; inspired performances and one-of-a-kind moments. Highlights include: &#8220;The Fight of the Century&#8221; between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier in 1971; the 1970 Knicks&#8217; NBA Championship; the Rangers&#8217; 1994 Stanley Cup Championship; three Democratic National Conventions and one Republican National Convention; Marilyn Monroe&#8217;s famous birthday serenade to President John F. Kennedy; Frank Sinatra&#8217;s &#8220;Main Event&#8221; concert in 1974; the only U.S. concerts from the reunited Cream; the 25 th &#32;Anniversary Rock and Roll Hall of Fame concerts and Billy Joel&#8217;s record-breaking 82 total performances at The Garden (through December 2016). In September 2015, His Holiness Pope Francis celebrated Mass at The Garden as part of his successful U.S. visit, which marked the first time a current pope has visited The Garden since Pope John Paul II in 1979. The Garden has also hosted four prominent benefit concerts, which galvanized the public to respond to national and global crises, including the first of its kind, &#8220;The Concert for Bangladesh&#8221; in 1972, as well as &#8220;The Concert for New York City,&#8221; following the events of 9/11; &#8220;From the Big Apple to the Big Easy,&#8221; held after Hurricane Katrina in 2005; and &#8220;12-12-12, The Concert for Sandy Relief&#8221; in 2012. 

The current Madison Square Garden Complex, located between 31 st &#32;and 33 rd &#32;Streets and Seventh and Eighth Avenues on Manhattan&#8217;s West Side, opened on February 11, 1968 with a salute to the U.S.O. hosted by Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. From a structural standpoint, the construction of the current Garden was considered an engineering wonder for its time, including its famous circular shape and unique, cable-supported ceiling, which contributes to its intimate feel. It was the first large structure built over an active railroad track. The builder, R.E. McKee, had a national reputation and was later recognized as a &#8220;Master Builder&#8221; by the construction industry. Architect Charles Luckman had one of the largest firms in the country and designed such buildings as the Prudential Tower in Boston, NASA&#8217;s flight center in Houston and the Forum. 

Following a three-year, top-to-bottom transformation, in October 2013, the Company debuted a fully-transformed Garden. Focused on the total fan experience, the transformation was designed to benefit everyone in attendance, whether first time visitors, season ticket subscribers, athletes, artists, suite holders or marketing partners. Our customers now have access to a full list of amenities including: improved sightlines; additional entertainment and dining options; new concourses; upgraded hospitality areas; new technology; unique historic exhibits; and a completely transformed interior, where the intimacy of the arena bowl and The Garden&#8217;s world famous ceiling have been maintained. The Garden&#8217;s transformation ensures that attending an event at &#8220;The World&#8217;s Most Famous Arena&#8221; is unlike anywhere else. 

We own the Madison Square Garden Complex, the platform on which it is built and development rights (including air rights) above our property. Madison Square Garden sits atop Pennsylvania Station, a major commuter hub in Manhattan, which is owned by the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak). While the development rights we own would permit us to expand in the future, any such use of development rights would require various approvals from the City of New York. The Garden seats up to approximately 21,000 &#32;spectators for sporting and entertainment events and, along with The Theater at Madison Square Garden, contains approximately 1,100,000 &#32;square feet of floor space over 11 levels. 

The Theater at Madison Square Garden 

The Theater at Madison Square Garden, which has approximately 5,600 &#32;seats, opened as part of the fourth Madison Square Garden Complex in 1968 with seven nights of performances by Judy Garland. Since then, some of the biggest names in live entertainment have played The Theater at Madison Square Garden , including The Who, Bob Dylan, Diana Ross, Elton John, James Taylor, Macklemore &#38; Ryan Lewis, Pentatonix, Sara Bareilles, Ellie Goulding, Ricky Gervais, Neil Young, Bill Maher, Radiohead, Jerry Seinfeld and Van Morrison. The Theater has also hosted boxing events and the NBA Draft; award shows such as The Daytime Emmys; and other special events including &#8220; Wheel of Fortune &#8221; and audition shows for &#8220;America&#8217;s Got Talent,&#8221; as well as a variety of theatrical productions and family shows, including &#32; A Christmas Story, Elf The Musical, and &#32;Sesame Street Live . The Theater at Madison Square Garden is the fourth highest-grossing entertainment venue of its size in the world, based on Billboard Magazine&#8217;s 2016 mid-year rankings. 

Radio City Music Hall 

Radio City Music Hall has a rich history as a national theatrical and cultural mecca since it was first built by theatrical impresario S.L. &#8220;Roxy&#8221; Rothafel in 1932. Known as &#8220;The Showplace of the Nation,&#8221; it was the first building in the Rockefeller Center complex and, at the time, the largest indoor theater in the world. Radio City Music Hall hosts concerts, family shows and special events, and is home to the Christmas Spectacular &#32; and the &#32; New York Spectacular . See &#8220;&#8212; MSG Entertainment &#32;&#8212; Our Productions .&#8221; Entertainers who have graced the Great Stage include: Yes, Lady Gaga, Jason Mraz, Bastille, Jack White, Kelly Clarkson, Leonard Cohen and Dave Chappelle. In 2009, Billboard Magazine ranked Radio City Music Hall the number one venue of the decade in its respective class based upon gross ticket sales. Radio City Music Hall is the highest-grossing entertainment venue of its size in the world, based on Billboard Magazine&#8217;s 2016 mid-year rankings. 

In 1978, Radio City Music Hall was designated a New York City landmark by the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission and a national landmark on the National Register of Historic Places. We acquired the lease in 1997, and in 1999, we invested in a complete restoration that returned the legendary theater to its original grandeur. Our acclaimed restoration touched all aspects of the venue and included burnishing the ceilings of Radio City Music Hall with 720,000 &#32;sheets of gold and aluminum leaf, replacing the existing stage curtain with a new 112 -foot wide golden silk curtain, and cleaning the three-story tall mural &#8220;The Fountain of Youth,&#8221; by Ezra Winter, which looms above the grand staircase. State-of-the-art sound systems, lighting and HDTV capabilities were also installed. 

We lease Radio City Music Hall, located at Sixth Avenue and 50 th &#32;Street in Manhattan, pursuant to a long-term lease agreement. The lease on Radio City Music Hall expires in 2023 . We have the option to renew the lease for an additional 10 &#32;years by providing two &#32;years&#8217; notice prior to the initial expiration date. 

Beacon Theatre 

In November 2006, we entered into a long-term lease agreement to operate the legendary Beacon Theatre, a venue with approximately 2,800 &#32;seats, which sits on the corner of Broadway and 74 th &#32;Street in Manhattan. The Beacon Theatre was conceived of by S. L. &#8220;Roxy&#8221; Rothafel and is considered the &#8220;older sister&#8221; to Radio City Music Hall. Designed by Chicago architect Walter Ahlschlager, the Beacon Theatre opened in 1929 as a forum for vaudeville acts, musical productions, drama, opera, and movies. The Beacon Theatre was designated a New York City landmark by the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1979 and a national landmark on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Over its history, the Beacon Theatre has been a venerable rock and roll room for some of the greatest names in music including Steely Dan, Coldplay, Mariah Carey, Crosby Stills &#38; Nash, Jackson Browne, Elton John, John Fogerty, Ray LaMontagne, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Eddie Vedder and Bob Dylan, as well as The Allman Brothers Band, which played their 238 th &#32;show at the Beacon Theatre in October 2014, marking their final concert as a band. The venue has also hosted special events such as film premieres for the Tribeca Film Festival and comedy events, including our ongoing Jerry Seinfeld residency, along with numerous luminaries such as His Holiness the Dalai Lama in 2009 and 2013, and President Bill Clinton in 2006 when the Rolling Stones played a private concert in honor of his 60 th &#32;birthday. 

In August of 2008 we closed the Beacon Theatre for a seven-month restoration project to return the theater to its original 1929 grandeur. The restoration of the Beacon Theatre focused on all historic, interior public spaces of the building, backstage and back-of-house areas, and was based on extensive historic research, as well as detailed, onsite examination of original, decorative painting techniques that had been covered by decades-old layers of paint. The Beacon Theatre has won several 

architectural awards recognizing its outstanding restoration. The widely acclaimed, comprehensive restoration was similar to our restoration of Radio City Music Hall, and reflects our commitment to New York City. The Beacon Theatre is the seventh highest-grossing entertainment venue of its size in the world, based on Billboard Magazine&#8217;s 2016 mid-year rankings. 

Our lease on the Beacon Theatre expires in 2026 . 

The Forum 

In June 2012, we added a West Coast home with the purchase of the Forum in Inglewood, CA, which serves the Greater Los Angeles area. Following an extensive reinvention of the historic venue, on January 15, 2014, the Forum re-opened with the first of six concerts by the legendary Eagles and is once again a thriving destination for both artists and music fans.With both the Forum and The Garden, MSG now has an iconic arena in the country&#8217;s two largest entertainment markets. 

The Forum is the only arena-sized venue in the country dedicated to music and entertainment, and offers something exceptional for everyone. Architecturally, the interior of the bowl has been completely modernized and features superior acoustics, along with flexible seating that ranges from 7,000 &#32;seats to 17,800 &#32;seats. Fans seated on the floor have access to one of the largest general admission floors in the country, with approximately 8,000 &#32;square feet of event level hospitality offerings, including food and beverage, merchandise and restrooms. The Forum also offers exclusive spaces for VIP customers, including the historic Forum Club, and, for artists, delivers a first-class experience that includes nine , star-caliber dressing rooms with high-end amenities. Among the key features that were resurrected in an effort to replicate the original design is the exterior color of the venue, which was returned to the 1960&#8217;s &#8220;California sunset red,&#8221; and is now officially known as &#8220;Forum Red.&#8221; Other outdoor features include the addition of a distinct and iconic Forum marquee and a 40,000 square foot terrace that surrounds the perimeter of the building. 

The original Forum was designed by renowned architect, Charles Luckman, who also designed The Garden that opened in 1968. The historic West Coast venue, which opened in 1967, has played host to some of the greatest musical performers of all time, including The Rolling Stones, The Jackson 5, Bob Dylan, Led Zeppelin, Madonna, Van Halen, Foo Fighters, Coldplay, Prince and many others. In addition, the Forum was home to the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Kings until 1999. 

Since re-opening in 2014, the Forum has received several architectural awards recognizing its outstanding restoration. The venue&#8217;s impressive lineup of entertainers has included: the Eagles, Justin Timberlake, Paul Simon and Sting, Sam Smith, U2, Maroon 5, Stevie Wonder, Aerosmith, Steely Dan, Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Mumford &#38; Sons, Foo Fighters, The Weeknd, Dead &#38; Company, Rihanna and Kings of Leon as well as His Holiness the Dalai Lama. The Forum has also hosted a number of special events such as the MTV Video Music Awards and Nickelodeon&#8217;s Kids&#8217; Choice Awards, as well as select sporting events, which in 2016 included the venue&#8217;s first Ultimate Fighting Championships mixed martial arts fight and a World Middleweight Championship fight, which ended with Gennady Golovkin claiming his 22 nd &#32;consecutive knockout victory. The Forum is the third highest-grossing entertainment venue of its size in the nation, and the fifth highest-grossing in the world, based on Billboard Magazine&#8217;s 2016 mid-year rankings. 

The Chicago Theatre 

In October 2007, to provide us with an anchor for content and distribution in a key market in the Midwest, we purchased the legendary Chicago Theatre, a venue with approximately 3,600 &#32;seats. The Chicago Theatre, which features its famous six-story-high &#8220;C-H-I-C-A-G-O&#8221; marquee, was built in 1921 and designed in the French Baroque style by architects Cornelius W. Rapp and George L. Rapp. It is the oldest surviving example of this architectural style in Chicago today, and was designated a Chicago landmark building in 1983 by the Mayor of Chicago and the Chicago City Council. 

Today, The Chicago Theatre has become a highly attractive destination for concerts, comedy shows and other live events, hosting a wide range of entertainers, including Bob Dylan, Mumford &#38; Sons, David Byrne, Neil Young, Steve Winwood, Jerry Seinfeld, Janet Jackson, The National, Louis C.K., Death Cab for Cutie, Conan O&#8217;Brien, Aziz Ansari and Steely Dan. The venue has also hosted theatrical tours such as A Christmas Story and Dr. Seuss&#8217; How The Grinch Stole Christmas! . The Chicago Theatre is ranked the 10 th &#32;highest-grossing entertainment venue of its size in the world, based on Billboard Magazine&#8217;s 2016 mid-year rankings. 

Wang Theatre 

Since August 2008, we have had a booking agreement with respect to the historic Wang Theatre in Boston. Under the booking agreement, we have been utilizing our diverse relationships and experience in event production and entertainment marketing to maximize the quantity and diversity of performances staged at the Wang Theatre. These performances have included theatrical productions and family shows such as the Tony award-winning &#32;Annie the Musical , Irving Berlin&#8217;s &#32;White Christmas the Musical, A Christmas Story , and &#32;Elf The Musical. The Wang Theatre has also welcomed a variety of concerts, including multi-night runs by Steely Dan, Sting, Neil Young, Eddie Izzard, Jerry Seinfeld, Steve Martin and Furthur and performances from Jason Mraz, Leonard Cohen, Ringo Starr, Wilco, Tegan and Sara, John Legend and The Shins. The Wang Theatre seats approximately 3,600. 

Our booking agreement expires in 2019 . We have the option to renew the agreement for an additional 10 &#32;years by providing two &#32;years&#8217; notice prior to the initial expiration date.

Our Company has a close association with The Garden of Dreams Foundation (the &#8220;Foundation&#8221;), a 501(c)(3) non-profit charity that is dedicated to making dreams come true for children facing obstacles. The Foundation works with 25 &#32;partner organizations throughout the tri-state area, including hospitals, wish organizations and community-based organizations, to reach children who are facing challenges such as homelessness, extreme poverty, illness and foster care.

Regulation &#32; 

Our sports and entertainment businesses are subject to legislation governing the sale and resale of tickets and consumer protection statutes generally. 

In addition, many of the events produced or promoted by our sports and entertainment businesses are presented in our venues which are, like all public spaces, subject to building and health codes and fire regulations imposed by the state and local governments in the jurisdictions in which our venues are located. These venues are also subject to zoning and outdoor advertising regulations, and, with respect to Radio City Music Hall and Beacon Theatre, landmark regulations which restrict us from making certain modifications to our facilities as of right or from operating certain types of businesses. These venues also require a number of licenses in order for us to operate, including occupancy permits, exhibition licenses, food and beverage permits, liquor licenses and other authorizations. In addition, our venues are subject to the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires us to maintain certain accessibility features at each of our facilities. See &#8220; Item 1A. &#32; Risk Factors &#32;&#8212; General Risks &#32;&#8212; We Are Subject to Extensive Governmental Regulation and Our Failure to Comply with These Regulations May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations. &#8221; 

The professional sports leagues in which we operate, primarily the NBA and NHL, claim the right under certain circumstances to regulate important aspects of our sports business and our team-related online and mobile businesses. See &#8220;&#8212; Our Business &#32;&#8212; MSG Sports &#32;&#8212; The Role of the Leagues in Our Operations .&#8221; 

Our sports and entertainment businesses are also subject to certain regulations applicable to our Internet web sites and mobile applications. We maintain various web sites and mobile applications that provide information and content regarding our businesses, offer merchandise and tickets for sale and make available sweepstakes and/or contests. The operation of these web sites and applications may be subject to a range of federal, state and local laws such as privacy, accessibility for persons with disabilities and consumer protection regulations. In addition, to the extent any of our web sites collect information from children under 13 years of age or are intended primarily for children under 12 years of age, we must comply with certain limits on commercial matter. 

Competition 

Competition in Our Sports Business 

Our sports business operates in a market in which numerous sports and entertainment opportunities are available. In addition to the NBA, NHL, WNBA and NBADL teams that we own and operate, the New York City metropolitan area is home to two Major League Baseball teams (the New York Yankees (the &#8220; Yankees &#8221;) and the New York Mets (the &#8220; Mets &#8221;)), two National Football League teams (the New York Giants (the &#8220; Giants &#8221;) and the New York Jets (the &#8220; Jets &#8221;)), two additional NHL teams (the New York Islanders (the &#8220; Islanders &#8221;) and the New Jersey Devils (the &#8220; Devils &#8221;)), a second NBA team (the Brooklyn Nets (the &#8220; Nets &#8221;) and two Major League Soccer franchises (the New York Red Bulls and the New York City Football Club). In addition, there are a number of other amateur and professional teams that compete in other sports, including at the collegiate and minor league levels. New York is also home to the U.S. Open tennis event each summer, as well as many other non-sports related entertainment options. 

As a result of the large number of options available, we face strong competition for the New York area sports fan. We must compete with these other sporting events in varying respects and degrees, including on the basis of the quality of the teams we field, their success in the leagues in which they compete, our ability to provide an entertaining environment at our games and the prices we charge for our tickets. In addition, for fans who prefer the unique experience of NHL hockey, we must compete with the Islanders and Devils as well as, in varying respects and degrees, with other NHL hockey teams and the NHL itself. Similarly, for those fans attracted to the equally unique experience of NBA basketball, we must compete with the Nets as well as, in varying respects and degrees, with other NBA teams and the NBA itself. In addition, we also compete to varying degrees with other productions and live entertainment events for advertising and sponsorship dollars. 

The amount of revenue we earn is influenced by many factors, including the popularity and on-court or on-ice performance of our professional sports teams and general economic conditions. In particular, when our teams have strong on-court and on-ice 

performance, we benefit from increased demand for tickets, potentially greater food and merchandise sales from increased attendance and increased sponsorship opportunities. When our teams make the playoffs, we also benefit from the attendance and in-game spending at the playoff games. The year-to-year impact of team performance is somewhat moderated by the fact that a significant portion of our revenues derive from rights fees, suite rental fees and sponsorship and signage revenue, all of which are generally contracted on a multi-year basis. Nevertheless, the long-term performance of our business is tied to the success and popularity of our teams and our ability to attract other compelling sports content. 

See &#8220; Item 1A. &#32; Risk Factors &#32;&#8212; Risks Relating to Our Sports Business &#32;&#8212; Our Sports Business Faces Intense and Wide-Ranging Competition, Which May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations. &#8221; 

Competition in Our Entertainment Business 

Our entertainment business competes, in certain respects and to varying degrees, with other live performances, sporting events, movies, home entertainment (including the Internet and online services, television, video and gaming devices) and the large number of other entertainment and public attraction options available to members of the public. Our businesses typically represent alternative uses for the public&#8217;s entertainment dollars. The primary geographic area in which we operate, New York City, is among the most competitive entertainment markets in the world, with the world&#8217;s largest live theater industry and extensive performing arts venues, twelve major professional sports teams, numerous museums, galleries and other attractions, and numerous movie theaters available to the public. Our venues outside of New York City similarly compete with other entertainment options in their respective markets and elsewhere. We compete with these other entertainment options on the basis of the quality of our productions and the public&#8217;s interest in our content, as well as on the price of our tickets and the quality and location of our venues. 

We compete for bookings with a large number of other venues both in the cities in which our venues are located and in alternative locations capable of booking the same productions and events. Generally, we compete for bookings on the basis of the size, quality, expense and nature of the venue required for the booking. 

In addition to competition for ticket sales and bookings, we also compete to varying degrees with other productions and sporting events for advertising and sponsorship dollars.

Employees 

As of June 30, 2016 &#32;we had approximately 1,400 &#32;full-time union and non-union employees and 7,500 &#32;part-time union and non-union employees. Approximately 67% &#32;of our employees were represented by unions as of June 30, 2016 . Labor relations in general and in the sports and entertainment industry in particular can be volatile, though our current relationships with our unions taken as a whole are positive. We have from time to time faced labor action or had to make contingency plans because of threatened or potential labor actions. 

The NHL players and the NBA players are covered by CBAs between the NHL Players&#8217; Association (&#8220; NHLPA &#8221;) and the NHL and between the National Basketball Players Association (&#8220; NBPA &#8221;) and the NBA, respectively. Both the NHL and the NBA have experienced labor difficulties in the past and may have labor issues in the future. On June 30, 2011 the prior CBA between the NBA and NBPA expired and there was a work stoppage for approximately five months until a new CBA was entered into in December 2011. On September 15, 2012 the prior CBA between the NHL and NHLPA expired and there was a work stoppage for approximately four months until a new CBA was entered into in January 2013.
