 Item 1. Business 

Tillys is a leading destination specialty retailer of West Coast inspired casual apparel, footwear and accessories for young men, young women, boys and girls. We believe we bring together an unparalleled selection of the most sought-after brands rooted in action sports, music, art and fashion inherent in the West Coast lifestyle. Our stores and website are designed to be a seamless extension of our teen and young adult consumers' lifestyles in a stimulating environment. Tillys is headquartered in Irvine, California and we operated 224 stores in 32 states as of January 30, 2016 . Our stores are located in malls, lifestyle centers, &#8216;power&#8217; centers, community centers, outlet centers and street-front locations. Customers may also shop online, where we feature the same assortment of products as is carried in our brick-and-mortar stores, supplemented by additional online-only styles. We believe our success across a variety of real estate venues and geographies in the United States demonstrates Tillys' portability. Our goal is to serve as a destination for the latest, most relevant merchandise and brands important to our customers. 

The Tillys concept began in 1982 when our co-founders, Hezy Shaked and Tilly Levine, opened their first store in Orange County, California. Since 1984 the business has been conducted through World of Jeans &#38; Tops, a California corporation, or &#8220;WOJT&#8221;, which operates under the name &#8220;Tillys&#8221;. In May 2011, Tilly&#8217;s, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed solely for the purpose of reorganizing the corporate structure of WOJT in preparation for an initial public offering. 

On May 2, 2012, the shareholders of WOJT contributed all of their equity interests in WOJT to Tilly&#8217;s, Inc. in exchange for shares of Tilly&#8217;s, Inc. Class B common stock on a one-for-one basis. In addition, WOJT terminated its &#8220;S&#8221; Corporation status and became a &#8220;C&#8221; Corporation. These events are collectively referred to as the &#8220;Reorganization Transaction&#8221;. As a result of the Reorganization Transaction, WOJT became a wholly owned subsidiary of Tilly&#8217;s, Inc. Except where the context otherwise requires or where otherwise indicated, the terms "the Company", "World of Jeans and Tops", "WOJT", "we", "our", "us" and "Tillys" refer to WOJT before the Reorganization Transaction (as defined above), and to Tilly's, Inc. and its subsidiary after the Reorganization Transaction. 

Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. For example, "fiscal 2015" refers to the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016 "fiscal 2016" refers to the fiscal year ending January 28, 2017 and "fiscal 2014" refers to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. 

Our Strengths 

We believe that the following competitive strengths contribute to our success and distinguish us from our competitors: 

&#8226; 

Destination retailer with a broad and differentiated assortment. &#32;We believe the combined depth and breadth of apparel, footwear and accessories offered at our stores exceeds the selection offered at many other specialty retailers. We offer an extensive selection of third-party, West Coast inspired lifestyle brands, which are complemented by our proprietary brands. Our merchandise includes a wide assortment of brands, styles, colors, sizes and price points to ensure we have what our customers want every time they visit our stores. We offer a balanced mix of merchandise across the apparel, footwear and accessories categories serving young men, young women, boys and girls. We believe that by combining proven and emerging fashion trends and core style products with a vibrant blend of carefully selected music and visuals, we provide an in-store experience that is authentic, fun, and engaging for our core customers. We believe that our differentiated in-store environment, evolving selection of relevant brands, and broader and deeper assortment positions us as a retail destination that appeals to a larger demographic than many other specialty retailers and encourages customers to visit our stores more frequently and spend more on each trip. 

&#8226; 

Dynamic merchandise model. &#32;We believe our extensive selection of third-party and proprietary merchandise allows us to identify and address trends more quickly, offer a greater range of price points and manage our inventories more dynamically. By closely monitoring trends and shipping product to our stores multiple times per week, we are able to adjust our merchandise mix based on store size and location. We also keep our merchandise mix relevant by introducing emerging brands not available at many other retailers. Our merchandising capabilities enable us to adjust our merchandise mix with a frequency that promotes a current look to our stores and website and encourages frequent visits. 

&#8226; 

Flexible real estate strategy across real estate venues and geographies. &#32;Our stores have proven to be successful in different real estate venues and geographies. We operate stores in malls, power centers, neighborhood and lifestyle centers, outlet centers and street-front locations across 85 markets in 32 states. We believe our success operating in these different retail venues and geographies demonstrates the portability of the Tillys brand. 

&#8226; 

Multi-pronged marketing approach . We utilize a multi-pronged marketing strategy to connect with our customers to drive traffic for our stores and online platform. We distribute catalogs to potential and existing customers from our proprietary 

database to familiarize them with the Tillys brand and our products and to drive sales to our stores and website. We offer an integrated digital platform, including our mobile and tablet applications, for our customers to shop how and when they like and to drive further connection with them. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we upgraded our mobile application to enhance our customer experience and engagement. We partner and collaborate with our vendors on exclusive events and contests to build credibility with our target customers, actively involve them in our brands, and enhance the connection between Tillys and the West Coast inspired lifestyle. We use social media to communicate directly with our customers while also encouraging customers to interact with one another and provide feedback on our events and products. In fiscal 2014, we implemented a customer loyalty program to further engage with our customers, build customer loyalty and gain customer insights. All of these programs are complemented by digital and email marketing as well as traditional radio and print advertising to build customer awareness and loyalty, highlight key merchandise offerings, drive traffic to our stores and online platform and promote the Tillys brand. Also, through our &#8220;We Care Program&#8221;, we support and participate in various academic, art, and athletic programs at local schools and other organizations in communities surrounding our stores. 

&#8226; 

Systems and distribution/fulfillment infrastructure to support growth. &#32;We have previously made investments in distribution, fulfillment and allocation infrastructure that we believe are adequate to support continued growth for several years. Our distribution center allows us to quickly sort and process merchandise and deliver it to our stores in a floor-ready format for immediate display. During the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we opened a new e-commerce fulfillment center that continues to provide us with a more efficient and expeditious fulfillment process to support our future growth. Our systems enable us to respond to changing fashion trends, manage inventory in real time and provide a customized selection of merchandise at each location. We believe our distribution and fulfillment infrastructure can support significant growth in our stores and e-commerce platform with minimal incremental capital investment. 

&#8226; 

Experienced management team. &#32;Our senior management team, led by Hezy Shaked and Edmond Thomas, has extensive experience across a wide range of disciplines in the specialty retail and direct-to-consumer industries, including store operations, merchandising, distribution, real estate, and finance. Mr. Shaked, our Co-Founder, Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Chief Strategy Officer, plays an important role in developing our long-term growth initiatives and cultivating our unique culture. Mr. Thomas, our President and Chief Executive Officer, rejoined Tillys in October 2015 with over 30 years of retail experience. He previously served as our President and Co-Chief Executive Officer from September 2005 to October 2007. 

Growth Strategy 

We are pursuing several strategies to drive long-term sales and profitability, including: 

&#8226; 

Drive Comparable Store Sales. &#32;We seek to maximize our comparable store sales by consistently offering new, on-trend and relevant merchandise, including exclusive and proprietary branded merchandise, across a broad assortment of categories, increasing our brand awareness through our multi-pronged marketing approach, providing an authentic store and online experience for our core customers, and maintaining a high level of customer service. We believe the combination of these factors, together with the operating strategies described below, will improve our comparable store sales results over time. 

&#8226; 

Increase Our Operating Margins. &#32;We believe we have the opportunity to drive operating margin expansion through scale efficiencies and continued process improvements. We believe comparable store sales increases will permit us to take advantage of largely fixed occupancy costs, favorable buying costs from larger volume purchases, leverage of our costs for store management and corporate overhead, as well as the fixed portion of shipping and handling costs over higher sales volumes. In addition, we expect to improve operating margins and support growth by leveraging previous investments in infrastructure, including our dedicated fulfillment center for e-commerce, upgraded e-commerce platform, ongoing investments to upgrade our point-of-sale, merchandise allocation and merchandise planning systems. We also will continue to use established business processes to identify and execute initiatives focused on lowering our unit costs and improving operational efficiency throughout our organization. 

&#8226; 

Continue Growing E-Commerce. &#32;We believe our e-commerce platform is an extension of our brand and retail stores, providing our customers a seamless shopping experience. Our e-commerce platform allows us to provide our customers with extensions of the same assortment offered in our brick-and-mortar stores, reach new customers, and build our brand in markets where we currently do not have stores. For example, during fiscal 2015, we generated e-commerce sales in all 50 states although we have physical stores in only 32 states. Our target customer regularly shops online and via mobile devices in addition to visiting stores, giving us a continued opportunity to grow our e-commerce platform over time. Key factors we expect to drive growth include continuing our catalog, online and mobile application marketing efforts, enhancing the efficiency and responsiveness of our digital capabilities, and supplementing the assortment available in our brick-and-mortar stores with additional online-only styles. We also expect to expand marketing efforts and build brand 

awareness in the communities surrounding our existing stores to drive growth in both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce sales. 

&#8226; 

Improve Inventory Management. We believe we can improve our operating results through improved micro-merchandising based on specific store characteristics. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we compiled individual store profiles for every store to highlight the differences in brand performance, gender penetrations, and customer interests that exist within our fleet of stores. By adapting allocation strategies to capitalize on these individual store differences, we believe we can improve sales results in our existing store base. We expect to achieve improvements in our allocation methodologies without requiring significant additional capital expenditures for new systems. 

&#8226; 

Develop Omni-Channel Capabilities. We currently have a direct-to-consumer program that allows online orders to be fulfilled and shipped direct to our customers from our brick-and-mortar stores. We believe we can further improve our sales results by developing additional omni-channel capabilities that will allow for online orders to be picked up in stores, both from satisfying the order from existing inventories within our stores as well as shipping product from our e-commerce fulfillment center to our stores. We believe these omni-channel initiatives will drive additional traffic to our stores and increase sales to customers who come to the store to pick up their online orders. 

&#8226; 

Remodel Existing Stores. We believe that re-investing in our existing stores is strategically important to enhance customer loyalty, elevate the customer experience and, in turn, drive additional comparable store sales. We began remodeling certain of our older, high-volume stores within our heritage markets of California, Arizona and Nevada during fiscal 2014. We expect to continue remodeling a number of our existing, high-volume stores during fiscal 2016 to continue improving our customers' in-store experience. 

Merchandising, Purchasing, and Planning and Allocation 

Merchandising 

We seek to be viewed by our customers as the destination for West Coast inspired apparel, footwear and accessories. We believe we offer an unparalleled selection of relevant brands, styles, colors, sizes and price points to ensure we have what our customers want every time they visit our stores. Our extensive selection of third-party and proprietary merchandise allows us to identify and address trends more quickly, offer a greater range of price points and manage our inventories more dynamically. We offer a balanced mix of merchandise for young men, young women, boys and girls across the apparel, footwear and accessories categories. We believe this category mix contributes to our broad demographic appeal. Our apparel merchandise includes branded, fashion and core styles for tops, outerwear, bottoms, and dresses. Accessories merchandise includes backpacks, hats, sunglasses, headphones, handbags, watches, jewelry and more. We focus on our merchandise presentation and vary the visual displays in our stores and windows throughout the month, presenting new looks and fashion combinations to our customers. 

Our ability to maintain an image consistent with the West Coast inspired lifestyle is important to our branded vendors and provides us better access to a wide assortment of products and styles. Our third-party branded merchandise includes both established and emerging brands. We strive to keep our merchandise mix current by continuously introducing emerging brands and styles not available at many other specialty retailers in order to identify and respond to the evolving desires of our customers. Our third-party brands represented approximately 72% of our net sales in each of the last three fiscal years with no single third-party brand exceeding 5% of total net sales. 

Selected third-party brands include, in alphabetical order: 

&#8226; AYC 

&#8226; Adidas 

&#8226; Billabong 

&#8226; Converse 

&#8226; G-Shock

&#8226; UGG 

&#8226; Vans 

&#8226; Volcom 

&#8226; Young &#38; Reckless 

&#160;...and many more 

We supplement our third-party merchandise assortment with our own proprietary brands across many of our apparel, accessory and footwear product categories. We utilize our own branded merchandise to expand our price point range, identify and respond to changing fashion trends quickly, fill merchandise gaps and provide a deeper selection of styles and colors for proven fashion items. Our proprietary brands represented approximately 28% of our net sales in each of the last three fiscal years. 

Examples of our proprietary branded merchandise include: 

Brand 

&#160; 

Category 

&#160; 

Denim, apparel and fragrance brand for young men, young women and boys 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Apparel, footwear and accessories brand for young women and girls 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Apparel and accessories brand for young men and boys 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Apparel and fragrance brand for young men, young women and boys 

We believe that our extensive selection of merchandise, from established and emerging third-party brands as well as our proprietary brands, caters to a wide demographic of core customers and enhances our store image as a destination that carries the most sought-after apparel, footwear and accessories. 

Merchandise Purchasing 

Our merchandising team is organized by category and product type under our Chief Merchandising Officer and includes divisional merchandise managers, a technical design and fashion trend team, buyers, associate buyers and assistant buyers. We believe a key element of our success is our team&#8217;s ability to identify and source the latest proven fashion trends and core styles that are most relevant to our customers. 

Our purchasing approach focuses on product relevance, quality, fit, availability, cost and speed of production in order to provide timely frequent delivery of merchandise to our stores. Our purchasing group and planning and allocation team are highly coordinated and maintain a disciplined buying strategy. 

To ensure a relevant assortment, our teams: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

perform comprehensive analysis of sales trends from our stores and e-commerce site; 

&#8226; 

gather feedback from our customers and our staff; 

&#8226; 

maintain regular dialogue with our existing vendor network and potential new vendors; 

&#8226; 

utilize trend and color forecasting services; 

&#8226; 

participate in trade shows and action sport related events; 

&#8226; 

review trade publications; and 

&#8226; 

evaluate merchandise assortments offered by other retail and online merchants. 

We have developed and maintain strong and, in many cases, long-standing relationships with our third-party vendors and we have a history of identifying and growing with emerging brands. We believe the Tillys brand, shopping experience and core customer lifestyle is highly consistent with the image and philosophy of our key vendors. This, in addition to our customer connectivity, facilitates a partnership culture with our key vendors and provides us access to an extensive variety of products and styles, as well as certain merchandise that is exclusive to our stores and website. Our merchandise purchasing group also works closely with independent third parties who design and procure merchandise for our proprietary brands. Our proprietary brand capabilities enhance our ability to rapidly identify and respond to trends and consistently offer proven fashion items that provide a broader demographic appeal. We work with more than 100 vendors based in the United States to supply us with our proprietary branded product. These vendors source from both domestic and international markets and either have their own factories or contract with owners of factories to source finished product. By sourcing merchandise for our proprietary brands both domestically and internationally, we have the flexibility to benefit from shorter lead times associated with domestic manufacturing and lower costs associated with international manufacturing. 

Planning and Allocation 

We have developed inventory planning and allocation processes to support our merchandising strategies. Working closely with our merchandise purchasing team, the planning and allocation team utilizes a disciplined approach to buying, forecasting, inventory control and allocation processes. Our planning and allocation team continually analyzes information from our management information system, including inventory levels and sell-through data, to regularly adjust the assortment at each store and the inventory levels for our company as a whole. Our broad third-party vendor base allows us to shift merchandise 

purchases to react quickly to changing consumer preferences and market conditions. Furthermore, the vendor base for our proprietary products provides us flexibility to develop our own branded products to quickly address emerging fashion trends and provide a deeper selection of styles, colors, and price points for proven fashion items. We modify our merchandising mix based upon store size, the season, and consumer preferences in different parts of the country. We are also able to react quickly to changing customer needs due to our shipment of merchandise to our stores multiple times per week. Finally, we coordinate closely with our visual merchandise managers and marketing group in order to manage inventory levels in connection with our promotions and seasonality. 

Stores 

As of January 30, 2016, we operated 224 stores in 32 states with an average size of approximately 7,600 square feet. Our stores are located in mall, off-mall and outlet locations. Our stores generated average net sales of $2.2 million, or $290 per square foot in fiscal 2015.

Distinctive Store Experience 

Tillys is a customer-driven lifestyle brand. We are energized and inspired by our customers&#8217; individuality and passion for the West Coast lifestyle, action sports, music, art, and fashion. Our stores bring these interests together in a vibrant, stimulating and authentic environment that is an extension of our customers&#8217; high velocity, multi-tasking lifestyle. We do this by blending the most relevant brands and styles with music videos, product-related visuals and a dedicated team of store associates. Our associates share the same passion as our customers for action sports, music, art and fashion, enabling them to easily engage with our customers and make shopping at Tillys a fun, social experience. Outside of our stores, we connect with our consumers using the same authentic approach, including social media, community outreach and sponsorship of contests, demos, and other events. We believe the Tillys experience drives customer awareness, loyalty and repeat visits while generating a buzz and excitement for our brand. 

Store Expansion Opportunities and Site Selection 

As of January 30, 2016, nearly half of our stores had been opened within the previous five years. The following table shows the number of stores opened and closed in each of our last five fiscal years:

Declining traffic has been a challenge for the teen retail industry in recent years. We believe this decline in traffic has contributed to declining sales in our stores and hindered the rate of growth for some of our newer stores. Consequently, we expect to slow our pace of new store growth in the near term compared to recent years. However, we will be opportunistic and selective about additional new store opportunities. Our new store openings are planned in both existing and new markets and in both mall and off-mall locations. We focus on potential locations that have above average incomes and an ability to draw from a sufficient population with attractive demographics. We have entered new markets by opening stores in high traffic malls as well as off-mall locations that effectively cover trade areas where our customers want to shop. 

Store Management, Culture and Training 

We believe that a key to our success is our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate qualified employees at all levels of our organization. Each of our stores typically operates with a three to five member store management team. In addition, each store has 10 or more full time equivalent store associates who represent the West Coast lifestyle and promote the Tillys brand not only inside the store, but also in their schools and communities. The number of store associates we employ generally increases during peak selling seasons, particularly the back-to-school and the winter holiday seasons, and will increase to the extent that we open new stores. 

We have developed a corporate culture that we believe empowers the individual store managers to make store-level business decisions and we reward them when they exceed sales targets. We are committed to improving the skills and careers of our workforce and providing advancement opportunities for employees. We evaluate our store associates weekly on measures such as sales per hour, units per transaction and dollars per transaction to ensure productivity, to recognize top performers and to identify potential training opportunities. We endeavor to design incentive programs for store associates that promote a competitive, yet fun, culture that is consistent with our image. 

We provide our managers with the knowledge and tools to succeed through comprehensive training programs, focusing on both operational expertise and supervisory skills. Our training programs and workshops are offered at the store, district and regional levels, allowing managers from multiple locations to interact with each other and exchange ideas to better operate stores. Store associates receive training from their managers to improve their product expertise and selling skills. 

E-Commerce 

In October 2014, we launched a new responsive design e-commerce platform for desktop and mobile designed to enhance the online customer experience. Our e-commerce platform was established in 2004 and has grown significantly since inception. In May 2014, we opened our new e-commerce fulfillment center in Irvine, California to accommodate significant additional growth. We believe our digital platform is an extension of our brand and retail stores, providing our customers a seamless shopping experience. We believe that our target customer regularly shops online through various digital channels in addition to visiting stores. Our website serves both as a sales channel and a marketing tool to our extended customer base, including those customers in markets where we do not currently have stores. In both fiscal 2015 and 2014, we sold merchandise to customers in all 50 states even though we have brick-and-mortar stores in only 32 states. We also believe our fully integrated digital platform reinforces the Tillys brand image and serves as an effective advertising vehicle for our retail stores. Our digital platform provides the same assortment available in our brick-and-mortar stores, supplemented by additional online-only styles. Similar to the merchandising approach in our stores, we frequently change the look of our website to highlight new brands and products and to encourage frequent visits. We utilize multiple tools to drive traffic online, including our catalog, marketing 

materials in our retail stores, search engine marketing, internet ad placement, shopping site partnerships, third-party affiliations, email marketing, digital marketing and direct mail. In addition, we utilize the website to offer current information on our upcoming events, promotions and store locations. 

Marketing and Advertising 

Our marketing approach is designed to create an authentic connection with our customers by consistently generating a buzz and excitement for our brand while staying true to our West Coast inspired heritage. We utilize a multi-pronged marketing strategy to connect with our customers and drive traffic to our stores and online platform, comprised of the following: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Catalog. &#32;We view our catalog in both print and digital format primarily as a sales and marketing tool to drive online and store traffic from both existing and new customers. We also believe our catalog reinforces the Tillys brand and showcases our comprehensive selection of products in settings designed to reflect our brand&#8217;s lifestyle image. We send these catalogs, which include coupons that can be redeemed at stores or online, to the customers in our database several times a year, primarily around key shopping periods such as spring break, back-to-school, and the winter holidays. 

&#8226; 

Brand Partnerships. &#32;We partner and collaborate with our vendors for exclusive events such as autograph signings, in-store performances, contests, demos, giveaways, shopping sprees and VIP trips. In fiscal 2015, we organized a variety of events, many involving musicians, celebrities and athletes in the entertainment, music and action sports industries. Through brand partnerships such as these, we are able to connect with and engage our customers in an exciting, authentic experience. 

&#8226; 

Social Media. &#32;We believe our core customers rely heavily on the opinions of their peers, often expressed through social media. Therefore, we use our website blog, as well as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat posts, as a viral marketing platform to communicate directly with our customers while also allowing customers to interact with one another and provide feedback on our events and products. 

&#8226; 

Loyalty Program. &#32;In January 2014, we launched a customer loyalty program designed to interact with our customers in a more direct and targeted manner, and to provide more insight into their shopping behaviors and preferences. The loyalty program is free to join and provides points to customers in exchange for purchases at our stores and online, and for interactions with us such as checking into Tillys events. We plan to rebrand and relaunch our loyalty program during fiscal 2016 to provide more meaningful rewards to our most loyal customers. 

&#8226; 

Community Outreach. &#32;Through our &#8220;We Care Program&#8221; and in partnership with our vendors, we support and participate in various academic, art, and athletic programs at local schools and other organizations in communities surrounding our stores. We also support Tilly&#8217;s Life Center, founded by our co-founder, Tilly Levine, which provides underprivileged youth a healthy and caring environment to help create a well-defined sense of self, cultivate community mindedness and release negative emotional stress. 

&#8226; 

Radio, Print and Email Marketing. &#32;We utilize traditional radio and print advertising as well as email marketing to build awareness, drive traffic to our stores and online platform and to promote local in-store promotions and events. We periodically send emails to the customers in our proprietary database to introduce new brands and products, offer promotions on select merchandise, highlight key events and announce new store openings. 

Distribution 

We distribute all of our store merchandise through a 126,000 square foot distribution facility co-located with our headquarters in Irvine, California. Our lease expires in December 2017 and we have two five-year renewal option periods. We designed this facility to allow us to manage our distribution operations in an efficient, cost-effective manner and to provide support for our growth initiatives. Extensive investments have been made to the distribution-center infrastructure, focused around systems automation, material-handling equipment, radio frequency technologies, and automated sortation in order to further enhance our processing speed and long term scalability. We believe the automation systems we utilize in our facility allow us to operate at a higher level of efficiency and accuracy than many of our competitors. 

In May 2014, we opened our new e-commerce fulfillment center in Irvine, California. We have invested a total of approximately $18 million in the e-commerce fulfillment center to handle all e-commerce orders in a highly automated environment that leverages material handling equipment, automated systems and other technologies consistent with our current distribution facility. This investment will support our future e-commerce growth initiatives. 

We ship merchandise to our stores multiple times per week, providing them with a steady flow of both new and replenishment products. Merchandise is shipped in a floor-ready format (carrying price tickets, sensor tags and with hangers where appropriate) which allows store employees to spend less time processing the merchandise and more time with our customers. 

We use our own fleet of trucks to ship merchandise to our Southern California stores and third-party distributors to ship merchandise to stores outside our local area. 

We believe our distribution and fulfillment infrastructure can support significant growth of our e-commerce platform and increases in our number of stores with minimal incremental capital investment. 

Management Information Systems 

Our management information systems provide a full range of business process support and information to our store, merchandising, financial, real estate and other business teams. We selected, customized and integrated our information systems to enable and support our dynamic merchandise model. We believe our systems provide us with improved operational efficiencies, scalability, management control and timely reporting that allow us to identify and quickly respond to trends in our business. We believe that our information systems are scalable, flexible and have the capacity to accommodate our current growth plans. 

We have made significant investments in our management information systems over the last several years. We use software licensed from JDA Software Group, Inc. for allocation, SKU classification, inventory tracking, purchase order management and sales audit functions. We utilize MicroStrategy Incorporated for business intelligence. We utilize Manhattan Associates Inc.&#8217;s warehouse management systems to handle merchandise distribution. We utilize technology from Strategic Distribution, Inc. in our distribution and new fulfillment centers enabling us to automate our merchandise sortation and fulfillment processes, allowing us greater flexibility in scaling our operations for new store expansions and peak season operations. Our financial systems are licensed from Lawson and our payroll system uses a third-party platform provided by Automatic Data Processing, Inc. 

We update our sales daily in our merchandising reporting systems by collecting sales information from each store&#8217;s point-of-sale, or POS, terminals utilizing software from Oracle, Inc. Our POS system consists of registers providing processing of retail transactions, price look-up, time and attendance and e-mail. Sales information, inventory tracking and payroll hours are uploaded to our central host system. The host system downloads price changes, performs system maintenance and provides software updates to the stores through automated nightly two-way electronic communication with each store. We evaluate information obtained through nightly polling to implement merchandising decisions, including product purchasing/reorders, markdowns and allocation of merchandise on a daily basis. 

Competition 

The teenage and young adult retail apparel, accessories and footwear industry is highly competitive. We compete with other retailers for customers, store locations, store associates and management personnel. We currently compete with other teenage-focused retailers such as, but not limited to, Abercrombie &#38; Fitch Co., Aeropostale, Inc., American Eagle Outfitters, Inc., The Buckle, Inc., Forever 21, Inc., Hot Topic, Inc., Pacific Sunwear of California, Inc., Urban Outfitters, Inc., and Zumiez, Inc. In addition, we compete with independent specialty shops, department stores and direct marketers that sell similar lines of merchandise and target customers through catalogs and e-commerce. Further, we may face new competitors and increased competition from existing competitors as we expand into new markets and increase our presence in existing markets. Given the extensive number and types of retailers with which Tillys competes for customers, we believe that our target market is highly fragmented and we do not believe we have a significant share of this market. 

Competition in our sector is based, among other things, upon merchandise offerings, store location, price and the ability to identify with the customer. We believe that we compete favorably with many of our competitors based on our differentiated merchandising strategy, store environment, flexible real estate strategy and company culture. However, many of our competitors are larger, have significantly more stores, and have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. Moreover, we recognize that we do not possess exclusive rights to many of the elements that comprise our in-store experience and product offerings. Our competitors can emulate facets of our business strategy and in-store experience, which could result in a reduction of any competitive advantage or special appeal that we might possess. See Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business. We face intense competition in our industry and we may not be able to compete effectively.&#8221; 

Trademarks 

&#8220;Ambitious&#8221;, &#8220;Blue Crown&#8221;, &#8220;Division 7&#8221;, &#8220;Eldon&#8221;, &#8220;Full Tilt&#8221;, &#8220;Full Tilt Sport&#8221;, &#8220;If it&#8217;s not here...it&#8217;s not happening&#8221;, &#8220;Infamous&#8221;, &#8220;RSQ&#8221;, &#8220;Tilly's&#8221;, &#8220;Vindicated&#8221;, "Destined" and logos related to some of these names, are among our trademarks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We regard our trademarks as valuable and intend to maintain such marks and any related registrations. We are not aware of any claims of infringement or other challenges to our right to use our marks in the United States. We vigorously protect our trademarks. 

Employees 

As of January 30, 2016, we employed approximately 1,400 full-time and approximately 3,500 part-time employees, of which approximately 500 were employed at our corporate office and distribution facility and approximately 4,400 were employed at our store locations. However, the number of total employees, especially part-time employees, fluctuates depending upon our seasonal needs and, in fiscal year 2015, varied between approximately 4,600 and 7,100 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 

Government Regulation 

We are subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising and promotions, privacy laws, safety regulations, consumer protection regulations and other laws that regulate retailers and govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of stores and warehouse facilities. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws. 

Insurance 

We use insurance for a number of risk management activities, including workers&#8217; compensation, general liability, automobile liability and employee-related health care benefits, a portion of which is paid by the employees. We evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis to maintain adequate levels of coverage. 

Seasonality 

Due to the seasonal nature of the retail industry, we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our revenues and net income. Net revenues are typically smallest in the first quarter of a given fiscal year followed by sequentially increased net revenues in each succeeding quarter within a fiscal year. Our net sales fluctuate significantly in relation to various holidays and other peak shopping periods, including but not limited to the Thanksgiving and year-end holiday season, the back-to-school season, spring break periods, and other holidays. If, for any reason, our revenues were below seasonal norms or expectations during these quarters, particularly during peak selling periods, our annual results of operations could be adversely affected. The level of our working capital reflects the seasonality of our business. We expect inventory levels, along with an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, generally to reach their highest levels in anticipation of the increased revenues during these periods.
