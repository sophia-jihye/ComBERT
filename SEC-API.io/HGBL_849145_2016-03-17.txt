 Item 1. Business.

Overview, History and Recent Developments

Heritage Global Inc. (&#8220;HGI,&#8221; &#8220;we&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated in Florida in 1983 under the name &#8220;MedCross, Inc.&#8221; The Company&#8217;s name was changed to &#8220;I-Link Incorporated&#8221; in 1997, to &#8220;Acceris Communications Inc.&#8221; in 2003, to &#8220;C2 Global Technologies Inc.&#8221; in 2005, to &#8220;Counsel RB Capital Inc.&#8221; in 2011, and to Heritage Global Inc. effective August 22, 2013. The most recent name change more closely identifies the Company with its core auction business, Heritage Global Partners, Inc. (&#8220;HGP&#8221;).

On March 20, 2014, the Company&#8217;s former majority shareholder, Street Capital Group Inc. (formerly Counsel Corporation, herein referred to as &#8220;Street Capital&#8221;), declared a dividend of all of its shares of the Company. This dividend was paid on April 30, 2014 to Street Capital&#8217;s common shareholders of record as of April 1, 2014.

On June 2, 2014, and effective May 31, 2014, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock in National Loan Exchange, Inc. (&#8220;NLEX&#8221;), a broker of charged-off receivables in the United States and Canada. NLEX operates as a wholly owned division of the Company. The acquisition of NLEX is consistent with HGI&#8217;s strategy to expand the services provided by its asset liquidation business. In connection with the acquisition, HGI entered into employment agreements with the previous owner and key employees of NLEX. The purchase price consisted of $2.0 million cash and an earn-out provision (&#8220;contingent consideration&#8221;) with a cap of $5.0 million, based on the Net Profits (as defined by the NLEX stock purchase agreement) of NLEX during the four years following the acquisition. At December 31, 2015 the present value of the contingent consideration is estimated to be $3.5 million. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.

On March 11, 2016, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement with International Auto Processing Inc. (&#8220;IAP&#8221;) to sell the Company&#8217;s real estate inventory. The purchase price of the real estate inventory is $4.1 million. Concurrently, the Company entered into a five year lease agreement with an affiliate of IAP to lease the building during the escrow period, which will terminate at the close of escrow. The purchase agreement gives IAP the right to terminate its obligation to consummate the sale for any reason, but in the event the sale is not consummated, the lease agreement will continue on through the end of the lease term. The purchase and sale agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.24, which exhibit is incorporated by reference herein.

Asset liquidation

The Company is a value-driven, innovative leader in corporate and financial asset liquidation transactions, valuations and advisory services. The Company specializes both in acting as an adviser, as well as acquiring or brokering turnkey manufacturing facilities, surplus industrial machinery and equipment, industrial inventories, accounts receivable portfolios, intellectual property, and entire business enterprises.

The asset liquidation business began operations in 2009 with the establishment of Heritage Global LLC (&#8220;HG LLC&#8221;). In addition to acquiring turnkey manufacturing facilities and used industrial machinery and equipment, HG LLC arranges traditional asset disposition sales, including liquidation and auction sales. In 2011, HG LLC acquired 100% of the business of EP USA, LLC (d/b/a Equity Partners) (&#8220;Equity Partners&#8221;), thereby expanding the Company&#8217;s operations. Equity Partners is a boutique M&#38;A advisory firm and provider of financial solutions for distressed businesses and properties. 

In 2012 the Company increased its in-house asset liquidation expertise via its acquisition of 100% of the outstanding equity of Heritage Global Partners, Inc. (&#8220;HGP&#8221;), a global full-service auction, appraisal and asset advisory firm, and in 2012, the Company launched Heritage Global Partners Europe (&#8220;HGP Europe&#8221;). Through its wholly-owned subsidiary Heritage Global Partners UK Limited, the Company opened three European-based offices, one each in the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain. 

In May 2014, the Company again expanded its asset liquidation operations with the acquisition of National Loan Exchange (&#8216;NLEX&#8221;). NLEX is the largest volume broker of charged-off receivables in the United States and Canada, and its offerings include national, state and regional portfolios on behalf of many of the world&#8217;s top financial institutions. The NLEX acquisition is consistent with HGI&#8217;s strategy to expand and diversify the services provided by its asset liquidation business. 

As a result of the events and acquisitions outlined above, management believes that HGI&#8217;s expanded global platform will allow the Company to achieve its long term industry leadership goals.

Intellectual property licensing

The Company holds several patents, including two that relate to Voice over Internet Protocol (&#8220;VoIP&#8221;). U.S. Patent No. 6,438,124 was developed by the Company, and encompasses the technology that allows two parties to converse phone-to-phone, regardless of 

&#160;

the distance, by transmitting voice/sound via the Internet . U.S. Patent No. 6,243,373 (the &#8220;VoIP Patent&#8221;) was purchased from a third party (the &#8220;Vendor&#8221;). These patents, together with related international patents and patent applications, form the Company&#8217;s international VoIP Patent Portfolio (the &#8220;Portfolio&#8221;) th at covers the basic process and technology that enable VoIP communication as used in the market today. As part of the consideration for the acquisition of the VoIP Patent, the Vendor is entitled to receive 35% of the net earnings from the Portfolio. At th is time, although the Company expects to continue to incur costs relating to maintaining ownership of these patents, it is not expected that either these costs or related revenue will be material. 

Employees

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, HGI had 52 employees: 29 are employed by HGP, 15 by NLEX, and eight by Equity Partners. In addition, five employees of Street Capital provided management and administrative services to HGI during the first eight months of 2015 under the terms of a management services agreement (the &#8220;Services Agreement&#8221;) that is described in Item 13 of this Report and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. The Services Agreement was terminated effective August 31, 2015. Refer to Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for more information. 

Industry and Competition

The asset liquidation business consists primarily of the auction, appraisal and asset advisory services provided by HGP, mergers and acquisitions advisory services provided by Equity Partners, and the accounts receivable brokerage services provided by NLEX. It also includes the purchase and sale, including at auction, of industrial machinery and equipment, real estate, inventories, accounts receivable and distressed debt. The market for these services and assets is highly fragmented. To acquire auction or appraisal contracts, or assets for resale, HGI competes with other liquidators, auction companies, dealers and brokers. It also competes with them for potential purchasers, as well as with equipment manufacturers, distributors, dealers and equipment rental companies. Some competitors have significantly greater financial and marketing resources and name recognition. 

HGI&#8217;s business strategy includes the option of partnering with one or more additional purchasers, pursuant to a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company agreement (collectively, &#8220;Joint Ventures&#8221;). These Joint Ventures give the Company access to more opportunities, helping to mitigate some of the competition from the market&#8217;s larger participants and contribute to the Company&#8217;s objective to be the leading resource for clients requiring capital asset solutions.

Government Regulation

We are subject to federal, state and local consumer protection laws, including laws protecting the privacy of customer non-public information and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. Many jurisdictions also regulate "auctions" and "auctioneers" and may regulate online auction services. These consumer protection laws and regulations could result in substantial compliance costs and could interfere with the conduct of our business.

Legislation in the United States, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, has increased public companies&#8217; regulatory and compliance costs as well as the scope and cost of work provided by independent registered public accountants and legal advisors. The mandatory adoption of XBRL reporting in 2011 has also increased the Company&#8217;s costs paid to third party service providers. As regulatory and compliance guidelines continue to evolve, we expect to continue to incur costs, which may or may not be material, in order to comply with legislative requirements or rules, pronouncements and guidelines by regulatory bodies.
