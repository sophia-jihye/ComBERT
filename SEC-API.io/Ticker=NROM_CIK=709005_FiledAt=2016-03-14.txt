 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General Information 

Noble Roman&#8217;s, Inc., an Indiana corporation incorporated in 1972 with two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Pizzaco, Inc. and N.R. Realty, Inc., sells and services franchises and licenses for non-traditional foodservice operations and stand-alone take-n-bake locations under the trade names &#8220;Noble Roman&#8217;s Pizza&#8221;, &#8220;Noble Roman&#8217;s Take-N-Bake&#8221; and &#8220;Tuscano&#8217;s Italian Style Subs&#8221;. The concepts&#8217; hallmarks include high quality pizza and sub sandwiches, along with other related menu items, simple operating systems, fast service times, labor-minimizing operations, attractive food costs and overall affordability. Since 1997, the Company has concentrated its efforts and resources primarily on franchising and licensing for non-traditional locations and now has awarded franchise and/or license agreements in 50 states plus Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, Italy, the Dominican Republic and Canada. The Company currently focuses all of its sales efforts on (1) franchises/licenses for non-traditional locations primarily in convenience stores and entertainment facilities, (2) franchises for stand-alone Noble Roman&#8217;s Take-N-Bake Pizza retail outlets and (3) license agreements for grocery stores to sell the Noble Roman&#8217;s Take-N-Bake Pizza. Pizzaco, Inc. owns and operates a Company location used for testing and demonstration purposes. References in this report to the &#8220;Company&#8221; are to Noble Roman&#8217;s, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise. 

Noble Roman&#8217;s Pizza 

The hallmark of Noble Roman&#8217;s Pizza is &#8220;Superior quality that our customers can taste.&#8221; Every ingredient and process has been designed with a view to produce superior results. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

A fully-prepared pizza crust that captures the made-from-scratch pizzeria flavor which gets delivered to non-traditional and grocery locations shelf-stable so that dough handling is no longer an impediment to a consistent product in those types of operations. 

&#9679; 

Crust made with only specially milled flour (except for its gluten-free crust) with above average protein and yeast. 

&#9679; 

Fresh packed, uncondensed and never cooked sauce made with secret spices, parmesan cheese and vine-ripened tomatoes. 

&#9679; 

100% real cheese blended from mozzarella and Muenster, with no soy additives or extenders.

&#160;

Noble Roman&#8217;s Take-N-Bake 

The Company developed a take-n-bake version of its pizza as an addition to its menu offerings. The take-n-bake pizza is designed as an add-on component for new and existing convenience stores, as a stand-alone offering for grocery stores and as the centerpiece of the Company&#8217;s stand-alone take-n-bake retail outlet concept. The Company offers the take-n-bake program in grocery stores under a license agreement rather than a franchise agreement. The stand-alone take-n-bake pizza units are offered under a franchise agreement. In convenience stores, take-n-bake is an available menu offering under the existing franchise/license agreement. The Company uses the same high quality pizza ingredients for its take-n-bake pizza as with its baked pizza, with slight modifications to portioning for enhanced home baking performance. 

Tuscano&#8217;s Italian Style Subs 

Tuscano&#8217;s Italian Style Subs is a separate non-traditional location concept that focuses on sub sandwich menu items. Tuscano&#8217;s was designed to be comfortably familiar from a customer&#8217;s perspective but with many distinctive features that include an Italian-themed menu. The ongoing royalty for a Tuscano&#8217;s franchise is identical to that charged for a Noble Roman&#8217;s Pizza franchise. The Company awards Tuscano&#8217;s franchises in the same facilities as Noble Roman&#8217;s Pizza franchises. Noble Roman&#8217;s has developed a grab-n-go service system for a selected portion of the Tuscano&#8217;s menu. The grab-n-go system is designed to add sales opportunities at existing non-traditional Noble Roman&#8217;s Pizza locations. 

Business Strategy 

The Company&#8217;s business strategy includes the following principal elements: 

1. Focus on revenue expansion through three primary growth vehicles: 

Sales of Non-Traditional Franchises and Licenses. The Company believes it has an opportunity for increasing unit growth and revenue within its non-traditional venues, particularly with convenience stores, travel plazas and entertainment facilities. The Company&#8217;s franchises/licenses in non-traditional locations are foodservice providers within a host business, and usually require a substantially lower investment compared to a stand-alone traditional location. Non-traditional franchises/licenses are most often sold into pre-existing facilities as a service and/or revenue enhancer for the underlying business. 

Licensing and Franchising the Company&#8217;s Take-N-Bake Program. &#160; Noble Roman's take-n-bake pizza is designed as a unique product offering for grocery stores, an add-on component for new or existing convenience store franchisees/licensees and stand-alone franchise locations. The Company believes there is a significant growth opportunity to license additional supermarkets to sell its take-n-bake pizzas in their deli departments. 

Franchising the Company&#8217;s Take-N-Bake Program for Stand-Alone Locations. &#160; The Company has developed a stand-alone take-n-bake pizza prototype, which features the chain&#8217;s popular traditional Hand-Tossed Style pizza, Deep-Dish Sicilian pizza, SuperThin pizza, a gluten-free pizza crust and Noble Roman&#8217;s famous breadsticks with spicy cheese sauce, all in a convenient cook-at-home format. Additional menu items include fresh salads, cookie dough, cinnamon rounds, bake-able pasta and more. The Company has since developed and continues to develop several enhancements to the stand-alone concept, such as "You Bake-We Bake", lunch service, limited inside seating and delivery service. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

As a result of the Company&#8217;s major focus on non-traditional franchising/licensing, franchising stand-alone take-n-bake retail outlets and licensing take-n-bake pizzas for grocery stores, its requirements for overhead and operating costs are significantly less than if it were focusing on traditional franchising. In addition, the Company does not operate restaurants, other than one location used for testing and demonstration purposes , which allows for a more complete focus on selling and servicing franchises and licenses to pursue increased unit growth. 

2. Leverage the results of research and development advances. 

The Company has invested significant time and effort to create what it considers to be competitive advantages in its products and systems for non-traditional and take-n-bake locations. The Company will continue to make these investments the focal point in its marketing process. The Company believes that the quality of its products, their cost-effectiveness, relatively simple production and service systems, and its diverse, modularized menu offerings all contribute to the Company&#8217;s strategic attributes and growth potential. Every ingredient and process was designed to produce superior results. The menu items in most venues were developed to be delivered in a ready-to-use format requiring only on-site assembly and baking except for take-n-bake pizza, which is sold to bake at home, and certain other complimentary menu items which require no assembly. The Company believes this process results in products that are great tasting, quality consistent, easy to assemble, relatively low in food cost, and require minimal labor, which allow for a significant competitive advantage due to the speed at which the products can be prepared, baked and served to customers. 

3. Aggressively communicate the Company&#8217;s competitive advantages to its target market of potential franchisees and licensees. 

The Company utilizes the following methods of reaching potential franchisees and licensees and to communicate its product and system advantages: (1) calling from both acquired and in-house prospect lists; (2) frequent direct mail campaigns to targeted prospects; (3) web-based lead capturing; (4) live demonstrations at trade and food shows; and (5) in the case of prospects for the stand-alone take-n-bake outlets, requiring visits to the Company headquarters to meet management and to sample the products. In particular, the Company has found that conducting live demonstrations of its systems and products at selected trade and food shows across the country allows it to demonstrate advantages that can otherwise be difficult for a potential prospect to visualize. There is no substitute for actually tasting the difference in a product&#8217;s quality to demonstrate the advantages of the Company&#8217;s products. The Company carefully selects the national and regional trade and food shows where it either has an existing relationship or considerable previous experience to expect that such shows offer opportunities for fruitful lead generation. 

Business Operations 

Distribution 

The Company&#8217;s proprietary products are manufactured pursuant to the Company&#8217;s recipes and formulas by third-party manufacturers under contracts between the Company and its various manufacturers. These contracts require the manufacturers to produce products meeting the Company&#8217;s specifications and to sell them to Company-approved distributors at prices negotiated between the Company and the manufacturer. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

At present, the Company has distribution agreements with its primary distributors strategically located throughout the United States. The distribution agreements require the primary distributors to maintain adequate inventories of all products necessary to meet the needs of the Company&#8217;s franchisees and licensees in their distribution area for weekly deliveries to the franchisee/licensee locations and to its grocery store distributors in their respective territories. Each of the primary distributors purchases the products from the manufacturer at prices negotiated between the Company and the manufacturers, but under payment terms agreed upon by the manufacturer and the distributor, and distributes the products to the franchisee/licensee at a price determined by the distribution agreement. Payment terms to the distributor are agreed upon between each franchisee/licensee and the respective distributor. In addition, the Company has agreements with 29 grocery store distributors located in various parts of the country which agree to buy the Company&#8217;s products from one of its primary distributors and to distribute those products only to their grocery store customers who have signed license agreements with the Company. 

Franchising 

The Company sells franchises into various non-traditional and traditional venues. 

The initial franchise fees are as follows: 

&#160;

Franchise Format 

&#160; Non-Traditional, 

Except Hospitals 

&#160; &#160; &#160;

&#160; Noble Roman&#8217;s Pizza 

&#160; $ 7,500 &#160; &#160; $ 10,000 &#160; &#160; $ 25,000 &#160; Tuscano&#8217;s Subs 

&#160; $ 6,000 &#160; &#160; $ 10,000 &#160; &#160; $ 15,000 &#160; Noble Roman&#8217;s &#38; Tuscano&#8217;s 

&#160; $ 11,500 &#160; &#160; $ 18,000 &#160; &#160; $ 28,000 &#160; 

The franchise fees are paid upon signing the franchise agreement and, when paid, are deemed fully earned and non-refundable in consideration of the administration and other expenses incurred by the Company in granting the franchises and for the lost and/or deferred opportunities to grant such franchises to any other party. 

&#160;

Licensing 

Noble Roman&#8217;s Take-n-Bake Pizza licenses for grocery stores are governed by a supply agreement. The supply agreement generally requires the licensee to: (1) only purchase proprietary ingredients from a Noble Roman&#8217;s-approved distributor; (2) assemble the products using only Noble Roman&#8217;s approved ingredients and recipes; and (3) display products in a manner approved by Noble Roman&#8217;s using Noble Roman&#8217;s point-of-sale marketing materials. Pursuant to the distribution agreements, the distributors place an additional mark-up, as determined by the Company, above their normal selling price on the key ingredients as a fee to the Company in lieu of a royalty. The distributors agree to segregate this additional mark-up upon invoicing the licensee, to hold the amount in trust for the Company and to remit such fees to the Company within ten days after the end of each month. 

Competition 

The restaurant industry and the retail food industry in general are very competitive with respect to convenience, price, product quality and service. In addition, the Company competes for franchise and license sales on the basis of product engineering and quality, investment cost, cost of sales, distribution, simplicity of operation and labor requirements. Actions by one or more of the Company&#8217;s competitors could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s ability to sell additional franchises or licenses, maintain and renew existing franchises or licenses, or sell its products. Many of the Company&#8217;s competitors are very large, internationally established companies. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Within the competitive environment of the non-traditional franchise and license segment of the restaurant industry, management has identified what it believes to be certain competitive advantages for the Company. First, some of the Company&#8217;s competitors in the non-traditional venue are also large chains operating thousands of franchised, traditional restaurants. Because of the contractual relationships with many of their franchisees, some competitors may be unable to offer wide-scale site availability for potential non-traditional franchisees. The Company is not faced with any significant geographic restrictions in this regard. 

Many of the Company&#8217;s competitors in the non-traditional venue were established with little or no organizational history operating traditional foodservice locations. This lack of operating experience may limit their ability to attract and maintain non-traditional franchisees or licensees who, by the nature of the venue, often have little exposure to foodservice operations themselves. The Company&#8217;s background in traditional restaurant operations has provided it experience in structuring, planning, marketing, and controlling costs of franchise or license unit operations which may be of material benefit to franchisees or licensees. 

Seasonality of Sales 

Direct sales of non-traditional franchises or licenses may be affected by seasonalities and holiday periods. Sales to certain non-traditional venues may be slower around major holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, and during the first quarter of the year. The Company&#8217;s sales of take-n-bake pizza in grocery stores are typically slower during the summer months, especially when the weather is hot. Additionally, extreme winter weather conditions, compared to the norm for the various regions of the country, adversely affect franchisee&#8217;s/licensee&#8217;s sales, which in turn affects Company royalties. 

Employees 

As of March 4, 2016, the Company employed approximately 21 persons full-time and seven persons on a part-time, hourly basis, of which 20 of the full-time employees are employed in sales and service of the franchise/license units and one full-time employee and all seven employed on a part-time manage and work the Company location. No employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements. The Company believes that relations with its employees are good. 

Trademarks and Service Marks 

The Company owns and protects several trademarks and service marks. Many of these, including NOBLE ROMAN&#8217;S &#174;, Noble Roman's Pizza&#174;, THE BETTER PIZZA PEOPLE &#174; and Tuscano&#8217;s Italian Style Subs&#174;, are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office as well as with the corresponding agencies of certain other foreign governments. The Company believes that its trademarks and service marks have significant value and are important to its sales and marketing efforts. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

The Company and its franchisees and licensees are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting the operation of our respective businesses. Each location is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, safety, sanitation, building and other agencies and ordinances in the state or municipality in which the facility is located. The process of obtaining and maintaining required licenses or approvals can delay or prevent the opening of a location. Vendors, such as our third-party production and distribution services, are also licensed and subject to regulation by state and local health and fire codes, and U. S. Department of Transportation regulations. The Company, its franchisees, licensees and vendors are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations, as well as laws and regulations relating to minimum wage and other employment-related matters. In certain circumstances, the Company is, or soon may be, subject to various local, state and/or federal laws requiring disclosure of nutritional and/or ingredient information concerning the Company&#8217;s products, its packaging, menu boards and/or other literature. Changes in the laws and rules applicable to the Company or its franchisees or licensees, or their interpretation, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. 

The Company is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;) and various state agencies pursuant to federal and state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. Several states also regulate aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The FTC requires us to furnish to prospective franchisees a disclosure document containing certain specified information. Several states also regulate the sale of franchises and require registration of a franchise disclosure document with state authorities. Substantive state laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states and bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for additional federal regulation of the franchisor-franchisee relationship in certain respects. State laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions and the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise. Some foreign countries also have disclosure requirements and other laws regulating franchising and the franchisor-franchisee relationship, and the Company is subject to applicable laws in each jurisdiction where it seeks to market additional franchised units.
