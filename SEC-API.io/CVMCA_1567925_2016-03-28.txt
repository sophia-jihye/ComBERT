 Item 1. Business. 

The Company 

Carter Validus Mission Critical REIT II, Inc., or the Company, or we, is a Maryland corporation that was formed on January 11, 2013, which elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or a REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, for federal income tax purposes commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2014. For the period from January 11, 2013 through December 31, 2013, we had not begun principal operations. Substantially all of our business is conducted through Carter Validus Operating Partnership II, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, or our Operating Partnership, formed on January 10, 2013. The Company is the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership and Carter Validus Advisors II, LLC, or our Advisor, is the initial limited partner of our Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2015, we owned 22 real estate investments, consisting of 28 properties, comprising approximately 1,523,000 rentable square feet of single-tenant and multi-tenant commercial space located in 17 metropolitan statistical areas, or MSAs, and one micropolitan statistical area, or &#181;SA. As of December 31, 2015, the rentable space of these real estate investments was 99.7% leased. 

We are offering for sale a maximum of $2,350,000,000 in shares of common stock, consisting of up to $2,250,000,000 in shares of common stock in our primary offering and up to $100,000,000 in shares of common stock to be issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, or the DRIP, on a &#147;best efforts&#148; basis pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11 filed with the SEC under the Securities Act, or our Offering, (SEC File Number: 333-191706, effective May 29, 2014). We are offering shares of common stock, Class A shares and Class T shares, in any combination with a dollar value up to the maximum primary offering amount. The initial offering price for the shares in the primary offering is $10.00 per Class A share and $9.574 per Class T share. 

As of December 31, 2015, we had accepted investors&#146; subscriptions for and issued approximately 48,486,000 shares of Class A common stock in our Offering, resulting in receipt of gross proceeds of approximately $481,558,000, before selling commissions and dealer manager fees of approximately $44,639,000 and other offering costs of approximately $10,258,000. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $1,868,442,000 in Class A shares and Class T shares of common stock remaining in our Offering. 

Substantially all of our business is managed by our Advisor. Carter Validus Real Estate Management Services II, LLC, or our Property Manager, an affiliate of our Advisor, serves as our property manager. SC Distributors, LLC, or our Dealer Manager, serves as the dealer manager of our Offering. At the commencement of our Offering, the indirect owner of our Dealer Manager was an affiliate of our Advisor. On August 29, 2014, RCS Capital Corporation, or RCAP, acquired Strategic Capital Management Holdings, LLC, and the Dealer Manager ceased to be under common control with our Advisor. On January 29, 2016, Strategic Capital Management Holdings, LLC was sold by RCAP to Validus/Strategic Capital, LLC, which is owned by substantially similar persons as originally owned Strategic Capital Management Holdings, LLC. As a result of this transaction, our Dealer Manager is an affiliate of our Advisor. We believe that there has been no impact to the operations as a result of these transactions. The Dealer Manager has received and will continue to receive fees for services related to our Offering. Our Advisor and Property Manager have received and will continue to receive fees for services related to our acquisition and operational stages. The Advisor also may receive fees during the liquidation stage. 

We were formed to invest primarily in quality income-producing commercial real estate, with a focus on data centers and healthcare properties, preferably with long-term net leases to investment grade and other creditworthy tenants, as well as to make other real estate investments that relate to such property types. Other real estate investments may include equity or debt interests, including securities, in other real estate entities. We also may originate or invest in real estate-related debt. We expect real estate-related debt originations and investments to be focused on first mortgage loans, but also may include real estate-related bridge loans, mezzanine loans and securitized debt. 

&#160;

Except as the context otherwise requires, &#147;we,&#148; &#147;our,&#148; &#147;us,&#148; and the &#147;Company&#148; refer to Carter Validus Mission Critical REIT II, Inc., our Operating Partnership and all wholly-owned subsidiaries. 

Key Developments during 2015 and Subsequent 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; As of March 24, 2016, we had accepted investors&#146; subscriptions for and issued approximately 55,752,000 shares of Class A common stock and 2,119,000 shares of Class T common stock in our Offering, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $553,473,000 and $20,283,000, respectively, before selling commissions and dealer manager fees of approximately $1,776,244,000. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; We currently pay, and intend to continue to pay, monthly distributions to our Class A stockholders equal to an annualized rate of 6.4%, assuming a purchase price of $10.00 per share of Class A common stock. We began paying monthly distributions to our Class T stockholders on January 21, 2016 equal to a daily rate of $0.001487049 per share of Class T common stock, assuming a purchase price of $9.574 per share. As of December 31, 2015, we had paid aggregate distributions of approximately $16,452,000 ($6,539,000 in cash and $9,913,000 reinvested in shares of common stock pursuant to the DRIP). Additionally, as of March 24, 2016, we had paid aggregate distributions, since inception, of approximately $24,438,000 ($9,898,000 in cash and $14,540,000 reinvested in shares of common stock pursuant to the DRIP). &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; During the year ended December 31, 2015, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, acquired 16 real estate investments, consisting of 22 properties, for an aggregate purchase price of $374,164,000 and comprising of 1,200,000 gross rental square feet of commercial space. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; As of March 24, 2016, we had a $110,000,000 outstanding balance under the secured credit facility. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Subsequent to December 31, 2015 and through March 24, 2016, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, had acquired 25 real estate investments, consisting of 37 properties, for an aggregate purchase price of $528,022,000 and comprising of approximately 1,771,000 gross rental square feet of commercial space. Our principal executive offices are located at 4890 West Kennedy Blvd., Suite 650, Tampa, Florida 33609. Our telephone number is (813) 287-0101. 

Investment Objectives and Policies 

Our primary investment objectives are to: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; acquire well-maintained and strategically-located, quality, mission critical real estate investments in high-growth sectors of the U.S. economy, including the data center and healthcare sectors, which provide current cash flow from operations; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; pay regular cash distributions to stockholders; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; preserve, protect and return capital contributions to stockholders; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; realize appreciated growth in the value of our investments upon the sale of such investments in whole or in part; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; be prudent, patient and deliberate with respect to the purchase and sale of our investments considering current and future real estate markets. &#160;

We cannot assure you that we will attain these objectives or that the value of our assets will not decrease. Furthermore, within our investment objectives and policies, our Advisor has substantial discretion with respect to the selection of specific investments and the purchase and sale of our assets, subject to the approval of our board of directors. Our board of directors may revise our investment objectives and policies if it determines it is advisable and in the best interest of our stockholders. 

Investment Strategy 

Primary Investment Focus 

There is no limitation on the number, size or type of properties we may acquire or the percentage of net proceeds of our Offering that may be invested in a single investment. We intend to focus our investment activities on acquiring mission critical net-leased properties, preferably with long-term leases, to creditworthy tenants that are primarily in the data center and healthcare sectors. We expect that most of our properties will be located throughout the continental United States; however, we may purchase properties in other jurisdictions. We may also invest in real estate-related debt and securities that meet our investment strategy and return criteria, provided that we do not intend for such investments to constitute a significant portion of our assets, and we will evaluate our assets to ensure that any such investments do not cause us to fail to lose our REIT status, cause us or any of our subsidiaries to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act, or cause our Advisor to have assets under management that would require our Advisor to register as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the Advisers Act. We expect the sizes of individual properties that we purchase to vary significantly, but we expect most of the properties we acquire are likely to have a purchase price between $5,000,000 and $200,000,000. The number and mix of properties and other real estate-related investments comprising our portfolio will depend upon real estate market conditions and other circumstances existing at the time we acquire the properties and other real estate-related investments, and the amount of proceeds raised in our Offering. 

Investing in Real Property 

Our Advisor uses the following criteria to evaluate potential investment opportunities: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; &#147;mission critical&#148; (as defined below) to the business operations of the tenant; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; leased to investment grade and other creditworthy tenants, preferably on a net-leased basis; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; long-term leases, preferably with terms of six years or longer, which typically include annual or periodic fixed rental increases; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; located in geographically diverse, established markets with superior access and visibility. We believe that net-leased properties, as generally compared to properties with other lease structures, offer a distinct investment advantage since such properties typically provide more stable and predictable returns to the property owner, require less operating capital, have less recurring tenant turnover and, with respect to single-tenant properties, often are located in superior locations that are less dependent on the financial stability of adjoining tenants. Further, since we intend to acquire properties that are geographically diverse, we expect to minimize the potential adverse impact of economic slowdowns or downturns in specific geographic markets. We believe that a portfolio consisting of freestanding, single-tenant and multi-tenant mission critical properties that are long-term net-leased to creditworthy tenants will enhance our liquidity opportunities for investors by making the sale of individual properties, multiple properties or our investment portfolio as a whole attractive to institutional investors and by making a potential listing of our shares attractive to the public investment community. 

&#160;

We consider &#147;mission critical&#148; properties as those properties that are essential to the successful operations of the companies within the industries in which such companies operate. 

As determined appropriate by our Advisor, we may acquire properties in various stages of development or that require substantial refurbishment or renovation. Our Advisor will make this determination based upon a variety of factors, including the available risk-adjusted returns for such properties when compared with other available properties, the effect such properties would have on the diversification of our portfolio, and our investment objectives of realizing both current income and capital appreciation upon the sale of such properties. 

To the extent feasible, we will continue to seek to achieve a well-balanced portfolio of real estate investments that is diversified by geographic location, age and lease maturities. We also will focus on acquiring properties in the high-growth data center and healthcare sectors. We expect that tenants of our properties will be diversified between national, regional and local companies. We generally will target properties with lease terms of six years or longer. We may acquire properties with shorter lease terms if the property is in an attractive location, is difficult to replace, or has other significant favorable attributes. We expect that these investments will provide long-term value by virtue of their size, location, quality and condition, and lease characteristics. 

Many data center and healthcare companies currently are entering into sale-leaseback transactions (as described below) as a strategy for applying capital to their core operating businesses that would otherwise be invested in their real estate holdings. We believe that our investment strategy will enable us to take advantage of this trend and companies&#146; increased emphasis on core business operations and competence in today&#146;s competitive corporate environment as many of these companies attempt to divest of their real estate assets. 

We have incurred, and intend to continue to incur, debt to acquire properties when our board of directors determines that incurring such debt is in our best interest. In addition, from time to time, we may acquire certain properties without financing and later incur mortgage debt secured by one or more of such properties if favorable financing terms are available. We would use the proceeds from these loans to acquire additional properties and other real estate-related investments. We intend to limit our aggregate borrowings to 50% of the fair market value of our assets (calculated after the close of our Offering and once we have invested substantially all the net proceeds of our Offering), unless excess borrowing is approved by a majority of our independent directors. 

We believe that our investment focus may present lower investment risks and greater stability to investors than other sectors of today&#146;s commercial real estate market, such as the office and multifamily property sectors. By acquiring a large number of mission critical properties, we believe that lower-than-expected results of operations from one or a few investments will have a less significant effect on our ability to realize our investment objectives than an alternative strategy in which fewer or different properties are acquired. 

Creditworthy Tenants 

In evaluating potential property acquisitions, we apply credit underwriting criteria to the existing tenants of such properties. Similarly, we will apply credit underwriting criteria to possible new tenants when we are re-leasing properties in our portfolio (to the extent applicable). We expect many of the tenants of our properties to be creditworthy national or regional companies with high net worth and high operating income. 

A tenant is considered creditworthy if it has a financial profile that our Advisor believes meets our criteria. In evaluating the creditworthiness of a tenant or prospective tenant, our Advisor will not use specific quantifiable standards, but will consider many factors, including, but not limited to, the proposed terms of the property acquisition, the financial condition of the tenant and/or guarantor, the operating history of the property with the tenant, the tenant&#146;s market share and track record within its industry segment, the general health and outlook of the tenant&#146;s industry segment, and the lease length and other lease terms at the time of the property acquisition. 

&#160;

We monitor the credit of our tenants to stay abreast of any material changes in credit quality. We monitor tenant credit by (1) reviewing the credit ratings of tenants (or their parent companies) that are rated by nationally recognized rating agencies, (2) reviewing financial statements that are publicly available or that are required to be delivered to us under the applicable lease, (3) monitoring news reports and other available information regarding our tenants and their underlying businesses, (4) monitoring the timeliness of rent collections, and (5) conducting periodic inspections of our properties to ascertain proper maintenance repair and upkeep. 

Description of Leases 

We acquire properties subject to existing tenant leases. When spaces in properties become vacant, existing leases expire, or we acquire properties under development or requiring substantial refurbishment or renovation, we anticipate entering into net leases. Net leases typically require tenants to pay, in addition to a fixed rental, all or a majority of the costs relating to the three broad expense categories of real estate taxes (including special assessments and sales and use taxes), insurance and common area maintenance (including repair and maintenance, utilities, cleaning and other operating expenses related to the property). There are various forms of net leases, most typically classified as triple net, or absolute net. Triple net leases typically require the tenant to pay, in addition to a fixed rental, all costs related to the three broad expense categories of real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance of the property, but hold the landlord responsible for the roof and structure of the property. Generally, the leases require each tenant to procure, at its own expense, commercial general liability insurance, as well as property insurance covering the building for the full replacement value and naming the ownership entity and the lender, if applicable, as the additional insured on the policy. As a precautionary measure, we may obtain, to the extent available, secondary liability insurance, as well as loss of rents insurance that covers one year of annual rent in the event of a rental loss. Tenants will be required to provide proof of insurance by furnishing a certificate of insurance to our Advisor on an annual basis. With respect to multi-tenant properties, we expect to have a variety of lease arrangements with the tenants of these properties. Since each lease is an individually negotiated contract between two or more parties, each lease will have different obligations of both the landlord and tenant. Many large national tenants have standard lease forms that generally do not vary from property to property. We will have limited ability to revise the terms of leases to those tenants. We expect that these properties will be subject to &#147;gross&#148; leases. &#147;Gross&#148; leases typically require the tenant to pay a flat rental amount and require us to pay for all property charges regularly associated with ownership of the property. 

A majority of our acquisitions generally have lease terms of six years or longer at the time of the property acquisition. As of December 31, 2015, the weighted average remaining lease term of our properties was 12.92 years. We have acquired and may continue to acquire properties under which the lease term is in progress and has a partial term remaining. We also may acquire properties with shorter lease terms if the property is in an attractive location, difficult to replace, or has other significant favorable real estate attributes. Under most commercial leases, tenants are obligated to pay a predetermined annual base rent. Some of the leases also will contain provisions that increase the amount of base rent payable at points during the lease term. In general, we will not permit leases to be assigned or subleased without our prior written consent. If we do consent to an assignment or sublease, the original tenant will generally remain fully liable under the lease unless we release that tenant from its obligations under the lease. 

Investment Decisions 

Our Advisor may purchase on our account, without the specific prior approval of our board of directors, properties with a purchase price of less than $15,000,000, so long as the investment in the property would not, if consummated, violate our investment guidelines or any restrictions on indebtedness and the consideration to be paid for such properties does not exceed the fair market value of such properties. Where the purchase price is equal to or greater than $15,000,000, investment decisions will be made by our board of directors upon the recommendation of our Advisor. 

&#160;

In evaluating and presenting investments for approval, our Advisor, to the extent such information is available, considers and provides to our board of directors, with respect to each property, the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; proposed purchase price, terms and conditions; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; physical condition, age, curb appeal and environmental reports; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; location, visibility and access; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; historical financial performance; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; tenant rent roll and tenant creditworthiness; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; lease terms, including rent, rent increases, length of lease term, specific tenant and landlord responsibilities, renewal, expansion, termination, purchase options, exclusive and permitted uses provisions, assignment and sublease provisions, and co-tenancy requirements; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; local market economic conditions, demographics and population growth patterns; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; neighboring properties; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; potential for new property construction in the area. Investing in and Originating Loans 

We may originate or acquire real estate loans. Our criteria for investing in loans are substantially the same as those involved in our investment in properties. We may originate or invest in real estate loans (including, but not limited to, investments in first, second and third mortgage loans, wraparound mortgage loans, construction mortgage loans on real property, preferred equity loans, and loans on leasehold interest mortgages). We also may invest in mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans. Further, we may invest in unsecured loans or loans secured by assets other than real estate; however, we will not make unsecured loans or loans not secured by mortgages unless such loans are approved by a majority of our independent directors. A bridge loan is short-term financing for an individual or business, until permanent or the next stage of financing, can be obtained. A mezzanine loan is a loan made in respect of certain real property that is secured by a lien on the ownership interests of the entity that, directly or indirectly, owns the real property. These loans would be subordinate to the mortgage loans directly on the underlying property. 

Our underwriting process typically involves comprehensive financial, structural, operational and legal due diligence. We do not require an appraisal of the underlying property from a certified independent appraiser for an investment in mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans, except for investments in transactions with our directors, our Advisor or any of their affiliates. For each such appraisal obtained, we will maintain a copy of such appraisal in our records for at least five years and will make it available during normal business hours for inspection and duplication by any stockholder at such stockholder&#146;s expense. In addition, we will seek to obtain a customary lender&#146;s title insurance policy or commitment as to the priority of the mortgage or condition of the title. 

We will not make or invest in mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans on any one property if the aggregate amount of all mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans outstanding on the property, including our borrowings, would exceed an amount equal to 85% of the appraised value of the property, as determined by our board of directors, including a majority of our independent directors, unless substantial justification exists, as determined by our board of directors, including a majority of our independent directors. Our board of directors may find such justification in connection with the purchase of mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans in cases in which it believes there is a high probability of our foreclosure upon the property in order to acquire the underlying assets and, in 

&#160;

respect of transactions with our affiliates, in which the cost of the mortgage loan investment does not exceed the appraised value of the underlying property. Our board of directors may find such justification in connection with the purchase of mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans that are in default where we intend to foreclose upon the property in order to acquire the underlying assets and, in respect of transactions with our affiliates, where the cost of the mortgage loan investment does not exceed the appraised value of the underlying property. 

When evaluating prospective investments in and originations of real estate loans, our management and our Advisor will consider factors such as the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the ratio of the total amount of debt secured by property to the value of the property by which it is secured; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the amount of existing debt on the property and the priority of that debt relative to our proposed investment; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the property&#146;s potential for capital appreciation; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; expected levels of rental and occupancy rates; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; current and projected cash flow of the property; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the degree of liquidity of the investment; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the geographic location of the property; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the condition and use of the property; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the quality, experience and creditworthiness of the borrower; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; general economic conditions in the area where the property is located; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; any other factors that our Advisor believes are relevant. We may originate loans from mortgage brokers or personal solicitations of suitable borrowers, or we may purchase existing loans that were originated by other lenders. Our Advisor will evaluate all potential loan investments to determine if the term of the loan, the security for the loan and the loan-to-value ratio meet our investment criteria and objectives. An officer, director, agent or employee of our Advisor will inspect the property securing the loan, if any, during the loan approval process. We do not expect to make or invest in mortgage or mezzanine loans with a maturity of more than ten years from the date of our investment, and anticipate that most loans will have a term of five years. We do not expect to make or invest in bridge loans with a maturity of more than one year (with the right to extend the term for an additional one year) from the date of our investment. Most loans which we will consider for investment would provide for monthly payments of interest and some also may provide for principal amortization, although many loans of the nature which we will consider provide for payments of interest only and a payment of principal in full at the end of the loan term. We will not originate loans with negative amortization provisions. 

Investing in Real Estate Securities 

We may invest in non-majority owned securities of both publicly-traded and private companies primarily engaged in real estate businesses, including REITs and other real estate operating companies, and securities issued by pass-through entities of which substantially all of the assets consist of qualifying assets or real estate-related assets. We may purchase the common stock, preferred stock, debt, or other securities of these entities or 

&#160;

options to acquire such securities. However, any investment in equity securities (including any preferred equity securities) must be approved by a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction, as being fair, competitive and commercially reasonable. 

Acquisition Structure 

We have and expect to continue to acquire fee interests in properties (a fee interest is the absolute, legal possession and ownership of land, property, or rights), although other methods of acquiring a property may be utilized if we deem them to be advantageous. Our focus is on acquiring commercial real estate predominantly in the data center and healthcare sectors, but we also may acquire other real property types, including office, industrial and retail properties. 

To achieve our investment objectives, and to further diversify our portfolio, we have invested and will continue to invest in properties using a number of acquisition structures, which include direct and indirect acquisitions, joint ventures, leveraged investments, issuing units in our Operating Partnership in exchange for properties and making mortgages or other loans secured by the same types of properties which we may acquire. Further, our Advisor and its affiliates may purchase properties in their own name, assume loans in connection with the purchase or loan and temporarily hold title to the properties for the purpose of facilitating acquisition or financing by us or any other purpose related to our business. 

Joint Ventures 

We may enter into joint ventures, partnerships and other co-ownership partnerships for the purpose of making investments. Some of the potential reasons to enter into a joint venture would be to acquire assets we could not otherwise acquire, to reduce our capital commitment to a particular asset, or to benefit from certain expertise a partner might have. In determining whether to invest in a particular joint venture, we evaluate the assets of the joint venture under the same criteria described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the selection of our investments. In the case of a joint venture, we also evaluate the terms of the joint venture as well as the financial condition, operating capabilities and integrity of our partner or partners. We may enter into joint ventures with our directors and our Advisor (or its affiliates) only if a majority of our board of directors, including a majority of our independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction, approves the transaction as being fair and reasonable to us and on substantially the same terms and conditions as those received by the other joint venturers. 

We may enter into joint ventures in which we have a right of first refusal to purchase the co-venturer&#146;s interest in the joint venture if the co-venturer elects to sell such interest. If the co-venturer elects to sell property held in any such joint venture, however, we may not have sufficient funds to exercise our right of first refusal to buy the other co-venturer&#146;s interest in the property held by the joint venture. If any joint venture with an affiliated entity holds interests in more than one property, the interest in each such property may be specially allocated based upon the respective proportion of funds invested by each co-venturer in each such property. 

International Investments 

We intend to primarily invest in real estate located in the United States; however, we may also invest in assets located outside of the United States. While we do not have specific locations identified, we could invest in real estate located in North America or Europe, or such other location as determined by our board of directors. 

Disposition Policy 

We intend to hold each asset we acquire for an extended period of time, generally five to seven years, or for the life of the Company. However, circumstances may arise that could result in the earlier sale of some assets. The determination of whether an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of will be made after consideration of 

&#160;

relevant factors, including prevailing economic conditions, specific real estate market conditions, tax implications for our stockholders, and other factors. The requirements for qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes also will put some limits on our ability to sell assets after short holding periods. 

The determination of whether a particular property should be sold or otherwise disposed of will be made after consideration of relevant factors, including prevailing economic conditions, specific real estate market circumstances, and current tenant creditworthiness, with a view to achieving maximum capital appreciation. We cannot assure you that this objective will be realized. The selling price of a property that is net-leased will be determined in large part by the amount of rent payable under the lease and the &#147;sales multiple&#148; applied to that rent. If a tenant has a repurchase option at a formula price, we may be limited in realizing any appreciation. In connection with our sales of properties, we may lend the purchaser all or a portion of the purchase price. In these instances, our taxable income may exceed the cash received in the sale. The terms of payment will be affected by custom in the area in which the property being sold is located and the then-prevailing economic conditions. 

In addition, if during the period ending two years after the close of the Offering, we sell assets and then reinvest in other assets, we will pay our advisor 2.0% of the contract purchase price of each property acquired (including our pro rata share of debt attributable to such property) and 2.0% of the amount advanced for a loan or other investment (including our pro rata share of debt attributable to such investment); provided, however , that in no event shall the aggregate acquisition fee paid in respect of such sale or reinvestment exceed 6.0% of the contract purchase price of each property (including our pro rata share of debt attributable to such property) or 6.0% of the amount advanced for a loan or other investment (including our pro rata share of debt attributable to such investment). 

Qualification as a REIT 

We qualified and elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to currently distribute at least 90.0% of our REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain, to our stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. 

If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT in any taxable year, we would then be subject to federal income taxes on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and would not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders. 

Distribution Policy 

Our board of directors began declaring distributions to our Class A stockholders in July 2014, after we made our first real estate investment. Our board of directors approved and authorized distributions to our Class T stockholders on January 20, 2016. The amount of distributions we pay to our stockholders is determined by our board of directors and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for payment of distributions, our financial condition, capital expenditure requirements, annual distribution requirements needed to maintain our status as a REIT under the Code and restrictions imposed by our organizational documents and Maryland law. 

We currently pay, and intend to continue to pay, monthly distributions to our stockholders. We currently calculate our monthly distributions on a daily record and declaration date. Therefore, new investors will be entitled to distributions immediately upon the purchase of their shares. Because all of our operations are 

&#160;

performed indirectly through our Operating Partnership, our ability to continue to pay distributions depends on our Operating Partnership&#146;s ability to pay distributions to its partners, including to us. If we do not have enough cash from operations to fund distributions, we may borrow, issue additional securities or sell assets in order to fund distributions, or make distributions out of net proceeds from our Offering. We have paid, and may continue to pay, distributions from sources other than from our cash flows from operations. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our cash flows provided by operations of approximately $3,290,000 was a shortfall of approximately $12,732,000, or 79.5%, of our distributions (total distributions were approximately $16,022,000, of which $6,379,000 was cash and $9,643,000 was reinvested in shares of our common stock pursuant to our DRIP) during such period and such shortfall was paid from net proceeds from our Offering. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our cash flows used in operations of approximately $1,705,000 was a shortfall of approximately $2,135,000, or 497%, of our distributions (total distributions were approximately $430,000, of which $160,000 was cash and $270,000 was reinvested in shares of our common stock pursuant to our DRIP) during such period and such shortfall was paid from net proceeds from our Offering. Subject to certain limited exceptions, there is no limit to the amount of distributions that we may pay from Offering proceeds. We have not established any limit on the amount of proceeds from our Offering that may be used to fund distributions, except that, in accordance with our organizational documents and Maryland law, we may not make distributions that would: (1) cause us to be unable to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; (2) cause our total assets to be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus senior liquidation preferences, if any; or (3) jeopardize our ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT. 

To the extent that distributions to our stockholders are paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, such distributions are taxable as ordinary income. To the extent that our distributions exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits, such amounts constitute a return of capital to our stockholders for federal income tax purposes, to the extent of their basis in their stock, and thereafter will constitute capital gain. All or a portion of a distribution to stockholders may be paid from net offering proceeds and thus, will constitute a return of capital to our stockholders. 

See Part II, Item 5. &#147;Market for Registrant&#146;s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities&#151;Distributions,&#148; for further discussion on distribution rates approved by our board of directors. 

Financing Strategies and Policies 

We believe that utilizing borrowing is consistent with our investment objectives and has the potential to maximize returns to our stockholders. Financing for acquisitions and investments may be obtained at the time an asset is acquired or an investment is made or at a later time. In addition, debt financing may be used from time to time for property improvements, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other working capital needs. The form of our indebtedness will vary and could be long-term or short-term, secured or unsecured, or fixed-rate or floating rate. We will not enter into interest rate swaps or caps, or similar hedging transactions or derivative arrangements for speculative purposes, but may do so in order to manage or mitigate our interest rate risk on variable rate debt. 

We will not borrow from our Advisor, any member of our board of directors, or any of their affiliates unless a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction, approves the transaction as being fair, competitive and commercially reasonable and no less favorable to us than comparable loans between unaffiliated parties. 

Conflicts of Interest 

We are subject to various conflicts of interest arising out of our relationship with our Advisor, and its affiliates, including conflicts related to the arrangements pursuant to which our Advisor and its affiliates will be 

&#160;

compensated by us. Our agreements and compensation arrangements with our Advisor and its affiliates were not determined by arm&#146;s-length negotiations. Some of the potential conflicts of interest in our transactions with our Advisor and its affiliates, and the limitations on our Advisor adopted to address these conflicts, are described below. 

Our Advisor and its affiliates try to balance our interests with their duties to other programs. However, to the extent that our Advisor or its affiliates take actions that are more favorable to other entities than to us, these actions could have a negative impact on our financial performance and, consequently, on distributions to our stockholders and the value of our stock. In addition, our directors and officers and certain of our stockholders may engage for their own account in business activities of the types conducted or to be conducted by our subsidiaries and us. 

Our independent directors have an obligation to function on our behalf in all situations in which a conflict of interest may arise, and all of our directors have a fiduciary obligation to act on behalf of our stockholders. 

Interests in Other Real Estate Programs 

Affiliates of our Advisor act as executive officers of our Advisor and as directors and/or officers of Carter Validus Mission Critical REIT, Inc., which is the other publicly registered, non-traded REIT currently offered, distributed and/or managed by affiliates of our Advisor. Affiliates of our officers and entities owned or managed by such affiliates may acquire or develop real estate for their own accounts, and have done so in the past. Furthermore, affiliates of our officers and entities owned or managed by such affiliates may form additional real estate investment entities in the future, whether public or private, which may have the same investment objectives and policies as we do and which may be involved in the same geographic area, and such persons may be engaged in sponsoring one or more of such entities at approximately the same time as our shares of common stock are being offered. Our Advisor, its affiliates and affiliates of our officers are not obligated to present to us any particular investment opportunity that comes to their attention, unless such opportunity is of a character that might be suitable for investment by us. Our Advisor and its affiliates likely will experience conflicts of interest as they simultaneously perform services for us and other affiliated real estate programs. 

Any affiliated entity, whether or not currently existing, could compete with us in the sale or operation of the properties. We will seek to achieve any operating efficiencies or similar savings that may result from affiliated management of competitive properties. However, to the extent that affiliates own or acquire a property that is adjacent, or in close proximity, to a property we own, our property may compete with the affiliate&#146;s property for tenants or purchasers. 

Every transaction that we enter into with our Advisor or its affiliates is subject to an inherent conflict of interest. Our board of directors may encounter conflicts of interest in enforcing our rights against any affiliate in the event of a default by or disagreement with an affiliate or in invoking powers, rights or options pursuant to any agreement between us and our Advisor or any of its affiliates. 

Other Activities of Our Advisor and Its Affiliates 

We rely on our Advisor for the day-to-day operation of our business. As a result of the interests of members of its management in other programs sponsored by affiliates of our Advisor and the fact that they also are engaged, and will continue to engage, in other business activities, our Advisor and its affiliates have conflicts of interest in allocating their time between us and other programs sponsored by affiliates of our Advisor and other activities in which they are involved. However, our Advisor believes that it and its affiliates have sufficient personnel to discharge fully their responsibilities to all of the programs sponsored by affiliates of our Advisor and other ventures in which they are involved. 

&#160;

In addition, each of our executive officers also serves as an officer of our Advisor, our Property Manager and/or other affiliated entities. As a result, these individuals owe fiduciary duties to these other entities, which may conflict with the fiduciary duties that they owe to us and our stockholders. 

We may acquire properties or interests in properties from entities affiliated with our Advisor. We will not acquire any properties from entities affiliated with our Advisor unless a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction, determine that the transaction is fair and reasonable to us. The purchase price of any property we acquire from our Advisor, its affiliates or a director will not exceed the current appraised value of the property. In addition, the price of the property we acquire from an affiliate may not exceed the cost of the property to the affiliate, unless a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, determines that substantial justification for the excess exists and the excess is reasonable. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we did not purchase any properties from our Advisor, its affiliates or a director. 

Competition in Acquiring, Leasing and Operating of Properties 

Conflicts of interest will exist to the extent that we may acquire, or seek to acquire, properties in the same geographic areas where properties owned by Carter Validus Mission Critical REIT, Inc., the other publicly registered, non-traded REIT offered, distributed and/or managed by affiliates of our Advisor, or any other future programs which may be sponsored by affiliates of our Advisor, are located. In such a case, a conflict could arise in the acquisition or leasing of properties if we and another program sponsored by affiliates of our Advisor were to compete for the same properties or tenants in negotiating leases, or a conflict could arise in connection with the resale of properties if we and another program sponsored by affiliates of our Advisor were to attempt to sell similar properties at the same time. Conflicts of interest also may exist at such time as we or our affiliates, managing properties on our behalf, seek to employ developers, contractors or building managers, as well as under other circumstances. Our Advisor will seek to reduce conflicts relating to the employment of developers, contractors or building managers by making such prospective employees aware of all such properties seeking to employ such prospective employees. In addition, our Advisor will seek to reduce conflicts that may arise with respect to properties available for sale or rent by making prospective purchasers or tenants aware of all such properties. However, these conflicts cannot be fully avoided in that there may be established differing compensation arrangements for employees at different properties or differing terms for resales or leasing of the various properties. 

Our Dealer Manager 

Since our Dealer Manager, is an affiliate of our advisor , we will not have the benefit of an independent due diligence review and investigation of the type normally performed by an unaffiliated, independent underwriter in connection with the offering of securities. 

Affiliated Property Manager 

The properties we acquire are managed and leased by our Property Manager, which is an affiliate of our Advisor, pursuant to a property management and leasing agreement. Our Property Manager is affiliated with the property managers of affiliated real estate programs, some of which may be in competition with our properties. Management fees paid to our Property Manager are based on a percentage of the rental income received by the managed properties. 

Joint Ventures with Affiliates of Our Advisor 

We may enter into joint ventures with other programs sponsored by affiliates of our Advisor (as well as other parties) for the acquisition, development or improvement of properties. We will not enter into a joint venture with our Sponsor, our Advisor, any director or any affiliate thereof, unless a majority of our directors, 

&#160;

including a majority of our independent directors, not otherwise interested in such transaction, approve the transaction as being fair and reasonable to us and on substantially the same terms and conditions as those received by the other joint ventures. Our Advisor and its affiliates may have conflicts of interest in determining which programs sponsored by affiliates of our Advisor should enter into any particular joint venture agreement. The co-venturer may have economic or business interests or goals which are or which may become inconsistent with our business interests or goals. In addition, should any such joint venture be consummated, our Advisor may face a conflict in structuring the terms of the relationship between our interests and the interest of the co-venturer and in managing the joint venture. Since our Advisor and its affiliates will control both us and any affiliated co-venturer, agreements and transactions between the co-venturers with respect to any such joint venture will not have the benefit of arm&#146;s-length negotiation of the type normally conducted between unrelated co-venturers. 

Receipt of Fees and Other Compensation by Our Advisor and Its Affiliates 

A transaction involving the purchase and sale of properties may result in the receipt of commissions, fees and other compensation by our Advisor and its affiliates, including acquisition and advisory fees, property management and leasing fees, disposition fees, brokerage commissions and participation in net sale proceeds. Subject to oversight by our board of directors, our Advisor will have considerable discretion with respect to all decisions relating to the terms and timing of all transactions. Therefore, our Advisor may have conflicts of interest concerning certain actions taken on our behalf, particularly due to the fact that such fees generally will be payable to our Advisor and its affiliates regardless of the quality of the properties acquired or the services provided to us. 

Employees 

We have no direct employees. The employees of our Advisor and its affiliates provide services for us related to acquisition, property management, asset management, accounting, investor relations, and all other administrative services. 

We are dependent on our Advisor and its affiliates for services that are essential to us, including asset acquisition decisions, property management and other general administrative responsibilities. In the event that these companies are unable to provide these services to us, we would be required to obtain such services from other sources. 

Reportable Segments 

We operate through two reportable business segments &#150; commercial real estate investments in data centers and healthcare. See Note 13&#151;&#147;Segment Reporting&#148; to the consolidated financial statements that are a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Insurance 

See the section captioned &#147;&#151;Description of Leases&#148; above. 

Competition 

As we continue to purchase properties for our portfolio, we are in competition with other potential buyers for the same properties, and may have to pay more to purchase the property than if there were no other potential acquirers or we may have to locate another property that meets our investment criteria. Although we generally acquire properties subject to existing leases, the leasing of real estate is highly competitive in the current market, and we may experience competition for tenants from owners and managers of competing projects. As a result, we 

&#160;

may have to provide free rent, incur charges for tenant improvements, or offer other inducements, or we might not be able to timely lease the space, all of which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. At the time we elect to dispose of our properties, we will also be in competition with sellers of similar properties to locate suitable purchasers for its properties. 

Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Leases 

As of December 31, 2015, we had cash on deposit, including restricted cash and escrowed funds, in certain financial institutions which had deposits in excess of current federally insured levels. We limit cash investments to financial institutions with high credit standing; therefore, we believe we are not exposed to any significant credit risk on our cash deposits. To date, we have not experienced any loss of or lack of access to cash in our accounts. 

Based on leases of our properties in effect as of December 31, 2015, three tenants&#146; exposure concentrations accounted for 10% or more of our 2015 contractual rental revenue. The following table shows the tenants that accounted for 10% or more of our 2015 contractual rental revenue:

All real properties and the operations conducted on real properties are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. In connection with ownership and operation of real estate, we may be potentially liable for costs and damages related to environmental matters. We intend to take commercially reasonable steps to protect ourselves from the impact of these laws, including obtaining environmental assessments of all properties that we acquire. We also carry environmental liability insurance on our properties, which provides coverage for pollution liability for third-party bodily injury and property damage claims.
