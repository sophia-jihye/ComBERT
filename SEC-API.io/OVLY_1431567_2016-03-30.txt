 ITEM 1. BUSINESS OF OAK VALLEY BANCORP 

&#160; 

Overview of the Business 

&#160; 

Oak Valley Bancorp. Oak Valley Bancorp (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated on April 1, 2008 in California for the purpose of becoming Oak Valley Community Bank&#8217;s parent bank holding company. Effective July 3, 2008, Oak Valley Bancorp acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Oak Valley Community Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;) (from time to time, the Bank and the Company may be generally referred to as &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;). The principal office of Oak Valley Bancorp is located at 125 North Third Avenue, Oakdale, California 95361 and its principal telephone is (209) 848-2265. 

&#160; 

The Company is authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of common stock, without par value, of which 8,078,155 are issued and outstanding at December 31, 2015, and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, without par value, of which no shares are issued and outstanding. 

&#160; 

The Company is the holding company of the Bank, and its only assets are the outstanding capital stock of the Bank, which the Company wholly owns, cash and income tax benefits receivable classified as other assets. 

&#160; 

Oak Valley Community Bank. The Bank commenced operations in May 1991. The Bank is an insured bank under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and is a member of the Federal Reserve. The Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the California Department of Business Oversight (DBO), the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve Board (FRB). Since its formation, the Bank has provided basic banking services to individuals and business enterprises in Oakdale, California and the surrounding areas. The focus of the Bank is to offer a range of commercial banking services designed for both individuals and small to medium-sized businesses in the two main areas of service of the Bank: the Central Valley and the Eastern Sierras. 

&#160; 

The Bank offers a complement of business checking and savings accounts for its business customers. The Bank also offers commercial and real estate loans, as well as lines of credit. Real estate loans are generally of a short-term nature for both residential and commercial lending purposes. Longer-term real estate loans are generally made with adjustable interest rates and contain customary provisions for acceleration. Traditional residential mortgages are available to Bank customers through a third party. 

&#160; 

The Bank offers other services for both individuals and businesses including online banking, remote deposit capture, mobile banking, merchant services, night depository, extended hours, wire transfer of funds, note collection, and automated teller machines in a national network. The Bank does not currently offer international banking or trust services although the Bank may make such services available to the Bank&#8217;s customers through financial institutions with which the Bank has correspondent banking relationships. The Bank does not offer stock transfer services nor does it directly issue credit cards. 

&#160; 

On December 23, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of Mother Lode Bank (&#8220;MLB&#8221;), a California state-chartered bank headquartered in Sonora, California, in a transaction in which Mother Lode Bank was merged with and into the Bank, with the Bank as the surviving company in the transaction. The purchase price for Mother Lode Bank was approximately $7.3 million. As of the acquisition date, Mother Lode Bank&#8217;s total assets were $78.7 million and total deposits were $71.1 million. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Expansion 

&#160; 

Branch Expansion. Since opening our doors of the main Oakdale branch in 1991, our network of branches and loan production offices have been expanded geographically. As of December 31, 2015, we maintained eighteen full-service branch offices (in addition to our corporate headquarters). Beginning in October 1995, we started our geographic expansion outside of Oakdale, by opening a Loan Production Office in Sonora, California. We subsequently opened a branch in Sonora and two branches in Modesto. In September 2000, we expanded into the Eastern Sierra, opening a branch in Bridgeport, California under the name Eastern Sierra Community Bank. Since that time we have added branches in Mammoth Lakes and Bishop. During 2005 and 2006, we aggressively increased our presence in the Central Valley, by opening branches in Turlock, Stockton, Patterson, Ripon and Escalon. In March 2007, our corporate headquarters expanded by adding an adjacent historical building located in downtown Oakdale to its complex. In 2011, we opened a third branch in Modesto and a branch in Manteca. In 2014, we opened a new branch in Tracy. In 2015, we added a second branch in Sonora. Later in 2015, Mother Lode Bank was merged with and into the Bank, which temporarily added two more branches in Sonora until they were eventually closed in January 2016 decreasing our total number of branches to sixteen, after management determined that our two existing branches would be able to support our new customers. We intend to continue our growth strategy in future years through the opening of additional branches and loan production offices as our needs and resources permit. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Bank Holding Company Reorganization. Effective July 3, 2008, we entered into a bank holding company reorganization, whereby each outstanding share of common stock of the Bank was exchanged into a share of common stock of the Company. Operating our banking business within a holding company structure provides, among other things, greater operating flexibility; facilitates the potential acquisition of related businesses as opportunities may arise from time to time; improves our ability to diversify as needed; enhances our ability to remain competitive in the future with other companies in the financial services industry that are organized in a holding company structure; and improves our ability to raise capital to support growth. &#160; 

&#160; 

Business Segments 

&#160; &#160; 

The Bank operates in two primary lines of business: Retail Banking and Commercial Banking, as described in additional detail below. These business lines do not meet the quantitative thresholds for reporting as separate segments and are therefore considered one segment for financial reporting purposes. 

&#160;

Retail Banking. &#160; We offer a range of checking and savings accounts, including NOW accounts, money market accounts, overdraft protection, health savings accounts, certificates of deposit, and Individual Retirement Accounts (&#8220;IRA&#8221;). To satisfy the lending needs of individuals in its service area, we offer real estate and home equity financing, as well as consumer, automobile, and home improvement loans. 

&#160; 

Commercial Banking . We offer a range of deposit and lending services to business customers. More specifically, we offer a variety of commercial loans for virtually any business, professional, or agricultural need. These include loans for short-term working capital, operating lines of credit, equipment purchases, leasehold improvements, construction, commercial real estate acquisitions or refinancing. Currently, virtually all of our business relationships are with customers located in the San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Tuolumne, Inyo and Mono Counties, of California. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Primary Market Area 

&#160; 

We conduct business from our main office in Oakdale, a city of approximately 21,500 residents located in Stanislaus County, California. Oakdale is approximately 15 miles from Modesto and sits at the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, at the edge of the California Central Valley agricultural area. Through our branches, we serve customers in the Central Valley, from Fresno to Sacramento, and in foothill locations. We also reach into the Highway 395 corridor in the Eastern Sierras and in the towns of Bishop, Mammoth and Bridgeport. Approximately 87% of our loans and 87% of our deposits are generated from the Central Valley. The Central Valley area includes Stanislaus, San Joaquin and Tuolumne counties and has a total population of over 3 million. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Lending Activities 

&#160; 

General. Our loan policies set forth the basic guidelines and procedures by which we conduct our lending operations. These policies address the types of loans available, underwriting and collateral requirements, loan terms, interest rate and yield considerations, compliance with laws and regulations and our internal lending limits. Our Board of Directors reviews and approves our loan policies on an annual basis. We supplement our own supervision of the loan underwriting and approval process with periodic loan audits by experienced external loan specialists who review credit quality, loan documentation and compliance with laws and regulations. We engage in a full complement of lending activities, including: 

&#160; 

&#9679; commercial real estate loans, 

&#160; 

&#9679; commercial business lending and trade finance, 

&#160; 

&#9679; Small Business Administration lending, and 

&#160; 

&#9679; consumer loans, including automobile loans, home mortgages, credit lines and other personal loans. 

&#160; 

As part of our efforts to achieve long-term stable profitability and respond to a changing economic environment in the California Central Valley, we constantly evaluate a variety of options to augment our traditional focus by broadening the services and products we provide. Possible avenues of growth include more branch locations, expanded suite of technology based services and new types of lending. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Loan Procedures. Loan applications may be approved by the Director Loan Committee of our Board of Directors, or by our management or lending officers, to the extent of their loan authority. Our Board of Directors authorizes our lending limits. Our President and Chief Credit Officer are responsible for evaluating the authority limits for individual credit officers and recommending lending limits for all other officers to the board of directors for approval. 

&#160; 

We grant individual lending authority to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Credit Officer, Credit Administrator and to some department managers and loan officers. Our highest management lending authority is combined administrative lending authority for unsecured and secured lending of $2,500,000, which requires the joint approval of either Chief Executive Officer, Chief Credit Officer, Senior Lending Officer and Credit Administrator. Loans for which direct and indirect borrower liability exceeds combined administrative lending authority are referred to our Board of Directors Loan Committee. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, the Bank&#8217;s authorized legal lending limits were $12.5 million for unsecured loans plus an additional $8.3 million for specific secured loans. Legal lending limits are calculated in conformance with California law, which prohibits a bank from lending to any one individual or entity or its related interests an aggregate amount which exceeds 15% of primary capital plus the allowance for loan losses on an unsecured basis, plus an additional 10% on a secured basis. The Bank&#8217;s primary capital plus allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2015 totaled $81.5 million. 

&#160; 

We seek to mitigate the risks inherent in our loan portfolio by adhering to certain underwriting practices. The review of each loan application includes analysis of the applicant&#8217;s prior credit history, income level, cash flow and financial condition, tax returns, cash flow projections, and the value of any collateral to secure the loan, based upon reports of independent appraisers and audits of accounts receivable or inventory pledged as security. In the case of real estate loans over a specified amount, the review of collateral value includes an appraisal report prepared by an independent, Bank-approved, appraiser. 

&#160; 

Real Estate Loans. We offer commercial real estate loans to finance the acquisition of new or the refinancing of existing commercial properties, such as office buildings, industrial buildings, warehouses, hotels, shopping centers, automotive industry facilities and multiple dwellings. At December 31, 2015, real estate loans constituted 84% of our loan portfolio, of which 93% were commercial loans. This includes the real estate loans made by Mother Lode Bank prior to its merger into the Bank in 2015. 

&#160; 

Commercial real estate loans typically have 10-year maturities with up to 25-year amortization of principal and interest and loan-to-value ratios of not more than 75% of the appraised value or purchase price, whichever is lower. We usually impose a prepayment penalty during the period within 3 to 5 years of the date of the loan. 

&#160; 

Construction loans are comprised of loans on commercial, residential and income producing properties that generally have terms of 1 year, with options to extend for additional periods to complete construction and to accommodate the lease-up period. We usually require 15% equity capital investment by the developer and loan to value ratios of not more than 75% of anticipated completion value. 

&#160; 

Miniperm loans finance the purchase and/or ownership of commercial properties, including owner-occupied and income producing properties. We also offer miniperm loans as take-out financing with our construction loans. Miniperm loans are generally made with an amortization schedule ranging from 20 to 25 years, with a lump sum balloon payment due in 3 to 5 years. 

&#160; 

Equity lines of credit are revolving lines of credit collateralized by junior deeds of trust on residential real properties. They generally bear a rate of interest that floats with our base rate or the prime rate, and have maturities of 10 years. 

&#160; 

We purchase participation interests in loans made by other financial institutions from time to time. These loans are subject to the same underwriting criteria and approval process as loans made directly by us. 

&#160; 

Our real estate loans are typically collateralized by first or junior deeds of trust on specific commercial properties and equity lines of credit, and are subject to corporate or individual guarantees from financially capable parties, as available. The properties collateralizing real estate loans are principally located in our primary market areas of the California Central Valley and the Eastern Sierra. Real estate loans typically bear interest rates that float with an established index. 

&#160; 

Our real estate portfolio is subject to certain risks, including (i) downturns in the California economy, (ii) significant interest rate fluctuations, (iii) reduction in real estate values in the California Central Valley, (iv) increased competition in pricing and loan structure, and (v) environmental risks, including natural disasters. As a result of the high concentration of the real estate loan in our loan portfolio, potential difficulties in the real estate markets c ould cause significant increases in nonperforming loans, which would reduce our profits. A decline in real estate values could cause some of our mortgage loans to become inadequately collateralized, which would expose us to a greater risk of loss. Additionally, a decline in real estate values could adversely affect our portfolio of commercial real estate loans and could result in a decline in the origination of such loans. However, we strive to reduce the exposure to such risks and seek to continue to maintain high quality in our real estate loans by (a) reviewing each loan request and each loan renewal individually, (b) using a dual signature approval system for the approval of each loan request for loans over a certain dollar amount, (c) adhering to written loan policies, including, among other factors, minimum collateral requirements, maximum loan-to-value ratio requirements, cash flow requirements and personal guarantees, (d) performing secondary appraisals from time to time, (e) conducting external independent credit review, and (f) conducting environmental reviews, where appropriate. We review each loan request on the basis of our ability to recover both principal and interest in view of the inherent risks. We monitor and stress test our entire portfolio, evaluating debt coverage ratios and loan-to-value ratios, on a quarterly basis. We monitor trends and evaluate exposure derived from simulated stressed market conditions. The portfolio is stratified by owner classification (either owner occupied or non-owner occupied), product type, geography and size. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, the aggregate loan-to-value of the entire commercial real estate portfolio was 50.8%. Historical data suggests that the Company continues to maintain strong LTV, which has served as a cushion against precipitous reductions in real estate values. Non-owner occupied real estate comprises 40.8% of the Company&#8217;s total commitments, as of December 31, 2015. The loan-to-value on the non-owner occupied segment was 46.6%, as of December 31, 2015. The highest concentration by product type is office buildings, which comprised 27.1% of total CRE loan commitments outstanding, as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Our portfolio diversity in terms of both product types and geographic distribution, combined with strong debt coverage ratios, a low aggregate loan-to-value and a high percentage of owner-occupied properties, significantly mitigate the risks associated with excessive commercial real estate concentration. These elements contribute strength to our overall real estate portfolio despite the current weakness in the real estate market. 

&#160; 

&#160; Commercial Business Lending. We offer commercial loans to sole proprietorships, partnerships and corporations, with an emphasis on the real estate related industry. These commercial loans include business lines of credit and commercial term loans to finance operations, to provide working capital or for specific purposes, such as to finance the purchase of assets, equipment or inventory. Since a borrower&#8217;s cash flow from operations is generally the primary source of repayment, our policies provide specific guidelines regarding required debt coverage and other important financial ratios. 

&#160; 

Lines of credit are extended to businesses or individuals based on the financial strength and integrity of the borrower and are secured primarily by real estate, accounts receivable and inventory, and have a maturity of one year or less. Such lines of credit bear an interest rate that floats with the prime rate, LIBOR or another established index. 

&#160; 

Commercial term loans are typically made to finance the acquisition of fixed assets, refinance short-term debts or to finance the purchase of businesses. Commercial term loans generally have terms from one to five years. They may be collateralized by the asset being acquired or other available assets and bear interest rates, which either floats with the prime rate, LIBOR or another established index or is fixed for the term of the loan. 

&#160; 

Our portfolio of commercial loans is also subject to certain risks, including (i) downturns in the California economy, (ii) significant interest rate fluctuations; and (iii) the deterioration of a borrower&#8217;s or guarantor&#8217;s financial capabilities. We attempt to reduce the exposure to such risks through (a) reviewing each loan request and renewal individually, (b) requiring a dual signature approval system, (c) mandating strict adherence to written loan policies, and (d) performing external independent credit review. In addition, we monitor loans based on short-term asset values on a monthly or quarterly basis. In general, during the term of the relationship, we receive and review the financial statements of our borrowing customers on an ongoing basis, and we promptly respond to any deterioration that we note. 

&#160; 

Small Business Administration Lending Services. Small Business Administration, or SBA, lending, forms an important part of our business. Our SBA lending service places an emphasis on minority-owned businesses. Our SBA market area includes the geographic areas encompassed by our full-service banking offices in the California Central Valley and in the Eastern Sierra. As an SBA lender, we enable borrowers to obtain SBA loans in order to acquire new businesses, expand existing businesses, and acquire locations in which to do business. 

&#160; 

Consumer Loans. Consumer loans include personal loans, auto loans, home improvement loans, home mortgage loans, revolving lines of credit and other loans typically made by banks to individual borrowers. We provide consumer loan products in an effort to diversify our product line. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Our consumer loan portfolio is subject to certain risks, including: 

&#160; 

&#9679; amount of credit offered to consumers in the market, 

&#160; 

&#9679; interest rate increases, and 

&#160; &#160; 

&#9679; consumer bankruptcy laws which allow consumers to discharge certain debts. 

&#160; 

We attempt to reduce the exposure to such risks through the direct approval of all consumer loans by: 

&#160; 

&#9679; reviewing each loan request and renewal individually, 

&#160; 

&#9679; using a dual signature system of approval, 

&#160; 

&#9679; strictly adhering to written credit policies and, 

&#160; 

&#9679; performing external independent credit review. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds 

&#160; 

Our primary sources of funds are deposits and loan repayments. Scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, whereas deposit inflows, outflows and unscheduled loan prepayments (which are influenced significantly by general interest rate levels, interest rates available on other investments, competition, economic conditions and other factors) are not as stable. Customer deposits also remain a primary source of funds, but these balances may be influenced by adverse market changes in the industry. We may resort to other borrowings, on an as needed basis, as follows: 

&#160; 

&#9679; on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in deposit inflows at less than projected levels, and 

&#160; 

&#9679; on a longer-term basis to support expanded lending activities and to match the maturity of repricing intervals of assets. 

&#160; 

We offer a variety of accounts for depositors, which are designed to attract both short-term and long-term deposits. These accounts include certificates of deposit, or &#8220;CDs&#8221;, regular savings accounts, money market accounts, checking and negotiable order of withdrawal, or &#8220;NOW&#8221;, accounts, savings accounts, health savings accounts and individual retirement accounts, or &#8220;IRAs&#8221;. These accounts generally earn interest at rates established by management based on competitive market factors and management&#8217;s desire to increase or decrease certain types or maturities of deposits. As needs arise, we augment these customer deposits with brokered deposits. The more significant deposit accounts offered by us are described below: 

&#160; 

Certificates of Deposit. We offer several types of CDs with a maximum maturity of five years. The substantial majority of our CDs have a maturity of one to twelve months and pay compounded interest typically credited monthly or at maturity. 

&#160; 

Regular Savings Accounts. We offer savings accounts that allow for unlimited ATM and in-branch deposits and withdrawals. Interest is compounded daily and paid monthly. 

&#160; 

Money Market Account. Money market accounts pay a variable interest rate that is tiered depending on the balance maintained in the account. Minimum opening balances vary. Interest is compounded daily and paid monthly. 

&#160; 

Checking and NOW Accounts. Checking and NOW accounts are generally non-interest and interest bearing accounts, respectively, and may include service fees based on activity and balances. NOW accounts pay interest, but require a higher minimum balance to avoid service charges. 

&#160; 

Federal Home Loan Bank Borrowings. To supplement our deposits as a source of funds for lending or investment, we borrow funds in the form of advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank. We regularly make use of Federal Home Loan Bank advances as part of our interest rate risk management, primarily to extend the duration of funding to match the longer term fixed rate loans held in the loan portfolio as part of our growth strategy. 

&#160; 

As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank system, we are required to invest in Federal Home Loan Bank stock based on a predetermined formula. Federal Home Loan Bank stock is a restricted investment security that can only be sold to other Federal Home Loan Bank members or redeemed by the Federal Home Loan Bank. As of December 31, 2015, we owned $2,958,000 in FHLB stock. 

&#160; 

Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank are typically secured by our entire real estate loan portfolio, which includes residential and commercial loans. At December 31, 2015, our borrowing limit with the Federal Home Loan Bank was approximately $198 million. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Internet Banking 

&#160; 

Since August 1, 2001, we have offered Internet banking service, which allows our customers to access their deposit accounts through the Internet. Customers are able to obtain transaction history and account information, transfer funds between accounts and make on-line bill payments. We intend to improve and develop our Internet banking products and delivery channels as the need arises and our resources permit. 

&#160; 

Other Services 

&#160; 

We also offer ATMs located at branch offices as well as seven other ATMs at various off site locations, and customer access to an ATM network. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Marketing 

&#160; 

Our marketing relies principally upon local advertising and promotional activity and upon personal contacts by our directors, officers and shareholders to attract business and to acquaint potential customers with our personalized services. We emphasize a high degree of personalized client service in order to be able to provide for each customer&#8217;s banking needs. Our marketing approach emphasizes the advantages of dealing with an independent, locally managed and state chartered bank to meet the particular needs of consumers, professionals and business customers in the community. Our management continually evaluates all of our banking services with regard to their profitability and efforts and makes determinations based on these evaluations whether to continue or modify our business plan, where appropriate. 

&#160; 

We do not currently have any plans to develop any new lines of business, which would require a material amount of capital investment on our part. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Regional Branch Competition. We consider our primary service area to be composed of the counties of San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Tuolumne, Inyo and Mono Counties, of California. The banking business in California generally, and in our primary service area, specifically, is competitive with respect to both loans and deposits and is dominated by a relatively small number of major banks which have many offices operating over wide geographic areas. These include Wells Fargo Bank, Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase Bank and Bank of the West. We compete for deposits and loans principally with these banks, as well as with savings and loan associations, thrift and loan associations, credit unions, mortgage companies, insurance companies, offerors of money market accounts and other lending institutions. 

&#160; 

Among the advantages of these institutions are their ability to finance extensive advertising campaigns and to allocate their investment assets to regions of highest yield and demand, their ability to offer certain services, such as international banking and trust services which are not offered directly by the Company and, the ability by virtue of their greater total capitalization, to have substantially higher lending limits than we do. In addition, as a result of increased consolidation and the passage of interstate banking legislation there is and will continue to be increased competition among banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions for the deposit and loan business of individuals and businesses. 

&#160; 

As of June 30, 2015, our primary service areas contained one hundred seventy-four (174) banking offices, with approximately $13.8 billion in total deposits. As of June 30, 2015, we had total deposits of approximately $684 million, which represented approximately 5.0% of the total deposits in the Bank&#8217;s primary service area. There can be no assurance that the Bank will maintain its competitive position against current and potential competitors, especially those with greater resources than the Bank. The deposits of the four (4) largest competing banks averaged approximately $122 million per office as of June 30, 2015. 

&#160; 

In order to compete with major financial institutions in our primary service areas, we use to the fullest extent the flexibility that our independent status permits. This includes an emphasis on specialized services, local promotional activity, and personal contacts by our officers, directors and employees. In the event that there are customers whose needs exceed our lending limits, we may arrange for such loans on a participation basis with other financial institutions. We also assist customers who require other services that we do not offer by obtaining such services from correspondent banks. However, no assurance can be given that our continued efforts to compete with other financial institutions will be successful. 

&#160; 

In addition to other banks, our competitors include savings institutions, credit unions, and numerous non-banking institutions, such as finance companies, leasing companies, insurance companies, brokerage firms, and investment banking firms. In recent years, increased competition has also developed from specialized finance and non-finance companies that offer money market and mutual funds, wholesale finance, credit card, and other consumer finance services, including on-line banking services and personal finance software. Strong competition for deposit and loan products affects the rates of those products as well as the terms on which they are offered to customers. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Other Competitive Factors. &#160; The more general competitive trends in the industry include increased consolidation and competition. Strong competitors, other than financial institutions, have entered banking markets with focused products targeted at highly profitable customer segments. Many of these competitors are able to compete across geographic boundaries and provide customers increasing access to meaningful alternatives to banking services in nearly all significant products areas. Mergers between financial institutions have placed additional pressure on banks within the industry to streamline their operations, reduce expenses, and increase revenues to remain competitive. Competition has also intensified due to the federal and state interstate banking laws, which permit banking organizations to expand geographically, and the California market has been particularly attractive to out-of-state institutions. The Financial Modernization Act, which has made it possible for full affiliations to occur between banks and securities firms, insurance companies, and other financial companies, is also expected to intensify competitive conditions. 

&#160; 

Technological innovations have also resulted in increased competition in the financial services industry. Such innovations have, for example, made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer customers automated transfer payment services that were previously considered traditional banking products. In addition, many customers now expect a choice of several delivery systems and channels, including telephone, mail, home computer, mobile devices, ATMs, self-service branches and/or in-store branches. 

&#160; 

Business Concentration. No individual or single group of related accounts is considered material in relation to our total assets or deposits, or in relation to our overall business. However, approximately 84% of our loan portfolio held for investment at December 31, 2015 consisted of real estate-related loans, including construction loans, miniperm loans, real estate mortgage loans and commercial loans secured by real estate. Moreover, our business activities are currently focused primarily in Central California, with the majority of our business concentrated in San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Tuolumne, Inyo and Mono Counties. Consequently, our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon the general trends in the Central California economies and, in particular, the residential and commercial real estate markets. In addition, the concentration of our operations in Central California exposes us to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes, such as earthquakes, fires and floods in this region. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 167 employees (135 full-time employees and 32 part-time employees). None of our employees are currently represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We added 9 employees as a result of the merger of Mother Lode Bank into the Bank. 

&#160; 

Economic Conditions and Legislative and Regulatory Developments 

&#160; 

As it is the case with financial institutions with our size and scope, our profitability primarily depends on interest rate differentials. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control and cannot be predicted, such as inflation, recession and unemployment, and the impact that future changes in domestic and foreign economic conditions might have on the Company. A more detailed discussion of the Company&#8217;s interest rate risks and the mitigation of those risks is included in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Our business is also influenced by the monetary and fiscal policies of the Federal government and the policies of regulatory agencies. The Federal Reserve Board implements national monetary policies (with objectives such as maintaining price stability, stimulating growth and reducing unemployment) through its open-market operations in U.S. Government securities, by adjusting the required level of reserves for depository institutions subject to its reserve requirements, and by varying the target Federal funds and discount rates applicable to borrowings by depository institutions. The actions of the Federal Reserve Board in these areas influence the growth of bank loans, investments, and deposits and also affect interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The nature and impact of any future changes in monetary and fiscal policies on us cannot be predicted. 

&#160; 

From time to time, federal and state legislation is enacted that may have the effect of materially increasing the cost of doing business, limiting or expanding permissible activities, or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial services providers. In response to the economic downturn and financial industry instability, legislative and regulatory initiatives were, and are expected to continue to be, introduced and implemented, which substantially intensify the regulation of the financial services industry. Moreover, in light of the economic environment over the last three to five years, bank regulatory agencies have responded to concerns and trends identified in examinations. While their response resulted in the increased issuance and continuation of enforcement actions against financial institutions towards the end of the last decade and into the beginning of this decade, the level of such actions compared to the peak in 2010 has decreased. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Supervision and Regulation in General 

&#160; 

The banking and financial services business in which we engage is highly regulated. Such regulation is intended, among other things, to protect depositors insured by the FDIC and the entire banking system. These regulations affect our lending practices, consumer protections, capital structure, investment practices and dividend policy. 

&#160; 

The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The Company and the Bank are each subject to supervision and regulation by a number of federal and state agencies and regulatory bodies, as outlined below. 

&#160; 

Upon effectiveness of the bank holding company reorganization on July 2, 2008, the Company became subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (&#8220;BHCA&#8221;). As a bank holding company, the Company is regulated and is subject to inspection, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. It is also subject to the California Financial Code, as well as limited oversight by the DBO and the FDIC. Under the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s regulations, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks. The BHCA regulates the activities of holding companies including acquisitions, mergers, and consolidations and, together with the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act of 1999, the scope of allowable banking activities. 

&#160; 

As a California-state chartered bank, the Bank is subject to primary supervision, examination and regulation by the DBO and the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board is the primary federal regulator of state member banks. The Bank is also subject to regulation by the FDIC, which insures the Bank&#8217;s deposits as permitted by law. If, as a result of an examination of a bank, the Federal Reserve Board determines that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of its operations are unsatisfactory, or that it or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation, various remedies are available to the Federal Reserve Board. Such remedies include the power to: enjoin &#8220;unsafe or unsound&#8221; practices; require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice; issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced; direct an increase in capital; restrict growth; assess civil monetary penalties; remove officers and directors; institute a receivership; and, ultimately terminate the bank&#8217;s deposit insurance, which would result in a revocation of its charter. The DBO separately holds many of the same remedial powers. 

&#160; 

The commercial banking business is also influenced by the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, also known as the FRB or the Federal Reserve Board. As a member of the Federal Reserve System, we are subject to certain regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The regulations of these agencies govern most aspects of our business, including the filing of periodic reports, and activities relating to dividends, investments, loans, borrowings, capital requirements, certain check-clearing activities, branching, mergers and acquisitions, reserves against deposits, and numerous other areas. Supervision, legal action and examination of us by the FRB is generally intended to protect depositors and is not intended for the protection of our shareholders. The Federal Reserve Board implements national monetary policies (with objectives such as curbing inflation and combating recession) by its open-market operations in United States Government securities, by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial intermediaries subject to its reserve requirements and by varying the discount rates applicable to borrowings by depository institutions. The actions of the Federal Reserve Board in these areas influence the growth of bank loans, investments and deposits and affects interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. Indirectly such actions may also impact the ability of non-bank financial institutions to compete with us. The nature and impact of any future changes in monetary policies cannot be predicted. 

&#160; 

The laws, regulations and policies affecting financial services businesses are continuously under review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. From time to time, legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business, limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial intermediaries. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks, bank holding companies and other financial intermediaries are frequently made in Congress, in the California legislature and by various bank regulatory agencies and other professional agencies. Changes in the laws, regulations or policies that impact us cannot necessarily be predicted, but they may have a material effect on our business and earnings. 

&#160; 

The federal and state bank regulatory agencies may respond to concerns and trends identified in examinations by issuing enforcement actions to, and entering into cease and desist orders, consent orders and memoranda of understanding with, financial institutions requiring action by management and boards of directors to address credit quality, liquidity, risk management and capital adequacy concerns, as well as other safety and soundness or compliance issues. Banks and bank holding companies are also subject to examination and potential enforcement actions by their state regulatory agencies. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Bank Holding Company and Bank Regulation 

&#160; 

Bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are subject to significant regulation and restrictions by Federal and State laws and regulatory agencies. Federal and State laws, regulations and restrictions, which may affect the cost of doing business, limit permissible activities and expansion or impact the competitive balance between banks and other financial services providers, are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the FDIC deposit insurance fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;), and secondarily for the stability of the U.S. banking system. They are not intended for the benefit of shareholders of financial institutions. The following discussion of key statutes and regulations to which the Company and the Bank are subject is a summary and does not purport to be complete nor does it address all applicable statutes and regulations. This discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the statutes and regulations referred to in this discussion. 

&#160; 

The wide range of requirements and restrictions contained in both Federal and State banking laws include: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9744;&#61623; 

Requirements that bank holding companies serve as a source of strength for their banking subsidiaries. In addition, the regulatory agencies have &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; authority to limit activities and order an assessment of a bank holding company if the capital of a bank subsidiary falls below capital levels required by the regulators. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9744;&#61623; 

Limitations on dividends payable to shareholders. A substantial portion of the Company&#8217;s funds to pay dividends or to pay principal and interest on our debt obligations is derived from dividends paid by the Bank. The Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s ability to pay dividends is subject to legal and regulatory restrictions. The Federal Reserve Board has authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends if such payment is deemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9744; 

Limitations on dividends payable by bank subsidiaries. &#160; These dividends are subject to various legal and regulatory restrictions. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depositary institution&#8217;s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements that provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9744; 

Safety and soundness requirements. Banks must be operated in a safe and sound manner and meet standards applicable to internal controls, information systems, internal audit, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, as well as other operational and management standards. These safety and soundness requirements give bank regulatory agencies significant latitude in exercising their supervisory authority and their authority to initiate informal or formal enforcement action. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#9744;&#61623; 

Requirements for approval of acquisitions and activities. Prior approval or non-objection of the applicable federal regulatory agencies is required for most acquisitions and mergers and in order to engage in certain non-banking activities and activities that have been determined by the Federal Reserve to be financial in nature, incidental to financial activities, or complementary to a financial activity. Laws and regulations governing state-chartered banks contain similar provisions concerning acquisitions and activities. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9744;&#61623; 

The Community Reinvestment Act (the &#8220;CRA&#8221;). The CRA requires that banks help meet the credit needs in their communities, including the availability of credit to low and moderate income individuals. If the Company or the Bank fails to adequately serve their communities, penalties may be imposed, including denials of applications for branches, to add subsidiaries and affiliates, or to merge with or purchase other financial institutions. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9744;&#61623; 

The Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act, and other anti-money laundering laws. These laws and regulations require financial institutions to assist U.S. Government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and other illegal acts by maintaining policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering, terrorist financing, and other suspicious activity. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9744;&#61623; 

Limitations on the amount of loans to one borrower and its affiliates and to executive officers and directors. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9744; 

Limitations on transactions with affiliates. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9744;&#61623; 

Restrictions on the nature and amount of any investments in, and ability to underwrite certain securities. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9744;&#61623; 

Requirements for opening of branches intra- and interstate. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9744;&#61623; 

Fair lending and truth in lending laws to ensure equal access to credit and to protect consumers in credit transactions. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9744; 

Provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (&#8220;GLB Act&#8221;) and other federal and state laws dealing with privacy for nonpublic personal information of customers. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The following discussion summarizes certain significant laws, rules and regulations affecting both the Company and the Bank. The Bank addresses the many state and federal regulations it is subject to through a comprehensive compliance program that addresses the various risks associated with these issues. The following discussion is not meant to cover all applicable rules and regulations and it is qualified in its entirety by reference to such laws, rules and regulations which may change from time to time. 

&#160; &#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

&#160; 

The events of the past several years have led to numerous new laws and regulatory pronouncements in the United States and internationally for financial institutions. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), enacted in 2010, is one of the most far reaching legislative actions affecting the financial services industry in decades and significantly restructures the financial regulatory regime in the United States. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act broadly affects the financial services industry by creating new resolution authorities, requiring ongoing stress testing of capital, mandating higher capital and liquidity requirements, increasing regulation of executive and incentive-based compensation and requiring numerous other provisions aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services sector depending, in part, on the size of the financial institution. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9744; 

capital standards applicable to bank holding companies may be no less stringent than those applied to insured depository institutions; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9744; 

annual stress tests and early remediation or so-called living wills are required for larger banks with more than $50 billion of assets as well risk committees of their boards of directors that include a risk expert and such requirements may have the effect of establishing new best practices standards for smaller banks; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9744; 

trust preferred securities must generally be deducted from Tier 1 capital over a three-year phase-in period ending in 2016, although depository institution holding companies with assets of less than $15 billion as of year-end 2009 are grandfathered with respect to such securities for purposes of calculating regulatory capital; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9744; 

the assessment base for federal deposit insurance was changed to consolidated assets less tangible capital instead of the amount of insured deposits, which generally increased the insurance fees of larger banks, but had relatively less impact on smaller banks; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9744; 

repeal of the federal prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits, including business checking accounts, and made permanent the $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9744; 

the establishment of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;) with responsibility for promulgating regulations designed to protect consumers&#8217; financial interests and prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices by financial institutions, and with authority to directly examine those financial institutions with $10 billion or more in assets for compliance with the regulations promulgated by the CFPB; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9744; 

limits, or places significant burdens and compliance and other costs, on activities traditionally conducted by banking organizations, such as originating and securitizing mortgage loans and other financial assets, arranging and participating in swap and derivative transactions, proprietary trading and investing in private equity and other funds; and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9744; 

the establishment of new compensation restrictions and standards regarding the time, manner and form of compensation given to key executives and other personnel receiving incentive compensation, including documentation and governance, proxy access by stockholders, deferral and claw-back requirements. 

&#160; 

As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, federal regulators have adopted regulations to (i) increase capital requirements on banks and bank holding companies pursuant to Basel III, and (ii) implement the so-called &#8220;Volcker Rule&#8221; of the Dodd-Frank Act, which significantly restricts certain activities by covered bank holding companies, including restrictions on proprietary trading and private equity investing. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Many of the regulations to implement the Dodd-Frank Act have not yet been published for comment or adopted in final form and a number of the regulations that have been adopted in final form will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the Company and the Bank, our customers or the financial industry more generally. Individually and collectively, these regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may materially and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s business, financial condition, and results of operations. Provisions in the legislation that require revisions to the capital requirements of the Company and the Bank could require the Company and the Bank to seek additional sources of capital in the future. 

&#160; 

Volcker Rule 

&#160; 

The final rules adopted on December 10, 2013, to implement a part of the Dodd-Frank Act commonly referred to as the &#8220;Volcker Rule&#8221;, prohibit insured depository institutions and companies affiliated with insured depository institutions (&#8220;banking entities&#8221;) from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of certain securities, derivatives, commodity futures and options on these instruments, for their own account. The final rules also impose limits on banking entities&#8217; investments in, and other relationships with, hedge funds or private equity funds. These rules became effective on April 1, 2014. Certain collateralized debt obligations (&#8220;CDOs&#8221;), securities backed by trust preferred securities which were initially defined as covered funds subject to the investment prohibitions, have been exempted to address the concern that many community banks holding such CDOs securities may have been required to recognize significant losses on those securities. 

&#160; 

Like the Dodd-Frank Act, the final rules provide exemptions for certain activities, including market making, underwriting, hedging, trading in government obligations, insurance company activities, and organizing and offering hedge funds or private equity funds. The final rules also clarify that certain activities are not prohibited, including acting as agent, broker, or custodian. 

&#160; 

The compliance requirements under the final rules vary based on the size of the banking entity and the scope of activities conducted. Banking entities with significant trading operations will be required to establish a detailed compliance program and their CEOs will be required to attest that the program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the final rule. Independent testing and analysis of an institution&#8217;s compliance program will also be required. The final rules reduce the burden on smaller, less-complex institutions by limiting their compliance and reporting requirements. Additionally, a banking entity that does not engage in covered trading activities will not need to establish a compliance program. The Company and the Bank held no investment positions at December 31, 2014 or 2015 that were subject to the final rule. Therefore, while these new rules may require us to conduct certain internal analysis and reporting, we believe that they will not require any material changes in our operations or business. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Capital Adequacy Requirements 

&#160; 

Banks and bank holding companies are subject to various capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weighting and other factors. 

&#160; 

The federal banking agencies have adopted risk-based minimum capital guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization&#8217;s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets and transactions which are recorded as off balance sheet items. Under these guidelines, nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages, which range from 0% for assets with low credit risk, such as federal banking agencies, to 100% for assets with relatively high credit risk. The higher the category, the more risk a bank is subject to and thus the more capital that is required. 

&#160; 

The regulatory agencies&#8217; risk-based capital guidelines are based upon capital accords of the internal Basel Committee on Bank Supervision (&#8220;Basel Committee&#8221;), a committee of central banks and bank supervisors/regulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines, which each country&#8217;s supervisors can use to determine the supervisory policies they apply to their home jurisdiction. In December 2010, the Basel Committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation, now officially identified as &#8220;Basel III.&#8221; Basel III, when fully phased-in, would require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital than currently required, with a greater emphasis on common equity. The Basel III capital framework, among other things: 

&#160; 

&#8226; introduces as a new capital measure, Common Equity Tier 1 (&#8220;CET1&#8221;), more commonly known in the United States as &#8220;Tier 1 Common,&#8221; and defines CET1 narrowly by requiring that most adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, and expands the scope of the adjustments as compared to existing regulations; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#8226; when fully phased in, requires banks to maintain: (i) a newly adopted international standard, a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%); (ii) an additional &#8220;SIFI buffer&#8221; for those large institutions deemed to be systemically important, ranging from 1.0% to 2.5%, and up to 3.5% under certain conditions; (iii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation); (iv) a minimum ratio of Total (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation); and (v) as a newly adopted international standard, a minimum leverage ratio of 3%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures (as the average for each quarter of the month-end ratios for the quarter); and &#160; 

&#160;

&#8226; an additional &#8220;countercyclical capital buffer,&#8221; generally to be imposed when national regulators determine that excess aggregate credit growth becomes associated with a buildup of systemic risk, that would be a CET1 add-on to the capital conservation buffer in the range of 0% to 2.5% when fully implemented. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In July 2014, the U.S. banking agencies approved the U.S. version of Basel III. The federal bank regulatory agencies adopted version of Basel III revises the risk-based and leverage capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with Basel III and to meet the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. Although many of the rules contained in these final regulations are applicable only to large, internationally active banks, some of them will apply on a phased in basis to all banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank. Among other things, the rules establish a new minimum common equity Tier 1 ratio (4.5% of risk-weighted assets), a higher minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital requirement (6.0% of risk-weighted assets) and a minimum non-risk-based leverage ratio (4.00% eliminating a 3.00% exception for higher rated banks). The new additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk weighted assets over each of the required capital ratios will be phased in from 2016 to 2019 and must be met to avoid limitations on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends, repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses. The additional &#8220;countercyclical capital buffer&#8221; is also required for larger and more complex institutions. The new rules assign higher risk weighting to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. The rules also change the permitted composition of Tier 1 capital to exclude trust preferred securities, mortgage servicing rights and certain deferred tax assets and include unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities (with a one-time opt out option for Standardized Banks (banks with less than $250 billion of total consolidated assets and less than $10 billion of foreign exposures)). The rules, including alternative requirements for smaller community financial institutions like the Company, would be phased in through 2019. The implementation of the Basel III framework for the Company and the Bank commenced on January 1, 2015. 

&#160; 

The Bank is well capitalized. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Bank&#8217;s Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio was 12.2% and 14.5%, and our Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio was 11.1% and 13.2%, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank&#8217;s Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio was 11.1%. 

&#160; 

In addition to the risk-based guidelines, federal banking regulators require banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of Tier 1 capital to total average assets, referred to as the leverage ratio. Banks that have received the highest rating of the five categories used by regulators to rate banks and are not anticipating or experiencing any significant growth must maintain a ratio of Tier 1 capital (net of all intangibles) to adjusted total assets, or &#8220;Leverage Capital Ratio&#8221;, of at least 3%. All other institutions are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 100 to 200 basis points above the 3% minimum, for a minimum of 4% to 5%. Pursuant to federal regulations, banks must maintain capital levels commensurate with the level of risk to which they are exposed, including the volume and severity of problem loans. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Bank&#8217;s Leverage Capital Ratios were 9.1% and 10.2%, respectively. 

&#160; 

Federal banking regulators may set capital requirements higher than the minimums described above for financial institutions whose circumstances warrant it. For example, a financial institution experiencing or anticipating significant growth may be expected to maintain capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

A bank may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if, after notice and the opportunity for a hearing, the appropriate federal agency finds an unsafe or unsound condition or practice so warrants, but no bank may be treated as &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; unless its actual capital ratio warrants such treatment. 

&#160;

At each successively lower capital category, an insured bank is subject to increased restrictions on its operations. For example, a bank is generally prohibited from paying management fees to any controlling persons or from making capital distributions, if to do so would make the Bank &#8220;undercapitalized.&#8221; Asset growth and branching restrictions apply to undercapitalized banks, which are required to submit written capital restoration plans meeting specified requirements (including a guarantee by the parent holding company, if any). &#8220;Significantly undercapitalized&#8221; banks are subject to broad regulatory authority, including among other things, capital directives, forced mergers, restrictions on the rates of interest they may pay on deposits, restrictions on asset growth and activities, and prohibitions on paying certain bonuses without FRB approval. Even more severe restrictions apply to critically undercapitalized banks. Most importantly, except under limited circumstances, the appropriate federal banking agency is required to appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured bank not later than 90 days after the Bank becomes critically undercapitalized. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions, insured banks may be subject to potential actions by federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law, rule, regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency. Enforcement actions may include the issuance of cease and desist orders, termination of insurance of deposits (in the case of a bank), the imposition of civil money penalties, the issuance of directives to increase capital, formal and informal agreements, or removal and prohibition orders against &#8220;institution-affiliated&#8221; parties. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Dividends 

&#160; 

The payment of cash dividends by the Bank to the Company is subject to restrictions set forth in the California Financial Code (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). Prior to any distribution from the Bank to the Company, a calculation is made to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Code and to ensure that the Bank remains within capital guidelines set forth by the DBO and the FRB. In the event that the intended distribution from the Bank to the Company exceeds the restriction in the Code, advance approval from FRB is required. Management anticipates that there will be sufficient earnings at the Bank level to provide dividends to the Company to meet its cash requirements for 2016. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Safety and Soundness Standards 

&#160; 

Federal banking agencies have also adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards for all insured depository institutions. Those guidelines relate to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan underwriting and documentation, compensation and interest rate exposure. In general, the standards are designed to assist the federal banking agencies in identifying and addressing problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan and institute enforcement proceedings, if an acceptable compliance plan is not submitted. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Deposit Insurance and FDIC Insurance Assessments 

&#160; 

Our deposits are insured by the FDIC to the maximum amount permitted by law, which is currently $250,000 per depositor. The Dodd-Frank Act made the deposit insurance coverage permanent at the $250,000 level retroactive to January 1, 2008. 

&#160; 

On February 7, 2011, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC approved a rule that changes the FDIC insurance assessment base from adjusted domestic deposits to a bank&#8217;s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, defined as Tier 1 capital. Since the new base is larger than the current base, the new rule lowers assessment rates to between 2.5 and 9 basis points on the broader base for banks in the lowest risk category, and 30 to 45 basis points for banks in the highest risk category. The change was effective beginning with the second quarter of 2011. Since we have a solid core deposit base and do not rely heavily on borrowings and brokered deposits, the benefit of the lower assessment rate (which has dropped by approximately half for us) significantly outweighed the effect of a wider assessment base. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank act also provided depositors at all FDIC-insured institutions with unlimited deposit insurance coverage on traditional checking accounts that do not pay interest and Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts beginning December 31, 2010 through the end of 2012, when this provision expired. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Community Reinvestment Act 

&#160; 

We are subject to certain requirements and reporting obligations involving the Community Reinvestment Act, or &#8220;CRA&#8221;. The CRA generally requires federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of financial institutions in meeting the credit needs of local communities, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA further requires that a record be kept of whether a financial institution meets its community credit needs, which record will be taken into account when evaluating applications for, among other things, domestic branches, consummating mergers or acquisitions, or holding company formations. In measuring a bank&#8217;s compliance with its CRA obligations, the regulators now utilize a performance-based evaluation system, which bases CRA ratings on the Company&#8217;s actual lending service and investment performance, rather than on the extent to which the institution conducts needs assessments, documents community outreach activities or complies with other procedural requirements. In connection with its assessment of CRA performance, the FRB assigns a rating of &#8220;outstanding,&#8221; &#8220;satisfactory,&#8221; &#8220;needs to improve&#8221; or &#8220;substantial noncompliance.&#8221; Our CRA performance is evaluated by the FRB under the intermediate small bank requirements. The FRB&#8217;s last CRA performance examination was performed on us and completed in July of 2013 and we received an overall &#8220;Satisfactory&#8221; CRA Assessment Rating.

Anti-Money Laundering Regulations 

&#160; 

A series of banking laws and regulations beginning with the Bank Secrecy Act in 1970 require banks to prevent, detect, and report illicit or illegal financial activities to the federal government to prevent money laundering, international drug trafficking, and terrorism. Under the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships as well as enhanced due diligence and &#8220;know your customer&#8221; standards in their dealings with high risk customers, foreign financial institutions, and foreign individuals and entities. We have extensive controls to comply with these requirements. 

&#160; 

Privacy and Data Security 

&#160; 

The Gramm-Leach Bliley Act (&#8220;GLBA&#8221;) of 1999 imposed requirements on financial institutions with respect to consumer privacy. The GLBA generally prohibits disclosure of consumer information to non-affiliated third parties unless the consumer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure. Financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to consumers annually. The GLBA also directs federal regulators to prescribe standards for the security of consumer information. We are subject to such standards, as well as standards for notifying consumers in the event of a security breach. We must disclose our privacy policy to consumers and permit consumers to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of having non-public customer information disclosed to third parties. We are required to have an information security program to safeguard the confidentiality and security of customer information and to ensure proper disposal. Customers must be notified when unauthorized disclosure involves sensitive customer information that may be misused. 

&#160; 

Other Consumer Protection Laws and Regulations 

&#160; 

Bank regulatory agencies are increasingly focusing on compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations. Examination and enforcement has become intense, and banks have been advised to monitor compliance carefully with various consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations. For example, the federal Interagency Task Force on Fair Lending issued a policy statement on discrimination in home mortgage lending describing three methods that federal agencies will use to prove discrimination: overt evidence of discrimination, evidence of disparate treatment, and evidence of disparate impact. In addition to CRA and fair lending requirements, we are subject to numerous other federal consumer protection statutes and regulations. Due to heightened regulatory concern related to compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations generally, we may incur additional compliance costs or be required to expend additional funds for investments in the local communities we serve. 

&#160; 

Restriction on Transactions between Member Banks and their Affiliates 

&#160; 

Transactions between the Company and the Bank are quantitatively and qualitatively restricted under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve Regulation W. Section 23A places restrictions on the Bank&#8217;s &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; with the Company, including loans and other extensions of credit, investments in the securities of, and purchases of assets from the Company. Section 23B requires that certain transactions, including all covered transactions, be on market terms and conditions. Federal Reserve Regulation W combines statutory restrictions on transactions between the Bank and the Company with FRB interpretations in an effort to simplify compliance with Sections 23A and 23B. 

&#160; 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 

&#160; 

On July 30, 2002, President Bush signed into law The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or &#8220;Sarbanes-Oxley Act&#8221;. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act addresses accounting oversight and corporate governance matters relating to the operations of public companies. During 2003, the Commission issued a number of regulations under the directive of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act significantly increasing public company governance-related obligations and filing requirements, including: 

&#160; 

&#9679; the establishment of an independent public oversight of public company accounting firms by a board that will set auditing, quality and ethical standards for and have investigative and disciplinary powers over such accounting firms, 

&#160; 

&#9679; the enhanced regulation of the independence, responsibilities and conduct of accounting firms which provide auditing services to public companies, 

&#160; &#160; 

&#9679; the increase of penalties for fraud related crimes, 

&#160; 

&#9679; the enhanced disclosure, certification, and monitoring of financial statements, internal financial controls and the audit process, and 

&#160; 

&#9679; the enhanced and accelerated reporting of corporate disclosures and internal governance. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Furthermore, in November 2003, in response to the directives of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, NASDAQ adopted substantially expanded corporate governance criteria for the issuers of securities quoted on the NASDAQ markets. The new NASDAQ rules govern, among other things, the enhancement and regulation of corporate disclosure and internal governance of listed companies and of the authority, role and responsibilities of their boards of directors and, in particular, of &#8220;independent&#8221; members of such boards of directors, in the areas of nominations, corporate governance, compensation and the monitoring of the audit and internal financial control processes. 

&#160; 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Commission rules promulgated thereunder, and the new NASDAQ governance requirements have required the Company to review its current procedures and policies to determine whether they comply with the new legislation and its implementing regulations. The Company is primarily responsible for ensuring compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley and the NASDAQ governance rules, as applicable. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Securities Laws and Corporate Governance 

&#160; 

The Company is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both as administered by the SEC. As a company listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the Company is subject to NASDAQ listing standards for listed companies. 

&#160; 

As discussed above, we are also subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, and other federal and state laws and regulations which address, among other issues, required executive certification of financial presentations, corporate governance requirements for board audit committees and their members, and disclosure of controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. NASDAQ has also adopted corporate governance rules, which are intended to allow shareholders and investors to more easily and efficiently monitor the performance of companies and their directors. 

&#160; 

Finally, the Company is subject to the provisions of the California General Corporation Law, while the Bank is also subject to the California Financial Code provisions. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Environmental Regulations 

&#160; 

In the course of our business, we may foreclose and take title to real estate, and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Other Pending and Proposed Legislation 

&#160; 

Other legislative and regulatory initiatives which could affect us and the banking industry, in general, are pending and additional initiatives may be proposed or introduced before the United States Congress, the California legislature and other governmental bodies in the future. Such proposals, if enacted, may further alter the structure, regulation and competitive relationship among financial institutions, and may subject us to increased regulation, disclosure and reporting requirements. In addition, the various banking regulatory agencies often adopt new rules and regulations to implement and enforce existing legislation. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any such legislation or regulations may be enacted or the extent to which our business would be affected thereby.
