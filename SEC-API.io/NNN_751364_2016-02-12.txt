&#32; &#32;1 

Business Strategies and Policies 

The following is a discussion of NNN&#8217;s operating strategy and certain of its investment, financing and other policies. These strategies and policies have been set by management and the Board of Directors and, in general, may be amended or revised from time to time by management and the Board of Directors without a vote of NNN&#8217;s stockholders. 

Operating Strategies 

NNN&#8217;s strategy is to invest primarily in retail real estate that is typically well located within each local market for its tenants&#8217; retail lines of trade. Management believes that these types of properties, generally leased pursuant to triple-net leases, provide attractive opportunities for stable current returns and the potential for increased returns and capital appreciation. Triple-net leases typically require the tenant to pay property operating expenses such as insurance, utilities, repairs, maintenance, capital expenditures and real estate taxes and assessments. Initial lease terms are generally 15 to 20 years. 

NNN holds real estate assets until it determines that the sale of such an asset is advantageous in view of NNN&#8217;s investment objectives. In deciding whether to sell a real estate asset, NNN may consider factors such as potential capital appreciation, net cash flow, tenant credit quality, tenant's line of trade, portfolio composition, market lease rates, local market conditions, potential use of sale proceeds and federal income tax considerations. 

NNN&#8217;s management team focuses on certain key indicators to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. These key indicators include the composition of the Property Portfolio (such as tenant, geographic and line of trade diversification), the occupancy rate of the Property Portfolio, certain financial performance ratios and profitability measures, industry trends and NNN's performance compared to that of the REIT industry. 

The operating strategies employed by NNN have allowed NNN to increase the annual dividend (paid quarterly) per common share for 26 &#32;consecutive years, one of only four publicly traded REITs to do so. 

Investment in Real Estate or Interests in Real Estate 

NNN&#8217;s management believes that single tenant, freestanding net lease retail properties will continue to provide attractive investment opportunities and that NNN is well suited to take advantage of these opportunities because of its experience in accessing capital markets, and its ability to source, underwrite and acquire properties. 

In evaluating a particular acquisition, management may consider a variety of factors, including but not limited to: 

&#8226; 

the location, visibility and accessibility of the property, 

&#8226; 

the geographic area and demographic characteristics of the community, as well as the local real estate market, including potential for growth, market rents, and existing or potential competing properties or retailers, 

&#8226; 

the size, age and title status of the property, 

&#8226; 

the purchase price, 

&#8226; 

the non-financial terms of the proposed acquisition, 

&#8226; 

the availability of funds or other consideration for the proposed acquisition and the cost thereof, 

&#8226; 

the compatibility of the property with NNN&#8217;s existing portfolio, 

&#8226; 

the quality of construction and design and the current physical condition of the property, 

&#8226; 

the property-level operating history, 

&#8226; 

the financial and other characteristics of the existing tenant, 

&#8226; 

the tenant&#8217;s business plan, operating history and management team, 

&#8226; 

the tenant&#8217;s industry, 

&#8226; 

the terms of any leases, 

&#8226; 

the rent to be paid by the tenant, 

&#8226; 

the potential for, and current extent of, any environmental problems, and 

&#8226; 

any existing indebtedness encumbering the property which may be assumed or incurred in connection with acquiring or refinancing these investments. 

NNN intends to engage in future investment activities in a manner that is consistent with the maintenance of its status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Additionally, NNN does not intend to engage in activities that will make NNN an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 

&#32; &#32;2 

Investments in Real Estate Mortgages, Commercial Mortgage Residual Interests, and Securities of or Interests in Persons Engaged in Real Estate Activities 

While NNN&#8217;s primary business objectives emphasize retail properties, NNN may invest in (i) a wide variety of property and tenant types, (ii) leases, mortgages, commercial mortgage residual interests and other types of real estate interests, (iii) loans secured by personal property, (iv) loans secured by partnership or membership interests in partnerships or limited liability companies, respectively, or (v) securities of other REITs, or other issuers, including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities. 

Financing Strategy 

NNN&#8217;s financing objective is to manage its capital structure effectively in order to provide sufficient capital to execute its operating strategies while servicing its debt requirements and providing value to its stockholders. NNN generally utilizes debt and equity security offerings, bank borrowings, the sale of properties, and to a lesser extent, internally generated funds to meet its capital needs. 

NNN typically funds its short-term liquidity requirements including investments in additional properties with cash from its $650,000,000 &#32;unsecured revolving credit facility ("Credit Facility"). As of December 31, 2015 , there was no &#32;outstanding balance and $650,000,000 &#32;was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility. 

As of December 31, 2015 , NNN&#8217;s ratio of total debt to total gross assets (before accumulated depreciation and amortization) was approximately 33 &#32;percent and the ratio of secured indebtedness to total gross assets was less than one &#32;percent. The ratio of total debt to total market capitalization was approximately 25 &#32;percent. Certain financial agreements contain covenants that limit NNN&#8217;s ability to incur additional debt under certain circumstances. 

NNN anticipates it will be able to obtain additional financing for short-term and long-term liquidity requirements as further described in "Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Liquidity." However, there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital will be available, or that the terms will be acceptable or advantageous to NNN. 

The organizational documents of NNN do not limit the absolute amount or percentage of indebtedness that NNN may incur. Additionally, NNN may change its financing strategy at any time. 

Strategies and Policy Changes 

Any of NNN&#8217;s strategies or policies described above may be changed at any time by NNN without notice to or a vote of NNN&#8217;s stockholders. 

Property Portfolio 

As of December 31, 2015 , NNN owned 2,257 &#32;Properties with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 24,964,000 &#32;square feet, located in 47 &#32;states, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 11.4 &#32;years. Approximately 99 &#32;percent of total Properties were leased as of December 31, 2015 .

Leases 

The following is a summary of the general structure of the leases in the Property Portfolio, although the specific terms of each lease can vary. Generally, the Property leases provide for initial terms of 15 to 20 years. As of December 31, 2015 , the weighted average remaining lease term of the Property Portfolio was approximately 11.4 &#32;years. The Properties are generally leased under net leases, pursuant to which the tenant typically bears responsibility for substantially all property costs and expenses associated with ongoing maintenance and operation, including utilities, property taxes and insurance. NNN's leases provide for annual base rental payments (payable in monthly installments) ranging from $6,000 to $2,668,000 (average of $220,000), and generally provide for increases in rent as a result of (i) fixed increases, (ii) increases in the Consumer Price Index ("CPI"), or, to a lesser extent, (iii) increases in the tenant&#8217;s sales volume. 

Generally, NNN's leases provide the tenant with one or more multi-year renewal options subject to generally the same terms and conditions provided under the initial lease term. Some of the leases also provide that in the event NNN wishes to sell the Property subject to that lease, NNN first must offer the lessee the right to purchase the Property on the same terms and conditions as any offer which NNN intends to accept for the sale of the Property. 

The following table summarizes the lease expirations, assuming none of the tenants exercise renewal options, of the Property Portfolio for each of the next 10 years and then thereafter in the aggregate as of December 31, 2015 :

As of December 31, 2015 , NNN did not have any tenant that accounted for ten percent or more of its rental income. 

Commercial Mortgage Residual Interests 

NNN holds the commercial mortgage residual interests ("Residuals") from seven securitizations. Each of the Residuals is reported at fair value; unrealized gains or losses are reported as other comprehensive income in stockholders&#8217; equity, and other than temporary losses as a result of a change in timing or amount of estimated cash flows are recorded as an other than temporary valuation impairment. The Residuals had an estimated fair value of $11,115,000 &#32;and $11,626,000 &#32;at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

&#32; &#32;5 

Governmental Regulations Affecting Properties 

Property Environmental Considerations. Subject to a determination of the level of risk and potential cost of remediation, NNN may acquire a property where some level of environmental contamination may exist. Investments in real property create a potential for substantial environmental liability for the owner of such property from the presence or discharge of hazardous materials on the property or the improper disposal of hazardous materials emanating from the property, regardless of fault. In order to mitigate exposure to environmental liability, NNN maintains an environmental insurance policy which provides some coverage for substantially all of the properties which expires in August 2018. As a part of its acquisition due diligence process, NNN obtains an environmental site assessment for each property. In such cases where NNN intends to acquire real estate where some level of contamination may exist, NNN generally requires the seller or tenant to (i) remediate the problem, (ii) indemnify NNN for environmental liabilities, and/or (iii) agree to other arrangements deemed appropriate by NNN, including, under certain circumstances, the purchase of environmental insurance to address environmental conditions at the property. 

As of January 28, 2016 , NNN has 67 &#32;Properties currently under some level of environmental remediation and/or monitoring. In general, the seller, a previous owner, the tenant or an adjacent land owner is responsible for the cost of the environmental remediation for each of these Properties. 

Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The Properties, as commercial facilities, are required to comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and similar state and local laws and regulations (collectively, the "ADA"). Investigation of a property may reveal non-compliance with the ADA. The tenants will typically have primary responsibility for complying with the ADA, but NNN may incur costs if the tenant does not comply. As of January 28, 2016 , NNN has not been notified by any governmental authority of, nor is NNN&#8217;s management aware of, any non-compliance with the ADA that NNN&#8217;s management believes would have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position or results of operations. 

Other Regulations. State and local fire, life-safety and similar entities regulate the use of the Properties. NNN&#8217;s leases generally require each tenant to undertake primary responsibility for complying with regulations, but failure to comply could result in fines by governmental authorities, awards of damages to private litigants, or restrictions on the ability to conduct business on such properties.
