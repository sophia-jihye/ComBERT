 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Our Company 

We are one of the world&#8217;s leading franchisors of real estate brokerage services. Our business strategy is to recruit and retain agents and sell franchises. Our franchisees operate under the RE/MAX brand name, which has held the number one market share in the U.S. and Canada since 1999, as measured by total residential transaction sides completed by our agents. Accordingly, our company slogan is &#8220;Nobody sells more real estate than RE/MAX.&#8221; The RE/MAX brand has the highest level of unaided brand awareness in real estate in the U.S. and Canada according to a 2015 consumer survey by MMR Strategy Group, and our iconic red, white and blue RE/MAX hot air balloon is one of the most recognized real estate logos in the world. 

The RE/MAX brand is built on the strength of our global franchise network, which is designed to attract and retain the best-performing and most experienced agents by maximizing their opportunity to retain a larger portion of their commissions. As a result of this agent-centric approach, we believe that our agents are substantially more productive than the industry average. We consider agent count to be a key measure of our business performance as the majority of our revenue is derived from fixed, contractual fees and dues paid to us based on the number of agents in our franchise network. 

RE/MAX was founded in 1973 by David and Gail Liniger with an innovative, entrepreneurial culture affording our agents and franchisees the flexibility to operate their businesses with great independence. This business strategy led to a 33-year period of uninterrupted growth, highlighted in the charts below, as RE/MAX added large numbers of franchises and agents in the U.S., Canada and around the world. Today, the RE/MAX brand operates in more countries than any other real estate brokerage brand in the world.

As of December 31, 2015. 

We grew our total agent count at a compound annual growth rate of 30% from our founding to a peak of approximately 120,000 agents in 2006. Our agent count declined approximately 26.8% from 2006 through 2011 as real estate transaction activity declined during the U.S. and global real estate downturn and economic recession. We returned to growth starting in 2012, resulting in a net gain of 10,534 agents between 2012 and 2014 (of which 5,953 were in the U.S.). In 2015, we gained 6,816 agents (of which 2, 813 were in the U.S.) as the upturn has continued , for a total of 104,826 agents (of which 59,918 were in the United States and 19,668 were in Canada). Approximately 28% of our agents gained in the U.S. during 2015 were from offices newly opened in 2014 . We expect that our U.S. agent count will continue to increase as we continue to attract agents who recognize the strength of the RE/MAX brand and our agent-centric value proposition. 

&#160;

As approximately 83% of our 2015 revenue came from the U.S., we believe that we have benefitted from improvements in the U.S. housing market. With approximately 12% of our 2015 revenue coming from Canada, where RE/MAX has the leading market share among residential brokerage firms, we also benefitted during periods of generally stable Canadian housing market trends. See &#8220;&#8212;Market Opportunity&#8212;U.S. and Canadian Real Estate Brokerage Industry Overview.&#8221; 

The RE/MAX network extends to commercial real estate brokerage as well, with approximately 2,800 RE/MAX Commercial &#174; practitioners in over 50 countries. RE/MAX Commercial &#174; is perennially named one of the top 25 commercial brokerage networks by National Real Estate Investor magazine. 

As a franchisor, we maintain a low fixed -cost structure, which enables us to generate high margins and helps us drive significant operating leverage through incremental revenue growth. 

&#160; 

(1) 

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure of financial performance that differs from U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. See &#8220; Item 7. &#8212; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; for further discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of the differences between Adjusted EBITDA and net income. 

(2) 

Excludes adjustments attributable to the non-controlling interest. See "Corporate Structure and Ownership&#8221; below. 

In 2015, we operated in two reportable segments, (1) Real Estate Franchise Services and (2) Brokerages. The Real Estate Franchise Services reportable segment comprises the operations of our owned and independent global franchising operations and corporate-wide professional services expenses. The Brokerages reportable segment contains the operations of our owned brokerage offices in the U.S., the results of operations of a mortgage brokerage company in which we owned a non-controlling interest and reflects the elimination of intersegment revenue and other consolidation entities. We started 2015 with 21 owned brokerage offices (which represented less than 1% of RE/MAX brokerages in the U.S.), but sold 18 of our brokerage offices in the Washington, DC and Portland, Oregon metropolitan areas in 2015, and have since sold the remaining three offices, in the Seattle, Washington area. Therefore we will report as a single segment for 2016. Our reportable segments for 2015 represent our operating segments for which separate financial information is available and which is utilized on a regular basis by our management to assess performance and to allocate resources. For additional financial information about our business by segment, see Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Market Opportunity 

We operate in the real estate brokerage franchising industry in nearly 100 countries , including the U.S. &#160; and Canada. 

U.S. and Canadian Real Estate Brokerage Industry Overview . Based upon U.S. Census Bureau data and existing home sales information from the National Association of Realtors (&#8220; NAR&#8221;), the U.S. residential real estate industry is an approximately $1.58 trillion market based on 2015 sales volume. Residential real estate represents the largest single asset class in the U.S. with a value of approximately $21.8 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve. 

&#160;

Residential real estate brokerages typically realize revenue by charging a commission based on a percentage of the price of the home sold. The real estate brokerage industry generally benefits in periods of rising home prices and transaction activity (with the number of licensed real estate agents generally increasing during such periods), and is adversely impacted in periods of falling prices and home sale transactions (with the number of licensed real estate agents generally decreasing during such periods). 

We believe the traditional agent-assisted business model compares favorably to alternative channels of the residential brokerage industry, such as discount brokers and &#8220;for sale by owner,&#8221; because full-service brokerages are best suited to address many of the key characteristics of real estate transactions, including: (i) the complexity and large monetary value involved in home sale transactions, (ii) the infrequency of home sale transactions, (iii) the high price variability in the home market, (iv) the unique nature of each home and (v) the consumer&#8217;s need for a high degree of personalized advice and support in light of these factors. For these reasons, we believe that consumers will continue to use the agent-assisted model for residential real estate transactions. In addition, although listings are available for viewing on a wide variety of real estate websites, we believe an agent&#8217;s local market expertise provides the ability to better understand the inventory of for-sale homes and the interests of potential buyers. This knowledge allows the agent to customize the pool of potential homes they show to a buyer, as well as help sellers to present their home professionally to best attract potential buyers. According to NAR, 89% of sellers of existing homes used an agent or broker in 2015 compared to 82% in 2004, and 87% of buyers used an agent or broker in 2015, compared with 77% in 2004. 

Cyclical Nature . The residential real estate industry is cyclical in nature, but has shown strong long-term growth. From the second half of 2005 through 2011, the U.S. real estate industry experienced a significant downturn, with existing home sale transactions declining by 40%, and median price declining 24% from 2005 to 2011, according to NAR . A steady, multi-year recovery began in 2012-2014 and continued through 2015, with NAR forecasting a relatively moderate 1.7% increase in transactions and 3.4% increase in median price in 2016. 

&#160; 

While this price recovery has meant that home affordability, as indicated by NAR&#8217;s Home Affordability Index, has weakened somewhat from record favorable conditions in 2012, home affordability has remained substantially better than its ten- and twenty-year averages. This means homes continue to be affordable for the median consumer. However, in comparison to what is traditionally considered a &#8216;balanced&#8217; market, with enough inventory on the market to satisfy six months of home sales demand, inventory has remained tight for nearly three and a half years. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Months Supply of Inventory

Source: NAR 

The extent to which home affordability remains high will depend on the extent of any future interest rate changes, changes in home prices (which may be influenced by the amount of inventory on the market), and changes in the job market and/or wage growth. 

In Canada, the downturn from 2005 through 2011 was mild by comparison to that of the U.S. for the same period. Canadian home sales were up 5.1% in 2014 and 5.5% in 2015, but are forecast to decline 1.1% in 2016, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association. 

Favorable Long-term Demand . We believe long-term demand for housing in the U.S. is primarily driven by the economic health of the domestic economy, and local factors such as demand relative to supply. We also believe the residential real estate market in the U.S. will benefit from fundamental demographic shifts over the long term. These include an increase in household formations, including as a result of immigration and population growth. We believe there is also pent-up selling demand from generational shifts, such as many retirement age homeowners who are likely to take advantage of improving housing market conditions in order to sell their existing residences and retire in new areas of the country or purchase smaller homes. Similarly, we believe there is also pent-up buying demand among adults in the large millennial generation, driving household formation back to historical levels. 

Our Market Position . We attribute our success to our ability to recruit and retain experienced agents and sell franchises. Our approach to sustained agent recruiting and retention and franchise sales depends upon two key elements of our unique business model: (i) creating and maintaining a premier market presence in the real estate brokerage industry worldwide, and (ii) creating and maintaining the unique RE/MAX &#8220;growth engine.&#8221; 

Premier Market Presence . The strength of our brand worldwide in the real estate brokerage industry is the result of our ability to successfully create and maintain &#8220;Premier Market Presence.&#8221; We believe we offer agents and franchisees a compelling market presence in the real estate brokerage industry through the combination of the following six attributes: 

&#183; 

leading unaided brand awareness; 

&#183; 

highly experienced and productive agents; 

&#183; 

unsurpassed market share; 

&#183; 

high traffic web presence; 

&#183; 

high level of customer satisfaction; and 

&#183; 

strong community citizenship. 

We believe our focus on creating and maintaining Premier Market Presence has led to a sustained growth of our global franchise network and the RE/MAX brand. 

&#160;

RE/MAX &#8220;Growth Engine.&#8221; The RE/MAX Growth Engine is a virtuous circle whereby all of the key stakeholders in our franchise network&#8212;our franchisees, agents and RE/MAX&#8212;benefit from mutual investment and participation in the RE/MAX network, or, as we say in RE/MAX, &#8220;Everybody wins.&#8221; By building our leading brand around an agent-centric model, we believe we are able to attract and retain highly productive agents and motivated franchisees. As a result, our agents and franchisees help to further enhance our brand and market share, expand our franchise network, and ultimately grow our revenue, as illustrated below: 

&#160; 

The RE/MAX Growth Engine leads to the following unique benefits for our franchisees and agents and RE/MAX:

Our Franchise Structure 

Franchise Organizational Model . We function under the following franchise organizational model, with nearly all of the RE/MAX branded brokerage office locations being operated by franchisees: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Franchise Tier 

Description 

RE/MAX 

Owns the right to the RE/MAX brand and sells franchises and franchising rights. 

&#160; 

Regional 

Franchise Owner 

Owns rights to sell brokerage franchises in a specified region. In the U.S. and Canada, as of the end of 2015, RE/MAX owned 12 of 32 regional franchises, representing 55% of our U.S. and Canada agent count. The remaining 20 regional franchises, representing 45% of our U.S. and Canada agent count, are Independent Regions. 

&#160; 

Franchisee 

(or Broker-Owner) 

Owns right to operate a RE/MAX-branded brokerage office, list properties and recruit agents. 6,986 offices globally, as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Agent 

(or Sales Associate) 

Branded independent contractors who operate out of local franchise brokerage offices. 104,826 agents globally, as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

In the early years of our expansion in the U.S. and Canada, we sold regional franchise rights to independent owners for certain Independent Regions while retaining rights to other regions. In recent years, we have pursued a strategy to reacquire regional franchise rights, such as the California-Hawaii, Florida and Carolinas regions in 2007, the Mountain States region in 2011, the Texas region in 2012 and the Central Atlantic and Southwest regions in 2013. In February 2016, we re-acquired regional franchise rights for the formerly-independent RE/MAX of New York region, which as of December 31, 2015 represented 1.1% of o ur U.S. and Canada agent count. 

Franchise Agreements and Relationship Terms . In those regions that are owned by us in the U.S. and Canada, we typically enter into a five-year renewable franchise agreement with franchisees covering a standard set of terms and conditions. For those regions that are independently owned, we enter into a long-term agreement (typically between 15 and 20 years, with up to three renewal periods of equal length) with the Independent Region owner, pursuant to which the regional franchise owner is authorized to enter into franchise agreements with individual franchisees in that region. 

In general, the franchisees (or broker-owners) do not receive an exclusive territory except under certain limited circumstances. Prior to opening an office, a franchisee or principal owner is required to attend a four to five day training program at our global headquarters. We maintain a close relationship with our franchisees and provide them with ongoing training via our RE/MAX University &#174; to help them better attract and train agents, market, and operate more effectively. Prospective franchisees, renewing franchisees, and transferees of a franchise are subject to a criminal background check and must meet certain subjective and objective standards, including those related to relevant experience, education, licensing, background, financial capacity, skills, integrity and other qualities of character. 

&#160;

Revenue Model 

The majority of our revenue is derived from a stable set of fees paid by our agents, franchisees and regional franchise owners. 

Revenue Streams . Our revenue streams are illustrated in the following chart: 

Revenue Streams as Percentage of 2015 Total Revenue 

Continuing Franchise Fees . In the U.S. and Canada, continuing franchise fees are fixed contractual fees paid monthly by regional franchise owners in Independent Regions or franchisees in Company-owned Regions to RE/MAX based on the number of agents in the franchise region or the franchisee&#8217;s office. 

Annual Dues . Annual dues are the membership fees that agents pay directly to RE/MAX to be a part of the RE/MAX network and use the RE/MAX brand. Annual dues are currently a flat fee of US$400/CA$400 per agent annually for our U.S. and Canadian agents. 

Broker Fees . Broker fees are assessed to the broker against real estate commissions paid by customers when an agent sells a home. Agents pay a negotiated percentage of these earned commissions to the broker in whose office they work. Broker-owners in turn pay a percentage of the commission to the regional franchisor. Generally, the amount paid by broker-owners to the regional franchisor, which we refer to as the &#8220;broker fee,&#8221; is 1% of the total commission on the transaction. The amount of commission collected by brokers is based primarily on the sales volume of RE/MAX agents, home sale prices in such sales and real estate commissions earned by agents on these transactions. Broker fees therefore vary based upon the overall health of the real estate industry and the volume of existing home sales in particular. This revenue stream is based on sales volume and provides us with incremental upside during a real estate market recovery. 

Franchise Sales and Other Franchise Revenue . Franchise sales and other franchise revenue primarily comprises: 

&#183; 

Franchise Sales. &#160; Franchise sales revenue consists of revenue from sales and renewals of individual franchises from Company-owned Regions and Independent Regions, as well as regional and country master franchises in global markets outside of North America. We receive only a portion of the revenue from the sales and renewals of individual franchises from Independent Regions. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Other Franchise Revenue . Other franchise revenue includes revenue from preferred marketing arrangements and approved supplier programs with third parties, including mortgage lenders and other real estate service providers, as well as event-based revenue from training and other programs, including our annual convention in the U.S. 

Brokerage Revenue . During 2015, brokerage revenue principally represented fees assessed by our owned brokerages for services provided to their affiliated real estate agents. Our owned brokerage offices were solely in the U.S. and represented less than 1% of the 3, 500 real estate brokerage offices that operate under the RE/MAX brand name in the U.S. During 2015 and the beginning of 2016, we sold all of our owned brokerages to existing RE/MAX franchisees, a nd as a result, prospectively, we will no longer earn brokerage revenue. 

Revenue per Agent in U.S. and Canada Owned and Independent Regions . We receive a higher amount of revenue per agent in our Company-owned Regions than in our Independent Regions. While both Company-owned Regions and Independent Regions charge relatively similar fees to RE/MAX brokerages and agents, we receive the entire amount of the continuing franchise fee, broker fee and initial franchise and renewal fee in Company-owned Regions, whereas we receive only a portion of these fees in Independent Regions. We generally receive 15%, 20% or 30% of the amount of such fees in Independent Regions, which is a fixed rate in each particular Independent Region established by the terms of the applicable regional franchise agreement. In 2015, the average annual revenue per agent in our Company-owned Regions was approximately $2,451, whereas the average annual revenue per agent in Independent Regions was approximately $821. 

&#160; 

Franchise and Agent Fee Increases . Given the low fixed infrastructure cost of our franchise model, modest increases in aggregate fees per agent positively affect our profitability. Although we may pursue future opportunities to increase our aggregate fees per agent over time, our strategic focus is to grow agent count through recruiting programs and retention initiatives. 

International Revenue. We base our continuing franchise fees, agent dues and broker fees outside the U.S. and Canada on the same structure as our Independent Regions, except that the aggregate level of such fees is substantially lower in these markets than in the U.S. and Canada. 

&#160;

For additional financial information about our business by geographic area, see Note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Our Agent-Centric Approach 

We believe that our agent-centric approach enables us to attract and retain highly effective agents and motivated franchisees to our network and drive growth in our business and profitability. We have built a franchise model designed to provide the following unique combination of benefits to our franchisees and agents: 

&#183; 

Affiliation with the Best Brand in Residential Real Estate . We believe buyers and sellers of real estate are most comfortable doing business with an entity and brand with which they are familiar. We drive brand awareness through transaction activity and visibility in the market. The RE/MAX brand has held number one market share as measured by total residential transaction sides completed by our agents in both the U.S. and Canada since 1999. We reinforce brand awareness through marketing and advertising programs that are supported by promotional campaigns of our franchisees and agents in their local markets. 

&#183; 

Entrepreneurial, High Performance Culture . We attract highly driven professionals through our recruiting and franchise sales efforts. We provide our franchisees and agents with a vast array of industry-leading tools, resources and support, but allow them autonomy to run their businesses independently. Our approach gives them the freedom generally to set commission rates and oversee local advertising in order to best meet the needs of their particular markets and circumstances. As we say to our agents, they are &#8220;in business for themselves, but not by themselves.&#8221; 

&#183; 

High Agent Commission Fee Split and Low Franchise Fees . In the RE/MAX franchise network, we recommend to our franchisees an agent-favorable commission split of 95%/5% (with the agent receiving 95%). In exchange for the agent generally retaining a high percentage of commissions, our agents pay the franchise broker a pre-agreed sum to share the overhead and other fixed costs of the brokerage. This model is highly attractive to high-producing agents because it allows them to earn a higher commission compared to traditional brokerages where the broker typically takes 30% to 40% of the agent&#8217;s commission. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Lead Referral Systems Supported by High Traffic Websites . We provide an attractive lead referral system to our agents free of referral fees. We believe that no other national real estate brand provides their real estate agents comparable access to free leads. Our websites, including remax.com, global.remax.com, theremaxcollection.com and remaxcommercial.com, collectively were visited over 85.0 million times in 2015, and our flagship site, remax.com, was the most visited real estate franchise website during 2015, according to Experian Hitwise Marketing Services data . In addition, the traffic across our websites provides listed properties additional exposure to potential buyers. When a prospective buyer inquires about a property displayed on our websites, or the websites of certain of our regions, offices, and agents, a RE/MAX agent receives this lead through our lead referral system, LeadStreet &#174; , without a referral fee. Our LeadStreet &#174; system has sent over 15.0 million free leads to our agents since 2006. Our expansive global network of agents also generates traditional agent-to-agent leads, such as when a relocating home seller wants their RE/MAX agent&#8217;s referral for an agent to help them buy in their new area, or a customer&#8217;s business needs the specialized assistance of a RE/MAX Commercial &#174; practitioner. 

&#183; 

RE/MAX University &#174; Training Programs . RE/MAX ha s been an industry leader in providing comprehensive education programs for franchisees and agents since 1994, when RE/MAX created the revolutionary RE/MAX Satellite Network, which was the only real estate related educational and training syste m of its kind for over a decade . RE/MAX agents and brokers have enrolled in more than 90,000 professional designations, certifications or other courses through our proprietary education systems. In 2007, RE/MAX introduced RE/MAX University &#174; , or RU, which offers worldwide, 24/7, on-demand access to the latest information on key industry topics and is aimed at helping our global network of agents deliver the best service possible to their existing and potential new customers. RE/MAX University further offers agents advanced training in areas such as distressed properties, luxury properties, senior clients, buyer agency and many other specialty areas of real estate. In 2014, we began our proprietary Momentum &#174; training program, a comprehensive training, development and recruiting program for RE/MAX brokers and agents (the &#8220;Momentum Program&#8221;). The Momentum Program is specifically designed to educate our broker owners on how to manage their business more effectively and profitably, and plan for future success by recruiting and training more agents. Since the program began, over 1,600 broker owners and managers have taken the Momentum Program&#8212;over 1,150 of them broker owners or managers in our Company-owned Regions. 

Value Creation and Growth Strategy 

We intend to leverage our market leadership in the residential real estate brokerage industry in the U.S. and Canada to drive shareholder value through: a) organic growth, building on our network of over 100,000 agents in nearly 100 countries; b) growth catalysts through acquisitions; and c) return of capital to shareholders. 

Organic Growth by Increasing Our Agent Count . The residential real estate market in the U.S. continues to improve and we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend due, in large part, to our leading brand and the quality of our agent and franchise network. Based on our experience, we believe gradually improving market conditions in the U.S. will enable us to continue to sell franchises and recruit and retain agents, increasing our revenue and profitability. We experienced agent losses during the downturn, but we returned to a period of net agent growth in 2012 and our year-over-year growth in agent count accelerated in 2013 , 2014 and 2015. As the housing market continues to improve, we expect that our organic agent count growth will continue. 

&#160;

Agent Count 

Number of Agents at Quarter-End 

We sold 929 office franchises in 2015 (as well as 17 international region and sub-region franchises) and intend to continue adding franchises in new and existing markets, and as a result, increase our global market share and brand awareness. 

Office Franchise Sales 

We intend to continue to focus on recruiting and retaining agents, because each incremental agent leverages our existing infrastructure, allowing us to drive additional revenue at little incremental cost. We are c ommitted to reinvest ing in the business to enhance our value proposition and through a range of new and existing programs and tools, including increasingly targeted marketing and promotional efforts, improved training and development programs for franchisees and agents, and benefits to both agents and franchisees from our network infrastructure such as our high-traffic websites and lead referral system. 

Growth Catalysts through Acquisitions . We intend to continue to pursue reacquisitions of the regional RE/MAX franchise rights in a number of Independent Regions in the U.S. and Canada, as well as other acquisitions in related areas that build on our core competencies in franchising and real estate brokerage support. 

The reacquisition of a regional franchise substantially increases our revenue per agent and provides an opportunity for us to drive enhanced profitability, as we receive a higher amount of revenue per agent in our Company-owned Regions than in our Independent Regions. For example, we can establish operational efficiencies and improvements in financial performance of a reacquired region by leveraging our existing infrastructure and experience. As discussed above, our average annual revenue per agent in our Company-owned Regions is substantially higher than in Independent Regions because, while both Company-owned Regions and Independent Regions charge relatively similar fees to their brokerages and agents, we only receive a percentage of the continuing franchise fee, broker fee and initial franchise and renewal fee in Independent Regions. By reacquiring regional franchise rights, we can capture 100% of these fees and substantially increase the average revenue per agent for agents in the reacquired region, which, as a result of our low fixed-cost structure, further increases our overall margins.

The regions in which we have re-acquired franchise rights since 2007 represented 37% of our agents in the U.S. and Canada as of December 31, 2015, with the result that the Co mpany-owned Regions in which we franchise directly represented 56% of our agents in the U.S. and Canada. This includes our acquisition of the New York region in February 2016. The remaining 44% of our U.S. and Canada combined agent count operate in Independent Regions. 

Return of Capital to Shareholders . &#160; We are committed to returning capital to shareholders as part of our value creation strategy. We have paid quarterly dividend s since April of 2014, the first quarter after our October 7, 2013 initial public offering , when we began paying quarterly dividends of $0.0625 per share. We increased our quarterly dividend to $0.125 per share in March 2015 and to $0.15 per share in February 2016. Including the special dividend also announced in March 2015, we distributed approximately $59.5 million &#160; to our shareholders and unitholders in 2015. Our disciplined approach to capital allocation allows us to return capital to shareholders and , as a result, generate shareholder value. 

Competition 

The real estate brokerage franchise business is highly competitive. We primarily compete against other real estate franchisors seeking to grow their franchise system. Our largest national competitors in the U.S. and Canada include the brands operated by Realogy Holdings Corp. (which include Century 21, Coldwell Banker, ERA, Sothebys and Better Homes and Gardens), Berkshire Hathaway Home Services, Keller Williams Realty, Inc. and Royal LePage. In most markets, we also compete against regional chains, independent, non-franchise brokerages and Internet-based and other brokers offering deeply discounted commissions. Our efforts to target consumers and connect them with a RE/MAX agent via our websites also face competition from major real estate portals. We believe that competition in the real estate brokerage franchise business is based principally upon the reputational strength of the brand, the quality of the services offered to franchises, and the amount of franchise-related fees to be paid by franchisees. 

&#160;

The ability of our franchisees to compete with other real estate brokerages, both franchised and unaffiliated, is an important aspect of our growth strategy. A franchisee&#8217;s ability to compete may be affected by a variety of factors, including the quality of the franchisee&#8217;s independent agents, the location of the franchisee&#8217;s offices and the number of competing offices in the area. A franchisee&#8217;s success may also be affected by general, regional and local housing conditions, as well as overall economic conditions. 

Preferred Marketing and Supplier Arrangements 

We have entered into preferred marketing arrangements providing various third parties, including mortgage lenders and other real estate service providers, with the opportunity to market their products and services to our franchisees and agents. Through these arrangements, we receive additional revenue in the form of fees paid for marketing access to our network of franchisees and agents. 

In addition, with the collective buying power of company-owned and franchised brokerages, we have established a network of preferred suppliers whose products may be purchased directly by franchisees and agents. These relationships provide group discount prices, marketing materials that have been pre-vetted to comply with RE/MAX brand standards and higher quality materials that may not be cost-effective to procure on an individual office basis. 

Marketing and Promotion 

We believe that the strength of the RE/MAX brand and our iconic red, white and blue RE/MAX hot air balloon logo help to drive brand awareness. RE/MAX advertising, marketing and promotion campaigns increase the strength of our brand and generate leads for our agents. We believe the widespread recognition of our brand is a key aspect of our value proposition to agents and franchisees. 

A variety of programs build our brand, including leading websites such as remax.com, advertising campaigns using television, print, billboards and signs, flyers, advertising inserts, Internet, email, social media and mobile applications. Event-based marketing programs, sponsorships, sporting activities and other similar functions also promote our brand. These include our support, since 1992 for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals in the U.S. and Children's Miracle Network in Canada, to help sick and injured children. Through the Miracle Home&#174; program, participating RE/MAX agents make a donation to Children's Miracle Network Hospitals once a home sale transaction is complete. 

Nearly all of the advertising, marketing and promotion to support the RE/MAX brand is funded by our agents and franchisees. In the U.S. and Canada, there are two primary levels of advertising and promotion of our brand based on the source of funding for the activity: (i) regional advertising funds build and maintain brand awareness and drive real estate consumers to use RE/MAX agents through regional activities and media buys, including placement of RE/MAX&#8217;s advertising on a regional or pan-regional basis, and (ii) local campaigns that are paid for directly by agents and franchisees within their local markets. The regional advertising funds are funded by our agents through fees that our brokers collect and pay to the regional advertising funds. 

&#183; 

Regional Advertising Funds . Regional advertising funds primarily support advertising campaigns focused on building and maintaining brand awareness at the regional level. These regional advertising funds in Company-owned Regions are corporations owned by our controlling stockholder as trustee for RE/MAX agents. Their activities are directed by our Company-owned Regions. For the regional advertising funds&#8217; fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, franchisee contributions to the regional advertising funds that promote the RE/MAX brand in Company-owned Regions were $43.8 million. The RE/MAX brand is promoted in Independent Regions by other regional advertising funds. On occasion, the advertising funds in Company-owned Regions, together with some or all of the advertising funds in Independent Regions, may contribute to national or pan-regional creative development and media purchases. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Local Campaigns. Our franchisees and agents engage in extensive promotional efforts within their local markets to attract customers and drive agent and brand awareness within the local market. These programs are subject to brand guidelines and quality standards that we establish for use of the RE/MAX brand, but we allow our franchisees and agents substantial flexibility to create advertising, marketing and promotion programs that are tailored to local market conditions. We believe the marketing, advertising and promotion expenditures by our agents and franchisees at the local level substantially exceed the amounts allocated to the national and regional advertising funds each year. 

&#183; 

Pan-Regional Campaigns . In late 2014, we and Independent Regions adopted a change in strategy to focus our advertising efforts in the U.S. on regional and local advertising and, beginning in January 2015, both Company-owned and Independent Regions in the U.S. shifted advertising expenditures away from our national advertising fund to our respective regional advertising funds. In 2016, funds previously allocated to the RE/MAX national advertising fund will be managed and invested by the separate RE/MAX regional advertising funds. These regional advertising funds will continue to be funded by our agents through fees that our brokers collect and pay to the regional advertising funds. The advertising funds in Company-owned Regions, together with some or all of the advertising funds in Independent Regions, may contribute to national or pan-regional creative development and media purchases, to promote a consistent brand message and achiev e economies of scale in the purchase of advertising . 

Intellectual Property 

We protect the RE/MAX brand through a combination of trademarks and copyrights. We have registered &#8220;RE/MAX&#8221; as a trademark in the U.S., Canada, and over 150 other countries and territories, and have registered various versions of the RE/MAX balloon logo and real estate yard sign design in numerous countries and territories as well. We also have filed other trademark applications in the U.S. and certain other jurisdictions, and will pursue additional trademark registrations and other intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective. We also are the registered holder of a variety of domain names that include &#8220;remax&#8221; and similar variations. 

Corporate Structure and Ownership 

We are a holding company incorporated in Delaware and our only business is to act as the sole manager of RMCO , LLC, or &#8220;RMCO&#8221;. In that capacity, we operate and control all of the business and affairs of RMCO. As of December 31, 2015 , we own 58.33% of the common units in RMCO , while RIHI, Inc. (&#8220;RIHI&#8221;) owns the remaining 41.67% of common units in RMCO. RIHI is majority owned and controlled by David Liniger, our Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and Co-Founder, and by Gail Liniger, our Vice Chair and Co-Founder. Daryl Jesperson, one of our directors, holds a minority ownership interest in RIHI. 

&#160;

The diagram below depicts our organizational structure : 

The holders of our Class A common stock collectively own 100% of the economic interests in RE/MAX Holdings, Inc. , while RIHI owns 100% of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock . The shares of Class B common stock have no economic rights but entitle the holder, without regard to the number of shares of Class B common stock held, to a number of votes on matters presented to stockholders of RE/MAX Holdings , Inc. that is equal to two times the aggregate number of common units of RMCO held by such holder. As a result of RIHI&#8217;s ownership of shares of our Class B common stock, it holds effective control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock and we constitute a &#8220;controlled company&#8221; under the corporate governance standards of the New York Stock Exchange and therefore are not required to comply with certain corporate governance requirements. 

Due to RIHI&#8217;s ownership interest in RMCO, our results reflect a significant non-controlling interest and our pre-tax income excludes RIHI&#8217;s proportionate share of RMCO&#8217;s net income. Our only source of cash flow from operations is in the form of distributions from RMCO and management fees paid by RMCO pursuant to a management services agreement between us and RMCO. 

&#160;

In November and December of 2015, RIHI executed a secondary offering of shares that it owned, and this sale reduced RIHI&#8217;s ownership in RMCO to 41.67%. However, RIHI retains a controlling vote in RE/MAX Holdings, Inc. through its ownership of 12,559,600 common units in RMCO and its Class B share of RE/MAX Holdings, Inc. This balance of economic interest and voting power is illustrated below: 

&#160; 

RIHI&#8217;s voting rights will be reduced to equal the aggregate number of RMCO common units held&#8212;and RIHI would therefore be expected to lose its controlling vote of RE/MAX Holdings, Inc.&#8212;after the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) October 7, 2018; (ii) the death of the Company&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and Co-Founder, David Liniger; or (iii) at such time as RIHI&#8217;s ownership of RMCO common units falls below 5,320,380 common units. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 311 employees, including 21 employees located in Western Canada, 275 in our corporate headquarters and 15 in our owned brokerage offices that we have subsequently sold (which included office staff, but not independent contractor sales associates affiliated with our owned brokerages). Other than with respect to our owned brokerage offices, our franchisees are independent businesses and their employees and independent contractor sales associates are therefore not included in our employee count. None of our employees are represented by a union. We believe our relations with our employees are good. 

Seasonality 

The residential housing market is seasonal with transactional activity in the U.S. and Canada peaking in the second and third quarter of each year. Our results of operations are somewhat affected by these seasonal trends. Our Adjusted EBITDA margins are often lower in the first and fourth quarters due primarily to the impact of lower broker fees and other revenue as a result of lower overall sales volume, as well as higher selling, operating and administrative expenses in the first quarter for expenses incurred in connection with our annual convention. 

&#160;

Government Regulation 

Franchise Regulation . The sale of franchises is regulated by various state laws, as well as by the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;). The FTC requires that franchisors make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees but does not require registration. A number of states require registration or disclosure by franchisors in connection with franchise offers and sales. Several states also have &#8220;franchise relationship laws&#8221; or &#8220;business opportunity laws&#8221; that limit the ability of the franchisor to terminate franchise agreements or to withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of these agreements. The states with relationship or other statutes governing the termination of franchises include Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. Some franchise relationship statutes require a mandated notice period for termination; some require a notice and cure period; and some require that the franchisor demonstrate good cause for termination. Although we believe that our franchise agreements comply with these statutory requirements, failure to comply with these laws could result in our company incurring civil liability. In addition, while historically our franchising operations have not been materially adversely affected by such regulation, we cannot predict the effect of any future federal or state legislation or regulation. 

Real Estate Regulation . The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (&#8220;RESPA&#8221;) and state real estate brokerage laws restrict payments which real estate brokers and other service providers in the real estate industry may receive or pay in connection with the sales of residences and referral of settlement services, such as mortgages, homeowners insurance and title insurance. Such laws may to some extent restrict our preferred vendor programs.
