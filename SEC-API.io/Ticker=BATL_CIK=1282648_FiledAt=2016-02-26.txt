 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

&#160; Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this report to "Halc&#243;n," "our," "us," and "we" refer to Halc&#243;n Resources Corporation (formerly known as RAM Energy Resources, Inc.) and its subsidiaries, as a common entity. On December 28, 2015, we completed a one-for-five reverse stock split of our common stock. All share and per share information in this report has been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split. 

We are an independent energy company focused on the acquisition, production, exploration and development of onshore liquids-rich oil and natural gas assets in the United States. We were incorporated in Delaware on February 5, 2004 and were recapitalized on February 8, 2012. During 2012, we focused our efforts on the acquisition of unevaluated leasehold and producing properties in selected prospect areas, providing us with an extensive drilling inventory in multiple basins that we believe allow for multiple years of production and broad flexibility to direct our capital resources to projects with the greatest potential returns. In the years since, we focused on the development of acquired properties and also divested non-core assets in order to fund activities in our core resource plays. Our oil and natural gas assets consist of proved reserves and undeveloped acreage positions in unconventional liquids-rich basins/fields. We have acquired acreage and may acquire additional acreage in the Bakken / Three Forks formations in North Dakota and the Eagle Ford formation in East Texas, as well as other areas. 

At December 31, 2015, our estimated total proved oil and natural gas reserves, as prepared by our independent reserve engineering firm, Netherland, Sewell &#38; Associates, Inc. (Netherland, Sewell) using SEC prices of $50.28 per Bbl of oil and $2.587 per MMBtu of natural gas, were approximately 146.8 MMBoe, consisting of 120.7 MMBbls of oil, 13.0 MMBbls of natural gas liquids, and 78.4 Bcf of natural gas. Approximately 56% of our proved reserves were classified as proved developed as of December 31, 2015. We maintain operational control of approximately 95% of our proved reserves. 

Our total operating revenues for 2015 were approximately $550.3 million. This represents a 52% decrease in operating revenues year over year, which was driven by the sustained decline in the prices of crude oil and natural gas. Full year 2015 production averaged 41,542 Boe/d compared to 42,107 Boe/d in 2014, resulting in a slight decrease in our average daily production year over year. We have curtailed our drilling in response to the decline in commodity prices. However, production volumes associated with our core properties in the Bakken / Three Forks formations and the Eagle Ford formation in East Texas (which we refer to as "El Halc&#243;n") remained flat or slightly increased year over year as we have focused our drilling efforts on our most economic areas due to the current price environment. These areas collectively accounted for approximately 38,500 Boe/d, or 93% of our production in 2015. Our remaining production was associated with various non-core properties. In 2015, we participated in the drilling of 184 gross (49.0 net) wells, all of which were completed and capable of production. 

Recent Developments 

The prices of crude oil and natural gas have declined dramatically since mid-year 2014, having recently reached multiyear lows, as a result of robust non Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' (OPEC) supply growth led by unconventional production in the United States, weakening demand in emerging markets, and OPEC's decision to continue to produce at current levels. These market dynamics have led many to conclude that commodity prices are likely to remain lower for a prolonged period. In response to these developments, among other things, we have reduced our spending and completed a series of transactions (described in more detail below) that resulted in the 

reduction of our long-term debt by approximately $1.0 billion and reduced our annual interest burden by approximately $53.5 million. We also extended the maturity date and amended other provisions of certain of our debt agreements. We are continuing to actively explore and evaluate various strategic alternatives to reduce the level of our long-term debt and lower our future cash interest obligations, including through debt repurchases, exchanges of existing debt securities for new debt securities and exchanges or conversions of existing debt securities for new equity securities, among other options. The timing and outcome of these efforts is highly uncertain. One or more of these alternatives could potentially be consummated without the consent of any one or more of our current security holders and, if consummated, could be dilutive to the holders of our outstanding equity securities and adversely affect the trading prices and values of our current debt and equity securities. Although we believe that we will have adequate liquidity over the next twelve months to operate our business and to meet our cash requirements, based on current market conditions, we believe that a reduction in our long-term debt and cash interest obligations is needed to improve our financial position and flexibility and to position us to take advantage of opportunities that may arise out of the current industry downturn. 

Senior Unsecured Notes Exchanged for Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2022 

On December 21, 2015, we completed the issuance of approximately $112.8 million aggregate principal amount of new 12.0% second lien senior secured notes due 2022 (the 2022 Second Lien Notes) in exchange for approximately $289.6 million principal amount of our senior unsecured notes, consisting of $116.6 million principal amount of our 9.75% senior notes due 2020, $137.7 million principal amount of our 8.875% senior notes due 2021 and $35.3 million principal amount of our 9.25% senior notes due 2022 in a public tender. At closing, we paid all accrued and unpaid interest since the respective interest payment dates of the notes surrendered in the exchange. As a result of the issuance of the 2022 Second Lien Notes, our borrowing base under our Senior Credit Agreement was reduced from $850.0 million to approximately $827.4 million. See Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#151;Note 5, " Long-term Debt " for additional information on the 2022 Second Lien Notes and the accounting for the exchange. 

Amendments to the Senior Credit Agreement 

On October 29, 2015, we entered into the Twelfth Amendment to our Senior Credit Agreement (the Twelfth Amendment) which, among other things, provided us additional flexibility with respect to exchanges and repurchases of senior unsecured notes; reaffirmed the borrowing base; and scheduled our next borrowing base redetermination for March 2016. We expect the borrowing base to be confirmed between $650.0 million to $700.0 million in this redetermination. 

On September 10, 2015, in conjunction with the issuance of the Third Lien Notes (defined below), we entered into the Eleventh Amendment to our Senior Credit Agreement (the Eleventh Amendment) which, among other things, permitted us to incur the debt under the Third Lien Notes and to grant the liens in connection therewith; excluded the Third Lien Notes for the calculation of the total secured debt to EBITDA ratio; and reduced the borrowing base under our Senior Credit Agreement to $850.0 million. 

On May 1, 2015, in conjunction with the issuance of the 2020 Second Lien Notes (defined below), we entered into the Tenth Amendment to our Senior Credit Agreement (the Tenth Amendment) which among other things, permitted us to incur the debt under the 2020 Second Lien Notes and to grant the liens in connection therewith; replaced the interest coverage ratio covenant that had been modified in the Ninth Amendment with a covenant that requires the ratio of our total secured debt (excluding the Third Lien Notes pursuant the Eleventh Amendment) to EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) be no greater than 2.75 to 1.00; reduced the borrowing base; and extended the maturity date of the Senior Credit Agreement to August 1, 2019. Prior to the Tenth Amendment, under the Ninth Amendment executed on February 25, 2015, the Senior Credit Agreement had a required 

minimum coverage of interest expenses of not less than 2.0 to 1.0 through March 31, 2016 and not less than 2.5 to 1.0 for subsequent periods. 

Repurchase of Senior Unsecured Notes 

During the fourth quarter of 2015, we repurchased approximately $44.5 million principal amount of our senior unsecured notes, consisting of $6.2 million principal amount of our 9.75% senior notes due 2020, $28.0 million principal amount of our 8.875% senior notes due 2021, and $10.3 million principal amount of our 9.25% senior notes due 2022. The net cash used to make these repurchases was approximately $14.8 million. Upon the settlement of each repurchase, we paid all accrued and unpaid interest since the respective interest payment dates of the notes repurchased. 

Senior Unsecured Notes Exchanged for Senior Secured Third Lien Notes 

On September 10, 2015, we issued approximately $1.02 billion aggregate principal amount of new 13.0% third lien senior secured notes due 2022 (the Third Lien Notes) in exchange for approximately $1.57 billion principal amount of our senior unsecured notes, consisting of $497.2 million principal amount of our 9.75% senior notes due 2020, $774.7 million principal amount of our 8.875% senior notes due 2021, and $294.4 million principal amount of our 9.25% senior notes due 2022 in privately negotiated transactions with certain holders of our outstanding senior unsecured notes. At closing, we paid all accrued and unpaid interest since the respective interest payment dates of the notes surrendered in the exchange. The Third Lien Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior basis by our subsidiary guarantors' assets and by certain future subsidiaries of ours. See Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#151;Note 5, " Long-term Debt " for additional information on the Third Lien Notes and the accounting for the exchange. 

HK TMS, LLC Agreement Amendment 

On June 1, 2015, our subsidiary, HK TMS, LLC (HK TMS), and funds and accounts managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management, LLC (Apollo) entered into an amendment to their original agreement (the HK TMS Amendment) which, among other things, i) commits HK TMS to drill a minimum of 6.5 net wells in each of the five consecutive twelve month periods beginning December 31, 2015 and ii) allows for the redemption of preferred shares at the greater of a 12% annual rate of return plus principal and 1.25 times Apollo's investment plus applicable fees (the Redemption Price), between March 1, 2016 and June 30, 2016 at the election of Apollo to the extent there is available cash above the minimum cash balance. For any commitment period in which HK TMS does not meet its drilling obligation, HK TMS must use available cash, above its minimum required cash balance, to redeem preferred shares at the Redemption Price. See Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#151;Note 10, " Mezzanine Equity " for additional information on the HK TMS Amendment as well as the original agreement. 

Issuance of Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2020 

On May 1, 2015, we completed the issuance of $700 million aggregate principal amount of 8.625% second lien senior secured notes due 2020 (the 2020 Second Lien Notes) in a private offering. The 2020 Second Lien Notes were issued at par. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2020 Second Lien Notes were approximately $686.2 million (after deducting offering fees and expenses). We used the net proceeds from the offering to repay a majority of the then outstanding borrowings under our Senior Credit Agreement. Interest on the 2020 Second Lien Notes is payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on August 1, 2015. The 2020 Second Lien Notes will mature on February 1, 2020. The 2020 Second Lien Notes are secured by second-priority liens on substantially all of our and our subsidiary guarantors' assets that secure our Senior Credit Agreement. 

Amendments to Convertible Note and February 2012 Warrants 

On March 9, 2015, we entered into an amendment (the HALRES Note Amendment) to our convertible note in the principal amount of $289.7 million due 2017 (the Convertible Note). The HALRES Note Amendment extended the maturity date of the Convertible Note by three years, from February 8, 2017 to February 8, 2020. The Convertible Note originally provided for prepayment without premium or penalty at any time after February 8, 2014, at which time it also became convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $22.50 per share. These dates have been extended and the conversion price has been adjusted, such that at any time after March 9, 2017, we may prepay the Convertible Note without premium or penalty, and HALRES may elect to convert all or any portion of unpaid principal and interest outstanding under the Convertible Note to shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $12.20 per share, subject to adjustments for stock splits and other customary anti-dilution provisions as set forth in the Convertible Note. At the same time, we also entered into an amendment (the Warrant Amendment, and collectively with the HALRES Note Amendment, the Amendments) to our five year warrants (the February 2012 Warrants) which extended the term of the February 2012 Warrants from February 8, 2017 to February 8, 2020 and adjusted the exercise price of the February 2012 Warrants from $22.50 to $12.20 per share. The Amendments were approved by our stockholders on May 6, 2015, in accordance with the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). 

Long-Term Debt Exchanged for Common Stock 

During the second quarter of 2015, we entered into several exchange agreements with holders of our senior unsecured notes in which they agreed to exchange an aggregate $258.0 million principal amount of their senior unsecured notes for approximately 29.0 million shares of our common stock. See Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#151;Note 5, " Long-term Debt " for additional information on the exchange agreements. 

Equity Distribution Agreement 

On March 18, 2015, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement (the Equity Distribution Agreement) with BMO Capital Markets Corp., Jefferies LLC and MLV &#38; Co. LLC (collectively, the Managers). Pursuant to the terms of the Equity Distribution Agreement, we sold, from time to time during 2015 through the Managers, by means of ordinary brokers' transactions through the facilities of the NYSE at market prices, a total of approximately 1.9 million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately $15.0 million, after deducting offering expenses. 

2016 Capital Budget 

We expect to spend approximately $140 million to $160 million on drilling and completion capital expenditures during 2016. In addition, we expect to spend approximately $10 million to $15 million on leasehold, infrastructure, seismic and other in 2016. The decrease in planned capital spending for 2016 is in response to the significant decrease in crude oil prices and our expectations that prices may not recover in the near term. Approximately 80-85% of our 2016 drilling and completion budget is expected to be spent in the Bakken / Three Forks formations in North Dakota and approximately 15-20% is budgeted for the El Halc&#243;n area in East Texas. Our 2016 drilling and completion budget currently contemplates running one to two operated rigs during the year, is based on our current view of market conditions and current business plans, and is subject to change. 

We expect to fund our budgeted 2016 capital expenditures with cash flows from operations and, to a lesser extent, with borrowings under our Senior Credit Agreement. We strive to maintain financial flexibility and may access capital markets as necessary to maintain substantial borrowing capacity under our Senior Credit Agreement, facilitate drilling on our large undeveloped acreage position and permit 

us to selectively expand our acreage position. In the event our cash flows are materially less than anticipated and other sources of capital we historically have utilized are not available on acceptable terms, we may further curtail our capital spending. 

Our financial results depend upon many factors, but are largely driven by the volume of our oil and natural gas production and the price that we receive for that production. Our production volumes will decline as reserves are depleted unless we expend capital in successful development and exploration activities or acquire properties with existing production. The amount we realize for our production depends predominately upon commodity prices and our related commodity price hedging activities, which are affected by changes in market demand and supply, as impacted by overall economic activity, weather, pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials and other factors. Accordingly, finding and developing oil and natural gas reserves in an economical manner is critical to our long-term success. 

Business Strategy 

Our primary long-term objective is to increase stockholder value by growing reserves, production and cash flow. To accomplish this objective, we intend to execute the following business strategies: 

&#149; Develop and Grow Our Liquids Rich Resource-Style Acreage Positions Using Our Proven Development Expertise. We plan to leverage our management team's expertise and the latest available technologies to economically develop our property portfolio with a focus on our core liquids-rich resource style plays. We are the operator for the majority of our acreage, which gives us control over the timing of capital expenditures, execution and costs. It also allows us to adjust our capital spending based on drilling results and the economic environment. Our leasing strategy is to pursue long-term contracts that allow us to maintain flexible development plans and avoid short-term obligations to drill wells, as have been common in other resource plays. As operator, we are also able to evaluate industry drilling results and implement improved operating practices which may enhance our initial production rates, ultimate recovery factors and rate of return on invested capital. &#149; Manage Our Property Portfolio Actively. We continually evaluate our property base to identify and divest non-core assets and higher cost or lower volume producing properties with limited development potential, which allows us to focus on a portfolio of core properties with the greatest economic potential to increase our proved reserves and production. Our Competitive Strengths 

We have a number of competitive strengths that we believe will allow us to successfully execute our business strategies: 

&#149; Proven Management Team with Significant Ownership Stake. Our management team and technical professionals, including geologists and engineers, have decades of combined experience in the industry. Our management team has successfully founded, grown, operated and sold companies in the oil and gas sector. Floyd C. Wilson was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Petrohawk Energy Corporation, which was acquired by BHP Billiton in August 2011, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of 3TEC Energy Corporation, which was acquired by Plains Exploration &#38; Production Company in 2003, and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Hugoton Energy Corporation, which was acquired by Chesapeake Energy Corporation in 1998. &#149; Geographically and Geologically Diverse Asset Base. Our proved reserves, production and acreage are located in concentrated positions within multiple onshore U.S. basins. These various basins provide exposure to a variety of reservoir formations, each of which has its own characteristics that impact the costs to drill, complete and operate as well as the composition (and therefore 10 

value) of the hydrocarbon stream. We believe that this geographic diversity provides us with broad flexibility to direct our capital resources to projects with the greatest potential returns and access to multiple key end markets, which mitigates our exposure to temporary price dislocations in any one market. 

&#149; Extensive Experience in Resource Plays. Our team has significant experience in all aspects of the development of resource plays. Under Mr. Wilson's leadership, Petrohawk, 3TEC and Hugoton improved drilling times and reserve recoveries through innovation, the use of new technologies and a focus on controlling costs. While at Petrohawk, in developing the early shale plays, the technical team also acquired expertise relevant in our evaluation of new resource play opportunities. In addition to their core strength in exploration and production, our personnel have experience in building midstream infrastructure and have managed oilfield service activities. For example, Petrohawk developed extensive midstream systems serving the Eagle Ford Shale and the Haynesville Shale in order to accommodate their rapid growth in production volumes. &#149; Strong Technical Team. We believe that there are certain competitive advantages to be gained by employing a highly skilled technical staff. This team has significant experience and expertise in applying the most sophisticated technologies used in conventional and unconventional resource style plays, including 3-D seismic interpretation, horizontal drilling, deep onshore drilling, comprehensive multi-stage hydraulic fracture stimulation programs, and other exploration, production, and processing technologies. We believe this technical expertise is partly responsible for our management team's strong track record of successful exploration and development, including new discoveries and defining core producing areas in emerging plays. Oil and Natural Gas Reserves 

The proved reserves estimates shown herein for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 have been independently evaluated by Netherland, Sewell, a worldwide leader of petroleum property analysis for industry and financial organizations and government agencies. Netherland, Sewell was founded in 1961 and performs consulting petroleum engineering services under Texas Board of Professional Engineers Registration No. F-2699. Within Netherland, Sewell, the technical persons primarily responsible for preparing the estimates set forth in the Netherland, Sewell reserves report incorporated herein are Mr. J. Carter Henson, Jr. and Mr. David E. Nice. Mr. Henson, a Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas (No. 73964), has been practicing consulting petroleum engineering at Netherland, Sewell since 1989 and has over 8 years of prior industry experience. He graduated from Rice University in 1981 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Mechanical Engineering. Mr. Nice, a Licensed Professional Geoscientist in the State of Texas (No. 346), has been practicing consulting petroleum geoscience at Netherland, Sewell since 1998 and has over 13 years of prior industry experience. He graduated from University of Wyoming in 1982 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Geology and in 1985 with a Master of Science Degree in Geology. Netherland, Sewell has reported to us that both technical principals meet or exceed the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers; both are proficient in judiciously applying industry standard practices to engineering and geoscience evaluations as well as applying Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other industry reserves definitions and guidelines. 

Our board of directors has established a reserves committee composed of three independent directors, all of whom have experience in energy company reserve evaluations. Our independent engineering firm reports jointly to the reserves committee and to our Senior Vice President of Corporate Reserves. The reserves committee is charged with ensuring the integrity of the process of selection and engagement of the independent engineering firm and in making a recommendation to our board of directors as to whether to accept the report prepared by our independent consulting 

petroleum engineers. Ms. Tina Obut, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Reserves is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the annual reserve report by Netherland, Sewell. She graduated from Marietta College with a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering, received a Master of Science degree in Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering from Penn State University and a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Houston. 

The reserves information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K represents only estimates. There are a number of uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves, including many factors beyond our control. Reserve evaluation is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates of different engineers may vary significantly. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may lead to revising the original estimate. Accordingly, initial reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. The meaningfulness of such estimates depends primarily on the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based. Except to the extent we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities or both, our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced. For additional information regarding estimates of proved reserves, the preparation of such estimates by Netherland, Sewell and other information about our oil and natural gas reserves, see Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#151;" Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited) ." 

Proved reserve estimates are based on the unweighted arithmetic average prices on the first day of each month for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2015. Average prices for the 12-month period were as follows: West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil spot price of $50.28 per Bbl, adjusted by lease or field for quality, transportation fees, and market differentials and a Henry Hub natural gas spot price of $2.587 per MMBtu, as adjusted by lease or field for energy content, transportation fees, and market differentials. All prices and costs associated with operating wells were held constant in accordance with SEC guidelines. The following table presents certain proved reserve information as of December 31, 2015. 

Proved Reserves (MBoe) (1) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Developed &#160; &#160; 81,885 &#160; Undeveloped &#160; &#160; 64,919 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Total &#160; &#160; 146,804 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 

(1) Natural gas reserves are converted to oil reserves using a ratio of six Mcf to one Bbl of oil. This ratio does not assume price equivalency and, given price differentials, the price for a barrel of oil equivalent for natural gas may differ significantly from the price for a barrel of oil. 

The following table sets forth the number of productive oil and natural gas wells in which we owned an interest as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. Shut-in wells currently not capable of production are excluded from the well information below.

Oil and Natural Gas Production 

Core Resource Plays 

At December 31, 2015, we have estimated proved reserves in our core resource plays of approximately 143.6 MMBoe, of which 92% are oil and natural gas liquids and 55% are proved developed. In general, our core resource plays are characterized by high oil and liquids-rich natural gas content in thick, continuous sections of source rock that can provide repeatable drilling opportunities and significant initial production rates. Our core resource plays are as follows: 

Bakken / Three Forks Formations 

We have working interests in approximately 123,000 net acres as of December 31, 2015 prospective in the Bakken / Three Forks formations in North Dakota. Multiple initiatives are underway to lower costs and improve recoveries in our operated project areas. We expect to spud 15 to 20 gross horizontal wells on our operated acreage in 2016 with an average working interest of 60%. In 2016, we expect to operate one to two rigs in the Williston Basin. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 264 operated wells producing in this area in addition to minor working interests in hundreds of non-operated wells. Our average daily net production from this area for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately 28,900 Boe/d. As of December 31, 2015, estimated proved reserves for the Bakken / Three Forks formations were approximately 122.0 MMBoe, of which approximately 54% were classified as proved developed and approximately 46% as proved undeveloped. 

East Texas Eagle Ford Formation (El Halc&#243;n) 

We have working interests in approximately 92,000 net acres as of December 31, 2015 prospective for the Eagle Ford formation in Brazos, Burleson, and Robertson Counties, Texas, with targeted depths ranging from 7,000 feet to 10,000 feet. We finished 2015 with a one rig drilling program and approximately 106 producing wells. In 2016, we plan to operate one rig during the first quarter and spud two gross horizontal wells with an average working interest of 98%. Our average daily net production from this area for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately 9,500 Boe/d. As of December 31, 2015, estimated proved reserves for the El Halc&#243;n area were approximately 21.6 MMBoe, of which approximately 63% were classified as proved developed and approximately 37% as proved undeveloped. 

Non-core Areas 

Tuscaloosa Marine Shale 

Through our subsidiary, HK TMS, we own working interests in approximately 183,000 net acres as of December 31, 2015 in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale (TMS), which is located primarily in Southwest Mississippi and the Louisiana Florida Parishes. Due to low commodity prices, we currently do not plan 

to drill any new wells in this area in 2016. Our average daily net production from this area for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately 920 Boe/d. As of December 31, 2015, estimated proved reserves for the TMS were approximately 1.1 MMBoe, 77% of which was classified as proved developed. We can provide no assurance that this exploratory area, or any wells we subsequently drill in the formations we have targeted for exploration and development, will be successful. 

Utica / Point Pleasant Formations 

Our acreage is located in the northern part of the Utica / Point Pleasant play, and as of December 31, 2015, we owned approximately 120,000 net acres in Trumbull and Mahoning Counties, Ohio, and Mercer and Venango Counties, Pennsylvania. Substantially all of our acreage in these areas is either held by shallow production or provides for five years, from the initial date of the lease, in which to drill a well with many of the leases containing a renewal option for an additional three to five years. Currently, seven operated wells are producing and five wells are shut in due to commodity prices. Average daily net production from this area for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately 330 Boe/d. Due to low commodity prices, we currently do not plan to drill any new wells in this area in 2016. We continue to monitor competitor activity in this area and new technologies that might allow for lower cost development and increased recoveries from this hydrocarbon rich basin. As of December 31, 2015, estimated proved reserves for the Utica / Point Pleasant formations were less than 0.1 MMBoe and all were classified as proved developed. We can provide no assurance that this exploratory area, or any wells we subsequently drill in the formations we have targeted for exploration and development, will be successful. 

Other Non-core Areas 

We have other oil and natural gas properties with varying working interests located in the Austin Chalk Trend in East Texas. Production from these non-core areas totaled approximately 670 MBoe, or 1,800 Boe/d, for the year ended December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, estimated proved reserves for these other properties were approximately 2.1 MMBoe in aggregate, of which all were classified as proved developed. We may consider divesting certain of these assets over time. 

Liquids-Rich Exploratory Plays 

In addition to the disclosed areas, we may acquire acreage in other unconventional exploratory plays as opportunities arise. Our strategy for our exploratory projects is to use our in-house geologic and engineering expertise to identify underdeveloped areas that we believe are prospective for oil or liquids-rich production. We can provide no assurance that any of these exploratory areas, or any wells we subsequently drill in the formations we have targeted for exploration and development, will be successful. Due to competitive concerns, we intend to keep the details of such plays confidential until such time as it is appropriate to disclose specific information. 

Risk Management 

We have designed a risk management policy for the use of derivative instruments to provide partial protection against certain risks relating to our ongoing business operations, such as commodity price declines. Derivative contracts are utilized to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations and reduce the variability in our cash flows associated with anticipated sales on future oil and natural gas production. Our objective generally is to hedge 70-80% of our anticipated oil and natural gas production for the next 18 to 24 months However, our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions. Our hedge policies and objectives change as our operational profile changes and/or commodity prices change and currently we have hedged only a limited amount of our anticipated production beyond 2016 due to low commodity prices. As a consequence, our future performance is subject to increased commodity price 

risks and our future cash flows from operations may be subject to greater volatility than historically. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative trading purposes. 

While there are many different types of derivatives available, we typically use costless collar agreements, swap agreements and deferred put options to attempt to manage price risk more effectively. The costless collar agreements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling commodity prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period. All costless collar agreements provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price is below the floor. The swap agreements call for payments to, or receipts from, counterparties depending on whether the index price of oil or natural gas for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for the period contracted under the swap agreement. Under deferred put option agreements, we pay a fixed premium to lock in a specified floor price for a specified future period. If the index price of oil or natural gas falls below the contracted floor price, the counterparty pays us the difference between the index price and the floor price (netted against the fixed premium payable to the counterparty). If the index price rises above floor price, we pay the fixed premium. 

It is our policy to enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties that are creditworthy financial institutions deemed by management as competent and competitive market makers. We did not post collateral under any of our derivative contracts as they are secured under our Senior Credit Agreement or are uncollateralized trades. We will continue to evaluate the benefit of employing derivatives in the future. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk and Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#151; Note 7 , "Derivative and Hedging Activities" for additional information. 

Oil and Natural Gas Operations 

Our principal properties consist of leasehold interests in developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas properties and the reserves associated with these properties. Generally, oil and natural gas leases remain in force as long as production in paying quantities is maintained. Leases on undeveloped oil and natural gas properties are typically for a primary term of three to five years within which we are generally required to develop the property or the lease will expire. In some cases, the primary term of leases on our undeveloped properties can be extended by option payments; the amount of any payments and time extended vary by lease.

(1) Although a well may be classified as productive upon completion, future changes in oil and natural gas prices, operating costs and production may result in the well becoming uneconomical, particularly extension or exploratory wells where there is no production history. 

We own interests in developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas acreage in the locations set forth in the table below. These ownership interests generally take the form of working interests in oil and natural gas leases that have varying provisions. The following table presents a summary of our acreage interests as of December 31, 2015:

Due to a variety of factors, including but not limited to, current market conditions and commodity prices, drilling results of us and other operators in our plays, tract location in relation to current developmental plans, and infrastructure requirements to bring product to market; approximately 165,000 of the 375,263 net owned undeveloped acres as of December 31, 2015, pertaining to certain tracts previously recorded in "Unevaluated oil and natural gas properties" on the consolidated balance 

sheets have been transferred over time into the full cost pool. Of the approximated 210,000 net owned undeveloped acres remaining as of December 31, 2015, approximately 29,000, 46,000 and 33,000 acres will expire in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, if we do not establish production in paying quantities on the units in which such acreage is included or do not pay (to the extent we have the contractual right to pay) delay rentals or obtain other extensions to maintain the lease. The potential lease expirations for 2016, 2017 and 2018 are primarily attributable to our TMS area, for which our capital budget includes the renewal/extension for a limited number of acres, subject to discretion as each lease comes due for renewal. For the majority of the 29,000 net acres expiring in 2016, management has not yet made a decision whether the leases will be renewed (to the extent renewal rights exist). 

We review undeveloped acreage on a quarterly basis for new or changed factors that could impact the renewal decisions, as well as making an assessment for possible impairment in which case the cost of any expired, or soon to be expired acreage, would be transferred the full cost pool to be depleted. For our proved undeveloped locations that are not scheduled to be drilled until after lease expiration, we continually review our near-term lease expirations, actively pursue lease extensions and renewals and modify our drilling schedules in order to preserve the leases. 

At December 31, 2015, we had estimated proved reserves of approximately 146.8 MMBoe comprised of 120.7 MMBbls of crude oil, 13.0 MMBbls of natural gas liquids, and 78.4 Bcf of natural gas. The following table sets forth, at December 31, 2015, these reserves: 

&#160; &#160; Proved Developed &#160; Proved Undeveloped &#160; Total Proved &#160; Oil (MBbls) &#160; &#160; 66,123 &#160; &#160; 54,570 &#160; &#160; 120,693 &#160; Natural Gas Liquids (MBbls) &#160; &#160; 7,561 &#160; &#160; 5,476 &#160; &#160; 13,037 &#160; Natural Gas (MMcf) &#160; &#160; 49,201 &#160; &#160; 29,241 &#160; &#160; 78,442 &#160; Equivalent (MBoe) (1) &#160; &#160; 81,885 &#160; &#160; 64,919 &#160; &#160; 146,804 &#160; 

(1) Natural gas reserves are converted to oil reserves using a ratio of six Mcf to one Bbl of oil. This ratio does not assume price equivalency and, given price differentials, the price for a barrel of oil equivalent for natural gas may differ significantly from the price for a barrel of oil. 

At December 31, 2015, our estimated proved undeveloped (PUD) reserves were approximately 64.9 MMBoe, a 46.8 MMBoe net decrease over the previous year's estimate of 111.7 MMBoe. The following table details the changes in PUD reserves for 2015 (in MBoe): 

Beginning proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2014 &#160; &#160; 111,710 &#160; Undeveloped reserves transferred to developed &#160; &#160; (14,594 ) Revisions &#160; &#160; (38,110 ) Extension and discoveries &#160; &#160; 5,913 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Ending proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2015 &#160; &#160; 64,919 &#160; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 

The decrease in PUD reserves was due to a negative revision associated with the decline in the unweighted 12-month average prices of oil and natural gas during 2015. Negative revisions of approximately 38 MMBoe were largely associated with PUD locations in the Bakken / Three Forks and El Halc&#243;n areas that became uneconomic at the lower unweighted 12-month average prices of oil and natural gas as of December 31, 2015, or were removed because they no longer met the SEC five year development requirement as we have reduced our capital spending since the prior year as a result of the sustained decline in oil and natural gas prices. Further reductions of approximately 15 MMBoe in PUD reserves were the direct result of our development of PUD through our drilling program and the 

associated transfer of those reserves to proved developed reserves, primarily in the Bakken / Three Forks and El Halc&#243;n areas. 

As of December 31, 2015, all of our PUD reserves are planned to be developed within five years from the date they were initially recorded. During 2015, approximately $285.2 million in capital expenditures went toward the development of proved undeveloped reserves, which includes drilling, completion and other facility costs associated with developing proved undeveloped wells. 

Reliable technologies were used to determine areas where PUD locations are more than one offset location away from a producing well. These technologies include seismic data, wire line open hole log data, core data, log cross-sections, performance data, and statistical analysis. In such areas, these data demonstrated consistent, continuous reservoir characteristics in addition to significant quantities of economic estimated ultimate recoveries from individual producing wells. Our management team has been a leader in data gathering and evaluation in these areas and was instrumental in developing consortiums that allow various operators to exchange data. We relied only on production flow tests and historical production data, along with the reliable geologic data mentioned above to estimate proved reserves. No other alternative methods or technologies were used to estimate proved reserves. 

The estimates of quantities of proved reserves contained in this report were made in accordance with the definitions contained in SEC Release No. 33-8995, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting . For additional information on our oil and natural gas reserves, see Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#151;"Supplemental Oil and Gas Information (Unaudited)." 

We account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting in accordance with SEC regulations. Accordingly, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration, and development of proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties, including the costs of abandoned properties, dry holes, geophysical costs, direct internal costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized. All general and administrative corporate costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred. Sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change. Depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method based on proved reserves. The net capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties are subject to a quarterly full cost ceiling test. Our net book value of oil and natural gas properties at March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2015 exceeded the respective ceiling amounts for each quarter end. As a result, we recorded full cost ceiling test impairments before income taxes of $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. See further discussion in Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#151;Note 4, "Oil and Natural Gas Properties." 

Capitalized costs of our evaluated and unevaluated properties at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are summarized as follows:

(1) On May 9, 2014, we completed the divestiture of certain non-core assets in East Texas. The effective date of the transaction was April 1, 2014. (2) During the fourth quarter of 2013, we completed three separate divestitures of non-core properties located in the United States. The effective date of the transactions was July 1, 2013. Additionally, on July 19, 2013, we completed the divestiture of our Eagle Ford assets located in Fayette and Gonzales Counties, Texas. The transaction had an effective date of January 1, 2013. 

(3) Natural gas reserves are converted to oil reserves using a ratio of six Mcf to one Bbl of oil. This ratio does not assume price equivalency and, given price differentials, the price for a barrel of oil equivalent for natural gas may differ significantly from the price for a barrel of oil. (4) Amounts exclude the impact of cash paid or received on settled commodities derivative contracts as we did not elect to apply hedge accounting. 

The average crude oil and natural gas sales prices above do not reflect the impact of cash paid on, or cash received from, settled derivative contracts as these amounts are reflected as " Net gain (loss) on derivative contracts " in the consolidated statements of operations, consistent with our decision not to elect hedge accounting. Including this impact 2015, 2014 and 2013 average crude oil sales prices were $78.50, $84.72 and $90.66 per Bbl and average natural gas sales prices were $3.06, $4.06 and $3.66 per Mcf, respectively. 

Competitive Conditions in the Business 

The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive and we compete with a substantial number of other companies that have greater financial and other resources. Many of these companies explore for, produce and market oil and natural gas, as well as carry on refining operations and market the resultant products on a worldwide basis. The primary areas in which we encounter substantial competition are in locating and acquiring desirable leasehold acreage for our drilling and development operations, locating and acquiring attractive producing oil and natural gas properties, obtaining sufficient availability of drilling and completion equipment and services, obtaining purchasers and transporters of the oil and natural gas we produce and hiring and retaining key employees. There is also competition between oil and natural gas producers and other industries producing energy and fuel. Furthermore, competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation considered from time to time by the government of the United States, the states in which our properties are located and tribal regulations in North Dakota. It is not possible to predict the nature of any such legislation or regulation which may ultimately be adopted or its effects upon our future operations. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of exploring for, developing or producing oil and natural gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation. 

Other Business Matters 

Markets and Major Customers 

The purchasers of our oil and natural gas production consist primarily of independent marketers, major oil and natural gas companies and gas pipeline companies. Historically, we have not experienced any significant losses from uncollectible accounts. In 2015 and 2014, three individual purchasers, Crestwood Midstream Partners, formerly Arrow Field Services LLC, Sunoco Inc. and Suncor Energy Marketing Inc., each accounted for more than 10% of our total sales, collectively representing 57% and 66% of our total sales for the year, respectively. 

Seasonality of Business 

Weather conditions affect the demand for, and prices of, natural gas and can also delay drilling activities, disrupting our overall business plans. Demand for natural gas is typically higher during the winter, resulting in higher natural gas prices for our natural gas production during our first and fourth fiscal quarters. Due to these seasonal fluctuations, our results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that we may realize on an annual basis. 

Operational Risks 

Oil and natural gas exploration and development involves a high degree of risk, which even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. There is no assurance that we will discover or acquire additional oil and natural gas in commercial quantities. Oil and natural gas operations also involve the risk that well fires, blowouts, equipment failure, human error and other events may cause accidental releases of toxic or hazardous materials, such as petroleum liquids or drilling fluids into the environment, or cause significant injury to persons or property. In such event, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred, the satisfaction of which could substantially reduce available cash and possibly result in loss of oil and natural gas properties. Such hazards may also cause damage to or destruction of wells, producing formations, production facilities and pipeline or other processing facilities. 

As is common in the oil and natural gas industry, we will not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or because we believe the premium costs are prohibitive. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material effect on our operating results, financial position or cash flows. For further discussion on risks see Item 1A. Risk Factors . 

Regulations 

All of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas, including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, and the plugging and abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern the size of drilling and spacing units, the density of wells that may be drilled in oil and natural gas properties and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties. In this regard, some states allow the forced pooling or integration of land and leases to facilitate exploration while other states rely primarily or exclusively on voluntary pooling of land and leases. In areas where pooling is primarily or exclusively voluntary, it may be difficult to form spacing units and therefore difficult to develop a project if the operator owns less than 100% of the leasehold. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose specified requirements regarding the ratability of production. On some occasions, tribal and local authorities have imposed moratoria or other restrictions on exploration and production activities pending investigations and studies addressing potential local impacts of these activities before allowing oil and natural gas exploration and production to proceed. 

The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction. 

Environmental Regulations 

Our operations are subject to stringent federal, state, tribal and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety or the protection of the environment. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the United States Environmental Protection 

Agency, commonly referred to as the EPA, issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws, which often require difficult and costly compliance measures. Among other things, environmental regulatory programs typically govern the permitting, construction and operation of a facility. Many factors, including public perception, can materially impact the ability to secure an environmental construction or operation permit. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting our activities. In addition, some laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for environmental contamination, which could result in liability for environmental damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on our part. 

Beyond existing requirements, new programs and changes in existing programs, may address various aspects of our business including natural occurring radioactive materials, oil and natural gas exploration and production, air emissions, waste management, and underground injection of waste material. Environmental laws and regulations have been subject to frequent changes over the years, and the imposition of more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance in the future may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position. 

Hazardous Substances and Wastes 

The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, referred to as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons may include the current or former owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances that have been released at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of some health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. 

Under the federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, referred to as RCRA, most wastes generated by the exploration and production of oil and natural gas are not regulated as hazardous waste. Periodically, however, there are proposals to lift the existing exemption for oil and gas wastes and reclassify them as hazardous wastes. If such proposals were to be enacted, they could have a significant impact on our operating costs and on those of all the industry in general. In the ordinary course of our operations moreover, some wastes generated in connection with our exploration and production activities may be regulated as solid waste under RCRA, as hazardous waste under existing RCRA regulations or as hazardous substances under CERCLA. From time to time, releases of materials or wastes have occurred at locations we own or at which we have operations. These properties and the materials or wastes released thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we have been and may be required to remove or remediate such materials or wastes. 

Water Discharges 

Our operations are also subject to the federal Clean Water Act and analogous state laws. Under the Clean Water Act, the EPA has adopted regulations concerning discharges of storm water runoff. This program requires covered facilities to obtain individual permits, or seek coverage under a general 

permit. Some of our properties may require permits for discharges of storm water runoff and, as part of our overall evaluation of our current operations, we are upgrading storm water management practices at some facilities. We believe that we will be able to obtain, or be included under, these permits, where necessary, and will need to make only minor modifications to existing facilities and operations that would not have a material effect on us. The Clean Water Act and similar state acts regulate other discharges of wastewater, oil, and other pollutants to surface water bodies, such as lakes, rivers, wetlands, and streams. Failure to obtain permits for such discharges could result in civil and criminal penalties, orders to cease such discharges, and costs to remediate and pay natural resources damages. These laws also require the preparation and implementation of Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure Plans in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil. 

Our oil and natural gas production also generates salt water, which we dispose of by underground injection. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), the Underground Injection Control (UIC) regulations promulgated under the SDWA and related state programs regulate the drilling and operation of salt water disposal wells. The EPA directly administers the UIC program in some states, and in others it is delegated to the state for administering. Permits must be obtained before drilling salt water disposal wells, and casing integrity monitoring must be conducted periodically to ensure the casing is not leaking salt water to groundwater. Contamination of groundwater by oil and natural gas drilling, production, and related operations may result in fines, penalties, and remediation costs, among other sanctions and liabilities under the SDWA and state laws. In addition, third party claims may be filed by landowners and other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages, and bodily injury. 

Hydraulic Fracturing 

Our completion operations are subject to regulation, which may increase in the short- or long-term. In particular, the well completion technique known as hydraulic fracturing, which is used to stimulate production of oil and natural gas, has come under increased scrutiny by the environmental community, and many local, state and federal regulators. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and additives under pressure, usually down casing that is cemented in the wellbore, into prospective rock formations at depth to stimulate oil and natural gas production. We engage third parties to provide hydraulic fracturing or other well stimulation services to us in connection with substantially all of the wells for which we are the operator. 

Under the direction of Congress, the EPA has undertaken a study of the effect of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater. The EPA has also announced its plan to propose pre-treatment standards under the Clean Water Act for wastewater discharges from shale hydraulic fracturing operations. Congress may consider legislation to amend the federal SDWA to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and natural gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process. Certain states, including Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, have issued similar disclosure rules. Several environmental groups have also petitioned the EPA to extend toxic release reporting requirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act to the oil and natural gas extraction industry. 

In addition, the Department of the Interior has promulgated new regulations concerning the use of hydraulic fracturing on lands under its jurisdiction, which includes lands on which we conduct or plan to conduct operations. A number of other jurisdictions likewise have sought to impose restrictions or bans on hydraulic fracturing. On December 19, 2013, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania overturned several portions of Pennsylvania's law regulating hydraulic fracturing, allowing local governments in Pennsylvania to regulate hydraulic fracturing through local land use regulations. Other local jurisdictions, including Denton, Texas and several cities in Colorado have adopted, or tried to adopt, regulations restricting hydraulic fracturing. Additional hydraulic fracturing requirements at the federal, state, tribal or local level may limit our ability to operate or increase our operating costs. 

Air Emissions 

The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed and continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources, including oil and natural gas production. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. Our operations, or the operations of service companies engaged by us, may in certain circumstances and locations be subject to permits and restrictions under these statutes for emissions of air pollutants. 

In 2012, the EPA issued four new regulations for the oil and natural gas industry, including: a new source performance standard for volatile organic compounds; a new source performance standard for sulfur dioxide; an air toxics standard for oil and natural gas production; and an air toxics standard for natural gas transmission and storage. The final rule includes the first federal air standards for natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured, or refractured, as well as requirements for several sources, such as storage tanks and other equipment, and has the effect of limiting methane emissions from these sources. Compliance with these regulations has imposed additional requirements and costs on our operations. 

In October 2015, the EPA announced that it was lowering the primary national ambient air quality standard for ozone from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion. Implementation will take place over several years; however, the new standard could result in a significant expansion of ozone nonattainment areas across the United States, including areas in which we operate. Oil and natural gas operations in ozone nonattainment areas would likely be subject to increased regulatory burdens in the form of more stringent emission controls, emission offset requirements, and increased permitting delays and costs. 

Climate Change 

Studies over recent years have indicated that emissions of certain gases may be contributing to warming of the Earth's atmosphere. In response to these studies, governments have been adopting domestic and international climate change regulations that require reporting and reductions of the emission of such greenhouse gases. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of burning oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products, are considered greenhouse gases. Internationally, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement address greenhouse gas emissions, and several countries, including those comprising the European Union, have established greenhouse gas regulatory systems. In the United States, at the state level, many states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have been implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through emission inventories, emissions targets, greenhouse gas cap and trade programs or incentives for renewable energy generation, while others have considered adopting such greenhouse gas programs. 

At the federal level, the EPA has issued regulations requiring us and other companies to annually report certain greenhouse gas emissions from our oil and natural gas facilities. Beyond its measuring and reporting rules, the EPA has issued an "Endangerment Finding" under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, concluding greenhouse gas pollution threatens the public health and welfare of current and future generations. The finding served as the first step in issuing regulations that require permits for and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for certain facilities. 

In addition, President Obama released a Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions in March 2014. Consistent with that strategy, the EPA issued a proposed rule in 2015 that would set additional standards for methane and volatile organic compound emissions from oil and gas production sources, including hydraulically fractured oil wells and natural gas processing and transmission sources. The EPA intends to issue a final rule in 2016. In addition, the federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has 

proposed standards for reducing venting and flaring on public lands. The EPA and BLM actions are part of a series of steps by the Administration that are intended to result by 2025 in a 40-45% decrease in methane emissions from the oil and gas industry as compared to 2012 levels. In the courts, several decisions have been issued that may increase the risk of claims being filed by governments and private parties against companies that have significant greenhouse gas emissions. Such cases may seek to challenge air emissions permits that greenhouse gas emitters apply for and seek to force emitters to reduce their emissions or seek damages for alleged climate change impacts to the environment, people, and property. 

Any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur additional operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems or other compliance costs, and reduce demand for our products. 

The National Environmental Policy Act 

Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities may be subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior, to evaluate major agency actions that have the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment that assesses the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. All of our current exploration and production activities, as well as proposed exploration and development plans, on federal lands require governmental permits that are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. 

Threatened and endangered species, migratory birds, and natural resources 

Various state and federal statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, migratory birds, wetlands, and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Clean Water Act. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service may designate critical habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat designation could result in further material restrictions on federal land use or on private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. Where takings of or harm to species or damages to wetlands, habitat, or natural resources occur or may occur, government entities or at times private parties may act to prevent or restrict oil and gas exploration activities or seek damages for any injury, whether resulting from drilling or construction or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and in some cases, criminal penalties, may result. 

Occupational Safety and Health Act 

We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees. 

Employees and Principal Office 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 323 full-time employees. We hire independent contractors on an as needed basis. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees. We believe that our employee relationships are satisfactory. 

As of December 31, 2015, we leased corporate office space in Houston, Texas at 1000 Louisiana Street, where our principal offices are located. We also lease corporate office space in Denver, Colorado as well as a number of other field office locations.
