Principal Products and Markets 

Our principal markets are the subscription broadcast, consumer electronics and residential security markets where our customers include subscription broadcasters, OEMs, international retailers, private label brands, pro-security dealers and companies in the computing industry. 

We provide subscription broadcasting providers, both domestically and internationally, with our universal remote control devices and integrated circuits, on which our software and device code database library is embedded. We also sell integrated circuits, on which our software and IR device control code database is embedded, and license our IR device control database to OEMs that manufacture televisions, digital audio and video players, streamer boxes, cable converters, satellite receivers, set-top boxes, room air conditioning equipment, game consoles, and wireless mobile phones and tablets. 

We continue to place significant emphasis on expanding our sales and marketing efforts to subscription broadcasters and OEMs in Asia, Latin America and Europe. Owning and operating our own factories in the People's Republic of China ("PRC") has enhanced our ability to compete in the OEM and subscription broadcasting markets. In addition, we have opened subsidiaries in Brazil and Mexico, which have allowed us to increase our reach and better compete in the Central and Latin American subscription broadcast market. We plan to continue to add new sales and administrative personnel to support anticipated sales growth in international markets over the next few years. 

We continue to pursue further penetration of the more traditional OEM consumer electronics markets as well as newer product categories in the mobile electronics markets such as smart phones, tablets and other mobile smart devices. Customers in these 

markets integrate our products and technology into their products to simplify and expand the universal control capabilities of home entertainment ecosystems. Growth in these markets has been driven by the increasing complexity of home entertainment, emerging digital technology, multimedia and interactive internet applications, and the increasing proliferation of connected smart devices offered by OEMs. 

In 2015, we acquired Ecolink Intelligent Technology, Inc. ("Ecolink"), a leading developer of smart home technology. Ecolink provides a wide range of intelligent wireless security and automation components dedicated to redefining the home security experience. Ecolink has over 20 years of wireless engineering expertise in the home security and automation market and holds more than 25 related pending and issued patents. UEI&#8217;s current subscription broadcasting customers are adding home security and automation to their list of service offerings. Our acquisition of Ecolink, one of the largest premise equipment suppliers to this market, enables us to broaden our design expertise and product portfolio to add home security and automation sensors to our capabilities. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, our sales to Comcast Corporation accounted for 21.5% &#32;of our net sales. For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , our sales to DIRECTV and its sub-contractors collectively accounted for 12.4% , 10.4% , and 15.6% &#32;of our net sales, respectively. 

Our One For All &#174; &#32;brand name remote controls and accessories sold within the international retail markets accounted for 8.1% , 9.2% , and 9.4% &#32;of our total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. 

Financial information relating to our international operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 &#32;is included in "ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 15". 

Intellectual Property and Technology 

We hold a number of patents in the United States and abroad related to our products and technology, and have filed domestic and foreign applications for other patents that are pending. At the end of 2015 , we had 364 &#32;issued and pending United States patents related to remote control, home security, safety and automation as well as hundreds of foreign counterpart patents and applications in various territories around the world. 

Our patents have remaining lives ranging from one to eighteen years. We have also obtained copyright registration and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and libraries of IR codes. Additionally, the names of many of our products are registered, or are being registered, as trademarks in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in most of the other countries in which such products are sold. These registrations are valid for terms ranging up to 20 years and may be renewed as long as the trademarks continue to be used and are deemed by management to be important to our operations. While we follow the practice of obtaining patent, copyright and trademark registrations on new developments whenever advisable, in certain cases we have elected common law trade secret protection in lieu of obtaining such other protection. 

A key factor in creating products and software for control of entertainment devices is the device control code database. Since our beginning in 1986, we have compiled an extensive device control code database library that covers over 922,000 &#32;individual device functions and approximately 7,300 &#32;individual consumer electronic equipment brand names, including virtually all IR controlled set-top boxes, televisions, audio components, DVD players, Blu-Ray players, CD players, other remote controlled home entertainment devices and home automation control modules, and wired (CEC) and wireless (IP) control protocols commonly found on many of the latest HDMI and internet connected devices. Our proprietary software automatically detects, identifies and enables the appropriate control commands for any given home entertainment, automation and air conditioning device in the home. Our library is continuously updated with device control codes used in newly introduced AV devices. These control codes are captured directly from the remote control devices or the manufacturer's written specifications to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the database. Our proprietary software and know-how permit us to offer a device control code database that is more robust and efficient than similarly priced products of our competitors. 

Our goal is to provide universal control solutions that require minimal or no user set-up and deliver consistent and intuitive one-touch control of all connected content sources and devices. QuickSet&#174; is a software application that is currently embedded in millions of devices globally. QuickSet may be embedded in an AV device, set-top box, or other host device, or delivered as a Cloud-based service to enable universal remote setup and control. QuickSet enables universal remote control set-up using automated and guided on-screen instructions and a wireless two-way communication link between the remote and the QuickSet enabled device. The two-way connection allows device control code data and configuration settings to be sent to the remote control from the device and greatly simplifies the universal remote control set-up process and can enable other time saving features. QuickSet utilizes data transmitted over HDMI or IP networks to automatically detect various attributes of the connected device and downloads the appropriate control codes and functions into the remote control without the need for the user to enter any additional information. The user does not need to know the brand or model number to set up the device in the remote. Any compatible new device that is 

connected is recognized. Consumers can quickly and easily set up their remotes to control multiple devices. Recently added features in QuickSet address common consumer challenges in universal device control, such as mode confusion and input switching. With QuickSet consumers switch easily between activities and reliably view their chosen content source with a single touch. QuickSet handles the device-specific control requirements. Licensees of QuickSet include service providers such as DIRECTV and Echostar Technologies; smart TV manufacturers such as Sony and Samsung; leading game console manufacturer Microsoft on their Xbox One game system; and mobile and tablet device manufacturers Samsung, LG, OPPO, Huawei and LeTV on some of their platforms. 

Smart devices are becoming a more prevalent part of the home entertainment experience, and UEI offers several solutions to enable entertainment device control with a smart phone, tablet or smart TV. In its smart device control solutions, UEI offers all of the elements needed for device control from the IR microcontroller to the device control database to the user interface for the touchscreen. Nevo is a UEI-designed and developed universal control application designed for Android and iOS tablets and smart phones that UEI has released and that is currently available for download at Google Play and the Apple App Store. 

Methods of Distribution 

Our distribution methods for our remote control devices are dependent on the sales channel. We distribute remote control devices, sensors and AV accessories directly to subscription broadcasters and OEMs, both domestically and internationally. We currently also distribute home security sensors to pro-security installers in the U.S. through a network of dealers. Outside of North America, we sell our wireless control devices and AV accessories under the One For All &#174; &#32;and private label brand names to retailers through our international subsidiaries. We utilize third-party distributors for the retail channel in countries where we do not have subsidiaries. 

We have developed a broad portfolio of patented technologies and the industry's leading database of device control codes. We ship integrated circuits, on which our software and control code database are embedded, directly to manufacturers for inclusion in their products. In addition, we license our software and technology to manufacturers. Licenses are delivered upon the transfer of a product master or on a per unit basis when the software or technology is used in a customer device. 

We provide domestic and international consumer support to our various universal remote control marketers, including manufacturers, cable and satellite providers, retail distributors, and audio and video OEMs through our live and automated call centers. We also make available a web-based support resource, www.urcsupport.com, designed specifically for subscription broadcasters. This solution offers videos and online tools to help users easily set up their universal remote, and as a result reduce call volume at customer support centers. Additionally, the UEI Technical Support Services call center provides customer interaction management services from service and support to retention. Services include pre-repair calls, post-install surveys, and inbound calls for cable customers to provide greater bottom-line efficiencies.

Raw Materials and Dependence on Suppliers 

We utilize our own manufacturing plants and third-party manufacturers and suppliers primarily located within the PRC to produce our remote control and sensor products. In 2014, Maxim Integrated Products International Limited provided 10.7% of our total inventory purchases. In 2015 and 2013, no single supplier provided more than 10% of our total inventory purchases. 

Even though we operate three factories in the PRC and assembly plants in Brazil and Mexico, we continue to evaluate additional contract manufacturers and sources of supply. During 2015 , we utilized multiple contract manufacturers and maintained duplicate tooling for certain of our products. Where possible we utilize standard parts and components, which are available from multiple sources. We continually seek additional sources to reduce our dependence on our integrated circuit suppliers. To further manage our integrated circuit supplier dependence, we include flash microcontroller technology in most of our products. Flash microcontrollers can have shorter lead times than standard microcontrollers and may be reprogrammed, if necessary. This allows us flexibility during any unforeseen shipping delays and has the added benefit of potentially reducing excess and obsolete inventory exposure. This diversification lessens our dependence on any one supplier and allows us to negotiate more favorable terms. 

Seasonality 

Historically, our business has been influenced by the retail sales cycle, with increased sales in the second half of the year. We expect this pattern to be repeated during 2016 . 

See "ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA &#8212; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#8212; Note 22" for further details regarding our quarterly results. 

Competition 

Our principal competitors in the subscription broadcasting market are Remote Solutions, Home Control Singapore PTE, Ltd. (formerly Philips Consumer Electronics), SMK, and Universal Remote Control. In the international retail and private label markets for wireless controls we compete with Logitech, Home Control Singapore PTE, Ltd., Ruwido and Sony, as well as various manufacturers of wireless controls in Asia. Our primary competitors in the OEM market are the original equipment manufacturers themselves and wireless control manufacturers in Asia. In home security, safety and automation, we offer universal sub-gigahertz products that are compatible with the top security panel manufacturers, such as Honeywell, GE, Tyco/DSC and 2GIG. We compete 

in our markets on the basis of product quality, features, price, intellectual property and customer support. We believe that we will need to continue to introduce new and innovative products and software solutions to remain competitive and to recruit and retain competent personnel to successfully accomplish our future objectives.

Environmental Matters 

Many of our products are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws governing chemical substances in products, including laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances and laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products. We may incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party damages or personal injury claims, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws. We also face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the materials composition of our products. 

We may also face significant costs and liabilities in connection with product take-back legislation. The European Union's Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ("WEEE") makes producers of electrical goods financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products. Our European subsidiaries are WEEE compliant. Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the PRC and Japan. 

We believe that we have materially complied with all currently existing international and domestic federal, state and local statutes and regulations regarding environmental standards and occupational safety and health matters to which we are subject. During the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , the amounts incurred in complying with federal, state and local statutes and regulations pertaining to environmental standards and occupational safety and health laws and regulations did not materially affect our earnings or financial condition. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies, may give rise to additional compliance costs that may have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or financial condition. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015 , we employed 2,309 &#32;employees, of which 474 &#32;worked in engineering and research and development, 90 &#32;in sales and marketing, 75 &#32;in consumer service and support, 1,422 &#32;in operations and warehousing and 248 &#32;in executive and administrative functions. In addition, our factories in the PRC and our Asian operations employed an additional 7,934 &#32;staff contracted through agency agreements. 

Labor unions represent approximately 19.0% &#32;of our 2,309 employees. Some unionized workers, employed within Manaus, Brazil, are represented under contract with the Sindicato dos Trabalhadores nas Industrias Metalugicas, Mecanicas e de Materiais Eletricos de Manaus. Other unionized workers, employed within Monterrey, Mexico, are represented under contract with the Sindicato Industrial de Trabajadores de Nuevo Le&#243;n adherido a la Federaci&#243;n Nacional de Sindicatos Independientes. Our business units are subject to various laws and regulations relating to their relationships with their employees. These laws and regulations are specific to the location of each business unit. We believe that our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are good.
