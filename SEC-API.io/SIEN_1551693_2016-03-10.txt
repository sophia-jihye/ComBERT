Overview 

We are a medical aesthetics company committed to making a difference in patients&#8217; lives by enhancing their body image, growing their self &#8209;esteem and restoring their confidence. We were founded to provide greater choice to board &#8209;certified plastic surgeons and patients in need of medical aesthetics products. We have developed a broad portfolio of products with technologically differentiated characteristics, supported by independent laboratory testing and strong clinical trial outcomes. We sell our breast implants and breast tissue expanders, or Breast Products, exclusively to board &#8209;certified and board &#8209;admissible plastic surgeons and tailor our customer service offerings to their specific needs, which we believe helps secure their loya lty and confidence. 

Our primary products are silicone gel breast implants for use in breast augmentation and breast reconstruction procedures, which we offer in over 195 variations of shapes, sizes , fill volumes and textures. Our breast implants are primarily used in elective procedures which are generally performed on a cash &#8209;pay basis. Many of our breast implants incorporate one or more differentiated technologies, including a proprietary high &#8209;strength, cohesive silicone gel and proprietary texturing branded TRUE Texture &#174; . Our breast implants offer a desired balance between strength, shape retention and softness due to the high &#8209;strength, cohesive silicone gel used in our manufacturing process. TRUE Texture &#174; provides texturing on the implant shell that is designed to reduce the incidence of malposition, rotation and capsular contracture. We also offer breast tissue expanders and a range of other aesthetic and specialty products. We do not have any patents or patent applications, but rely on trade secrets, proprietary know &#8209;how and regulatory barriers to protect our products and technologies. 

Our breast implants were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in 2012, based on data we collected from our ongoing, long &#8209;term clinical trial , or the Study, of our breast implants in 1,788 women across 36 investigational sites in the United States , which included 3,506 implants (approximately 53% of which were smooth and 47% of which were textured) . Our clinical trial is the largest prospective, long &#8209;term safety and effectiveness pivotal study of breast implants in the United States and included the largest magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, cohort with 571 patients . The MRI cohort is a subset of study patients that underwent regular MRI screenings in addition to the other aspects of the clinical trial protocol prior to FDA approval. Post-approval, all patients in the Study are subject to serial MRI screening as part of the clinical protocol . The clinical data we collected over a n &#160; eight &#8209;year follow &#8209;up period demonstrated rupture rates, capsular contracture rates and reoperation rates that were comparable to or better than those of our competitors, at similar time points . In addition to our pivotal study, our clinical data is supported by our Continued Access Study of 2,497 women in the United States. We have also commissioned a number of bench trials run by independent laboratories that we believe further demonstrate the advantages of our breast implants over those of our competitors. 

We sell our Breast Products exclusively to board &#8209;certified and board &#8209;admissible plastic surgeons, as determined by the American Board of Plastic Surgery, who we refer to as Plastic Surgeons. These surgeons have completed the extensive multi &#8209;year plastic surgery residency training required by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. While aesthetic procedures are performed by a wide range of medical professionals, including dermatologists, otolaryngologists, obstetricians, gynecologists, dentists and other specialists, the majority of aesthetic surgical procedures are performed by Plastic Surgeons. Plastic Surgeons are thought leaders in the medical aesthetics industry. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, or ASPS, there are approximately 6,400 board &#8209;certified plastic surgeons in the United States. We seek to provide Plastic Surgeons with differentiated services, including enhanced customer service offerings, a ten &#8209;year limited warranty that is the best &#8209;in &#8209;the &#8209;industry based on providing patients with the largest cash reimbursement for certain out &#8209;of &#8209;pocket costs related to revision surgeries in a covered event; a lifetime no &#8209;charge implant replacement program for covered ruptures; and our industry &#8209;first CapCon Care Program, or C3 Program, through which we offer no &#8209;charge replacement implants to breast augmentation patients who experience capsular contracture within the first five years after implantation with our smooth or textured breast implants. 

We commenced sales of our breast implants in the United States in the second quarter of 2012. Our net sales were $38.1 million, $44.7 million and $35.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Our net loss was $41.2 million, $5.8 million and $19.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. 

&#160;

Between October 9, 2015 and March 1, 2016, we voluntarily suspended the sale of all Sientra devices manufactured by our sole manufacturer and supplier Silimed Industria de Implantes Ltda. (formerly, Silimed-Silicone e Instrumental Medico-Cirugio e Hospitalar Ltda.), or Silimed , due to the suspension of Silimed&#8217;s CE certificate by TUV SUD, Silimed&#8217;s notified body under EU regulations, followed by Brazilian regulatory inquiries and a temporary suspension by the Brazilian regulatory agency ANVISA and the Department of the Secretary of State of Rio de Janeiro of the manufacturing and shipment of all medical devices made by Silimed, and recommended that plastic surgeons discontinue implanting the devices until further notice. As of March 1, 2016, after ongoing discussions with the FDA and our own review of the matter with the assistance of independent experts in quality management systems, Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, and data-based risk assessment, we lifted this temporary hold on sale and also sent a letter to our Plastic Surgeons informing them of our market re-entry plans. In addition, on October 22, 2015, there was a fire in the manufacturing building where Silimed primarily manufactures our breast implants. We are working with Silimed to seek clarity as to the near and long-term capabilities of Silimed&#8217;s manufacturing operations. See &#8220;Business &#8212; Manufacturing and Quality Assurance&#8221; and &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Relating to Our Business and Our Industry &#8221; for further detail. 

Our Market 

The overall market for medical aesthetic procedures is significant, and awareness and acceptance of these procedures is growing in the United States. According to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, or ASAPS, in 201 4 , consumers in the United States spent approximately $12.4 billion on aesthetic procedures overall, including both surgical and non &#8209;invasive cosmetic treatment s. Of this amount, more than $7.5 billion was spent on aesthetic surgical procedures. 

Breast augmentation surgery remains the leading aesthetic surgical procedure by dollars and number of procedures in the United States. According to ASAPS, over 287 ,000 primary breast augmentation procedures and 72 ,000 revision augmentation procedures were perfor med in the United States in 2014 . These procedures provide cosmetic solutions generally to enhance breast size and shape, correct breast asymmetries or help restore fullness after breastfeeding. For breast reconstruction, ASPS estimates that approximately 102 ,000 procedures were performed in the United States in 201 4 . These procedures are a surgical solution generally used to restore a breast to near normal shape and appearance following a mastectomy and typically utilize a breast tissue expander prior to implantation of a breast implant. Based on the number of procedures reported by ASAPS and by ASPS, and our estimates of average selling price, implant mix and implants per procedure, we estimate that the U.S. market for breast implants and breast tissue expanders exceeded $6 30 million in 201 4 . 

Our Opportunity 

We believe a significant opportunity exists in the U.S. marketplace due to the high barriers to entry in the U.S. breast implant market and the historical lack of product and service innovation for Plastic Surgeons. 

For more than 20 years prior to the FDA approval of our breast implants in 2012, only two companies manufactured and distributed breast implants in the United States. We believe that this market concentration is largely a result of the considerable costs and risks associated with the lengthy regulatory approval process required by the FDA, which has created a significant barrier to entry in the U.S. breast implant market. All new breast implants require pre &#8209;market approval, or PMA, from the FDA before they may be marketed in the United States. The PMA application process is lengthy and uncertain, and the PMA application must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires long &#8209;term follow &#8209;up of a large number of enrolled patients, as well as extensive technical, pre &#8209;clinical, clinical and manufacturing data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. At present, we are not aware of any ongoing clinical studies in the United States for silicone gel breast implants other than those post &#8209;approval studies being performed by us and our two U.S. competitors. We believe that in the near term, it is likely that the companies currently providing silicone gel breast implants in the United States will continue to be the only companies servicing the U.S. silicone breast implant &#160; market. 

We believe the rigorous FDA approval process and the existence of only two competitors in the U.S. market have historically contributed to a lack of technological innovation in the U.S. breast implant industry resulting in limited product choices. Until the FDA approval of our breast implants in 2012 , surgeons in the United States were only able to purchase basic round breast implants from our two U.S. competitors, while surgeons outside of the United States were able to purchase technologically &#8209;advanced round and anatomically &#8209;shaped breast implants. 

&#160;

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities afforded by current market dynamics. By focusing on products with technologically differentiated characteristics, demonstrating strong clinical data, offering more product choice and providing services tailored specifically to the needs of Plastic Surgeons, we believe we can continue to enhance our position in the breast implant market. Our competitive strengths include: 

Differentiated silicone gel and texturing technologies. We incorporate differentiated technologies into our breast implants, including a proprietary high &#8209;strength, cohesive silicone gel and proprietary texturing branded TRUE Texture &#174; . Our breast implants offer a desired balance between strength, shape retention and softness due to the high-strength, cohesive silicone gel used in our manufacturing process. In addition, TRUE Texture &#174; technology provides texturing on the implant shell that is designed to reduce the incidence of malposition, rotation and capsular contracture. We do not have any patents or patent applications, but rely on trade secrets, proprietary know &#8209;how and regulatory barriers to protect our products and technologies. 

Strong clinical trial outcomes. Our clinical trial results demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our breast implants. Our breast implants were approved by the FDA based on data we collected from our ongoing, long &#8209;term clinical trial of our breast implants in 1,788 women across 36 investigational sites in the United States. The clinical data we collected over an eight-year follow-up period demonstrated rupture rates, capsular contracture rates and reoperation rates that were comparable to or better than those of our competitors, based on our competitors&#8217; published eight &#8209;year data. 

Innovative services that deliver an improved customer experience. Our customer service offerings are intended to accommodate and anticipate the needs of Plastic Surgeons so that they can focus on providing better services to their patients. W e provide a ten &#8209;year limited warranty that is the best &#8209;in &#8209;the &#8209;industry based on providing patients with the largest cash reimbursement for certain out &#8209;of &#8209;pocket costs related to revision surgeries in a covered event ; a lifetime no &#8209;charge implant replacement program for covered rupture s; and our industry &#8209;first C3 Program through which we offer no &#8209;charge replacement implants to breast augmentation patients who experience capsular contracture within the first five years after implantation with our smooth or textured breast implants. We also offer specialized educational initiatives and a streamlined ordering, shipping and billing process. 

Board &#8209;certified plastic surgeon focus. We sell our Breast Products exclusively to board &#8209;certified and board &#8209;admissible plastic surgeons who are thought leaders in the medical aesthetics industry.

Proven and experienced leadership team. We have a highly experienced management team at both the corporate and operational levels with significant experience in the medical aesthetics industry. Members of our senior management team have extensive experience in the medical aesthetics industry. 

Our Strategy 

Our objective is to become a leading global provider of differentiated medical aesthetic products and services tailored to meet the needs of Plastic Surgeons, allowing us to deliver on our commitment to enhance and make a difference in patients&#8217; lives. We are currently focused on growing the breast implant and breast tissue expander markets and our share of them in the United States, and intend to leverage our capabilities into new or complementary aesthetic products or technologies and new geographic markets or market segments. To achieve our objective, we are pursuing the following business strategies: 

Create awareness of our differentiated technologies, products and services with Plastic Surgeons and consumers. Since we commenced commercial operations , we have focused most of our marketing efforts on Plastic Surgeons to promote and create awareness of the benefits of our products. Among other marketing programs targeted at Plastic Surgeons, we offer educational initiatives exclusively to Plastic Surgeons through our Sientra Education Forums. Recently, we have increased our consumer-directed efforts including an expanded exclusive collaboration with RealSelf.com. We believe that continuing to invest in expanding marketing initiatives will have a positive impact on our business . 

Selectively pursue acquisitions and expand into new markets . We may selectively pursue domestic and international acquisitions of businesses or technologies that may allow us to leverage our relationships with Plastic 

&#160;

Surgeons and our existing commercial infrastructure to provide us with new or complementary products or technologies, and allow us to compete in new geographic markets or market segments or to increase our market share. 

Broaden our product portfolio and launch new products and services. We plan to continue to develop products that address the unmet needs of Plastic Surgeons and patients by leveraging our innovative technologies in combination with our regulatory and product development expertise. We have a number of new Breast Products under development with different characteristics and configurations. We believe these expanded product choices will allow Plastic Surgeons to potentially achieve better outcomes for their patients. 

Enhance our sales capabilities and marketing programs to drive adoption of our products. We intend to increase our direct sales capabilities through the hiring of additional, experienced sales representatives and support staff. We believe that continued expansion of our sales team will allow us to broaden our market reach and educate a broader group of Plastic Surgeons on the benefits of our products. 

Invest in clinical studies and peer reviewed articles with key opinion leaders. We intend to continue to invest in clinical studies in order to provide published peer reviewed articles that support the clinical benefits of our products and technologies over those of our competitors. We believe our relationship with Plastic Surgeons and our continued focus on providing differentiated products and services will allow us to leverage our existing capabilities to increase our share of the breast implant market specifically and the medical aesthetics market generally. 

Our Products 

Our portfolio of products has been specifically tailored to the needs of the Plastic Surgeons we serve. We believe that our broad portfolio of products with technologically differentiated characteristics enable Plastic Surgeons to deliver better outcomes for their patients. 

Breast Augmentation and Breast Reconstruction Products 

Breast Implants. We offer the following breast implants: 

&#183; 

Anatomically &#8209;shaped textured. A full line of textured, anatomically &#8209;shaped HSC+ breast implants, all of which incorporate our high &#8209;strength, cohesive silicone gel and TRUE Texture &#174; technology. Our anatomically &#8209;shaped implants are engineered for shape retention and feature a gradual upper &#8209;pole slope and distributed volume that mimics the characteristics of a natural breast. They also provide a desired balance between strength, shape retention and softness and are designed to enhance tissue adherence to reduce malposition and capsular contracture. Due to the unique relationship between our implant gel and our implant shells, our anatomically &#8209;shaped implants have enhanced ability to retain their shape without sacrificing the desired softness. We offer these anatomically &#8209;shaped implants in three configurations: round &#8209;base, classic &#8209;base and oval &#8209;base. Our round &#8209;base implants are available in eight volumes, our classic &#8209;base implants are available in eight volumes and our oval &#8209;base implants are available in three projection profiles and 25 volumes. 

&#183; 

Round textured. A full line of textured, round HSC breast implants, all of which incorporate our high &#8209;strength, cohesive silicone gel and TRUE Texture &#174; technology. Our textured, round implants maintain softness and are designed to enhance tissue adherence that reduces malposition and capsular contracture. We offer these textured, round implants in three projection profiles: low, moderate and high. Our low projection implants are available in 15 volumes, our moderate plus projection implants are available in 16 volumes and our high projection implants are available in 14 volumes. 

&#183; 

Round smooth. A full line of smooth, round HSC and HSC+ breast implants, all of which incorporate our high &#8209;strength, cohesive silicone gel. Our smooth, round implants are designed to deliver full upper &#8209;pole aesthetic results without compromising softness. We offer these smooth, round implants in five projection profiles: low, moderate, moderate plus, moderate high and high . Additionally, in the third quarter of 2015 , we introduced two implant projection profiles available in HSC+ gel in 30 new volumes mirroring the existing HSC moderate plus and high projection profiles. 

Breast Tissue Expanders. We offer a full line of breast tissue expanders, most of which are marketed as ACX, in 25 different shapes and sizes that include single and double chamber tissue expanders. Our double chamber tissue 

&#160;

expanders are unique to the marketplace and feature technology that was designed to allow controlled and differentiated expansion of breast tissue. Our breast tissue expanders are used in breast reconstruction and implanted during or after the completion of a mastectomy and before the patient has enough tissue to adequately cover a breast implant. Our breast tissue expanders are temporary devices intended to aid in the process of recreating tissue coverage to allow for the placement of the final implant to reconstruct the breast. 

Other Products 

We also offer a range of other aesthetic products that have received 510(k) clearance from the FDA, including: 

&#183; 

body contouring and other implants, including gluteal, pectoral, calf, facial and nasal implants, and nasal stents, all made from single pieces of silicone elastomer; 

&#183; 

silicone elastomer oval carving blocks that can be shaped and sized by surgeons to address congenital and other deformities caused by trauma or tumor removal ; 

&#183; 

scar management products under the brand Medgel that use a compound of biocompatible, medical &#8209;grade silicone gel or sheeting specifically formulated to treat or prevent various types of scars; 

&#183; 

temporary, single &#8209;use, saline &#8209;filled breast implant sizers that can be used to help identify the correct style and size implant for an individual patient; and 

&#183; 

non &#8209;breast tissue expanders, which are temporary devices intended to aid in the process of expanding tissue and skin surface area for burn care and other reconstructive use. 

Our Technology 

Our current portfolio of breast implants utilizes what we believe are the most advanced technologies currently available on the market. These technologies are supported by rigorous product testing, analytics and clinical data. The advanced technologies in our products include: 

High &#8209;strength, cohesive silicone gel. Our HSC and HSC+ breast implants offer a desired balance between strength, shape retention and softness due to the high &#8209;strength, cohesive silicone gel used in our manufacturing process. The use of high &#8209;strength, cohesive silicone gel in our HSC and HSC+ breast implants allows the breast implants to hold a controlled shape while maintaining a soft feel. 

The silicone material used in our breast implants has been designed to provide the characteristics desired by Plastic Surgeons for breast implants. At present, we are the only company in the United States that has received FDA approval to use this specific silicone material in our products. 

We have completed a number of studies conducted by independent laboratories to demonstrate the competitive advantages of using high &#8209;strength, cohesive silicone gel in our breast implants. We believe this technology differentiates our breast implants for the following reasons: 

&#183; 

our implant gel is stronger, which is evidenced by its resistance to gel fracture; 

&#183; 

due to the unique relationship between our implant gel and our implant shells, our implants have an enhanced ability to retain their shape while preserving the shape of anatomically &#8209;shaped implants without sacrificing the desired softness; and 

&#183; 

our shaped implants are softer and more elastic than our competitors&#8217; shaped implants. 

&#160;

We believe the beneficial properties of our implants arise from the characteristics of the gel, as well as the unique integration of the gel with our implant shell. Inside each of our implants, the gel adheres to the shell, creating additional structural strength and shape retention in the implant. This results in the ability to deliver strength and shaping capability without a stiffer gel or implant and without sacrificing the desired softness. We typically evaluate these characteristics using the following metrics: 

&#183; 

Peel &#8209;force. Peel &#8209;force is measured by the amount of force, measured in pound &#8209;force, or lbf, necessary to separate the outer shell of the implant from the intern al gel filling. A greater peel &#8209; force measurement indicates greater gel &#8209;shell integration. In the case of anatomically &#8209;shaped implants, greater peel &#8209;force can also be an indication of the ability of the implant to retain its shape, particularly the upper portions of the implant, also referred to as the upper pole. Upper pole stability is of particular importance in preserving the desired anatomical shape of an implant over time. 

&#183; 

Gel strength. Gel strength is measured by the amount of force, measured in lbf, required to cause permanent fractures in the gel. A larger value indicates greater strength. 

&#183; 

Gel elasticity and implant elasticity. Gel elasticity and implant elasticity can be measured by the level of resistance, measured in millimeters, or mm, to an applied constant force. A higher value represents greater softness and a lower deformation value represents greater firmness. 

TRUE Texture &#174; . We sell breast implants that are available with a smooth outer surface or with an outer surface that is textured using TRUE Texture &#174; technology. We believe our textured breast implants using TRUE Texture &#174; technology offer us clinical advantages over our competitors&#8217; textured products, including: 

&#183; 

better tissue adherence to reduce the incidence of malposition and rotation; and 

&#183; 

reduction in the rate of capsular contracture, a complication in which the patient&#8217;s body creates a scar &#8209;tissue capsule around the implant that can tighten and squeeze the implant potentially causing discomfort, pain and even dislocation of the implant. While we have neither sought nor obtained FDA approval to state that TRUE Texture &#174; technology reduces the incidence of capsular contracture, we believe it may significantly reduce this risk, as evidenced by the lower rates of capsular contraction reported over a five &#8209;year follow &#8209;up period in our ongoing clinical trial. 

On a breast implant, the desired texture should have a proportionate amount of surface disruption, as overly aggressive texture can result in double &#8209;capsule formation while not enough texturing can result in a lack of adherence resulting in malposition or rotation. We believe that TRUE Texture &#174; technology has the right combination of surface disruption without overly aggressive texturing. 

We use the competitive advantages demonstrated by the independent laboratory results above and our clinical results for our breast implants incorporating high &#8209;strength, cohesive silicone gel and TRUE Texture &#174; technology to market and differentiate our products to Plastic Surgeons. 

Our Clinical Data 

In 2012, our breast implants were approved by the FDA, based on data we co llected from our ongoing, long &#8209; term clinical trial of our breast implants in 1,788 women across 36 investigational sites in the United States, which included 3,506 implants (approximately 53% of which were smooth and 47% of which were textured). Our clinical trial results demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our breast implants and provide Plastic Surgeons and their patients the security and confidence to choose our products. 

Our clinical trial is the largest prospective, long &#8209;term safety and effectiveness pivotal study of breast implants in the United States and included the largest magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, cohort with 571 patients. The MRI cohort is a subset of study patients that underwent regular MRI screenings in addition to the other aspects of the clinical trial protocol prior to FDA approval. Post-approval, all patients in the Study are subject to serial MRI screening as part of the clinical protocol . The clinical data we collected over an eight &#8209;year follow &#8209;up period demonstrated rupture rates, capsular contracture rates and reoperation rates that were comparable to or better than those of our competitors, at similar time points. In addition to our pivotal study, our clinical data is supported by our Continued Access Study of 2,497 women in 

&#160;

the United States. We have also commissioned a number of bench trials run by independent laboratories that we believe further demonstrate the advantages of our breast implants over those of our competitors. 

We, and our two competitors were required to run independent ten &#8209;year clinical studies to obtain PMA approval from the FDA. Our clinical study was not designed to facilitate head &#8209;to &#8209;head comparisons. However, our clinical data and our competitors&#8217; clinical data are publicly available to both surgeons and patients who are able to use such data to compare and contra s t competing implants. 

Our Services 

Our services are designed to cater to the specific needs of Plastic Surgeons to enable them to maintain and grow their practices. We provide our Plastic Surgeons with superior warranty programs, enhanced customer service offerings and specialized educational initiatives. We believe that tailoring our customer service offerings to Plastic Surgeons helps secure their loyalty and confidence. 

Industry &#8209;Leading Product Programs and Warranties. Through our C3 Program, we provide no &#8209;charge replacement implants to patients who experience capsular contracture in the first five years following primary breast augmentation. We provide this benefit to every patient implanted with our smooth or textured breast implants. We also provide a ten &#8209;year limited warranty that is the best &#8209;in &#8209;the &#8209;industry , based on providing patients with the largest cash reimbursement for certain out &#8209;of &#8209;pocket costs related to revision surgeries in a covered event and a lifetime no &#8209;charge implant replacement program for covered ruptures. 

Enhanced Customer Service. As we focus exclusively on Plastic Surgeons and their patients, we believe we are able to tailor our customer service offerings to their specific needs. Our surgeon &#8209;facing customer service policies include: 

&#183; 

simplified account setup through our sales representatives and with pre &#8209;qualification and pre &#8209;approved credit terms; 

&#183; 

no &#8209;charge shipping to and from accounts; 

&#183; 

six &#8209;month pre &#8209;approved returns of unused products with no &#8209;charge return shipping and no restocking fees; 

&#183; 

end &#8209;of &#8209;month statement billing, rather than one invoice per shipment, and 30 &#8209;day payment terms; 

&#183; 

individualized consignment inventory; and 

&#183; 

order acceptance by phone, fax, email or through our sales representatives. 

Educational and Marketing Initiatives. We have implemented educational and marketing initiatives with a focus on both Plastic Surgeons and their patients considering breast augmentation or reconstruction. 

Plastic Surgeons. In order to educate Plastic Surgeons about our product lines and, in particular, about the proper use of our anatomically &#8209;shaped breast implants, we provide a variety of education programs for Plastic Surgeons under the banner of the Sientra Education Forum. 

&#183; 

we have developed a tablet &#8209;based mobile marketing tool for our sales representatives to use while calling on accounts that includes access to our patient and surgeon labeling, published clinical studies, marketing literature, details on our warranty and C3 programs, our educational iBooks and more. 

&#183; 

we host symposia with one or more key &#8209;note speakers who speak on topics ranging from our corporate identity and customer service offerings to surgical tips and suggestions from thought &#8209;leading Plastic Surgeons. 

&#183; 

we produce comprehensive guides for Plastic Surgeons via the Internet, referred to as iBooks, to provide them training and expertise on the implantation of anatomically &#8209;shaped breast implants. 

&#160;

&#183; 

we send a limited number of Plastic Surgeons to Europe to observe surgeries and train with world &#8209;renowned surgeons who have been implanting anatomically &#8209;shaped breast implants for decades and, upon return to the United States, we engage them as consultant &#8209;educators to conduct tr aining sessions for other U.S. &#8209; based Plastic Surgeons. 

&#183; 

we periodically sponsor educational surgical preceptorships where a small group of Plastic Surgeons are able to observe a live surgery conducted by one of our trained preceptors and train with that preceptor. 

Patients. We have been engaging directly with consumers who are considering breast augmentation or reconstruction. We initially focused our consumer educational and marketing activities on websites where consumers come to research their breast augmentation or reconstruction options, including: 

&#183; 

our own consumer website, branded with our &#8220;Feel So Good&#8221; campaign, that provides resources for consumers considering breast augmentation or reconstruction, including referrals and commentaries, product descriptions, patient planning guides and educational brochures and information regarding our rupture warranty and C3 programs; and 

&#183; 

our exclusive collaboration with RealSelf, the leading online community helping people make confident choices in elective cosmetic procedures. Together with RealSelf, we deliver fresh and meaningful content to the RealSelf community that answers common questions patients have regarding breast augmentation. This content is featured on a dedicated Sientra page on RealSelf&#8217;s website designed to build consumer engagement with the brand and open up the online conversation around breast augmentation directly with Plastic Surgeons. 

We believe that our innovative services, including industry &#8209;leading product programs and warranties, enhanced customer service offerings and educational and marketing initiatives, deliver an improved customer experience to Plastic Surgeons and their patients. 

Sales and Marketing 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had a sales organization of 51 employees, including sales representatives and sales management. We assign sales territories based on the regions with the highest concentration of accounts. Our sales team is supported by customer and sales experience teams, which provide full &#8209;time telephonic and email customer support to our sales representatives and customers. 

In addition, our marketing team leads our efforts in brand development, trade &#160; show attendance, educational forums, product messaging, website development and advertising, among others. 

Research and Development 

We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant research and development expenses. Our research and development expenses were approximately $7.2 million, $4.7 million and $4.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. Our research and development expenses primarily consist of costs associated with our clinical and post &#8209;approval studies, regulatory activity and product development, including our efforts to seek approval for a range of breast implant line extensions that would allow us to sell Breast Products in additional styles, sizes and projections that we do not currently offer. 

Manufacturing and Quality Assurance 

All of our products are listed under our FDA Medical Device Establishment Registration and Device Listing where it indicates we are the specification developer of our products, and except for our breast implant sizers , &#160; we are the owner of our products&#8217; FDA approvals and clearances. This means that we are primarily responsible for the design, manufacturing and quality assurance of our products. However, we do not manufacture our products ourselves. Instead, we rely on Silimed , our &#160; sole source, third-party manufacturer located in Brazil , to manufacture and package our silicone gel breast implants, tissue expanders and other products to our specifications. Silimed has over 35 years of experience manufacturing silicone &#8209;based implants and distributes its products to over 60 countries worldwide. When we receive our products from Silimed, we inspect a representative sample of packaging and labeling prior to shipping them to our customers. We maintain strategic levels of inventory at our storage facilities located in Santa Barbara, California. 

&#160;

We and Silimed are subject to the FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, reporting requirements and current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP , audits by the FDA. Under the QSR and cGMP requirements, manufacturers, including third party manufacturers, must follow stringent design, testing, production, control, supplier and contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process. Both Silimed and us have been inspected by the FDA regularly, and no FDA Form 483 observations, which are issued when an FDA inspector has observed any conditions that in his or her judgment may constitute violations of the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act and related Acts, or FD&#38;C, may be in violation of FDA&#8217;s requirements. Silimed has had four FDA inspections in 14 years and is also audited periodically by our quality department to ensure conformity with the specifications, policies and procedures for our products. 

At present, except for our breast implant sizers, all of our products, including our silicone gel breast implants and breast tissue expanders, are manufactured by Silimed pursuant to an amended and restated exclusivity agreement with Silimed , which we refer to as the Silimed Agreement. Pursuant to the Silimed Agreement, Silimed manufactures and supplies products ordered by us for distribution in the United States and Canada, which we refer to as the Territory. We agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to promote, sell and distribute the products in the Territory. In addition to Silimed&#8217;s existing products, we have the exclusive right to sell and distribute any new products manufactured by Silimed during the term of the Silimed Agreement. Silimed sells the products to us at a fixed cost, which may be increased by no more than a low single &#8209;digit percentage per annum. 

The Silimed Agreement provides that Silimed will not provide its products to any third party in the Territory, with the exception of the distribution of its gastric and urology products pursuant to pre &#8209;existing supply agreements that it has with third &#8209;party distributors, and we have agreed not to sell Silimed&#8217;s products to any third party if we have reason to believe that such products have been or will be distributed outside of the Territory. We have also agreed not to distribute any product that directly competes with a product manufactured by Silimed in the Territory. 

In the event Silimed fails to supply products ordered by us, we may, under certain circumstances, exercise manufacturing rights to manufacture the products directly or through a third party manufacturer. Pursuant to the Silimed Agreement, Silimed granted to us an exclusive, royalty &#8209;free, non &#8209;transferable license to use certain of its trademarks in the Territory, including in the event Silimed fails to supply the products to us and in connection with the marketing and sale of the products in the Territory. In addition, the Silimed Agreement allocates intellectual property rights between the parties, including that the parties will jointly own all developments, modifications, enhancements or alterations of products jointly created by the parties, subject to certain restrictions concerning the use of such improvements outside of the Territory. Each party is subject to certain limitations and other restrictions on the transfer of the other party&#8217;s technology to third parties. 

The Silimed Agreement can be terminated by either party under certain limited circumstances, including in connection with the other party&#8217;s breach of any of its material obligations which such breaching party fails to cure within 60 days of receiving notice from the non &#8209;breaching party. If the breach relates only to single product, then the non &#8209;breaching party is entitled to terminate the agreement with respect to that specific product. The parties may also terminate the agreement at any time on a product &#8209;by &#8209;product basis upon mutual written agreement of the parties. 

The term of the Silimed Agreement will continue until April 2017. 

Several recent events have occurred which have affected our ability to rely on Silimed as our source for our silicone gel breast implants, tissue expanders and other products in the short and long term, including the suspension of Silimed&#8217;s CE certificate by TUV SUD, Silimed&#8217;s notified body under EU regulation, relating to particles on Silimed breast products , followed by Brazilian regulatory inquiries and a temporary suspension by the Brazilian regulatory agency ANVISA and the Department of the Secretary of State of Rio de Janeiro of the manufacturing and shipment of all medical devices made by Silimed, including products manufactured for Sientra. As a result of this suspension, between October 9, 2015 and March 1, 2016, we voluntarily placed a temporary hold on the sale of all Sientra devices manufactured by Silimed and recommended that plastic surgeons discontinue implanting the devices until further notice . As of March 1, 2016, after ongoing discussions with the FDA and our own review of the matter with the assistance of independent experts in quality management systems, GMP and data-based risk assessment, we lifted this temporary hold on sale and also sent a letter to our Plastic Surgeons informing them of our market re-entry plans. 

In addition, on October 22, 2015, there was a fire in the manufacturing building where Silimed primarily manufactures Sientra&#8217;s breast implants. We are working with Silimed to seek clarity as to the near and long-term capabilities of Silimed&#8217;s manufacturing operations, including the status of equipment that is used to manufacture breast 

&#160;

implants and the potential feasibility, production capacity and timing related to Silimed&#8217;s ability to manufacture our breast implants. 

Competition 

The medical device industry is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and highly sensitive to the introduction of new products or other market activities of industry participants. We primarily compete with two companies that manufacture and sell breast implants in the United States: Johnson &#38; Johnson through its wholly owned subsidiary, Mentor Worldwide, LLC, or Mentor, and Allergan plc, or Allergan. 

Both of our U.S. competitors are either publicly &#8209;traded companies or divisions or subsidiaries of publicly &#8209;traded companies with significantly more market share and resources than we have. These companies have greater financial resources for sales, marketing and product development, broader established relationships with healthcare providers and third &#8209;party payors, and larger and more established distribution networks. In some instances, our competitors also offer products that include features that we do not currently offer. For example, Allergan sells temporary gel sizers for silicone gel implants and we sell only temporary saline filled sizers. In addition, our competitors may offer pricing programs with discounts across their non &#8209;breast aesthetic product portfolios. 

We also face potential future competition from a number of companies, medical researchers and existing medical device companies that may be pursuing new implant technologies, new material technologies and new methods of enhancing and reconstructing the breast. 

We believe the primary competitive factors in our markets include: 

&#183; 

breadth of portfolio; 

&#183; 

technological characteristics of products; 

&#183; 

clinical evidence; 

&#183; 

product price; 

&#183; 

customer service; and 

&#183; 

support by key opinion leaders. 

Government Regulation 

Our products are medical devices subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal and state regulatory authorities, Health Canada and, if we commence international sales outside of the United States and Canada, other regulatory bodies in other countries. 

Regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the FDA&#8217;s implementing regulations govern, among other things: 

&#183; 

product design and development; 

&#183; 

pre &#8209;clinical and clinical testing; 

&#183; 

establishment registration and product listing; 

&#183; 

product manufacturing; 

&#183; 

product labeling and storage; 

&#183; 

pre &#8209;market clearance or approval; 

&#183; 

post &#8209;market studies; 

&#160;

&#183; 

advertising and promotion; 

&#183; 

product sales and distribution; 

&#183; 

recordkeeping and device tracking; 

&#183; 

complaint handling; 

&#183; 

recalls and field safety corrective actions; and 

&#183; 

post &#8209;market surveillance and adverse event reporting, including reporting of deaths, serious injuries or device malfunctions. 

Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a pre &#8209;market notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of a pre &#8209;market approval, or PMA, application. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA approval processes can be expensive, lengthy and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available. 

The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Unless specifically exempted from certain requirements, all three classes of devices are subject to general controls such as labeling, pre &#8209;market notification and adherence to the FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which cover manufacturers&#8217; methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of products. Devices deemed to pose low to moderate risk are placed in Class I or II, which, absent an exemption, requires the manufacturer to obtain a 510(k) clearance. Class II devices are subject to special controls such as performance standards, post &#8209;market surveillance, FDA guidelines, or particularized labeling requirements, as well as general controls. Some low risk devices are exempted by regulation from the 510(k) clearance requirement, and/or the requirement of compliance with substantially all of the QSR. A PMA application is required for devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life &#8209;sustaining, life &#8209; supporting or certain implantable devices, including all breast implants, or devices that are &#8220;not substantially equivalent&#8221; either to a device previously cleared through the 510(k) process or to a &#8220;preamendment&#8221; Class III device in commercial distribution in the United states before May 28, 1976 for which a regulation requiring a PMA application has not been issued by the FDA. 

Our tissue expanders and our body contouring, facial and nasal implants received FDA clearance as Class II devices at various dates prior to approval of our breast implants in March 2012. To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit a pre &#8209;market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a preamendment device. The FDA&#8217;s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to 12 months from the date the application is completed, but it can take significantly longer and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) pre &#8209;market notifications are cleared without clinical data, in some cases, the FDA requires significant clinical data to support substantial equivalence. In reviewing a pre &#8209;market notification, the FDA may request additional information, including clinical data, which may significantly prolong the review process. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer&#8217;s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer&#8217;s determination regarding whether a new pre &#8209;market submission is required for the modification of an existing device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application is obtained. If the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application for any modifications to a previously cleared product, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval. In addition, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite PMA application(s). In addition, the FDA is currently evaluating the 510(k) process and may make substantial changes to industry requirements. 

Silicone gel &#8209;filled breast implants are treated as Class III devices and a full PMA is required. A PMA for our breast implants was approved by the FDA in March 2012. The PMA application process is generally more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process and requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA application must be supported by valid scientific evidence that typically includes, but is 

&#160;

not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, pre &#8209;clinical and clinical trial data, and manufacturing and labeling information to demonstrate to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After a PMA application is submitted and found to be sufficiently complete, the FDA begins an in &#8209;depth review of the submitted information. By statute, the FDA has 180 days to review the &#8220;accepted application,&#8221; although, generally, review of the application takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA generally will conduct a pre &#8209;approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to evaluate compliance with QSR, which requires manufacturers to implement and follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures in the device design and manufacturing process. 

The FDA may approve a PMA application with post &#8209;approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution and collection of long &#8209;term follow &#8209;up data from patients in the clinical study that supported approval. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval. New PMA applications or PMA application supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling and design of a device that could affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the device&#8217;s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application, and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel, depending on the nature of the proposed change. 

Clinical Trials. A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application and may be required for a 510(k) pre &#8209;market notification. In the United States, absent certain limited exceptions, human clinical trials intended to support product clearance or approval require an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, application. Some types of studies deemed to present &#8220;non &#8209;significant risk&#8221; are deemed to have an approved IDE once certain requirements are addressed and institutional review board, or IRB, approval is obtained. If the device presents a &#8220;significant risk&#8221; to human health, as defined by the FDA, the Sponsor must submit an IDE application to the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trials. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to evaluate the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of subjects, unless the product is deemed a non &#8209;significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the responsible institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. There can be no assurance that submission of an IDE will result in the ability to commence clinical trials. Additionally, after a trial begins, the FDA may place it on hold or terminate it if, among other reasons, it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to unacceptable health risks that outweigh the benefits of participation in the study. During a study, we are required to comply with the FDA&#8217;s IDE requirements for investigator selection, clinical trial monitoring, reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or making safety or efficacy claims for them. We are also responsible for the appropriate labeling and distribution of investigational devices. Our clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations and federal and state regulations concerning human subject protection, including informed consent and healthcare privacy. The investigators must also obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. The FDA&#8217;s grant of permission to proceed with clinical testing does not constitute a binding commitment that the FDA will consider the study design adequate to support clearance or approval. In addition, there can be no assurance that the data generated during a clinical study will meet chosen safety and effectiveness endpoints or otherwise produce results that will lead the FDA to grant marketing clearance or approval. 

Other Regulatory Requirements. Even though our breast implants have been approved and commercialized, numerous regulatory requirements apply after a device is placed on the market, regardless of its classification or pre &#8209;market pathway. These include, but are not limited to: 

&#183; 

establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; 

&#160;

&#183; 

QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, production, control, supplier and contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; 

&#183; 

labeling regulations that prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved, or &#8220;off &#8209;label,&#8221; uses, and impose other restrictions on labeling, advertising and promotion; 

&#183; 

medical Device Reporting, or MDR, regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; and 

&#183; 

corrections and removals reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health. In addition, the FDA may order a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death. 

Also, the FDA requires us to conduct post &#8209;market surveillance studies and to maintain a system for tracking our breast implants through the chain of distribution to the patient level. The FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Health Services enforce regulatory requirements by conducting periodic, unannounced inspections and market surveillance. Inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. 

Failure by us or our manufacturer to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement actions by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. These may include, but may not be limited to, any of the following sanctions or consequences: 

&#183; 

warning letters or untitled letters that require corrective action; 

&#183; 

fines and civil penalties; 

&#183; 

unanticipated expenditures; 

&#183; 

delays in or refusal to grant requests for 510(k) clearance or pre &#8209;market approval of new products or modified products; 

&#183; 

FDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries; 

&#183; 

suspension or withdrawal of FDA clearance or approval; 

&#183; 

product recall, detention or seizure; 

&#183; 

operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 

&#183; 

injunctions and consent decrees; and 

&#183; 

criminal prosecution. 

We and our contract manufacturers and some suppliers of components or device accessories also are required to manufacture our products in compliance with cGMP requirements set forth in the QSR. The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and it includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components or services, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing, and record keeping. The FDA evaluates compliance with the QSR through periodic, unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. If the FDA believes that we or any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers are not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down our manufacturing operations, require recall of our products, refuse 

&#160;

to approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees. 

Healthcare Regulatory Laws. Our business activities, including but not limited to, research, sales, marketing, promotion, distribution, medical education and other activities are subject to regulation under additional healthcare laws by numerous regulatory and enforcement authorities in the United States, in addition to the FDA. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti &#8209;kickback , false claims, physician sunshine , and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations, including but not limited to those described below. 

Additionally, our relationships with healthcare providers and other third parties are subject to scrutiny under these laws. Non &#8209;compliance with the laws described below may generally result in the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Defending against any actions for non &#8209;compliance of such laws can be costly, time &#8209; consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. 

Federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Law. The federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly or willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual or the purchase, or recommendation, order or furnishing of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The definition of &#8220;remuneration&#8221; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including such items as improper payments, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, waiver of payments and providing anything at less than its fair market value. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case &#8209;by &#8209;case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. 

The penalties for violating the federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute include imprisonment for up to five years, fines of up to $25,000 per violation and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation . In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act, or FCA. 

We have entered into consulting, speaker and other financial arrangements with physicians, including some who prescribe or recommend our products to patients. We engage such physicians as consultants, advisors and to educate other physicians. Noncompliance with the federal Anti &#8209;Kickback Statute could result in the penalties set forth above. 

Federal Civil False Claims Act. The FCA, prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons submitting claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, that are for services not provided as claimed, or for services that are not medically necessary. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA if they are deemed to &#8220;cause&#8221; the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off &#8209;label. Penalties for FCA violations include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal FCA is a civil statute, FCA violations may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. 

In addition to actions initiated by the government itself, the statute authorizes actions to be brought on behalf of the federal government by a private party having knowledge of the alleged fraud, known as &#8220;qui tam&#8221; whistleblower lawsuits. Because the complaint is initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before the defendant is even aware of the action. If the government intervenes and is ultimately successful in obtaining redress in the matter, or if the plaintiff succeeds in obtaining redress without the government&#8217;s involvement, then the plaintiff will receive a percentage of the recovery. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of 

&#160;

healthcare companies to have to defend a false claim action, pay fines or be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action. 

Federal Criminal False Claims Law s . The federal criminal false claims laws prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully making, or causing to be made, a false statement or representation of a material fact for use in determining the right to any benefit or payment under a federal health care program. A violation of these laws may constitute a felony or misdemeanor and may result in fines or imprisonment. 

Civil Monetary Penalties Law. The f ederal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary&#8217;s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. Noncompliance can result in civil money penalties of up to $10,000 for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the federal healthcare programs. 

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, augmented two federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from governmental programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment. 

HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, including the F inal HIPAA O mnibus R ule published on January 25, 2013, mandates, among other things, that certain types of entities and individuals adopts uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. Among other things, HITECH makes certain of HIPAA&#8217;s standards and requirements directly applicable to &#8220;business associates&#8221;&#8212;independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney&#8217;s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties. 

Physician Payments Sunshine Act. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, PPACA, imposed, among other things, new annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program, for certain payments and &#8220;transfers of value&#8221; provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately, and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for &#8220;knowing failures , &#8221; for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately, and completely reported in an annual submission. We are required to report detailed payment data and submit legal attestation to the accuracy of such data by March 31st of each calendar year . 

In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and other transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities. Similar to the federal law, certain states also have adopted marketing and/or transparency laws relevant to device manufacturers, some of which are broader in scope. Certain states, such as California and Connecticut, also mandate that device manufacturers implement compliance programs. Other states, such as Massachusetts and Vermont, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities. The need to build 

&#160;

and maintain a robust compliance program with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements, resulting in fines and penalties 

Additional State Healthcare Laws. Many states have also adopted some form of each of the aforementioned laws, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor. Nevertheless, a determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions. 

Additionally, as some of these laws are still evolving, we lack definitive guidance as to the application of certain key aspects of these laws as they relate to our arrangements with providers with respect to patient training. We cannot predict the final form that these regulations will take or the effect that the final regulations will have on us. As a result, our provider and training arrangements may ultimately be found to be not in compliance with applicable laws. 

United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits United States corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making corrupt payments, gifts or transfers to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA would include interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. 

International Regulation. We may evaluate international expansion opportunities in the future. International sales of medical devices are subject to local government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval in another country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, and the requirements may differ. There is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the European Union, United States, Canada and various other industrialized countries. 

The primary regulatory body in Europe is that of the European Union, which includes most of the major countries in Europe. Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices. The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout Europe. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self &#8209;assessment by the manufacturer and a third party assessment by a &#8220;Notified Body.&#8221; This third &#8209;party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer&#8217;s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer&#8217;s product. An assessment by a Notified Body of one country within the European Union is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the European Union. Additional local requirements may apply on a country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis. Outside of the European Union, regulatory approval would need to be sought on a country &#8209;by &#8209;country basis in order for us to market our products. 

Coverage and Reimbursement. Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which the procedures using our products will be covered by third &#8209;party payors, such as government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. Breast augmentation procedures are generally performed on a cash &#8209;pay basis and are not covered by third &#8209;party payors. In contrast, breast reconstruction procedures may be covered by third &#8209;party payors, but such third &#8209;party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost &#8209;containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. &#160; Adoption of price controls and cost &#8209;containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net sales and results. 

Moreover, t he process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product or procedure may be separate from the process for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product or procedure . A payor&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a product or procedure does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor&#8217;s determination to provide coverage for a product or procedure does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product or procedure . Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to ensure profitability . 

&#160;

Health Reform. The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our business. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. 

By way of example, in the United States, the recent implementation of PPACA is an example that has the potential to substantially change healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. The PPACA imposed, among other things, a new federal excise tax of 2.3% on certain entities that manufacture or import medical devices for sale in the United States and implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. &#160; The medical device excise tax has been suspended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, or the CAA, with respect to medical device sales during calendar years 2016 and 2017. Absent further Congressional action, this excise tax will be reinstated for medical device sales beginning January 1, 2018. The CAA also temporarily delays implementation of other taxes intended to help fund PPACA programs. The full impact of the PPACA on our business remains unclear. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments in the future. 

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation&#8217;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, and will stay in effect through 2025 unless Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals. 

We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure. 

Intellectual Property 

Our intellectual property portfolio consists primarily of trademarks and trade secrets and does not presently consist of any patents or patent applications. We do not currently intend to file any patent applications in the United States or elsewhere. 

Our trademark portfolio consists of five registered U.S. trademarks and six pending Canadian trademark applications. We maintain a program to protect our marks and will institute legal action where necessary to prevent others from using and registering confusingly similar marks. 

In addition, to protect our trade secrets and other intellectual property rights, we have entered into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and confidential information and invention assignment agreements with employees, consultants and advisors. However, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful in any given case and third parties may still obtain this information or we may be unable to protect our rights. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 96 full &#8209;time employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced any work stoppage. We believe we have good relations with our employees. 

&#160;

Facilities 

Our headquarters located in Santa Barbara, California is approximately 20,000 square feet. The term of the lease for our headquarters expires in February 2020. We also lease warehouse space located in Santa Barbara, California, which is approximately 10, 000 square feet . The term of the lease for our warehouse expire s in January 2019 . 

Legal Proceedings 

On September 25, 2015, a lawsuit styled as a class action of our stockholders was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The lawsuit names us and certain of our officers as defendants and alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with allegedly false and misleading statements concerning o ur business, operations, and prospects. The plaintiff seeks damages and an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys&#8217; fees. On November 24, 2015, three stockholders (or groups of stockholders) filed motions to appoint lead plaint i ff(s) and to approve their selection on lead counsel. On December 10, 2015, the court entered an order appointing lead plaintiffs and approving their selection of lead counsel. On February 19, 2016, lead plaintiffs filed their consolidated amended complaint. 

&#160; 

On October 28, &#160; November 5, and November 19, 2015, three la wsuits styled as class actions of our stockholders were filed in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Mateo. The lawsuits name us , certain of our officers and directors, and the underwriters associated with our follow-on public offering that closed on September 23, 2015 as defendants. The lawsuits allege violations of Sections 11, 12(a)(2), and 15 of the Securities Act in connection with allegedly false and misleading statements in o ur offering documents associated with the follow-on offering concerning o ur business, operations, and prospects. The plaintiffs seek damages and an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys&#8217; fees. &#160; On December 4, 2015, defendants removed all three lawsuits to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. On December 15 and December 16, 2015, plaintiffs filed motions to remand the lawsuits back to San Mateo Superior Court , or Motions to Remand. On January 19, 2016, defendants filed their opposition to the Motions to Remand, and plaintiffs filed their reply in support of the Motions to Remand on January 26, 2016. 

&#160; 

It is possible that additional suits will be filed, or allegations made by stockholders, with respect to these same or other matters and also naming us and/or our officers and directors as defendants. We believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously. Due to the early stage of these proceedings, &#160; we are not able to predict or reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome or possible losses relating to these claims. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

We expect that, in the future, our net sales will fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to a variety of factors, including seasonality of breast augmentation procedures. We believe that breast implant sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation due to breast augmentation patients&#8217; planning their surgery leading up to the summer season and in the period around the winter holiday season.
