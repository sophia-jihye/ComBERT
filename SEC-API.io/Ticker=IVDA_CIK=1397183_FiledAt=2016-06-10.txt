 ITEM 1 &#8211; BUSINESS 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

We developed Sentir&#174;, a video surveillance management platform with big data storage technology for flexible and scalable distribution of hosted video surveillance services to end users. Sentir has an enterprise-class video hosting architecture, utilizing robust data centers. Sentir is ideal for service providers such as telecommunications companies, Internet service providers (&#8220;ISPs&#8221;), data centers, and cable companies with an existing physical infrastructure that are looking to add video surveillance services to their customer offerings. Sentir allows scalability, flexibility, and centralized video management, access, and storage. The advantage this platform offers end users is that there is no need to buy and maintain video surveillance software and hardware. This platform enables real-time viewing and recorded playback of video on computers and mobile devices with push notifications and alerts. Our expertise allows us to enable large service providers to offer cloud-based plug-and-play video surveillance using our Sentir platform. 

&#160; 

Historically, we sold and installed video surveillance equipment, primarily for security purposes and secondarily for operational efficiencies and marketing. We also provided video hosting, in-vehicle streaming video, archiving, and real-time remote surveillance services to a variety of businesses and organizations. Our principal sources of revenue were derived from monthly fees from video hosting and real-time surveillance services and one-time fees for equipment sales and installation. 

&#160; 

In 2014, we shifted our revenue model from direct project-based sales to licensing Sentir and selling Sentir-enabled plug-and-play cloud cameras to service providers such as telecommunications companies, ISPs, data centers, and cable companies already providing services to an existing customer base. Partnering with service providers that have an existing loyal subscriber base allows us to focus on our customers, the service providers, and leverage their end-user infrastructure to sell, bill, and provide customer service for the Sentir cloud video surveillance offering. This business model provides dual revenue streams &#8211; one from camera sales to the service providers and the other from monthly Sentir licensing fees on a per-camera activation basis. 

&#160; 

In April, 2011, we completed our acquisition of MEGAsys&#174;, a company founded in 1998 by a group of sales and research and development professionals from Taiwan Panasonic Company. MEGAsys, our subsidiary in Taiwan, specializes in deploying new, and integrating existing, video surveillance systems for airports, commercial buildings, government customers, data centers, shopping centers, hotels, banks, and Safe City initiatives in Taiwan and other neighboring countries. MEGAsys combines security surveillance products, software, and services to provide integrated security solutions to the end user. Through MEGAsys, we have access not only to Asian markets but also to Asian manufacturers and engineering expertise. MEGAsys is our research and development arm, working with a team of developers and managing our relationship with the Industrial Technology Research Institute (&#8220;ITRI&#8221;) in Taiwan. MEGAsys also houses the application engineering team that supports Sentir implementation for our service provider customers in Asia. The acquisition of MEGAsys provided the following benefits to our business: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; An established presence and credibility in Asia and access to the Asian market. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Relationships in Asia for cost-effective research and development of new product offerings and securing the best pricing for end user devices. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Sourcing of products directly using MEGAsys&#8217;s product sourcing expertise to enhance our custom integration capabilities. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Enhancements to the global distribution potential for our products and services. &#160; 

In April 2009, the Department of Homeland Security (&#8220;DHS&#8221;) approved us as a Qualified Anti-Terrorism Technology provider under a formal SAFETY Act Designation. The designation gives us, our partners, and our customers certain liability protection. We became the first company to offer real-time Internet Protocol (&#8220;IP&#8221;) video hosting and remote surveillance services with a SAFETY Act Designation. Our SAFETY Act Designation was renewed in October 2014. In January 2016, after thoroughly reviewing the analysis of the DHS Office of SAFETY Act, the Deputy Under Secretary of Science and Technology determined that our technology satisfies the criteria set forth in Section 442(d)(s) of the SAFETY Act and in Section 25.8(a) of the regulations promulgated pursuant to the SAFETY Act and officially issued a Certification. A Certificate of Conformance of Technology was issued and our video surveillance products and services were placed on &#8220;Approved Products List for Homeland Security.&#8221; 

&#160; 

In November 2012, we signed a cooperation agreement with ITRI, a research and development organization based in Taiwan. Together with ITRI, we have developed cloud-video services. Pursuant to the cooperation agreement, we received the right to license some of ITRI&#8217;s patents that were used in the development. We also have exclusive rights to license the products and services we develop in cooperation with ITRI. 

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

In June and August 2014, in collaboration with our local partner in the Philippines, we shipped our ZEE &#174; cloud plug-and-play cameras for delivery to the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (&#8220;PLDT&#8221;) for distribution to its customers with a cloud video surveillance service offering, utilizing our Sentir platform. 

&#160; 

In December 2014, we entered into a Framework Agreement with Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group (VNPT), the largest telecommunications company in Vietnam to install Sentir at its data centers and conduct technical testing for mass distribution of our ZEE cameras to its existing customer base. In June 2015, Sentir was installed at four of VNPT&#8217;s data centers. After technical testing, in July 2015, VNPT issued a thorough report validating Sentir. 

&#160; 

In November 2015, we signed an agreement with Nguyen Business &#38; Investment Co., Ltd. as our exclusive reseller in Vietnam. Since then, they formed Iveda Vietnam Co., Ltd. to be the operating entity to license the Sentir platform and resell Sentir-enabled devices (e.g., ZEE, IvedaHome). 

&#160; 

Market Overview 

&#160; 

According to a report titled &#8220;IP Video Surveillance and VSaaS Market (Technologies, Applications, Services, Geography) &#8211; Industry Analysis, Trends, Share, Opportunities and Forecast, 2012 &#8211; 2020,&#8221; published by Allied Market Research in January 2014 (the &#8220;Report&#8221;), the global IP Video Surveillance and Video Surveillance as a Service (&#8220;VSaaS&#8221;) market is expected to reach $57.3 billion by 2020. The global IP Video Surveillance and VSaaS market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (&#8220;CAGR&#8221;) of 37.3% during the period from 2012 to 2020. North America is expected to achieve the highest share in the IP Surveillance market by 2020, while the Asia Pacific region is expected to experience CAGR of 44.3% during the period from 2013 to 2020, the highest growth rate of any region. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

According to the Report, the VSaaS market&#8217;s projected growth is attributable to the increasing adoption of advanced surveillance systems by national and local governments and the increased maintenance costs associated with existing surveillance systems. These major driving forces are contributing to the adoption of newer, more cost-effective IP surveillance systems. Traditional surveillance systems lack the flexibility and scalability of more advanced IP surveillance systems. Moreover, as end users&#8217; reliance on video increases, the limited capacity of traditional digital video recorders (&#8220;DVRs&#8221;) will become apparent and will reduce the effectiveness of more traditional surveillance systems. 

&#160; 

The Report named Axis Communication AB, D-Link, Genetec, GeoVision Inc., Panasonic Corporation, Arecont Vision, Mobotix AG, Milestone System, March Network, and Avigilon Corporation, among others, as key players in the IP surveillance system industry. Those companies either manufacture IP cameras or are network video recorder (&#8220;NVR&#8221;) software providers. None of those companies are true VSaaS providers. Although the NVR software that many of those companies offer may be cloud-enabled, the software is more suitable for use in private clouds rather than for mass deployment of cloud video surveillance. Scalability and flexibility are two important characteristics of VSaaS, which none of today&#8217;s NVR solutions can achieve. Similarly, the cameras produced by those companies are IP network cameras and simply allow for integration into cloud-based technologies. 

&#160; 

Our strategy to license Sentir globally to telecommunications companies, ISPs, data centers, and cable companies presents an opportunity for growth through partnerships with these organizations that have substantial existing subscriber bases. Given the success of smartphones and tablets with many Internet-based applications, telecommunications companies, in particular, are looking to expand the services offered to their customers. We believe that our cloud video surveillance service complements their existing products and can easily be bundled to create new service offerings. We have already begun to execute on this strategy, as we partner with several telecommunications companies that have subscriber bases of millions of users. Based on our active engagements with several telecommunications companies around the world, we believe that market adoption of VSaaS will grow significantly.

&#160; 

Technology 

&#160; 

We invested $264,768 and $304,121 in research and development in 2015 and 2014, respectively, which we used to develop our Sentir cloud video surveillance platform and the integration of our ZEE cloud plug-and-play cameras. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs related to internally developed software are expensed as research and development expense until technological feasibility has been achieved, after which the costs are capitalized. 

&#160; 

Sentir - Cloud Video Surveillance Platform 

&#160; 

Sentir is a video management platform with proprietary video streaming and storage technology. It offers the video surveillance functionality of traditional security industry DVR and NVR, all delivered from the cloud as an application. The Sentir platform enables real-time viewing and playback of recorded video on computers and mobile devices with push notifications and alerts. Most of Sentir&#8217;s applications run from a Web browser without a software installation or download. Sentir eliminates infrastructure management, maintenance, and support because every aspect of the IP video system is managed by the service provider, including video applications, runtime, middleware, operating system, virtualization, servers, storage, and networking. Sentir provides video surveillance without additional hardware-cameras, power, and an Internet connection are all the user needs. 

&#160; 

The Sentir platform includes surveillance software, cloud management software, servers, storage, and networking protocols. Sentir is a well-integrated and highly optimized solution for large scale video surveillance hosting. Although our service providers employ the highest industry standards of network and data security, Sentir can be used as a private video hosting cloud platform for customers who do not want to put sensitive surveillance data on their service provider&#8217;s cloud. Sentir can also be deployed to data centers for running large scale video hosting services. It is an all-in-one &#8220;cloud video platform&#8221; featuring big data storage, high availability, high performance, and scalability. 

&#160; 

Sentir Utilizes Distributed Storage System 

&#160; 

Online Replication 

&#160; 

Sentir&#8217;s storage system can be configured to replication mode, which replicates files across storage servers, achieving high availability of files in the storage system. Accessing files is load balanced to multiple storage servers. This allows users to access files on demand as long as one storage server is available. This online replication is an active-active model, where every server is serving requests at the same time, compared with active-passive models where data is backed up to a slave server in the background and only the master server is serving requests. The active-active model is superior because it fully utilizes the computation of all storage servers, resulting in better performance. 

&#160; 

Scale-Out Storage 

&#160; 

The scalability of traditional storage systems has limitations. As one&#8217;s business grows, the storage capacity may prove insufficient and require expansion. In traditional storage systems, performance can be improved by replacing the controller. However, the storage system needs to be shut down to make the replacement. Additionally, the capability of the controller is limited by the performance of its CPU. With scale-out storage, performance can be increased by simply adding more storage servers to the system. More storage servers in the system yield better performance. Our distributed, scale-out storage system allows customers to add more capacity without interruption. Every new storage server contributes its computing power as well as adds capacity to the system. Our scale-out storage also provides flexibility to users. Because our scale-out storage system is flexible, customers do not need to decide how many servers they need to accommodate future data storage requirements. Our storage system allows on-line expansion, meaning that customers can expand storage capacity as needed, minimizing capital expenditures. 

&#160; 

Thin-provisioning 

&#160; 

Typically, systems administrators add capacity ahead of demand to ensure applications will not crash. Oftentimes, the excess storage cannot be used by other applications, wasting space. With thin-provisioning technology, a storage administrator creates the typical logical volume to an application, but the storage system allocates physical capacity to the volume only when it is required. This means administrators can create large storage volume for applications without actually installing the physical hard drives during initial system set up. 

&#160; 

Server Virtualization Environment 

&#160; 

We provide video surveillance solutions to meet various customer needs. Each solution has different infrastructure requirements. The Sentir Rack is designed to fit customized requirements by providing a server virtualization environment. Sentir can be configured for both Linux and Windows virtual machines. The virtual machines Sentir provides are highly optimized for our video surveillance solutions. Several hardware-assisted virtualization technologies are integrated for acceleration, including Intel virtualization technology (Intel VT-x, Intel VT-d) for CPU acceleration and Single-Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) for network interface acceleration. In addition, Sentir provides well-integrated virtual machine images that can be used to create surveillance-ready virtual machines. With this feature, scaling the video surveillance system is simple.

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Cloud Video Surveillance as a Service 

&#160; 

Several companies offer software for cloud video surveillance implementation, ideal for campus-based deployments, but the software itself is not cloud-based for mass-scale deployments. Our legacy services use off-the-shelf NVRs and are being hosted at a data center and delivered to our customers from our cloud. Its limitations compelled us to develop and offer our own proprietary cloud platform, Sentir, for scalability, flexibility, and on-demand service offerings ideal for mass-scale deployment of cloud video surveillance services. 

&#160; 

Our products, services, and platform pass all the accepted standards of cloud computing. With defined characteristics, such as commercial accessibility over the Web, centralized software management, and a &#8220;one-to-many&#8221; delivery model, end users no longer need to be responsible for software upgrades and patches and API availability for integration. End users can receive feature and function upgrades over the cloud without always needing to purchase a new camera. 

&#160; 

Through a monthly subscription, end users are provided with a license to use Sentir applications on a per-device basis. Sentir&#8217;s integrated cloud storage management system with built-in software-defined storage technology makes it adaptable to big data and helps set it apart from others in the industry. 

&#160; 

Our business model focuses on achieving market share by mass distribution through organizations with existing, loyal customer bases already paying a monthly fee for services. Given the success of smartphones and tablets with many Internet-based applications, telecommunications companies, in particular, are looking to expand the services offered to their customers. We believe that our cloud video surveillance service complements their existing products and can easily be bundled to create new service offerings. Based on our active engagements with several telecommunications companies around the world, we believe that market adoption of VSaaS will grow significantly. 

&#160; 

The Iveda Difference 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; We have over ten years of cloud video surveillance experience. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; We have provided cloud video surveillance technology to customers, including small businesses, law enforcement, cities and municipalities, and other government entities in the United States, Mexico, and Asia. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; We have built and managed our enterprise-class cloud video infrastructure from the ground up. We designed our own cloud video platform architecture for optimal scalability, flexibility, security, and high availability. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; We offer our Sentir platform, which provides multiple cloud-enabled product offerings for a multitude of applications and industries, including in-vehicle streaming video, smartphone video streaming, and plug-and-play cameras. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; We have a SAFETY Act Designation by DHS as a Qualified Anti-Terrorism Technology provider since 2009 and received a Certification in January 2016. &#160; 

Devices Enabled for Sentir 

&#160; 

ZEE &#8211; Plug-and-Play Cloud Cameras 

&#160; 

Our ZEE cameras are enabled for Sentir, a cloud-managed video hosting platform. These inexpensive, plug-and-play cloud cameras are specifically designed with consumers and small businesses in mind. With Sentir, consumers and small businesses can eliminate the hours of network setup and upkeep of ZEE cameras in numerous locations. The solution provides an inexpensive and easy-to-install enterprise-level video surveillance solution for home, office, or business that can be accessed anywhere in the world using our online dashboard from virtually any Internet-enabled smartphone, tablet, or computer. Our ZEE camera line currently includes indoor, outdoor, fixed, and pan/tilt (&#8220;P/T&#8221;) cameras. We offer the Sentir platform with our ZEE cameras to our telecommunications company clients to bundle with their existing products and services. 

&#160; 

VEMO &#8211; In-Vehicle Streaming Video Surveillance System 

&#160; 

VEMO is an in-vehicle video surveillance system enabled for Sentir. Live video from vehicles is hosted in the cloud and centrally managed. High resolution video is recorded on a local hard drive up to two terabytes. Videos can be accessed from one dashboard, which includes VEMO GPS, enabling end users to track the current location of their vehicles. VEMO is a fully integrated, in-vehicle surveillance system that allows for streaming live to the cloud, utilizing the Sentir platform. VEMO is ideal for law enforcement, school buses, commercial transportation, and emergency response vehicles where visibility of ongoing events is crucial. 

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Pricing Strategy 

&#160; 

Our pricing strategy is simple: we charge our customers (service providers) a monthly Sentir licensing fee per camera, based on a certain volume commitment. The monthly fee includes initial installation of Sentir software, software maintenance, updates, and patches. Our service provider customers then account for our licensing fees and their data center costs when pricing the cloud video surveillance service or bundle. We price our ZEE cameras and other Sentir-enabled devices on a per-unit basis, subject to volume discounts. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

Historically, our U.S.-based segment sold cameras and cloud video surveillance services directly to end users and in some cases to security integrators on a per-project basis. Our customers included banks, storage facilities, homeowners associations, law enforcement, food processing plants, public pools and parks, and government agencies in the United States, Mexico, and Asia. 

&#160; 

In 2014, we shifted our focus from direct project-based sales to licensing Sentir to organizations already providing services to an existing customer base. We believe that partnering with service providers that have an existing loyal subscriber base will expedite the widespread adoption of our cloud video surveillance products and services. This business model provides dual revenue streams &#8211; one from camera sales to the service providers and the other from monthly Sentir licensing fees on a per-camera activation basis. 

&#160; 

MEGAsys continues to service its enterprise and government clients on a per-project basis. Some of its customers include Chunghwa Telecom, the Taiwan Stock Exchange, New Taipei City Police Department, and Taiwan Energy Systems. 

&#160; 

Historically, a significant portion of our revenue has come from a limited number of key customers. U.S.-based segment revenue from two customers represented approximately 66% of total U.S.-based segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, and U.S.-based segment accounts receivable from one customer represented approximately 62% of total U.S.-based segment accounts receivable at December 31, 2015. Taiwan-based segment revenue from two customers represented approximately 67% of total Taiwan-based segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, and Taiwan-based segment accounts receivable from three customers represented approximately 85% of total Taiwan-based segment accounts receivable at December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Our Sentir licensing business, in particular, is susceptible to concentration of revenue, given our licensing customers&#8217; large consumer bases of end users. The loss of a key service provider customer, the delay, reduction, or cancellation of a significant order, or difficulty collecting on our accounts receivable from our service provider customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

&#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Our business strategy consists of the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Licensing to Reseller/Service Providers for Distribution to Subscribers/End Users &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Actively engage with telecommunications companies in the United States, Mexico, Asia, and Africa for Sentir licensing. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Streamline the process of bringing in a new reseller/service provider to expedite going to market. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Create and document processes for every stage of engagement with a new service provider (i.e., business plan, implementation, installation, training, customer service, and billing). &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Marketing &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Provide marketing plan, including sample sales and marketing materials to service providers demonstrating the features and benefits of cloud video surveillance and the value of cloud-hosted video surveillance compared with traditional systems (e.g., powerpoint presentations, billing statement promos, data sheets, brochures, white papers, and case studies). &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Provide partnernet portal for service providers to access the latest versions of technical and marketing materials. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Enhance search engine optimization (SEO) of our website periodically. &#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Infrastructure/Security/R&#38;D &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Develop new products with technology partners in Asia to enhance and enable our video surveillance technology. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Incorporate another layer of security to our edge devices to further enhance the value of our products and services. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Continuously improve our Sentir platform. &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; International Business Development &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Solicit manufacturers to embed our Sentir firmware into their devices to place more Sentir-enabled devices into the marketplace. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Leverage MEGAsys&#8217;s existing relationships with software developers and manufacturers in Asia to produce higher quality cameras at reduced cost. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Partner with data centers worldwide to fulfill hosting services for service providers that either lack data centers or choose not to host Sentir on their data centers. &#160; 

Marketing Strategy 

&#160; 

Our marketing strategy has changed to coincide with our shift away from direct sales to end users and towards licensing relationships with service providers. In order to capitalize on our licensing model, we are now focusing on building our brands internationally and assisting our customers with their go-to-market plans by providing public relations activities, sample sales and marketing materials, and market intelligence and by supporting our partners in market launches. We rely on our in-house team of marketing and graphic design professionals to help us produce both print and digital multimedia sales and marketing materials. 

&#160; 

We continue to build our already established brand within the security industry. Our Chief Executive Officer has spoken at security industry events and has been interviewed by many local publications, trade publications, and talk shows to provide expert insight and analysis into security and cloud video surveillance. We also work with our partners and customers for joint news releases and case studies. We will continue our internal PR activities, including following editorial calendars of various trade and vertical publications, seeking speaking engagements for our CEO, and publishing industry articles. We also participate in investor relations conferences and non-deal road shows to increase our communication and brand awareness in the investment community. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We regard certain aspects of our internal operations, products, and documentation as proprietary and rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, software security measures, license agreements, and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary information. We do not currently hold any patents, but we have certain exclusive rights to relevant patents. 

&#160; 

We cannot guarantee that our protections will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our system. Nonetheless, we intend to vigorously defend our proprietary technologies, trademarks, and trade secrets. We have required and will continue to require existing and future members of management, employees, and consultants to sign non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements for work performed on our behalf. 

&#160; 

Although we have not historically sought any patent protection, we intend to secure appropriate national and international trademark protections with the intention of prosecuting any infringements. To date, we have solely relied on trade secrets, software security measures, and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary information. We own registered trademarks for Iveda Solutions and its logo, Iveda and its logo, Sentir, ZEE, VEMO, IvedaXpress, IvedaEnterprise, IvedaMobile, IvedaXchange, IvedaOnBoard, IvedaPinPoint, IvedaSentry, and SafeCiti from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. 

&#160; 

In November 2012, we signed a cooperation agreement with ITRI, a research and development organization based in Taiwan. Together with ITRI, we have developed cloud-video technologies, including Sentir and IvedaMobile. Pursuant to the cooperation agreement, we received the right to license some of ITRI&#8217;s patents that were used in the development. We also have exclusive rights to license the products and services we develop in cooperation with ITRI. 

&#160; 

We do not believe that our proprietary rights infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. However, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us with respect to current or future technology or that any such assertion may not require us to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation. Furthermore, our proposed future products and services may not be proprietary and other companies may already be providing these products and services. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

The security and surveillance industry and consumer data privacy are subject to government regulation. Future changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate, which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations. In addition, failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of any required operating permits and licenses. If laws and regulations change or we fail to comply in the future, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 

&#160; 

In April 2009, DHS approved us as a Qualified Anti-Terrorism Technology provider under a formal SAFETY Act Designation. Our SAFETY Act Designation was renewed in October 2014. In January 2016, our Designation was elevated to Certification. Any amendments or interpretive guidance related to the SAFETY Act may affect our ability to retain our SAFETY Act Certification and may increase the costs of compliance. Because we view our SAFETY Act Certification as a differentiating factor among our industry peers, if laws and regulations change relating to the SAFETY Act or if we fail to comply with the SAFETY Act in the future, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 13 full-time employees in the United States and 19 full-time employees in Taiwan. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly qualified security, sales, marketing, technical, and management personnel. From time to time, we employ independent consultants or contractors to support our development, marketing, sales and support, and administrative needs. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit. 

&#160; 

Insurance 

&#160; 

We maintain insurance, including comprehensive general liability coverage, key man, and directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; coverage in amounts and with types of coverage that we believe are customary in our industry. Special coverage is sometimes added in response to unique customer requirements. We also maintain compliance with applicable state workers&#8217; compensation laws. A certificate of insurance, which meets individual contract specifications, is made available to every customer. 

&#160; 

Our History 

&#160; 

We were incorporated in Nevada in June 2006 under the name Charmed Homes, Inc. and engaged in the construction and marketing of custom homes in Alberta, Canada. As a result of the unfavorable housing market and a lack of available funding, we ceased operations in 2008. On October 15, 2009, we completed a reverse merger with IntelaSight, Inc. doing business as Iveda Solutions, a Washington corporation (&#8220;IntelaSight&#8221;), pursuant to which IntelaSight became a wholly owned subsidiary of our company. Thereafter, we changed our name to Iveda Corporation. After the reverse merger, all of our operations were conducted under IntelaSight until December 31, 2010, at which time IntelaSight merged with and into our company, with our company surviving. At that time, we changed our name to Iveda Solutions, Inc. On April 30, 2011, we completed our acquisition of MEGAsys, which was incorporated in the Republic of China (Taiwan) on July 5, 1999. 

&#160; 

Our common stock is traded on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol &#8220;IVDA.&#8221;
