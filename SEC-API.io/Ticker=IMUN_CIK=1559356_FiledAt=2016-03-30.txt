Company Overview 

&#160; 

Immune Therapeutics, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was initially incorporated in Florida on December 2, 1993 as Resort Clubs International, Inc. (&#8220;Resort Clubs&#8221;). It was formed to manage and market golf course properties in resort markets throughout the United States. Galliano International Ltd. (&#8220;Galliano&#8221;) was incorporated in Delaware on May 27, 1998 and began trading in November 1999 through the filing of a 15C-211. On November 10, 2004, Galliano merged with Resort Clubs. Resort Clubs was the surviving corporation. On August 23, 2010, Resort Clubs changed its name to pH Environmental Inc. (&#8220;pH Environmental&#8221;). 

&#160; 

On April 23, 2012, pH Environmental completed a name change to TNI BioTech, Inc., and on April 24, 2012, we executed a share exchange agreement for the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of TNI BioTech IP, Inc. On September 4, 2014, a majority of our shareholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, to change our name to Immune Therapeutics, Inc. We filed our name change amendment with the Secretary of State of Florida on October 27, 2014 changing our name to Immune Therapeutics, Inc. 

&#160; 

The Company currently operates out of Orlando, Florida. In July 2012, the Company&#8217;s focus turned to acquiring patents that would protect and advance the development of new uses of opioid-related immune- therapies, such as low dose naltrexone (&#8220;LDN&#8221;) and Methionine [Met5]-enkephalin (&#8220;MENK&#8221;). The Company&#8217;s therapies are believed to stimulate and/or regulate the immune system in such a way that they provide the potential to treat a variety of diseases. We believe our therapies may be able to correct abnormalities or deficiencies in the immune system in diseases such as HIV infection, autoimmune disease, immune disorders, or cancer; all of which can lead to disease progression and life-threatening situations when the immune system is not functioning optimally. 

&#160; 

In October 2012, the Company formed TNI BioTech International, Ltd., a BVI company in Tortola, British Virgin Islands, which was set up to allow the Company to market and sell LDN in those countries outside the U.S. in which we have been able to obtain approval to sell the Company&#8217;s products. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

In August 2013, the Company formed its United Kingdom subsidiary, TNI BioTech, LTD (the &#8220;UK Subsidiary&#8221;). The UK Subsidiary received approval to be considered a micro, small or medium-sized enterprise (&#8220;SME&#8221;) with the European Medicines Agency (&#8220;EMA&#8221;) on August 21, 2013. The designation provides the UK Subsidiary with significant discounts when holding meetings or submitting filings to the EMA. On September 19, 2013, the UK Subsidiary submitted a pre-submission package to the EMA regarding Crohn&#8217;s Disease. The EMA granted the UK Subsidiary a meeting that took place on September 27, 2013. The UK Subsidiary is eligible to benefit from the provisions for administrative and financial assistance for SMEs set out in Regulation (EC) No 2049/2005. The Company will apply to obtain EMA benefits once funding becomes available. 

&#160; 

In December 2013, the Company formed a new subsidiary, Cytocom Inc., to focus on conducting LDN and MENK clinical trials in the United States. In December 2014, the Company finalized the distribution of common stock of Cytocom Inc. to its shareholders. As part of the transaction, the Company retained exclusive rights to all international patents, in-country approvals, formulations, trademarks, manufacturing, marketing, sales, and distributions rights in emerging nations, including Africa, Central America, South America, Russia, India, China, Far East, and The Commonwealth of Independent States (former Soviet Union). The Company will continue to have access to existing clinical data as well as any new data generated by Cytocom Inc. during drug development. On December 8, 2014, the number of Cytocom Inc. shares of common stock that were issued to our shareholders totaled 113,242,522 shares. In connection with the transaction, Cytocom Inc. issued 140,100,000 shares of its common stock to the Company, which gave the Company a 55.3% stake in Cytocom Inc. on that date. The stake has since been reduced to 50.2% at December 31, 2015, by subsequent issuances of Cytocom common stock to shareholders. 

&#160; 

In March 2014, the Company incorporated Airmed Biopharma Limited, an Irish corporation with an address in Dublin, Ireland, and Airmed Holdings Limited, an Irish company domiciled in Bermuda. The Irish companies were set up to benefit from incentives granted by the Irish government for the establishment of pharmaceutical companies (many of the world&#8217;s leading pharmaceutical companies have located in Ireland), and so that the Company could take advantage of Ireland&#8217;s status as a member of the European Union and the European Economic Area. An Irish limited liability company enjoys a low corporate income tax rate of 12.5%, one of the lowest in the world. The Irish-domiciled company hopes to qualify for tax incentives for Irish holding/headquartered companies and to benefit from the network of double tax treaties that reduce withholding taxes. TNI BioTech International, Ltd. will manage our international distribution, using product that is manufactured in Ireland and elsewhere. 

&#160; 

We are focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutic treatments for cancer, HIV/AIDS and autoimmune diseases and immune disorders by combating these severe and fatal diseases through the stimulation and/or regulation of the body&#8217;s immune system. Our growth strategy includes the near-term commercialization of our existing immunotherapies targeting cancer, Crohn&#8217;s disease and/or HIV/AIDS. 

&#160; 

Product Development 

&#160; 

The drugs currently being developed by the Company include: (i) MENK, which is a small synthetic pentapeptide that is naturally produced in the body. Exogenous MENK is being manufactured and developed under the name &#8220;IRT-101&#8221;; and (ii) naltrexone, a small molecular weight chemical entity that is being developed in low doses under the name &#8220;IRT-103.&#8221; Both IRT-101 and IRT-103 bind specifically to opioid receptors which are found not only in the central nervous system but also on other cells including immune-mediating cells, cancerous cells and epithelial cells (including those in the gastrointestinal tract) where they play a role in regulation of inflammation, growth, and mucosal repair. Opioid receptors have been associated with most types of immune cells and chemokine receptors, where their interaction involves changes in cell proliferation, alteration of functions, and release of inflammatory cytokines. 

&#160; 

The Company seeks to benefit patients with chronic and often life-threatening diseases through the stimulation and/or regulation of the body&#8217;s immune system. Using our patented immunotherapy, management believes that the Company&#8217;s products, technologies and patents will harness the power of the immune system to improve the treatment of cancer, HIV/AIDS, autoimmune diseases and disorders such as Crohn&#8217;s disease. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

MENK 

&#160; 

MENK is a potent endogenous opioid peptide that influences DNA synthesis and cell growth. MENK interacts with the opioid growth factor receptor (OGFr) which has been shown in nonclinical studies to delay the cell cycle by modulating cyclin-dependent inhibitory kinase pathways. The MENK-OGFr axis is an inhibitory pathway that plays a role in the onset and progression of autoimmune diseases, viral disease (such as HIV/AIDS) and cancer. Studies have shown that the modulation of the MENK-OGFr axis can be accomplished by the administration of exogenous MENK intravenously, or through other methods such as subcutaneous administration. By regulating this pathway with MENK, this can have a direct impact in maintaining human health and treatment of diseases. (Zagon IS, Donahue R, McLaughlin PJ. Targeting the opioid growth factor: opioid growth factor receptor axis for treatment of human ovarian cancer. Exp Biol Med (Maywood). 2013 May; 238(5):579-87. McLaughlin PJ , Zagon IS . The opioid growth factor-opioid growth factor receptor axis: homeostatic regulator of cell proliferation and its implications for health and disease ( Biochem Pharmacol. 2012 Sep 15; 84(6):746-55). 

&#160; 

Our first acquisition was the patents and intellectual property of Dr. Nicholas P. Plotnikoff and Professor Fengping Shan in 2012. While Dr. Plotnikoff was with Oral Roberts University, he was a member of the team that developed and patented the specific application of MENK as a treatment for cancer, HIV/AIDS, and infectious diseases. 

&#160; 

Dr. Nicholas Plotnikoff initiated and completed Phase I and Phase II clinical studies of MENK under Investigational New Drug (&#8220;IND&#8221;) protocols filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;). In these clinical trials, MENK has been shown to reduce the symptoms of early AIDS and AIDS Related Complex (&#8220;ARC&#8221;), a condition also known as pre-AIDS which includes symptoms such as fever, diarrhea, weight loss, swollen lymph nodes and herpes. In addition to the therapeutic effects of the treatments, trial reports indicated an elevation in mood of the patients treated (Bihari, B., Plotnikoff, N., Freeman, K., Dowling, J., Duguid, C., and Altmann, E., &#8217;&#8216;Methionine Enkephalin in the Treatment of ARC,&#8217;&#8217; Seventh Int. Conf. on AIDS, Florence, Italy, 1991). 

&#160; 

A double-blind, randomized controlled Phase II study of 46 patients was performed with ARC (Bihari B, Plotnikoff NP. Methionine Enkephalin in the Treatment of AIDS-Related Complex. CRC Press, LLC; Cytokines: Stress and Immunity . 1999; 77-91) that was designed to measure the effect of a regular weekly dosing schedule of MENK at two different dose levels. The study involved randomized assignment to three arms: (i) patients on the first arm received weekly doses of 60&#181;g/kg of MENK (low dose) for 12 weeks; (ii) patients on the second arm received a weekly infusion of 60&#181;g/kg of MENK (low dose) for 2 weeks, followed by 10 weekly doses of MENK at 125&#181;g/kg (high dose); and (iii) the patients on the third arm received a placebo intravenously for 12 weeks. 

&#160; 

The MENK treatment was generally well tolerated with no significant toxicity observed. The high dose of MENK significantly increased adaptive cell immunity resulting in increased activity of the body&#8217;s immune system (e.g. increased IL-2 receptors, CD56 NK and LAK cells, CD3, CD4 and CD8 cells) and a significant reduction in the size of lymph nodes. One patient in the high dose group administered by rapid intravenous infusion experienced dizziness, diaphoresis, elevated blood pressure and decreased pulse rate. These signs and symptoms were responded to with supportive measures. 

&#160; 

Recently, Professor Fengping Shan and Dr. Plotnikoff have published, in a number of peer-reviewed international journals, that MENK inhibited regulatory T-cells, increasing the functional activities of T cells and NK cells and, thus, is a key to improved cancer therapy. They additionally published results showing that MENK alone or in combination with Interleukin-2 (&#8220;IL -2&#8221;) or Interferon-undefined (&#8220;IFN-undefined&#8221;) can enhance the production of interferon- undefined or IL-2 from CD4+T cells, respectively (Shan F, Yanjie Xia, Ning Wang, Jingjuan Meng, Changlong Lu, Yiming Meng, Nicolas P. Plotnikoff. Functional modulation of the pathway between dendritic cells (DCs) and CD4+T cells by the neuropeptide: Methionine enkephalin (MENK). Peptides 32. 2011; 929&#8211;937). MENK also appeared to be more potent than IL -2 or IFN-undefined, alone (Hua H, Changlong Lu, Weiwei Li, Jingjuan Meng, Danan Wang, Nicolas Plotnikoff, Enhua Wang and Fengping Shan. Comparison of stimulating effect on subpopulations of lymphocytes in human peripheral blood by methionine enkephalin with IL-2 and IFN-undefined. Human Vaccines &#38; Immunotherapeutics 8:8, 2012; 1082-1089), two widely known cytokines that have been approved by the FDA for marketing. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Research results indicate that MENK, at suitable doses, boosts the immune system through the following possible mechanisms: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; increasing proliferation and functional activities of CD4+T-cells and CD8+T-cells which will play a role in anti-virus and anti-tumor activities; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; increasing maturation of dendritic cells which will initiate and intensify T-cell responses; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; increasing secretion of cytokines such as IL-2, TNF, IL-12 and IFN-undefined which will amplify the T-cell response and mediate interaction among immune cells, forming a modulated and balanced immunity; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; increasing functions of macrophages, resulting in enhanced cellular immunity through secreting a set of cytokines; and &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; increasing activity of NK cells which have the ability to kill cancer cells and virus-infected cells. &#160; 

A team from Penn State University (&#8220;PSU&#8221;), led by Dr. Ian Zagon as the senior basic scientist and Dr. Jill Smith as the senior physician scientist, have shown that in addition to the reported immunotherapy effects of MENK, they have discovered a novel opioid receptor that is highly expressed on cancer cells and on some normal tissue cells, which selectively bind MENK and thereby has been shown to induce direct inhibition of cancer cell growth in the laboratory or in immunodeficient nude mice, and they have decided to refer to MENK as an opioid growth factor (&#8220;OGF&#8221;). Therefore, MENK has been shown to have therapeutic activity by both immune stimulating effects (binding to OGF receptors (OGFr) on immune cells to increase immune function) and direct anti-cancer inhibitory effects (binding to OGFr on cancer cells to inhibit cell growth). 

&#160; 

Based upon published literature, the Company believes that, in oncology in particular, MENK has two possible mechanisms of actions: 

&#160; 

1. Immune stimulation and regulation effects; and 

&#160; 

2. Direct anti-cancer inhibitory effects. 

&#160; 

Based upon data from multiple in vivo and in vitro studies conducted by Zagon et al. over the past 15 years, the onset and/or progression of some cancers may be related to defects in MENK and/or OGFr, which would promote or exacerbate tumorigenesis. These findings show there may be an advantage in up-regulating the peptide (e.g., MENK administration) to enhance anti-cancer activity (Zagon IS, Donahue RN, McLaughlin PJ. Opioid growth factor-opioid growth factor receptor axis is a physiological determinant of cell proliferation in diverse human cancers. Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol. 2009; 297: R1154&#8211;R1161). Further exploration and clinical trials are needed to confirm MENK&#8217;s mechanism of action and its ability to stop the growth of cancerous cells in human subjects with advanced cancer; however, supportive literature around the possible mechanism of actions for MENK are provided below. 

&#160; 

MENK as an immune stimulator/regulator 

&#160; 

While Dr. Nicholas Plotnikoff was a faculty member at Oral Roberts University, he discovered that all three of the classical opioid receptors are expressed on most subsets of immune cells, and that either in vitro incubation with MENK or parenteral administration of and humans, especially those with immunodeficiencies associated with cancer or HIV/AIDS, MENK in vivo increased the number and functional activities of T cells, including cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and also natural killer (NK) cells (Plotnikoff NP, Faith RE, Murgo AJ, Herberman RB, Good RA. Methionine Enkephalin: A New Cytokine &#8211; Human Studies. Clinical Immunology and Immunopathology . February 1997; 82(2): 93-101). Following those pioneering studies, several other investigators observed that administration of MENK to mice increased CD4+ and CD+ T cells, and increased various immune functions, including cytotoxic activities of both T cells and NK cells ( Wybran J , Schanden&#233; L , Van Vooren JP , Vandermoten G , Latinne D , Sonnet J , De Bruy&#232;re M , Taelman H , Plotnikoff NP . Immunologic properties of methionine-enkephalin, and therapeutic implications in AIDS, ARC, and cancer. Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1987; 496:108-14). Recently, Drs. Fengping Shan and Nicholas Plotnikoff have reported that MENK treatment of mice stimulates the cytotoxic activities of T cells and NK cells and reduces levels of T regulatory cells, and augments therapeutic effects in tumor-bearing immunocompetent mice. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

MENK as an inhibitor of cancer cell growth 

&#160; 

MENK has been found to exert a profound inhibition on the initiation and progression of human pancreatic cancer in vitro and in vivo (Zagon IS, Smith JP, McLaughlin PJ. Opioid Growth Factor (OFG) Inhibits Human Pancreatic Cancer Transplanted into Nude Mice. Cancer Letters. 1997 Jan 30; 112(2):167-175. Zagon IS, Smith JP, Conter R, McLaughlin PJ. Identification and Characterization of Opioid Growth Factor Receptor in Human Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma. International J of Molecular Med. 2000 Jan; 5(1):77-84.). This led to the discovery that MENK interacted with a novel opioid receptor (OGFr) on human cancer cells (ovarian, SCCHN, pancreatic, colorectal and others) creating a competitive inhibition profile and subcellular location that is different from other well-known &#8220;classic&#8221; opioid receptors [mu (&#181;), delta (undefined) and kappa (undefined)]. The other &#8220;classic&#8221; opioid receptors have not been found to have any impact on cell growth; thus there is specificity in the MENK-OGFr interaction which regulates cell proliferation. In an extensive number of experiments that have been conducted on human pancreatic cancer cells in tissue culture exposed to a variety of opioid-related compounds, MENK was the only compound that inhibited cell proliferation. Based upon data from multiple in vivo and in vitro studies conducted by Zagon et al ., the onset and/or progression of some cancers may be related to defects in MENK and/or OGFr, which would promote or exacerbate tumorigenesis. These findings show there may be an advantage in up-regulating the peptide (e.g., MENK administration) to enhance anti-cancer activity. 

&#160; 

Therefore, as opioid receptors are not only found on cancer cells, but also on most subsets of immune cells, MENK has the ability to not only inhibit cancer cell growth, but also have a direct impact on the patient&#8217;s immune system by increasing the number and functional activities of T cells and NK cells. 

&#160; 

Zagon and McLaughlin have not recorded in any of their animal studies any side effects of MENK for non-oncological indications such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE, the mouse model of multiple sclerosis) or relapse-remitting EAE (RR-EAE) with MENK being administered daily. Treatment with MENK or LDN did not exacerbate EAE and was able to halt progression of disease, reverse neurological deficits, and prevent the onset of neurological dysfunction over time (Rahn KA, McLaughlin PJ , Zagon IS . Prevention and diminished expression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by low dose naltrexone (LDN) or opioid growth factor (OGF) for an extended period: Therapeutic implications for multiple sclerosis). 

&#160; 

LDN 

&#160; 

Management believes clinical trials involving LDN hold great promise for the millions of people worldwide with autoimmune diseases or disorders, central nervous system disorders or those who face cancer. Management also believes it could be the first low-cost, easy to administer therapy with minimal to no side-effects for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, autoimmune diseases and immune disorders, in particular Crohn&#8217;s disease, multiple sclerosis, and/or fibromyalgia. 

&#160; 

Naltrexone is an orally effective opioid receptor antagonist, used as a treatment for opiate addiction. Naltrexone was originally synthesized in 1963 and patented in 1967. In 1984, the FDA approved naltrexone in a 50 mg dose as a treatment for heroin addiction. Naltrexone 50 mg film-coated tablets have been approved in Europe since at least 1989 for the treatment of opiate addiction and more recently alcohol dependency. At lower doses (approximately 4.5 mg/day), it has been gaining popularity as a treatment for signs and symptoms of autoimmune diseases and immune disorders, HIV/AIDS and cancer. Research studies by others have indicated that the short-term blockage of opioid receptors on circulating and tissue cells by LDN was followed by a substantial rebound in opioid receptor expression and increased levels of undefined-endorphin and methionine-enkephalin (Zagon IS, McLaughlin PJ. Opioid antagonist modulation of murine neuroblastoma: A profile of cell proliferation and opioid peptides and receptors. Brain Res . 1989; 480:16&#8211;28.) 

&#160; 

Oral administration of LDN has been shown to transiently (approximately 4 hours) inhibit opioid receptors which in turn provides a remaining window of approximately 20 hours for the unregulated opioids and receptors to interact ( Donahue RN , McLaughlin PJ , Zagon IS . The opioid growth factor (OGF) and low dose naltrexone (LDN) suppress human ovarian cancer progression in mice. Gynecol Oncol. 2011 Aug; 122(2):382-8). 

&#160; 

LDN has been shown to increase the levels of endogenous opioid activity, thereby having the ability to play a direct role in enhancing the human body&#8217;s stress resilience, improving psychiatric problems such as autism, in addition to being able to have a direct impact on the immune system and regulation of how the immune system works when faced with disease. LDN is believed to facilitate the body&#8217;s own resources to slow down or combat cancers, autoimmune diseases and HIV/AIDS; thus reducing the overall impact and load on the body (Brown N, and Panksepp J. Low dose naltrexone for disease prevention and quality of life. Med Hypotheses . 2008 Mar: 72(3):293-6.). 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Naltrexone was originally patented in 1967 by the specialty pharmaceutical company Endo Health Solutions Inc. At the time, it seemed unlikely that naltrexone would be developed because the experimental drug had relatively low market potential, and naltrexone&#8217;s patent protection would likely expire before the completion of clinical trials. With the assistance of DuPont, a division of Merck &#38; Co. that acquired Endo in 1969, the US government&#8217;s National Institute on Drug Abuse (&#8220;NIDA&#8221;) advanced naltrexone through the FDA approval process, leading to approval for marketing as a treatment for heroin addiction in a 50 mg dose in 1984. Although its patent expired that same year, naltrexone gained seven additional years of marketing exclusivity for DuPont when the FDA designated it (trademarked as Trexan) an Orphan Drug. Marketing exclusivity provides a pharmaceutical company the right to sell its drug for a certain length of time free of competition from generic versions of the drug and is often granted to encourage companies to develop a use for a drug whose patent has expired or to encourage a company to develop an already approved drug for a new use. With market exclusivity, the anticipated returns on investment are higher, improving the profitability of a drug. With funding provided by the US National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (&#8220;NIAAA&#8221;) and the potential to gain three additional years of post-approval market exclusivity for naltrexone, DuPont advanced naltrexone through additional clinical trials, and gained FDA approval for a 50 mg dose (trademarked as ReVia) as a treatment for alcohol abuse in 1995. As naltrexone had already been on the market for 10 years as a treatment for heroin addiction, the FDA&#8217;s confidence in its safety resulted in approval only six months after naltrexone&#8217;s regulatory application was submitted. 

&#160; 

Naltrexone has a black box warning for liver toxicity, which was included based on liver enzyme elevations reported with daily dosing at 100 mg-300 mg. These doses were evaluated in clinical trials for obesity; however, they have not been approved for this use. Our review of the literature and adverse effect reports in naltrexone clinical trials did not demonstrate a risk for liver damage with daily dosing at 50 mg. Although the black box warning does remain, the FDA has stated that naltrexone does not appear to be a hepatotoxin at the recommended doses for the currently approved indications. Recently, naltrexone at 4 mg and 8 mg, in combination with the anti-depressant drug, bupropion at 90 mg, was evaluated as an anti-obesity drug by Orexigen Therapeutics Inc. and submitted for FDA approval in 2010. Data from studies with the drug combination (trademarked Contrave) showed potential hepatotoxicity in 1.2% of subjects treated with Contrave (n = 3,239). [Note: After the FDA requested a long-term study to demonstrate the daily recommended dose of the drug combination (two tablets each with 8 mg naltrexone plus 90 mg bupropion taken twice daily) does not raise the risk of heart attacks, Orexigen initiated a Phase III trial to evaluate Contrave in a study expected to enroll more than 9,000 subjects and is anticipated to be completed in 2017.] Other than its small potential association with liver toxicity at high doses, the most common adverse effects reported with naltrexone are non-specific gastrointestinal complaints such as diarrhea and abdominal cramping.

Significant published clinical trial evidence indicates that LDN, particularly daily dosing at 3mg - 4.5 mg, stimulates the immune system and is effective in the treatment of some immunodeficiency diseases, such as HIV/AIDS diseases, and advanced cancer as shown in the studies referenced herein. In addition, LDN has been used quite widely for treatment of a variety of autoimmune diseases and immune disorders. The first clinical trial results with LDN for immune disorders, however, were published only recently in a peer-reviewed medical journal in 2007 which evaluated LDN treatment in a pilot phase II study of 17 patients with Crohn&#8217;s disease, a form of inflammatory bowel disease that most commonly affects the ileum and the beginning of the colon. Two-Thirds of patients in this study went into remission after 4.5 mg daily LDN treatment (p &#60; 0.001), with 89% of patients overall showing some degree of response. 

&#160; 

An open-label pilot study was conducted by Pennsylvania State University with LDN to evaluate response, safety and toxicity in adult subjects with moderate to severe, active Crohn&#8217;s disease. Patients were treated with LDN orally each evening at a dose of 4.5 mg for 3 months. A total of 17 patients were enrolled, 16 of whom completed the study. No laboratory abnormalities were noted. The most common side effect was sleep disturbances (occurred when dosing at night, at about bed-time), occurring in seven patients (41%). 

&#160; 

A second clinical study was conducted by Pennsylvania State University as a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study to test the efficacy and safety of LDN for 12 weeks in adults with moderate to severe active Crohn&#8217;s disease. Forty subjects with moderate to severe active Crohn&#8217;s disease were enrolled in the study. Randomized patients received daily oral administration LDN (4.5 mg/day) or placebo. Fatigue was the only side effect reported of statistical significance, and it was greater in subjects receiving placebo. 

&#160; 

A pilot Phase II clinical trial was conducted by Pennsylvania State University in children with moderate to severe active Crohn&#8217;s disease. Fourteen subjects were enrolled, 12 subjects were randomized and treated with a mean age of 12.3 years (range 8-17 years). Children were randomized to placebo or LDN (0.1 mg/kg or a maximum dose of 4.5 mg) orally for 8 weeks followed by open-label treatment for an additional 8 weeks of LDN at the same dose of 0.1 mg/kg or 4.5 mg. Oral LDN was well tolerated without any serious adverse events.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Fourteen (14) subjects were enrolled, 12 subjects were randomized and treated (Smith J. et al ., 2007; Smith J. et al ., 2011; Smith J. et al ., 2013). 

&#160; 

Pennsylvania State University researchers have also demonstrated in a mouse model of Crohn&#8217;s disease (chemically induced colitis with dextran sodium sulfate) that opioid receptor blockade by LDN resulted in less weight loss, lower disease activity index scores and less histological evidence of inflammation when compared to controls. Furthermore, the researchers demonstrated that tissue inflammatory cytokine mRNA was reversed to baseline levels in the colons of mice treated with LDN. 

&#160; 

Management believes in LDN&#8217;s potential treatment effects for Crohn&#8217;s disease, as the treatments currently available for Crohn&#8217;s disease do not control the disease well and there are major side effects associated with virtually all of the currently used drugs. In addition, most of these drugs are very expensive. Management believes that LDN provides an attractive alternative. Three published clinical trials in patients with moderate to severe disease, two in adults and one in children, have shown significant disease and quality of life improvement by 12-weeks. LDN was able to reverse the inflammatory activity, promote mucosal healing, and significantly decrease histologic inflammation when compared to placebo-treated controls (Smith J. et al, 2011; Smith J. et al, 2013). Based on these results, the Company has placed a very high priority on implementing a Phase II dose response study. By using the 505(b)(2) pathway, confirmation of efficacy in our Phase III study is expected to result in approval by the FDA. 

&#160; 

With its increasing recognition in children and adolescents, Crohn&#8217;s disease has become one of the most significant chronic diseases that affect young people. Pediatric Crohn&#8217;s disease affects approximately 80,000 patients in the United States, and thus has led to orphan drug designation with the FDA. In addition to the common GI symptoms due to inflammation in the small and/or large intestine, children often experience growth failure, malnutrition, pubertal delay, bone demineralization, and psychological issues. Crohn&#8217;s tends to be both severe and extensive in the pediatric population with a relatively high proportion of pediatric Crohn&#8217;s patients having involvement of their small intestine, proximal to the ileum. 

&#160; 

The 505(b)(2) Regulatory Pathway 

&#160; 

Traditionally, pharmaceutical drugs had to be approved by the FDA under the standard 505(b)(1) regulatory pathway, which could take as long as 15 years. Now, drugs approved under 505(b)(2) may rely in part on data from existing reference drugs meaning they can be developed and achieve FDA approval in as little as 30 months with only a fraction of the number of required clinical trials and at a much lower cost. 

&#160; 

Developing LDN using the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway decreases the amount of development time and cost in order to obtain FDA approval. As naltrexone is an FDA-approved product for alcohol or opiate dependence, prescriptions are currently being filled for naltrexone in 50 mg doses by hundreds of local pharmacies and mail-order pharmacies around the United States. 

&#160; 

The FDA&#8217;s 505(b)(2) pathway for approving drugs opens the door for the Company to gain FDA approval of LDN (which is used at doses of approximately 1/10th the approved dose) for new diseases. A 505(b)(2) drug application for LDN will contain full reports of clinical investigations to support the safety and effectiveness in the new indication(s); however, at least some of the information required for approval will come from studies not conducted by or for the applicant, and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use, as many of these drugs are now off-patent. With the opportunity to use previous findings of safety, the Company intends to use the 505(b)(2) pathway to study and gain approval for LDN in other diseases, with Crohn&#8217;s disease slated as its first therapeutic indication. 

&#160; 

As there is a sufficient database of information around the safety of this product, and the reference listed drug (NDA 018932 REVIA) is being used, the FDA agreed that a 505(b)(2) application would be an acceptable approach at this time.

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

The Company has been developing active forms of immunotherapies through the acquisition of patents, IND Applications, clinical data and all proprietary technical information, know-how, procedures, protocols, methods, prototypes, designs, data and reports which are not readily available to others through public means, and which were owned, generated or developed through experiments or testing by Dr. Plotnikoff, Professor Shan, Dr. Bernard Bihari, Dr. Ian S. Zagon, Dr. Jill Smith, Dr. Patricia J. McLaughlin and Moshe Rogosnitzky. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s management believes that to be successful, it was imperative to not only acquire all of the intellectual property and patents but also the scientist(s) behind their development. To date, the Company has been able to acquire many of the patents and intellectual property it was seeking, and has also been able to team up with some of the leaders in the field of immunology, experts such as the late Dr. Ronald Herberman (1940-2013), Dr. Angus Dalgleish and Dr. Joseph Fortunak. 

&#160; 

Dr. Plotnikoff is the inventor behind a number of patents granted for cancer treatments and an adjunct to patents for autoimmune diseases including: European Patent United Kingdom, Germany, France, Ireland EP 1401471 BI Methods for inducing sustained immune response; Russian Patent Russian Federation patent number 2313364; The Patent Office of the People&#8217;s Republic of China, Application No.: 200810165784.8 China Patent CN1015113407 A The Patent Office of the People&#8217;s Republic of China ISSN: 1006-2858 CN 21-1349/R; Patent Agencies Government of India Patent, Application number 1627/KOLNP/2003 number 220265 an Enkephalin Peptide Composition; and the US Patent Pending, US Patent Application 10/146.999 e (the &#8220;Plotnikoff Patents&#8221;). The Patent Cooperation Treaty (&#8220;PCT&#8221;) enables a U.S. applicant to file a single application, known as &#8220;an international application,&#8221; in a standardized format in English in the U.S. Receiving Office (the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office) that is acknowledged as a regular national or regional filing in any state or region that is party to the PCT. 

&#160; 

The Company entered into a Sale of Technology Agreement with Dr. Nicholas P. Plotnikoff on March 4, 2012, wherein Dr. Plotnikoff agreed to transfer and assign all of his rights, title and interest in the Plotnikoff Patents to the Company. The Company received all the production formulations and technology designs from Dr. Plotnikoff necessary for the manufacturing, formulation, production and protocols of the MENK treatment of cancer and HIV/AIDS. As consideration for entering into the Sale of Technology Agreement, Dr. Plotnikoff received 8,000,000 shares of common stock, a royalty of a single-digit percentage on all sales of MENK and was granted the position of Non-Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors. 

&#160; 

In addition to the above patents, we also signed an exclusive licensing agreement for all of the intellectual property developed at Pennsylvania State University by Dr. Ian S. Zagon, Dr. Patricia J. McLaughlin and Dr. Jill P. Smith for the treatment of cancer. The patents cover methods and formulations related to the treatment and prevention of cancers. More specifically, the present inventions describe the use of drugs that interact with opioid receptors (naltrexone, naloxone and the pentapeptide MENK) to inhibit and arrest the growth of cancer. Such efficacy has been discovered to be partially due to the functional manipulation of the zeta opioid receptor through exogenous and endogenous MENK. This receptor has been determined to be present in a variety of cancers, including pancreatic, ovarian, liver, head and neck, and colon cancer. US Patent Numbers 6,737,397, CA 2,557,504, US 20010046968 , US 6737397 , US 6136780 , US 20080015211 , US 20070053838 , US 8003630 , US 20110123437 , US 7807368 , US 7576180 , US 7517649 , US 20080146512 , US 7122651 , US 20060073565 , US 20050191241 , Patent No 8,003,630. 

&#160; 

We also acquired the licensing rights to the patent portfolio and intellectual property developed by Dr. Bernard Bihari relating to treatments with drugs that interact with opioid receptors such as LDN and MENK for a variety of diseases and conditions including malignant lymphoma, chronic lymphocyctic leukemia, Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma, chronic herpes virus infections, and chronic infections due to the Epstein-Barr virus and a treatment method for humans infected with HTLV-III (AIDS) virus including patients clinically diagnosed as suffering from HIV/AIDS and those suffering from ARC. The licensed rights include all reissues or modifications, reexaminations, or other related U.S. patent filings directed to the same subject matter and the use of U.S. Patent Number 6,586,443 , U.S. Patent Number 6,384,044 , U.S. Patent Number 6,288,074 , U.S. Patent Number 5,356,900 , U.S. Patent Number 5,013,739 , U.S. Patent Number 4,888,346 . 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Once the Company acquired the above patents, it was then able to sign a licensing agreement to acquire the exclusive patent rights for the intellectual property of the licensors, Dr. Jill Smith and LDN Research Group, LLC, whose members include Dr. Ian S. Zagon, Dr. Patricia J. McLaughlin and Moshe Rogosnitzky. The patents cover methods and formulations for the treatment of the inflammatory and ulcerative diseases of the bowel, using naltrexone in low doses as an opioid antagonist. Endogenous opioids and opioid antagonists at low doses have been shown to play a role in stimulating and rebalancing the immune system and the healing and repair of tissues. US Patent No. 6,136,780, Patent No. US 7879870. The Company then negotiated with Dr. Jill Smith to arrange the transfer of the Orphan Drug Designation for the use of naltrexone for the treatment of pediatric Crohn&#8217;s disease with the FDA. Dr. Smith has since transferred the IND to the Company, and the FDA acknowledged that the Company is now the sponsor for this IND. In September 2014, the Company and the licensors jointly agreed to terminate the license agreement, and in place thereof, have the licensors grant a similar license in their patent rights to Cytocom Inc. pursuant to a Patent License Agreement between the licensors, Cytocom Inc. and the Company with substantially similar terms as set forth in the original license agreement. Pursuant to this agreement, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of its common stock to the licensors and the Company guaranteed the obligations of Cytocom Inc. to the licensors under the agreement. 

&#160; 

The Company originally acquired the patents and intellectual property from Dr. Smith and LDN Research Group, LLC because management believed clinical trials involving LDN held great promise for the millions of people worldwide with autoimmune diseases or disorders, central nervous system disorders or those who face cancer. Management also believed it could be the first low-cost, easy to administer therapy with minimal to no side-effects for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, autoimmune diseases and immune disorders, in particular Crohn&#8217;s disease, multiple sclerosis, and/or fibromyalgia. 

&#160; 

Dr. Nicholas Plotnikoff, Professor Fenping Shan and Noreen Griffin recently filed a Provisional Application for a Utility Patent US Application No. 62/296,759 Method for Inducing a Sustained Immune Response, which was assigned to the Company in March 2016. U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued the Official Filing Receipt in connection with this application, and accorded a filing date of February 18, 2016 during its pendency in the USPTO.

Immunotherapy 

&#160; 

Overview of Immunotherapy 

&#160; 

The role of the immune system in counteracting the development of cancer was initially supported by individual clinical case reports, when it was observed that cancer occurs more frequently in individuals with compromised immune systems. In groundbreaking work in the late 1800s, it was noted that some cancer patients suffering from bacterial infections had regression in their tumors. In trying to fight off the bacterial infection, the patients&#8217; immune systems had become highly activated, thus affording some resistance to the tumor. Since then there have been hundreds of clinical trials conducted to evaluate numerous candidates and decades of research by countless scientists. In April 2010, Provenge became the first cancer immunotherapy to acquire FDA approval. 

&#160; 

Immunotherapy History 

&#160; 

More than 100 years after researchers first explored the potential to harness the body&#8217;s immune system to fight cancer, many of the field&#8217;s leading doctors believe the concept will finally prove itself on a large scale within the next two years. A number of large companies now work on immunotherapy drugs for the treatment of cancer and, if proven successful, could gain a significant share of the global market for oncology drugs. IMS Health estimates the oncology drug market will reach $75 Billion by 2015 (The Global Use of Medicines: Outlook Through 2015, IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics (2011). Scores of new immunotherapy vaccines and other immune system modifiers are being tested against a variety of cancers. The new understanding of how immunotherapies work may demand a revised definition of clinical success. 

&#160; 

Antigen Presentation 

&#160; 

Antigen presentation is a process in the body&#8217;s immune system by which antigen-presenting cells (&#8220;APCs&#8221;), such as macrophages, B-lymphocytes, dendritic cells and other types of cells, process and present antigens on their surfaces to effector cells in the immune system and enable their recognition, inducing two major types of defense (i.e., adaptive and innate) against the target protein. The adaptive response is thought to be &#8220;specific&#8221; and is composed of highly specialized, systemic T and B cells and processes that eliminate or prevent disease, whereas the innate response is active spontaneously, is &#8220;non-specific,&#8221; and reacts against foreign cells immediately. There are several types of cells involved in the innate immune response, especially natural killer (&#8220;NK&#8221;) cells and dendritic cells which are present in tissues in contact with the external environment and have garnered the most research interest as antigen presenting cells. Tumor cells display a number of proteins on the cell surface that signal to the immune system that these cells are not normal, healthy cells. As a result, cancer patients often have specific anti-tumor antibodies and T-cells circulating in their blood, demonstrating that the immune system detected the tumor cells and mounted a specific response. 

&#160; 

In many cases, the immune system response fails due to strategies that tumor cells use to evade immune detection. These strategies range from methods designed to hide tumor cells, to active incapacitation of immune cells by tumor-produced agents that lower the immune system&#8217;s responses. Based on the types of antigens and method of their presentation used, the following immunotherapy strategies have been evaluated: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Active Immunotherapy by which drugs or vaccines stimulate the body&#8217;s own defenses to fight disease; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Adoptive Immunotherapy which uses immune system components (e.g., antibodies, cytokines, or immune cells) created outside the body and then administered to patients; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Non-Specific Immunotherapies which stimulate the body&#8217;s immune system in general ways, including activity against cancer cells or virus-infected cells. &#160; 

While extending life is the gold standard, most cancer drug trials have been deemed successful when tumors shrink or when a treatment can demonstrate a delay in tumor growth or in worsening of the disease, known as progression-free survival (&#8220;PFS&#8221;). New approaches based on more recent knowledge of the immune system include activating a variety of cells to go after tumors and modifying mechanisms that keep either the immune system in check or turn it loose. 

&#160; 

Immunotherapy presents a number of potential advantages over approved cancer treatments. The traditional tools for treating cancer have been around for years, including radiation, which has been used since the 1800s; surgery; and chemotherapy, which evolved from the original use of mustard gas after World War I. All of these treatments are based on destroying the cancer cells either by damaging their DNA, selective toxicity or removing them. All of these therapies have a high number of side effects. The goal of immunotherapy is to treat the disease by harnessing the immune system to eliminate or control chronic, life-threatening diseases avoiding the necessity for these traditional treatments. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The immune system is quite diverse and includes major biological functions: (1) immune defense, which works against infectious organisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites; (2) immune homeostasis which works to remove senescent cells and debris; and (3) immune surveillance to clear mutated cells or cancer cells. Researchers discovered that the principal cells in the immune system that attacked viruses and tumors were macrophages, dendritic cells, T-cells, NK cells, NKT cells and gamma/delta T-cells. These cells originate in bone marrow and perform functions in peripheral blood, skin, respiratory and intestinal tracts, and immune organs. The most important participant in the immune response is a class of white blood cells known as lymphocytes. These cells develop in the bone marrow and are released into general circulation. There are different subpopulations of T-Cells including: Helper T-Cells (Th) (CD4+), cytotoxic T-cells (CTL)(CD8+) and CD4+/CD25+T cells (T regulatory cells), and NK cells. 

&#160; 

One of the most significant medical advances in the past 30 years has been the discovery of the hormones of the immune system, known as &#8220;cytokines.&#8221; Cytokines are small proteins or polypeptides produced by certain body cells that interact with other cells of the immune system in order to regulate the body&#8217;s response to disease or other disorder. The most famous of these are the interleukins (&#8220;IL&#8221;) and the interferons (&#8220;IFN&#8221;), such as IL-2 and IFN-gamma. Another major group includes the enkephalins, such as MENK and endorphins. Clinically, these cytokines have been found to be useful in stimulating the immune system in treating viral infections such as AIDS and hepatitis as well as in a number of different types of cancer. The resulting balance of systems protects the individual from harmful extremes of uncontrolled activity. Diseases such as those caused by viral infections (especially HIV), bacterial infections and cancer tend to result in deficiencies of the immune system response. Thus, it is critical to restore the body&#8217;s immunity to its effective level and to restore system balance. 

&#160; 

Our Company&#8217;s Immunotherapy 

&#160; 

Management believes one of the most significant medical advances in the past 20 years has been the discovery of the hormones of the immune system, known as &#8220;cytokines.&#8221; MENK is a member of the body of hormones known as cytokines, which are produced by the immune system. MENK plays an essential role in influencing all components of the immune system. 

&#160; 

Two of the most important compounds being researched by the Company are LDN and MENK. Both LDN and MENK are proven immune-stimulating drugs. They boost the immune system by increasing the T and NK cells in the body, thereby activating the body&#8217;s own natural defenses against cancer, autoimmune diseases, immune disorders and infections. As previously mentioned, Dr. Plotnikoff and Professor Shan have published articles proving that MENK plays a very important role in immune stimulation. Dr. Plotnikoff and Professor Shan have been able to show that MENK has more advantages in boosting the human immune system than either IFN (interferon) or IL-2 (interleukin-2). MENK inhibits Treg cells while interferon or interleukin-2 does not. This is a unique discovery by the Company that supports our strategy to combat cancer with our patented technologies and therapies. 

&#160; 

The most important participant in the immune response is a class of white blood cells known as lymphocytes. These cells develop in the bone marrow and are released into general circulation. The lymphocytes (or white blood cells) traveling through the thymus are transformed into T-lymphocytes (or T-Cells) by a hormone known as thymosin. Others, known as B-lymphocytes (or B-Cells), mature in other regions of the body. B-Cells produce specific substances called antibodies that bind to and destroy antigens. 

&#160; 

Researchers discovered that the principal cells in the immune system that attack viruses and tumors are T-cells and NK cells. These cells originate in certain body tissues such as the bone marrow and are activated by hormones known as cytokines, which include enkephalins. Several of these are recognized as stress hormones that stimulate the immune system to fight off infections and cancer. 

&#160; 

Thus, the immune system acts as a defensive system against infectious organisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites and, importantly, tumor cells. The immune system includes many different defense cells such as macrophages, T-cells, NK cells, B-cells and neutrophils. These cells and their produced cytokines communicate with all of the cells in the immune system. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our Immunotherapy Products 

&#160; 

IRT-101 is an active immunotherapy systemic administration of MENK that works by stimulating and/or regulating a patient&#8217;s immune system against infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, immune disorders and tumor cells. This is accomplished by increasing the number of T-cells and NK cells, NKT and gamma/delta T-cells that destroy infective organisms and tumor cells, while simultaneously inhibiting T regulatory cells. 

&#160; 

IRT-103 is an active immunotherapy by administration of LDN which works by the short-term blockage of opioid receptors on circulating and tissue cells followed by a substantial rebound in opioid receptor expression and increased levels of undefined-endorphin and methionine-enkephalin. 

&#160; 

Management considers any condition that results in altered-immune response a target for investigation. However, the Company will most likely pursue additional investigations for LDN and MENK as valuable candidates in the treatment of the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Autoimmune diseases or immune disorders such as Crohn&#8217;s disease and multiple sclerosis; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; As an adjunct to antivirals in the treatment of HIV/AIDS; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; In cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, radiation treatments or surgery. &#160; 

In clinical trials there is evidence that LDN and MENK stimulate the immune system and are effective in the treatment of some immune-suppressed diseases. The treatment modality to date has been demonstrated to be effective while avoiding certain deleterious effects on the body, as is often the case with traditional treatments. 

&#160; 

Treatment Focus 

&#160; 

Cancer 

&#160; 

In clinical trials with MENK, and off-label use of LDN around the world, both products are being used to fight cancer. MENK treatment has been shown in clinical trials to have a substantial degree of efficacy against a wide variety of cancers in patients, with only mild side effects. 

&#160; 

Patients with Kaposi&#8217;s sarcoma (9 patients), lung cancer (12 patients), melanoma (3 patients), hypernephroma (1 patient), or pancreatic cancer (1 patient) were treated with MENK for 1 week to 12 months at doses of 10 &#181;g /kg three times per week up to 80 &#181;g /kg 3 times per week. After 1-2 weeks increases in T cell subsets (CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD2 positive cells) were observed. An increase also occurred in IL-2 receptor expression. NK cell activity was measured in 14 patients and an increased NK activity was present in 12/14 patients. No toxicity attributable to treatment with MENK was observed in any patient. 

&#160; 

Two case studies have been reported in an infant and a 20-month old child who were treated with MENK. The infant was diagnosed with hepatoblastoma and was treated with one course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy at approximately 1 week of age. Due to significant complications from the chemotherapy (neutropenic fever, pneumonia and sepsis), the patient&#8217;s parents declined further chemotherapy, and the infant was treated with surgical resection and MENK/low dose naltrexone (LDN). She is currently close to 10 years disease&#8211;free survival (Rogosnitzky M, et al., 2013). The 20-month-old child was diagnosed with hepatoblastoma. Due to existing comorbidities (including autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease and hypertension), and biopsy results that indicated the tumor might be insensitive to chemotherapy, the parents elected not to proceed with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The patient was treated with surgical resection and MENK/LDN, and is currently at more than 5 years disease-free survival (Rogosnitzky M, et al., 2013). 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Multiple clinical trials have been performed by Dr. Jill Smith and her colleagues at the Pennsylvania State University (PSU) School of Medicine in Hershey, PA. A total of five advance cancer studies have been conducted with MENK via i.v. infusion or s.c. injection. Three studies were conducted in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, one study in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and one study in patients with advanced head and neck cancer. Across the five studies, MENK therapy has been observed to be safe with limited toxicity when given to adults with advanced cancer. The patients with pancreatic cancer had failed prior chemotherapy regimens and were either treated with MENK or were entered into a hospice program. Clinical benefits were experienced by 53% of MENK-treated patients, whereas historical controls with similarly advanced disease had only 23.8% and 4.8% for gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), respectively. Of the MENK-treated patients surviving more than eight weeks, 62% showed either a decrease or stabilization in tumor size by computed tomography. The median survival time for the MENK-treated patients was three times that of the untreated hospice patients (65.5 versus 21 days, p &#60; 0.001). No adverse effects on hematologic or chemistry parameters were noted, and quality of life surveys suggested improvement with MENK (Smith JP, Conter RL, Bingaman SI, Harvey HA, Mauger DT, Ahmad M, Demers LM, Stanley WB, McLaughlin J, Zagon IS. Treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer with opioid growth factor: Phase I. Anti-Cancer Drugs. 2004; 15:203&#8211;209. Smith JP, Bingaman SI, Mauger DT, Harvey HA, Demers LM, Zagon IS. Opioid Growth Factor improves clinical benefit and survival in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Open Access Journal of Clinical Trials. 2010; 2 37&#8211;48). 

&#160; 

The use of MENK therapy at earlier stages of disease or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents may further improve the outcome of this very aggressive malignancy. 

&#160; 

HIV/AIDS 

&#160; 

Early stage clinical trials in AIDS patients have been completed and results from these trials show great promise. 

&#160; 

The Company recently completed an open label non-randomized, two-group clinical trial during the period of May 2015 through December 2015. The control group received the standard ART medication plus a placebo, while the treatment group received 4.5 mg of LodonalTM [daily at bedtime] in addition to the standard ART medications. All patients enrolled in this study signed informed consent forms required by the Osun State Ministry of Health Ethics Committee and were covered by health insurance. The primary objective of this Bridging Trial was to confirm that Lodonal TM has a beneficial effect on the immune system of immune deficient patients and that it is safe. The trial separated the patients into a Control (placebo) Group and a Treatment Group (which was administered Lodonal TM ). The efficacy of increasing CD4 count [cell/mm 3 ] between Day-1 and Day-90 by at least 25% was set as the criteria for demonstrating beneficial effect on the immune system. Safety was demonstrated through quality of life assessment and vitals both of which were not adversely affected. Treatment Group patients were given a daily dose of 4.5-mg/kg of Lodonal. 

&#160; 

The results yielded an average increase in of 44% for the Treatment Group compared to 11% for the Control Group. Additionally, there were no reported opportunistic infections and no toxicity levels uncovered. Liver function remained normal and there was no negative impact on other systems based on blood results. The patients were able to go about their daily routine unhindered. No significant sleep disturbance or vivid dreams were present enough to justify trial discontinuation. No significant adverse CNS, renal, cardiac, hepatic, musculoskeletal, hematopoietic side effects were present. 

&#160; 

NAFDAC is at the forefront of the development of effective health-care in Africa. NAFDAC has approved Lodonal TM as an innovative non-toxic adjunct treatment in the treatment of HIV/AIDS and as a general immune booster to improve the quality of life of people suffering from a compromised immune system. 

&#160; 

A single blind nine-month randomized clinical trial and a single prospective cohort study were conducted in Mali under the auspices of the Centre National d&#8217;Appui &#224; la lutte contre la Maladie (CNAM), Bamako, Mali and other institutions named in the study to evaluate the impact of LDN on asymptomatic HIV+ adults. Results of the nine-month study showed an improvement in CD4 count in the treatment groups that was significantly greater than the control group at 6 months (p = 0.041) and marginally at 9 months (p = 0.067) (Traore AK, Thiero O, Dao S, Kounde FF, Faye O, Cisse M, McCandless JB, Zimmerman JM, Coulibaly K, Diarra A, et al. Impact of low dose naltrexone (LDN) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) treated HIV+ adults in Mali: A single blind randomized clinical trial. J. AID HIV Res . 2011; 3(10):189-198). Results of the single prospective cohort study showed 71% of subjects that completed the study did not show any indication of clinical AIDS symptoms, side effects or a loss of CD4 count that would warrant initiation of ART medication (Traore AK, Thiero O, Dao S, Kounde FF, Faye O, Cisse M, McCandless JB, Zimmerman JM, Coulibaly K, Diarra A, et al. Single cohort study of the effect of low dose naltrexone on the evolution of immunological, virological and clinical state of HIV+ adults in Mali. J. AID HIV Res . 2011; 3(10):180-188). 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

A 12-week, placebo-controlled trial of LDN was conducted from 1985-1986 in 38 patients with AIDS by Dr. Bihari and his colleagues. Patients who participated in this trial showed a significant difference in the incidence of opportunistic infections with 5 out of 16 patients (31%) on placebo developing opportunistic infections in comparison to 0 of the 22 patients in the LDN group. Other difference between placebo and LDN treated patients included: lymphocyte mitogen responses declined on placebo and not on LDN; pathologically elevated levels of acid-labile alpha interferon declined significantly in the patients on LDN and not in those patients on placebo (Bihari B. Low Dose Naltrexone in the Treatment of HIV Infection. www.lowdosenaltrexon.org . September 1996 http://www.lowdosenaltrexone.org/ldn_hiv_1996.htm ). 

&#160; 

After the conclusion of the above clinical trial, Dr. Bihari began to use LDN in his own medical practice. Of 158 patients in his practice that were evaluated, only 10 (6%) were on antivirals. Patients of Dr. Bihari who had taken the drug regularly as prescribed showed no drop in CD4 cells. The average CD4 number in these patients before starting LDN was 358, and the average 18 months later increased to 368. There were 55 patients who had not taken the drug, or had taken it only sporadically (non-compliant) and these patients showed a drop of CD4 cells from an average of 297 to 176 in 18 months. This represented a drop in CD4 of approximately 80 per year, which corresponds to the average drop observed in patients with HIV receiving no treatment. The stabilization of CD4 cells in patients who were administered LDN was also accompanied by disease stabilization. The 55 patients who were non-compliant experienced 25 opportunistic infections, in comparison to the 103 compliant patients who only experienced 8. Survival between the two groups was also significantly different, 13 deaths occurred in the 55 non-compliant patients compared to only one death in the compliant group of 103. At the time of this referenced article (1996), patients in Dr. Bihari&#8217;s practice had been on LDN for 7 to 8 years, with no disease progression, no drop in CD4 levels and no evidence of resistance to the beneficial effects of LDN. None of the patients experienced side effects while on LDN. 

&#160; 

Dr. Bihari also examined CD4 changes in 19 patients who were on the combination treatment regimen of 3TC (Epivir), AZT and LDN. The rise in CD4 counts at 6 months in Dr. Bihari&#8217;s patients was compared with the rise in CD4 counts reported by an investigator working for Glaxo (New England Journal of Medicine, December 21, 1995, Vol. 333, number 25, pg. 1662). In both groups none of the patients had taken AZT previously; however Dr. Bihari&#8217;s patients simultaneously were treated with LDN, which the Glaxo group did not receive. The patients on LDN had an average baseline CD4 count of 88 while the Glaxo group had an average baseline value of 352. The Glaxo patients experienced an average rise in CD4 of 40 at 6 months; or an increase of 11.3%. The LDN patients experienced an average rise of 106 CD4&#8217;s at 6 months, representing a 128% increase. Of the 19 LDN patients, each patient experienced an increase of at least 30%. In 18 of the 19 LDN patients, a significant increase in energy, appetite and mood was observed. In those LDN patients who were severely underweight, weight gains of 10 to 50 pounds were observed in the first two months of treatment. 

&#160; 

Crohn&#8217;s Disease 

&#160; 

Crohn&#8217;s disease is an inflammatory bowel disease (&#8220;IBD&#8221;) marked by chronic inflammation potentially involving any location of the gastrointestinal tract (&#8220;GI&#8221;) causing abdominal pain, diarrhea, GI bleeding, and weight loss. Crohn&#8217;s disease can be both painful and debilitating, and sometimes may lead to life-threatening complications. Current therapies for the condition reduce the inflammation but can be expensive and may incur rare but serious side effects, including infections and lymphoma. Prior research has suggested that endorphins and enkephalins may play a role in the development or continuation of inflammation.

To date the comparator used in the clinical trials has been stable doses of standard of care in combination with LDN or with placebo. However, patients enrolled in these trials had significantly elevated CDAI (Crohn&#8217;s Disease Activity Index) and PCDAI (Pediatric Crohn&#8217;s Disease Activity Index) scores upon enrollment despite maintenance standard of care drugs and other concomitant medications. CDAI is an index utilized to determine an adult patient&#8217;s progress, or lack of progress with their disease state and PCDAI is the corresponding pediatric index. The CDAI and PCDAI are utilized to provide a common scoring method of disease state across multiple sites. This scoring method takes into account symptoms such as abdominal pain and frequency of liquid or very soft stools. In addition to the CDAI or PCDAI, the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn&#8217;s Disease (SES-CD) will be utilized to determine endoscopic disease state and changes in endoscopic activity pre- and post-treatment.

LDN has been shown to be effective to date as is detailed in the publications below: 

&#160; 

Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study in Adults (Smith et al ., 2011) 

&#160; 

Results: 88% of those treated with naltrexone had at least a 70-point decline in CDAI scores compared to 40% of placebo-treated patients (p = 0.009). After 12 weeks, 78% of subjects treated with naltrexone exhibited an endoscopic response as indicated by a 5-point decline in the Crohn&#8217;s disease endoscopy index severity score (CDEIS) from baseline compared to a 28% response in placebo-treated controls (p = 0.008), and 33% achieved remission with a CDEIS score &#60;6, whereas only 8% of those on placebo showed the same change. Fatigue was the only side effect reported that was significantly greater in subjects receiving placebo. 

&#160; 

Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study in Children (Smith et al ., 2013) 

&#160; 

Results: When contrasting the condition end points, we observed a significantly greater reduction of baseline pain in those taking low dose naltrexone than in those taking placebo (28.8% reduction versus 18.0% reduction; P = 0.016). Low dose naltrexone was also associated with improved general satisfaction with life (P = 0.045) and with improved mood (P = 0.039), but not improved fatigue or sleep. Thirty-two percent of participants met the criteria for response (defined as a significant reduction in pain plus a significant reduction in either fatigue or sleep problems) during low dose naltrexone therapy, as contrasted with an 11% response rate during placebo therapy (P = 0.05). Low dose naltrexone was rated equally tolerable as placebo, and no serious side effects were reported. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Status 

&#160; 

The Company holds the following IND Applications: 

&#160; 

IND # &#160; Indication &#160; Product Name &#160; Status 34,442 &#160; HIV/AIDS &#160; MENK &#160; Inactive 67,442 &#160; Crohn&#8217;s Disease &#160; Naltrexone HCL &#160; Active 50,987 &#160; Pancreatic Cancer &#160; MENK/OGF &#160; Active &#160; 

Clinical trials under the INDs are anticipated to be conducted in the United States with the potential for global Phase III studies. 

&#160; 

IRT-101 : The Company had an End-of-Phase 1 Meeting with the FDA in August 2013 to discuss its development plan and protocol designs. Based on the guidance from the FDA, the Company plans to initiate a Phase II dose response/dose-confirmation study in patients with advanced cancer. Possible indications include MENK as an adjuvant therapy for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer, advanced hepatocellular cancer or advanced head and neck cancer. 

&#160; 

IRT-103 : A Type C meeting was held with the FDA on June 26, 2013. Based on the guidance from the FDA, the Company plans to initiate a Phase II dose-response/dose-confirmation study in patients with active Crohn&#8217;s disease. Possible indications include Multiple Sclerosis, Crohn&#8217;s disease, fibromyalgia or HIV (in combination with antivirals in asymptomatic HIV patients). 

&#160; 

IRT-103 is currently our lead candidate. 

&#160; 

An End-of-Phase 1 meeting occurs with the FDA after completion of Phase 1 studies, where guidance is sought prior to moving into Phase 2 clinical trials. This type of meeting is also considered a Type B meeting. Type B meetings are typically scheduled to occur within 60 days of FDA receipt of the official written meeting request. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

A Type C meeting is any meeting requested with the FDA that does not fall into the category of a Type A or Type B meeting. Type C meetings are typically scheduled to occur within 75 days of FDA receipt of the official written meeting request. 

&#160; 

A Type A meeting is a meeting needed to help an otherwise stalled product development program proceed. 

&#160; 

Type B meetings are: (i) pre-investigational new drug application (pre-IND) meetings; (ii) certain End-of-Phase 1 meetings; (iii) End-of-Phase 2 meetings; and (iv) pre-new drug application (NDA)/biologics license application (BLA) meetings. 

&#160; 

The FDA review staff participates in meetings with sponsors and applications who seek guidance relating to the development and review of INDs and drug or biological product marketing applications. These meetings are often at critical points in the regulatory process and are helpful for applicants to help them continue to make progress toward FDA approval. 

The Company has recently retained Cote Orphan to submit an expanded briefing package to the FDA for both Pediatric and Adult Crohn&#8217;s Disease. Once we obtain final protocol approval from the FDA, subject to availability of funding, we hope to begin the trials in 2016. 

&#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s short-term business strategy focuses on several key areas described below, all of which are being undertaken simultaneously. 

&#160; 

Conference Attendance: The Company will participate in a number of conferences both domestically and internationally in 2016 about the value of LDN as an immunomodulator for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancer. These conferences include SeeThu Equity Conference February 22, 2016; South Florida Investment Forum Luncheons &#38; Corporate Presentations on March 7th in Miami and March 8 th , 2016 in Boca Raton, Florida; BIO Int. Convention San Francisco, CA June, 6&#8211;9, 2016; Global Biotechnology Congress 2016 (4th in the Series) August 22nd - 25 th , 2016, Boston, MA, USA. The Company will add conferences as they come available and funds are available. 

&#160; 

International Regulatory Approval in 2016: The Company has been in discussions with drug regulators regarding the regulatory and approvals process for sale of its products in 2016 in a number of countries: South Africa, Nigeria, Malawi, Kenya, Angola, Niger, Gabon, Egypt, Sri Lanka, and China. The process can take between four to 12 months depending on the local authorities. In December 2015, the Company presented the final results of a bridging trial in Nigeria. As of March 30, 2016, we are still awaiting receipt of final approvals for sale of Lodonal&#8482; in Nigeria. The Company has begun discussions for a 90-day Lodonal&#8482; bridging trial as an adjunct to chemotherapy in Kenya. If we complete the Kenya trial and if we meet the primary and secondary end points, the Company expects to receive approval for Lodonal&#8482; as an adjunct treatment for cancer in Kenya. An approval in Nigeria would allow the Company to fast track approvals in other countries.

&#160; 

Establish Partnerships in Africa: The Company&#8217;s goal is to establish partnerships in Africa with large employers that maintain onsite clinics; there is increasing recognition that health creates wealth and advances GDP. HIV and AIDS have had a significant negative impact on labor and productivity. The vast majority of people living with HIV in Africa are of working age 15-49 years old. The Company believes that Lodonal&#8482; can be used as a prophylactic to avoid many of the standard opportunistic infections accompanied with HIV and cancer. The Company will now move forward on this program if it receives approval for Lodonal&#8482; sales in Nigeria. 

&#160; 

Funding Cytocom Inc. Clinical Trials: If we generate significant revenue from sales to Africa and under the licensing of our LDN formulation to KRS Global Biotechnology, Inc., which is described in detail below under &#8220;Agreements to Promote Development and Sale of Company Products,&#8221; we believe that in 2016 we will be able to commit financial resources to help fund Cytocom Inc.&#8217;s clinical trials in the United States to validate the use of IRT-103 LDN in a number of indications. Unless other funding becomes available, the Company expects to use revenue from the sale of Lodonal&#8482; in Nigeria to help underwrite clinical trials in the U.S. and Europe. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Clinical Studies: 

&#160; 

In 2015, the Company focused on receipt of approvals in Nigeria and Malawi to conduct clinical development programs for Lodonal&#8482;. We completed a trial in Nigeria in December 2015, and we are now awaiting final NAFDAC approval to commence sales in Nigeria. The Company also expects to commence a bridging trial for cancer in 2016 in the Republic of Malawi.

&#160; 

On the regulatory front, Cytocom Inc. has held constructive dialogue with the FDA with respect to appropriate trial designs and study protocols for IRT-103 LDN and IRT-101. The Company has received approval for a phase IIB/III to be run in conjunction with this trial, but as of the date of this Report the FDA remains in the process of determining the primary endpoint for the trial for Crohn&#8217;s Disease. The Company has retained Cote Orphan to submit a final package to the FDA during the second quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

Cytocom Inc.&#8217;s immediate focus will be on Crohn&#8217;s Disease both in children and adults and the Company expects recruitment in both pharmacokinetic (PK) and Dosing Trials for IRT-103 LDN to begin in 2016 as long as funds are available. 

&#160; 

In addition to the trial design as described immediately above, the Company intends to undertake a Toxicologist and PK study in China with its partner, Hubei Qianjiang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd,, for IRT-101 for the purpose of furthering its understanding of the effect of the pharmacokinetics of IRT-101. The trial has been delayed until 2016 because the State Food and Drug Administration of the People&#8217;s Republic of China on the Safety of Drugs and Medical Devices (SFDA) has required chemistry, manufacturing and controls to be completed before the start of the toxicology study. Quinjiang expects to have the PK and Toxicology studies completed before the end of the year. This will allow the Company to better understand the potential for drug interactions to further optimize treatment for Phase 3 development of IRT-101 for cancer in both the United States and China. These trials are required before Hubei can file for a phase III trial for liver cancer with the SFDA. 

&#160; 

Strategy for Growth: 

&#160; 

Since 2014, the Company has worked aggressively to build the business both upward and outward. It has worked to create a multi-faceted leader in immunotherapies by exploring opportunities beyond HIV/AIDS and cancer in emerging nations. 

&#160; 

The goal and strategic vision is to build a diverse pipeline and to develop and commercialize novel drug treatments to improve the lives of patients suffering from chronic often life-threating disease. 

&#160; 

To fulfill these goals, the Company received funding from the sale of stock, the exercise of stock warrants and issuance of notes payable totaling approximately $2.66 million in 2015. The Company anticipates generating revenues in 2016 from a number of sources, including revenues from the use of its formulation and patents and the sale of Lodonal&#8482; in Nigeria, Malawi, Kenya, and Equatorial Guinea.

&#160; 

Company Growth : 

&#160; 

To build visibility and positive awareness of the Company, management has made presentations at key investor and industry conferences internationally. 

&#160; 

If the Company receives approvals for the sale of LDN in Nigeria following the 2015 bridging trial there, the Company believes it will be able to &#8220;fast track&#8221; the approval process in a number of African nations that will accept NAFDAC Nigeria&#8217;s approval of IRT-103 LDN for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Focus on HIV/AIDS 

&#160; 

HIV/AIDS remains one of the three global public health threats. This disease results in substantial morbidity, mortality, negative socioeconomic consequences, and human suffering. Despite the significant increase in financial support and recent progress in addressing HIV/AIDS, many obstacles and unmet priorities remain. 

&#160; 

Disease-specific interventions must be developed to ensure successful treatments of this disease. Apart from human suffering, the associated high adult mortality caused by HIV/AIDS, negatively impacts the socioeconomic development in some countries, especially in Nigeria and South Africa. 

&#160; 

Adopting a treatment regimen for life that involves taking daily medication with potential side effects, presents many challenges that must be overcome if patients are to successfully remain on treatment. If drug resistance occurs through failure to adhere to antiretroviral treatments (ARVs), far more expensive second line therapy may be necessary. In some cases drug-resistant strains of HIV are transmitted, which can impact national treatment programs. Drug resistance has been found to be more prevalent the longer a country has provided antiretroviral therapies. 

&#160; 

The Company believes Lodonal&#8482; can provide an alternative in areas where patients have stopped taking their therapies due to side effects, or cost; Lodonal&#8482; has been shown in trials to lessen the toxic side effects of ARVs. In those countries where people must travel monthly for a medical check-up (and lose a day&#8217;s pay), IRT-103 LDN can cost-effectively provide the ability to slow the progression of the disease without any toxic side effects. 

&#160; 

Nigeria: In Nigeria, it is estimated that more than 3.6 million people are living with HIV/AIDS, with the annual number of new infections for adults at 323,000 and 57,000 for children. Currently, only 600,000 people receive HIV treatment. 

&#160; 

South Africa: Based on a wide range of data including the household and antenatal studies, UNAIDS estimated that HIV prevalence was 17.3% among 15-49 year olds at the end of 2011. The high and low estimates were 16.6% and 18.1%, respectively. This implies that approximately 5.6 million South Africans were living with HIV at the end of 2011, including 460,000 children under 15 years old. By October 2012, only two million people were receiving ARVs. The biggest problem is compliance with prescribed treatment, as people are required to take pills 2 to 3 times a day at specific times and many times with food with considerable toxic side effects. In contrast, IRT-103 LDN is taken only once per day, does not have to be taken with food, and has no toxic side effects. 

&#160; 

Agreements to Promote Development and Sale of Company Products 

&#160; 

The Company is focused on its lead therapies designed for the treatment of cancer, HIV/AIDS, Crohn&#8217;s disease, fibromyalgia and MS. Management believes the pharmaceutical industry is eager to acquire advanced clinical-phase and approved products. However, despite the strong demand for advanced clinical-phase products, nearly 4,000 known compounds have had their development suspended in Phase II or earlier. Many of these are promising therapeutic drug candidates, but their development was discontinued because of strategic or financial constraints rather than for clinical reasons. Therefore, management believes there are clear market opportunities with a significant amount of unmet needs and a robust potential for partnering activities. 

&#160; 

To further the business strategy, the Company has entered into relationships with a number of groups to promote the sale of its products outside the U.S., focusing initially on countries in Africa. They include: The Brewer Group, Inc.; GB Oncology &#38; Imaging Group, LLC; American Hospitals and Resorts Limited (&#8220;AHAR&#8221;), an advanced surgical and medical facility, as well as a number of U.S. doctors that own and operate clinics in the U.S. and Nigeria. 

&#160; 

The Brewer Group, Inc. is an international business advisory firm engaged in the business of identifying and capitalizing on opportunities with international governments, non-government organizations and professional athletes. The CEO of The Brewer Group is also the founder and Executive Director of The Jack Brewer Foundation. The Jack Brewer Foundation seeks to provide the Company with medical equipment where it is needed. Under the Engagement Agreement for Corporate Advisory Services dated February 5, 2013, the Brewer Group agreed to evaluate the Company&#8217;s options for expansion and growth into certain international markets, including Africa and, upon request, markets in Haiti, the Dominican Republic and/or Panama. Pursuant to the Engagement Agreement, the Brewer Group agreed to endorse the Company publicly and assist the Company in securing strategic partnership deals to enhance brand and market awareness. The initial term of the Engagement Agreement was 12 months, with an option for either party to terminate upon 30 calendar days with written notice to the other party. The agreement has been extended through 2016. The Company has issued the Brewer Group a total of 1,000,000 shares of its common stock since the signing of the Engagement Agreement. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

GB Pharma lead by Dr. Gloria B. Herndon, a former director and current consultant of the Company has been committed to sourcing sustainable solutions in the field of health care in Africa, and has been involved since the 1990s on health-care related issues in Africa. The Company and GB Pharma have continued working with the ministries of health in African countries to provide better access to and public awareness of the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer and chronic infectious diseases. 

&#160; 

On July 14, 2012, GBOIG in partnership with the Company signed a letter of intent agreement to collaborate with the Government of Malawi to assist in expanding the treatment of cancer, HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. 

&#160; 

In 2015, the Company submitted protocols seeking permission from the Pharmacy, Medicines and Poisons Board of Malawi (&#8220;PMPB&#8221;) to conduct two trials involving Lodonal&#8482; in Malawi: 

&#160; 

a. The first protocol, submitted jointly with The Jack Brewer Foundation (&#8220;JBF Worldwide&#8221;), received PMPB approval on November 11, 2015. The protocol covers a 12-month trial for a &#8220;Single Visit Approach to Cervical Cancer Prevention.&#8221; The approach is designed to deliver a preventive and simple procedure that can be performed in a clinical setting without the use of a laboratory and to allow for immediate treatment of any precancerous lesions utilizing Wallach LL100 Cryosurgical systems. The protocol provides for 50% of the patient group to be put on Lodonal&#8482; to determine if the drug lowers the number of opportunistic infections during the year, and if it can be shown that LDN increases CD4, CE8, NK and T cell count, which would show that the incidence rates of opportunistic infection could decrease with Lodonal&#8482; and that Lodonal&#8482; could be used as a prophylaxis to prevent substantial HIV-related morbidity in Malawi. The Company expects the final trial agreement with PMPB to be signed by the end of the second quarter of 2016. Lodonal&#8482; pills have been produced in Nicaragua in anticipation of the trial. Shipments will commence once the trial is approved. &#160; &#160; b. The second protocol, which has not yet been approved, covers a trial using Lodonal&#8482; for the treatment of cancer. The protocol is still under discussion with the PMPB, and the Company expects a final protocol to be submitted for approval by year end. &#160; 

On September 25, 2012, GBOIG, in partnership with the Company, signed an agreement with the Government of Malawi to open an outpatient clinic at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (in Malawi) for the treatment of cancer and infectious disease. The duration of the Agreement shall be for 25 years with an optional 10-year renewal to be indicated by the Government of Malawi at least three years prior to the expiration of the term. The Government of Malawi shall bear the upfront costs for the agreement of $2,500,000. Due to a change in the Government the Company has abandoned this contract. 

&#160; 

In September 2013, TNI BioTech International, Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, signed a Distribution Agreement with AHAR Pharma, a Nigerian company, to market Lodonal&#8482;, in Nigeria for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancer. AHAR intends to distribute Lodonal&#8482; through a local distributor network, an Internet client base and directly to hospitals, pharmacists and doctors in Nigeria. The agreement gives AHAR exclusive rights to sell to customers in the private sector and non-exclusive rights to public-sector companies. The Company may terminate the exclusivity if AHAR fails to meet minimum purchase targets. Unless terminated earlier, the agreement is valid for five years, subject to the right of the parties to extend for one additional five-year term. The Company had hoped to implement the agreement in 2015 but did not finish the trial until December 2015. We now anticipate launch of the product in the second quarter of 2016. Under the agreement, the Company is obligated to provide delivery of an initial supply of between 1 million and 1.5 million doses of Lodonal&#8482; product to cover AHAR Pharma&#8217;s first-year purchase commitment. 

&#160; 

In August 2015, the Company announced the signing of a letter of interest with GB Pharma/AHAR and Fidson Healthcare of Nigeria to enable Fidson to market and sell Lodonal TM in Nigeria. The agreement will become effective if we receive NAFDAC approval to distribute Lodonal TM in Nigeria, based on the 2015 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of Lodonal&#8482;. The agreement will require an amendment to the agreement signed in September 2013 with AHAR, so that both contracts conform. On January 21, 2016 the company submitted the initial results of the clinical trial to NAFDAC, and on February 22, 2016 AHAR Pharma submitted final document to NAFDAC requesting the issuance for marketing approval. As of March 30, 2016 the Company is still awaiting approval for distribution of Lodonal&#8482; in Nigeria. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In September 2014, Airmed Biopharma Limited (&#8220;Airmed&#8221;), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, signed an exclusive agency agreement with GB Pharma Holdings Inc., to market and promote Lodonal&#8482;, and to solicit purchase orders for Lodonal&#8482;, in various counties in Africa. Airmed is required to pay GB Pharma Holdings Inc. a commission based on payments actually received on purchase orders procured by the GB Pharma Holdings Inc. from customers in Africa during the term of the agreement, after deduction for certain costs incurred by Airmed for product supply. The agreement has an initial term of five years, with automatic renewals for additional one-year periods unless terminated by either party. 

&#160; 

On October 18, 2012, the Company and Hubei Qianjiang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Qianjiang Pharmaceutical&#8221;), signed a Venture Cooperation Agreement on New Drug Methionine Enkephalin (the &#8220;Venture Agreement&#8221;) pursuant to which Qianjiang Pharmaceutical acquired an exclusive license for the production of MENK in China. The Venture Agreement requires that Qianjiang Pharmaceutical conduct drug research and pilot testing for MENK, organize pre-clinical studies, and apply for clinical trials for MENK with the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration. Under the Venture Agreement, Qianjiang Pharmaceutical must open a co-administration account for the development of MENK in China. Qianjiang Pharmaceutical must pay the Company, upon the marketing of MENK products, a half-year amount equaling 6% of its gross sales from MENK of the preceding half year. The Company may cancel the Venture Agreement if Qianjiang Pharmaceutical does not pay expenses for a period exceeding nine months or does not commence clinical trials within 12-months after receiving certain approvals. Qianjiang Pharmaceutical may cancel the Venture Agreement if the Company fails to perform its obligations for a period of nine months or the failure to receive approval of clinical trials is due to the Company&#8217;s MENK technologies. The Venture Agreement was amended on February 24, 2013 to expand the clinical trials from pancreatic to both pancreatic and liver cancer and amended on March 6, 2014 to require Qianjiang Pharmaceutical to commence studies and clinical trials in China and place funds in the co-administration account. 

&#160; 

On August 6, 2014, the Company entered into a Supplementary Agreement on New Drug Methionine &#8211; Enkephalin Cooperation (the &#8220;Amendment&#8221;) with Qianjiang Pharmaceutical, amending the Venture Agreement, as amended. The Company and Qianjiang Pharmaceutical executed the Amendment to accelerate clinical trials in both the United States and China, and agreed to immediately initiate three month Good Laboratory Practice (&#8220;GLP&#8221;) Toxicology Studies (rat and dog) within 30 days of signing the Amendment. The Amendment requires that the GLP Toxicology Studies Trials are conducted in China in accordance with international standards and standards acceptable to the FDA. 

&#160; 

In February 2013, the Company signed a Strategic Framework Agreement for Cooperation with Qianjiang Pharmaceutical. Under the agreement, the parties will work together to further the development of new products and conduct research and development on the Company&#8217;s licensed patented technology. Specifically, the parties aim to co-invest to develop and market products focusing on HIV, cancer and related autoimmune system therapies, develop co-ventured manufacturing facilities in China, and develop co-ventured distribution of the developed products in China and Africa. The agreement does not have a definitive term, as each new agreement resulting from the cooperation will set forth the material terms, including, but not limited to, fees, duration and termination therein. 

&#160; 

In accordance with these agreements, Qianjiang Pharmaceutical has acquired MENK material for the preclinical and clinical trial. MENK toxicology studies are in process under the trial, including a six-month toxicology study in animals. Other studies, including stability and general pharmacology (on normal animals to determine the effect to heart, blood pressure, etc.) have commenced. All FDA-required tests, including formulation and quality control tests, are in process in China. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

On December 8, 2014, the Company entered into a Contract for the Compounding of Pharmaceutical Products with KRS Global Biotechnology, Inc. (&#8220;KRS&#8221;) pursuant to which KRS will carry out the services of compounding, packaging and distributing tablets of IRT-103 LDN for sale in the United States in accordance with the agreement. The agreement has an initial term of three years starting on December 8, 2014. The parties may agree to extend the initial term for one year. KRS will pay the Company for every tablet it compounds, packages and sells, calculated in accordance with a formula set forth in the agreement. The Company has agreed, (i) to provide sales and marketing assistance necessary to allow KRS to fulfill its obligations, (ii) that the rights provided to KRS in the agreement to provide IRT-103 LDN are exclusive only to KRS and will not be provided to any other party during the term, (iii) to provide KRS with specifications for raw materials and the necessary technical specifications for the compounding and packaging processes of IRT-103 LDN, as available, (iv) in the event of termination by the Company for any reason, to reimburse KRS for all unused packaging materials, (v) in the event that KRS does not receive and ship at least 1,000 orders (prescriptions) for LDN, to reimburse KRS for 100% of the &#8220;ramp up costs&#8221; of compounding our product, even in the case where the Company cancels/terminates the agreement, and (vii) to provide the design of secondary packing and instructions in any language needed to sell IRT-103 LDN. KRS is required to order and have shipped directly to KRS the active pharmaceutical ingredient necessary for the production of IRT-103 LDN and to submit a purchase order to the Company for such active pharmaceutical ingredient. The Company has agreed to pay such purchase order directly to the supplier of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Upon KRS receiving a minimum of 10,000 orders (prescriptions) per month, KRS will pay for the active pharmaceutical ingredient for each such 10,000 orders month. 

&#160; 

Production 

&#160; 

On April 23, 2013, the Company signed a Contract with ViPharma for the Supervision and Inspection of Manufacturing Processes as part of its negotiations for a contract for the manufacturing of LDN in a tablet, capsule and/or cream. The contract sets out the terms and conditions under which ViPharma will carry out the services of inspecting and supervising the manufacturing and packaging processes of LDN and ensure compliance with the FDA&#8217;s Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s specifications. ViPharma will carry out its obligations in whatever Latin American country the Company ultimately decides to manufacture LDN. Under the contract, ViPharma has the exclusive rights to supervise and inspect all manufacturing processes of LDN in Latin America. The initial term of the agreement is ten years commencing in September 2013, with automatic five-year renewal terms provided neither party is in breach. The agreement may be terminated by (i) mutual agreement, (ii) in the event of a breach after a 45 day cure period or (iii) by either party upon provision of written notice at least 90 days before the end of the agreement, provided however that if the Company terminates the contract without cause it will be required to pay ViPharma a $10 million penalty. 

&#160; 

The Company executed a manufacturing agreement with Laboratorios Ramos, a current good manufacturing practice (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;) facility for IRT-103 LDN effective August 16, 2013. Under the agreement, Laboratorios Ramos will produce LDN tablets, capsules and/or cream in accordance with the technical specifications we provided, cGMPs and the practices of Nicaragua and of any other regulatory body of the countries where the products will be exported. Laboratorios Ramos has obtained all permits and licenses necessary to carry out the manufacturing of LDN. The manufacturing agreement has a five-year term, renewable by a signed agreement by the parties at least 60 days before the expiration of the agreement. The agreement may be terminated earlier through mutual agreement or upon expiration of a 30-day cure period following notice from the non-breaching party to the breaching party of a material failure of the obligations under the agreement. Additionally, we may terminate the agreement upon at least 30 days written notice if Laboratorios Ramos does not act in strict accordance with the technical specifications we provided and with cGMPs or those of any regulatory body of the importing countries. We will pay Laboratorios Ramos a low single digit cent amount per tablet or capsule and a low double-digit cent amount per each cream produced. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials and Principal Suppliers 

&#160; 

The Company has decided to enter into third-party manufacturing agreements; accordingly, we rely on third parties for clinical production of our products and product candidates. 

&#160; 

The active pharmaceutical ingredient (&#8220;API&#8221;) for initiating clinical trials in the United States has been and will continue to be sourced from a cGMP-established vendor that has filed or will file a Type II Drug Master File in the United States. Prior to sourcing, a quality due diligence/vendor qualification will be completed that will include, but is not limited to, a review of the vendor&#8217;s inspection and compliance history with the FDA and, as relevant, the vendor&#8217;s inspection and compliance history with other regulatory bodies (i.e. the European Medicines Agency, or EMA). 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Company expects that the Finished Pharmaceutical Product (&#8220;FPP&#8221;) for initiating the proposed clinical trials will be prepared by a U.S. vendor with extensive cGMP experience, a strong record of compliance with FDA regulations as evidenced by a site Quality Audit, and an extensive history of manufacturing products administered to humans in the U.S. 

&#160; 

American Peptide Company is the Company&#8217;s supplier of the API in MENK. S.A.L.A.R.S SpA supplies the API in LDN. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. A large number of companies of all sizes, including major pharmaceutical companies and specialized biotechnology companies, engage in activities similar to ours. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources available to them. In addition, colleges, universities, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations continue to conduct research and are becoming more active in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements to collect royalties for use of technologies that they have developed. Some of our competitors&#8217; current or future products and technologies may be in direct competition with ours. We also must compete with these institutions in recruiting highly qualified personnel. 

&#160; 

Established pharmaceutical companies that currently sell or are developing drugs in our markets of interest include, for example; Abbott Laboratories, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Biogen Idec, Bayer, Elan, Johnson &#38; Johnson, Merck, Merck Serono, Takeda, Novartis, Pfizer, Reata, Sanofi-Aventis and Teva. Many or all of these established competitors are also involved in research and drug development regarding various OGF receptors. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which are known to be involved in immuno therapy research and related drug development include Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Takeda, Sanofi-Aventis, Incyte, and UCB Pharma, among others. 

&#160; 

Protalex, Inc. is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company that is developing a class of biopharmaceutical drugs for treating autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and rtax Biopharma is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing breakthrough therapies for autoimmune diseases. Its pipeline of drugs is based on novel science that targets the interaction between T-cell receptors (TCR) and Nck, a key protein involved in T-cell activation. 

&#160; 

There are also comparable companies focused on advancing drugs for various diseases using the FDA&#8217;s 505(b)(2) pathway including Akorn Inc., Chelsea Therapeutics Inc., MAP Pharmaceuticals Inc., Pain Therapeutics Inc., Rexahn Pharmaceuticals Inc., Santarus Inc., Ventrus Biosciences Inc., and XenoPort Inc. 

&#160; 

The current lack of safe, effective, low cost oral treatments for autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and Crohn&#8217;s disease provides an attractive opportunity for our product. Treatment of cancer is an unmet medical need in developing countries, and the need for a safe, effective, low-cost oral treatment provides an opportunity for our Company. Clinical results with LDN trials support further evaluation of our products in the treatment of Crohn&#8217;s disease. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

In 2015, the Company recorded Lodonal sales totaling $16,197 to individuals in the USA under its agreement with KRS. The Company had no sales to customers in 2014. 

&#160; 

The Company has made final applications for the importation of Lodonal&#8482; into the Republic of Nigeria, Republic of Equatorial Guinea where the company obtained approval for the drug the government to date has not allocated any funds to complete the purchase. The Company has received approval from the Republic of Malawi and has received approval for the importation of Lodonal&#8482;, subject to completion of a 6 month clinical trial as an adjunct treatment for cancer. In December 2014, NAFDAC granted permission to the Company and AHAR Pharma for a Lodonal&#8482; trial for HIV/AIDS in Nigeria. The objective of this bridging trial was to assure safety and tolerability as well as efficacy with the local population. The Company completed this trial in December 2015, and as of March 30, 2016 had not yet received approval for the importation of Lodonal&#8482; in Nigeria. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Company, with approval from the Minister of Health in Nicaragua and countries that approve and register the product inclusive of the Certificate of Pharmaceutical Products issued for that jurisdiction, will look to open distribution channels in Central and South America in 2016. 

&#160; 

Government Regulations 

&#160; 

United States 

&#160; 

The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, import, export, marketing and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries with regulations differing from country to country. Neither we nor our collaboration partners are permitted to market our drug candidates in the United States until we receive approval of a New Drug Application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;) from the FDA. Neither we nor our collaboration partners have submitted an application for or received marketing approval for any of our drug candidates. Obtaining approval of an NDA can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. 

&#160; 

Prior to receiving approval to commercialize any of our drug candidates in the United States or abroad, we and our collaboration partners must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA and other regulatory authorities abroad, that such drug candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. Results from preclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Regulatory approval of an NDA or NDA supplement is not guaranteed, and the approval process is expensive and may take several years. 

&#160; 

Before a drug can be tested in people, the sponsor (in this case the Company) performs laboratory and animal tests to discover how the drug works and whether it&#8217;s likely to be safe and effective in humans. As LDN and MENK have previously been used in clinical trials, this phase of development was not required by the Company to initiate clinical trials under its applications. 

&#160; 

Next, a series of tests in people (i.e. clinical trials) is begun to determine whether the drug is safe when used to treat a disease and whether it provides a real health benefit. The clinical phase typically starts at Phase 1 and progresses to Phase 3. The Company will have an abbreviated list of clinical trials that need to be conducted due to published literature on previously conducted studies, as well as utilizing the approval of naltrexone previously at 50 mg by the FDA. 

&#160; 

Upon completion of the clinical trials, the Company will send the FDA and/or the EMA the evidence from these tests to prove the drug is safe and effective for its intended use (New Drug Application (NDA) in the US or Marketing Authorisation Application in the EU). The regulatory bodies will review these data and determine if the sponsor has approval to market the product at the specified dose(s) and formulation(s) for the specified indication(s) ( http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/default.htm) . 

&#160; 

Once regulatory approval has been granted, the approved product and its manufacturer are subject to continual review by the FDA and/or non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Any regulatory approval that we or our collaboration partners receive for our drug candidates may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing follow-up studies to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product. In addition, if the FDA and/or non-U.S. regulatory authorities approve any of our drug candidates, we will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements by the FDA and other regulatory authorities with regard to the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for our products. In addition, manufacturers of our drug products are required to comply with current cGMP regulations which include requirements related to quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Further, regulatory authorities must approve these manufacturing facilities before they can be used to manufacture our drug products, and these facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

European Union 

&#160; 

We intend to seek distribution and marketing partners for IRT-101 (MENK) and IRT-103 (LDN) in the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;). To market our future products in the European Economic Area (&#8220;EEA&#8221;) (which is comprised of the 27 member states of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and many other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals. More concretely, in the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (&#8220;MA&#8221;). 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;&#9679; National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the member states of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a member state of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another member state through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any member state at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various member states through the Decentralized Procedure. &#160; 

Under the procedures described above, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the member states of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 

&#160; 

Our IND is being conducted per 21 Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, Part 312. In addition, we follow ICH guidelines, including good clinical practices (ICH E6) and current good manufacturing practice (ICH Q7) throughout the development process. After completion of Phase III clinical trials, the Company will file our NDA for LDN (IRT-103) as a 505(b)(2) application. IRT-103 products will follow the 505(b)(2) pathway relying on the Reference Listed Drug (RLD) REVIA to support the safety of the product. Efficacy will be submitted by the Company directly to the LDN NDA. IRT-101 products will follow the traditional approval pathway as a RLD is not available for MENK. However, published literature will support this program. 

&#160; 

Nigeria 

&#160; 

NAFDAC is the equivalent in Nigeria of the FDA. It undertakes registration of food, drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, agrochemicals and other similar products in Nigeria. At the end of the process, a registration number is given to the product and a registration certificate is issued to the applicant. 

&#160; 

Many of the African countries do not have a local FDA equivalent organization or agency. We plan to use the NAFDAC Registration as the guideline for submission in Africa for countries that do not have their own application and approval procedures. 

&#160; 

Malawi 

&#160; 

No formal governmental agency is in place in Malawi to govern the application of a new drug. Malawi is a member of the Southern Africa Development Community (&#8220;SADC&#8221;). The SADC has been making efforts to synchronize the regulation of medication in the SADC countries. The SADC published Guidelines for Submitting Application for Registration of a Medicine are available at: http://www.ich.org/fileadmin/Public_Web_Site/ABOUT_ICH/Organisation/SADC/Guideline_for_Medicine_ Registration.pdf. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

The guidelines require filing an application prior to approval of registration. However, these guidelines are preliminary. The Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (&#8220;RISDP&#8221;) is a comprehensive development and implementation framework guiding the Regional Integration agenda of the SADC over a period of fifteen years (2005-2020). It is designed to provide clear strategic direction with respect to SADC programs, projects and activities in line with the SADC Common Agenda and strategic priorities, as enshrined in the SADC Treaty of 1992. http://www.sadc.int/about-sadc/overview/strategic-pl/regional-indicative-strategic-development-plan/. 

&#160; 

In July 2014, the Republic of Malawi approved Lodonal&#8482; as an adjunct for the treatment of cancer. Protocols for a Lodonal&#8482; trial were approved in November 2015. The Brewer Group, Inc. has paid for production of the first shipment to Malawi of Lodonal&#8482;, which was delivered to Malawi from Nicaragua in 2015. 

&#160; 

Equatorial Guinea 

&#160; 

Equatorial Guinea does not have procedures for the official approval of traditional medical practices or remedies. Accordingly, the Company was requested to make a presentation to the Health Sector and Minister on the use of naltrexone in the treatment of certain indications. After due discussion, the Government approved the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; 1. Drug use naltrexone (4.5 mg) in the treatment of diseases requiring immune system stimulating cancer, HIV infection, multiple sclerosis, etc., as demonstrated by the Company, at a cost of $1/day or 450 x F.CFA/day. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2. Management &#8211; laboratory for quality control and to analyze drugs imported in to Equatorial Guinea. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 3. The implementation of local production of quality essential medicines. &#160; 

China 

&#160; 

In terms of the Company&#8217;s cooperative venture with its China Partner, the Partner is required to obtain all approvals and permits required for the importation and sale of the Company&#8217;s products in China. 

&#160; 

China&#8217;s drug registration process is administered by the China Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;CFDA&#8221;) (formerly known as China State Food and Drug Administration or &#8220;SFDA&#8221;). The process includes two applications, before and after a clinical trial. 

&#160; 

The first step is to submit an application to the CFDA for a Clinical Trial Application (&#8220;CTA&#8221;). The CFDA will conduct a preliminary review of the submission package and then transfer the dossier to the Center for Drug Evaluation (&#8220;CDE&#8221;). Reviewers with background in pharmaceuticals, pharmacology and clinical study will run a technical review, while local sample testing will also be conducted in parallel. Few CTAs pass through the CDE review in one round. However, most applications will receive supplement notice(s) in writing to request additional information for further assessment. In such case, CDE will allow a 4-month period for the applicant to gather and submit additional requested information to CDE. This entire CTA step usually takes at least 125 working days. A CTA is similar to an IND in the United States. 

&#160; 

The second step in drug registration is Production Application (or Imported Drug License Application), which involves submitting a clinical report and other relevant files to obtain an imported drug license. The process itself is basically the same as the CTA step. This second step will take approximately 145 days. A Product Application is similar to an NDA. 

&#160; 

Nicaragua 

&#160; 

Laboratorios Ramos in Managua, Nicaragua has been issued approval from the Minster of Health to manufacture Naltrexone for the Company under the trademark name Lodonal&#8482;. The certificate of free sale allows Naltrexone to be exported from the Managua facility to other jurisdictions where the Company is approved to market and sell Naltrexone in satisfaction of the import requirements of such jurisdictions. The free sale certificate is not a license for export, which is issued separately for a specific product in both the country of export as well as the country of import. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Our research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;) organization focuses primarily on new uses for the opioid-related immuno-therapies, such as LDN and MENK. These therapies stimulate the immune system in such a way that provides the potential to treat a variety of diseases that have abnormalities in the immune system. 

&#160; 

Our R&#38;D priorities include development of MENK IRT-101, a small synthetic pentapeptide that is naturally occurring in the body, and LDN IRT-103, an opioid receptor antagonist. Our pipeline provides two therapies with an extremely wide range of indications that can be pursued. Both molecules have the ability to stimulate and/or regulate the immune system in order to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis, immune disorders such as Crohn&#8217;s disease, cancer, and viral infections such as HIV/AIDS. 

&#160; 

Our R&#38;D is overseen and managed internally, working with individuals, universities, and Contract Research Organizations (&#8220;CROs&#8221;) in order to utilize patents that we have licensed or acquired since our inception. We continue to seek to expand our pipeline by reviewing other compounds, technologies or capabilities. We also seek out promising compounds and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery and development processes or projects. 

&#160; 

Drug discovery and development is time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable. According to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), out of 5,000-10,000 screened compounds, only 250 enter preclinical testing, five enter human clinical trials and one is approved by the FDA. The process from early discovery or design to development to regulatory approval can take more than 10 years. Drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process, and candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2014, we had two compounds (IRT-101 and IRT-103) in research and development. In 2014 our development programs focused on both compounds, one in oncology and one in Crohn&#8217;s disease; which we are expecting to move into Phase II clinical trials. 

&#160; 

The following table provides information about significant regulatory actions by, and filings pending with the FDA and regulatory authorities in the EU, as well as additional indications and new drug candidates in late-stage development.

&#160; 

The Company has incurred, and expects to continue incurring, substantial research, development and other costs in connection with compound partnering agreements. In 2015, the Company incurred cash expenses of $xxx for research and development. The Company estimates it will spend approximately $15,000,000 in cash for research and development costs in 2016. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had 5 full time employees.
