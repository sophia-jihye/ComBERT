Organization Structure and Description of Services 

WAL is a bank holding company headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware. WAL provides a full spectrum of deposit, lending, treasury management, and online banking products and services through its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, WAB.

WAB operates the following full-service banking divisions: ABA in Arizona, BON in Southern Nevada, Bridge in Northern California, FIB in Northern Nevada, and TPB in Southern California. The Company also serves business customers through a national platform of specialized financial services including AAB, Corporate Finance, Equity Fund Resources, Life Sciences Group, Mortgage Warehouse Lending, Public Finance, Renewable Energy Group, Resort Finance, and Technology Finance. In addition, the Company has one &#32;non-bank subsidiary, LVSP, which holds and manages certain non-performing loans and OREO.

&#8226; 

BW Real Estate, Inc. - operates as a real estate investment trust and holds certain real estate loans and related securities. 

&#8226; 

BW Nevada Holdings, LLC - was dissolved on June 12, 2015 after distributing its 2700 West Sahara Avenue, Las Vegas, Nevada office building to WAB. 

Market Segments 

The Company&#8217;s reportable segments are aggregated primarily based on geographic location, services offered, and markets served, primarily in the Arizona, California, and Nevada regions. As a result of the Bridge acquisition on June 30, 2015, former Bridge activities were allocated between the newly formed Northern California segment and the CBL segment. The Southern California segment represents legacy Western Alliance operations in California, excluding two branches located in northern California, which are now included in the Northern California segment. Prior period amounts have been adjusted accordingly. The Arizona, Nevada, Southern California, and Northern California segments provide full service banking and related services to their respective markets although operations may not be domiciled in these states. The Company's CBL segment provides banking services to niche markets and, as of June 30, 2015, includes the operations of Bridge. These CBLs are managed centrally and are broader in geographic scope, though still predominately within the Company's core market areas. The 

Corporate &#38; Other segment primarily relates to our Treasury division and also includes other corporate-related items, income and expense items not allocated to other reportable segments, and inter-segment eliminations. 

The accounting policies of the reported segments are the same as those of the Company as described in " Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies " in Item 8. All intercompany transactions are eliminated for reporting consolidated results of operations. Loan and deposit accounts are assigned directly to the segments where these products are originated and/or serviced. Equity capital is assigned to each segment based on the risk profile of their assets and liabilities with a funds credit provided for the use of this equity as a funding source. Any excess equity not allocated to segments based on risk is assigned to the Corporate &#38; Other segment. 

Net interest income, provision for credit losses, and non-interest expense amounts are recorded in their respective segment to the extent that the amounts are directly attributable to those segments. Net interest income of a reportable segment includes a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. Using this funds transfer pricing methodology, liquidity is transferred between users and providers. Net income amounts for each reportable segment are further derived by the use of expense allocations. Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific segment are allocated across all segments based on key metrics, such as number of employees, average loan balances, and average deposit balances. Income taxes are applied to each segment based on the effective tax rate for the geographic location of the segment. Any difference in the corporate tax rate and the aggregate effective tax rates in the segments are adjusted in the Corporate &#38; Other segment. 

Lending Activities 

Through WAB and its banking divisions and operating subsidiaries, the Company provides a variety of financial services to customers, including CRE loans, construction and land development loans, commercial loans, and consumer loans. The Company&#8217;s lending has focused primarily on meeting the needs of business customers. 

Commercial and Industrial: &#32;Commercial and industrial loans include working capital lines of credit, inventory and accounts receivable lines, mortgage warehouse lines, equipment loans and leases, and other commercial loans. Loans to technology companies, tax exempt municipalities, and not-for-profit organizations are categorized as commercial and industrial loans. 

CRE: &#32;Loans to finance the purchase or refinancing of CRE and loans to finance inventory and working capital that are additionally secured by CRE make up the majority of our loan portfolio. These CRE loans are secured by apartment buildings, professional offices, industrial facilities, retail centers and other commercial properties. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , 48% &#32;and 46% , respectively, of our CRE loans were owner-occupied. Owner-occupied CRE loans are loans secured by owner-occupied non-farm nonresidential properties for which the primary source of repayment (more than 50%) is the cash flow from the ongoing operations and activities conducted by the borrower who owns the property. Non-owner occupied CRE loans are CRE loans for which the primary source of repayment is nonaffiliated rental income associated with the collateral property. 

Construction and Land Development: &#32;Construction and land development loans include multi-family apartment projects, industrial/warehouse properties, office buildings, retail centers, and medical facilities. These loans are primarily originated to experienced local developers with whom the Company has a satisfactory lending history. An analysis of each construction project is performed as part of the underwriting process to determine whether the type of property, location, construction costs, and contingency funds are appropriate and adequate. Loans to finance commercial raw land are primarily to borrowers who plan to initiate active development of the property within two years. 

Residential real estate: &#32;In 2010, the Company discontinued residential mortgage real estate loan origination as a business line, but continues to hold a small number of previously originated (or acquired) mortgage loans. 

Consumer: &#32;Limited types of consumer loans are offered to meet customer demand and to respond to community needs. Consumer loans are generally offered at a higher rate and shorter term than residential mortgages. Examples of our consumer loans include: home equity loans and lines of credit, home improvement loans, and personal lines of credit. 

At December 31, 2015 , our loan portfolio totaled $11.14 billion , including HFS loans, or approximately 78% &#32;of total assets. The following table sets forth the composition of our HFI loan portfolio as of the periods presented:

Loans, Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses " of the Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein or "Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Financial Condition &#8211; Loans discussions" in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 

General 

The Company adheres to a specific set of credit standards within its banking subsidiary that are intended to ensure the proper management of credit risk. Furthermore, the Bank's senior management team plays an active role in monitoring compliance with such standards. 

Loan originations are subject to a process that includes the credit evaluation of borrowers, utilizing established lending limits, analysis of collateral, and procedures for continual monitoring and identification of credit deterioration. Loan officers actively monitor their individual credit relationships in order to report suspected risks and potential downgrades as early as possible. The WAB BOD approves all changes to loan policy, as well as lending limit authorities. Our lending policies generally incorporate consistent underwriting standards across all geographic regions that the Bank operates in, customized as necessary to conform to state law and local market conditions. Our credit culture has enabled us to identify troubled credits early, allowing us to take corrective action when necessary. 

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority 

Our loan approval procedures are executed through a tiered loan limit authorization process, which is structured as follows: 

&#8226; 

Individual Authorities. &#32;The CCO of each region sets the authorization levels for individual loan officers on a case-by-case basis. Generally, the more experienced a loan officer, the higher the authorization level. The maximum approval authority for any loan officer is $1.0 million. Certain members of executive management or credit administration may have higher approval authority. 

&#8226; 

Management Loan Committees. &#32;Credits in excess of individual loan limits are submitted to the appropriate region&#8217;s MLC. The MLCs consist of members of the senior management team of each region and are chaired by each region&#8217;s CCO. The MLCs have approval authority up to $7.0 million. 

&#8226; 

Credit Administration. &#32;Credits in excess of the MLC authority are submitted to the WAB SLC. The SLC has approval authority up to established house concentration limits, which range from $15.0 million to $50.0 million, depending on risk grade. SLC approval is also required for new relationships of $12.5 million or greater to borrowers within market footprint, and $5.0 million or greater outside market footprint. The SLC reviews all other loan approvals to any one borrower of $5.0 million or greater. The SLC is chaired by the WAB CCO and includes the Company&#8217;s CEO. Current policy states that over house limit exceptions require unanimous approval of the SLC. 

Loans to One Borrower. &#32;In addition to the limits set forth above, subject to certain exceptions, state banking laws generally limit the amount of funds that a bank may lend to a single borrower. Under Arizona law, the obligations of one borrower to a bank generally may not exceed 20% of the bank&#8217;s capital, plus an additional 10% of its capital if the additional amounts are fully secured by readily marketable collateral. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk. &#32;Our lending policies also establish customer and product concentration limits to control single customer and product exposures. Our lending policies have several different measures to limit concentration exposures. Set forth below are the primary segmentation limits and actual measures as of December 31, 2015 :

Asset Quality 

General 

To measure asset quality, the Company has instituted a loan grading system consisting of nine different categories. The first five are considered &#8220;satisfactory.&#8221; The other four grades range from a &#8220;special mention&#8221; category to a &#8220;loss&#8221; category and are consistent with the grading systems used by Federal banking regulators. All loans are assigned a credit risk grade at the time they are made, and each assigned loan officer reviews the credit with his or her immediate supervisor on a quarterly basis to determine whether a change in the credit risk grade is warranted. In addition, the grading of our loan portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis by our internal Loan Review Department. 

Collection Procedure 

If a borrower fails to make a scheduled payment on a loan, Bank personnel attempt to remedy the deficiency by contacting the borrower and seeking payment. Contacts generally are made within 15 business days after the payment becomes past due. The Bank maintains regional Special Assets Departments, which generally services and collects loans rated substandard or worse. Each division's CCO is responsible for monitoring activity that may indicate an increased risk rating, including, but not limited to, past-dues, overdrafts and loan agreement covenant defaults. Loans deemed uncollectible are proposed for charge-off and all charge-offs in excess of $100,000 are reported to the WAB BOD. 

Nonperforming Assets 

Nonperforming assets include loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest, non-accrual loans, TDR loans, and repossessed assets, including OREO. In general, loans are placed on non-accrual status when we determine ultimate collection of principal and interest to be in doubt due to the borrower&#8217;s financial condition, collateral value, and collection efforts. A TDR loan is a loan on which the Company, for reasons related to a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that the Company would not otherwise consider. Other repossessed assets resulted from loans where we have received title or physical possession of the borrower&#8217;s assets. The Company generally re-appraises OREO and collateral dependent impaired loans every twelve months. The net gain on sales / valuations of repossessed and other assets was $2.1 million &#32;and $5.4 million &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. Losses may be experienced in future periods. 

Criticized Assets 

Federal bank regulators require banks to classify its assets on a regular basis. In addition, in connection with their examinations of the Bank, examiners have authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, re-classify them. A loan grade six from our internal loan grading system is utilized to identify potential problem assets and loans grades seven through nine are utilized to identify actual problem assets. 

The following describes the potential and actual problem assets using our internal loan grading system definitions: 

&#8226; 

"Special Mention" (Grade 6): &#32;Generally these are assets that possess weaknesses that warrant management's close attention. These loans may involve borrowers with adverse financial trends, higher debt to equity ratios, or weaker 

liquidity positions, but not to the degree of being considered a &#8220;problem loan&#8221; where risk of loss may be apparent. Loans in this category are usually performing as agreed, although there may be non-compliance with financial covenants. 

&#8226; 

&#8220;Substandard&#8221; (Grade 7): These assets are characterized by well-defined credit weaknesses and carry the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if such weakness or deficiency is not corrected. We believe that these loans generally are adequately secured and in the event of a foreclosure action or liquidation, the Company should be protected from loss. All loans 90 days or more past due and all loans on non-accrual are considered at least &#8220;substandard,&#8221; unless extraordinary circumstances would suggest otherwise. 

&#8226; 

&#8220;Doubtful&#8221; (Grade 8): &#32;These assets have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as "substandard" with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable, but because of certain known factors which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset (for example, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral and refinancing plans), classification as an estimated loss is deferred until a more precise status may be determined. 

&#8226; 

&#8220;Loss&#8221; (Grade 9): &#32;These assets are considered uncollectible and having such little recoverable value that it is not practical to defer writing off the asset. This classification does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practicable or desirable to defer writing off the asset, even though partial recovery may be achieved in the future. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

Like other financial institutions, the Company must maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense. Loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses when management believes that collectability of the contractual principal or interest is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance is reported at an amount believed adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectable, based on evaluation of the collectability of loans and prior credit loss experience, together with the other factors. For a detailed discussion of the Company&#8217;s methodology see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis and Financial Condition &#8211; Critical Accounting Policies &#8211; Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 

Investment Activities 

Our banking subsidiary and holding company have an investment policy, which was approved by the Bank's and Company's BOD. This policy dictates that investment decisions be made based on the safety of the investment, liquidity requirements of the Bank and holding company, potential returns, cash flow targets, and consistency with our interest rate risk management. The Bank&#8217;s ALCO is responsible for making securities portfolio decisions in accordance with established policies. The CFO and Treasurer have the authority to purchase and sell securities within specified guidelines. All transactions for the Bank and for our holding company were reviewed by the ALCO and BOD. 

Generally, our investment policy limits new securities investments to the following: securities backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, including U.S. treasury bills, notes, and bonds, direct obligations of Ginnie Mae, USDA and SBA loans; MBS or CMO issued by a GSE, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac; debt securities issued by a GSE, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the FHLB; municipal securities with a rating of &#8220;Single-A&#8221; or higher; ARPS where the issuing company is rated &#8220;BBB&#8221; or higher; corporate debt with a rating of &#8220;Single-A&#8221; or better; investment grade corporate bond mutual funds; private label collateralized mortgage obligations with a single rating of &#8220;AA&#8221; or higher; commercial mortgage-backed securities with a rating of &#8220;AAA&#8221;; and mandatory purchases of equity securities of the FRB and FHLB. ARPS holdings are limited to no more than 10% of the Bank&#8217;s Common Equity Tier 1; municipal securities are limited to no more than 5% of the Bank's assets; investment grade corporate bond mutual funds are limited to no more than 5% of the Bank's Tier 1 capital; corporate debt holdings are limited to no more than 2.5% of the Bank&#8217;s assets; and commercial mortgage-backed securities are limited to an aggregate purchase limit of $50 million. 

The Company no longer purchases (although we may continue to hold previously acquired) CDOs. Our policies also govern the use of derivatives, and provide that the Company prudently use derivatives in accordance with applicable regulations as a risk management tool to reduce the overall exposure to interest rate risk, and not for speculative purposes. 

As of December 31, 2015 , all of our investment securities are classified as AFS or measured at fair value (&#8220;trading&#8221;) pursuant to ASC Topic 320, Investments &#32;and ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments . AFS securities are reported at fair value in accordance with Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had an investment securities portfolio of $1.98 billion , representing approximately 13.9% &#32;of our total assets, with the majority of the portfolio invested in AAA/AA+-rated securities. The average duration of our investment securities was 3.3 years as of December 31, 2015 .

As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , the Company had an investment in BOLI of $162.5 million &#32;and $142.0 million , respectively. The BOLI was purchased to help offset employee benefit costs. For additional information concerning investments, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Financial Condition &#8211; Investments&#8221; in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 

Deposit Products 

The Company offers a variety of deposit products, including checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, and other types of deposit accounts, including fixed-rate, fixed maturity certificates of deposit. The Company has historically focused on growing its lower cost core customer deposits. As of December 31, 2015 , the deposit portfolio was comprised of 34% &#32;non-interest bearing deposits and 66% &#32;interest-bearing deposits. 

The competition for deposits in our markets is strong. The Company has historically been successful in attracting and retaining deposits due to several factors, including: 1) our high quality of customer service; 2) our experienced relationship bankers who have strong relationships within their communities; 3) the broad selection of cash management services we offer; and 4) incentives to employees for business development and retention. The Company intends to continue its focus on attracting deposits from our business lending relationships in order to maintain our low cost of funds and improve our net interest margin. The loss of low-cost deposits could negatively impact future profitability. 

Deposit balances are generally influenced by national and local economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, internal pricing decisions, perceived stability of financial institutions and competition. The Company&#8217;s deposits are primarily obtained from communities surrounding its branch offices. In order to attract and retain deposits, we rely on providing quality service and introducing new products and services that meet the needs of our customers. 

In 2015 , the Bank's deposit rates were determined through an internal oversight process under the direction of its ALCO. The Bank considers a number of factors when determining deposit rates, including: 

&#8226; 

current and projected national and local economic conditions and the outlook for interest rates;

In addition to our deposit base, we have access to other sources of funding, including FHLB and FRB advances, repurchase agreements and unsecured lines of credit with other financial institutions. Previously, we have also accessed the capital markets through trust preferred, subordinated debt, and Senior Note offerings. For additional information concerning our deposits, see &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Balance Sheet Analysis &#8211; Deposits&#8221; in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 

Financial Products and Services 

In addition to traditional commercial banking activities, the Company offers other financial services to its customers, including: internet banking, wire transfers, electronic bill payment, lock box services, courier, and cash management services. 

Customer, Product, and Geographic Concentrations 

Approximately 49% &#32;and 54% &#32;of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively, consisted of CRE-secured loans, including CRE loans, and construction and land development loans. The Company&#8217;s business is concentrated in the Las Vegas, Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose, Phoenix, Reno, San Diego and Tucson metropolitan areas. Consequently, the Company is dependent on the trends of these regional economies. The Company is not dependent upon any single or limited number of customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the Company. No material portion of the Company&#8217;s business is seasonal. 

Foreign Operations 

The Company has no significant foreign operations. We provide loans, letters of credit, foreign exchange, and other trade-related services to commercial enterprises that conduct business outside the U.S. 

Customer Concentration 

Neither the Company nor any of its reportable segments has any customer relationships that individually account for 10% or more of consolidated or segment revenues, respectively. 

Competition 

The financial services industry is highly competitive. Many of our competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization, have greater access to capital markets, and offer a broader range of financial services than we can offer, and may have lower cost structures. 

This increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of long-term changes in regulation that made mergers and geographic expansion easier; changes in technology and product delivery systems and web-based tools; and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers. We compete for loans, deposits, and customers with other banks, credit unions, brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, and other non-bank financial services providers. This strong competition for deposit and loan products directly affects the interest rates on those products and the terms on which they are offered to consumers. 

Technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets. 

Mergers between financial institutions have placed additional pressure on banks to consolidate their operations, reduce expenses and increase revenues to remain competitive. The competitive environment is also significantly impacted by federal and state legislation that makes it easier for non-bank financial institutions to compete with the Company. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had 1,446 &#32;full-time equivalent employees. The Company&#8217;s employees are not represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Management believes that its employee relations are good. 

Recent Developments 

The capital framework under Basel III became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015. Under the Basel III final rules, minimum requirements have increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company. A new capital conservation buffer, comprised of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, is also established above the regulatory minimum capital requirements. This capital conservation buffer will be phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each subsequent year by an additional 0.625% until reaching its final level of 2.5% on January 1, 2019. Strict eligibility requirements for regulatory capital instruments have been implemented under the final rules and the final rules also revise the definitions and calculations of Tier 1 capital, total capital, and risk-weighted assets. In addition, the final rules create a new capital ratio, Common Equity Tier 1. As of December 31, 2015 , the Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.2% &#32;and the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.7% . 

On September 27, 2011, as part of the U.S. Treasury&#8217;s SBLF program, the Company sold $141.0 million of Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B, to the Secretary of the Treasury, with the proceeds used to redeem in full preferred shares previously issued by the Company in 2008 under TARP Capital Purchase Program. The initial dividend rate on the SBLF shares was 5%, subject to downward adjustment based on the Company growth in qualifying small business loans. Due to its rapid success in growing qualifying small business loans, the Company's dividend rate on the SBLF Shares was locked in at 1% (the lowest possible rate) in the first quarter of 2012. The Company redeemed 70,500 &#32;SBLF shares on December 19, 2014, at their liquidation value of $1,000 per share plus accrued dividends for a total redemption price of $70.7 million . The Company redeemed the remaining 70,500 &#32;SBLF shares on December 18, 2015, at their liquidation value of $1,000 per share plus accrued dividends for a total redemption price of $70.7 million .
