 Item 1. Business 

Overview 

Aramark (the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;) is a leading global provider of food, facilities and uniform services to education, healthcare, business &#38; industry, and sports, leisure &#38; corrections clients. Our core market is North America (composed of the United States and Canada), which is supplemented by an additional 17 -country footprint. We hold the #2 position in North America in food and facilities services as well as uniform services based on total sales in fiscal 2016 . Internationally, we hold a top 3 &#32;position in food and facilities services based on total sales in fiscal 2016 &#32;in most countries in which we have significant operations, and are one of only 3 &#32;food and facilities competitors with our combination of scale, scope, and global reach. Through our established brand, broad geographic presence and approximately 266,500 &#32;employees, we anchor our business in our partnerships with thousands of education, healthcare, business and sports, leisure &#38; corrections clients. Through these partnerships we serve millions of consumers including students, patients, employees, sports fans and guests worldwide. 

We operate our business in three reportable segments that share many of the same operating characteristics: Food and Support Services North America ("FSS North America"), Food and Support Services International ("FSS International") and Uniform and Career Apparel ("Uniform"). Both FSS North America and Uniform have significant scale and hold the # 2 &#32;position in North America, while in our FSS International segment we hold a top 3 &#32;position in most countries in which we have significant operations based on fiscal 2016 &#32;total sales. The following chart shows a breakdown of our sales and operating income by our reportable segments:

Our History 

Since our founding in 1959, we have broadened our service offerings and expanded our client base through a combination of organic growth and successful acquisitions, with the goal of further developing our food, facilities and uniform capabilities, as well as growing our international presence. In 1984, we completed a management buyout, after which our management and employees increased their Company ownership to approximately 90% of our equity capital leading up to our December 2001 public offering. On January 26, 2007, we delisted from the NYSE in conjunction with a going-private transaction executed with investment funds affiliated with Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, CCMP Capital Advisors, J.P. Morgan Partners, Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. and Warburg Pincus LLC as well as approximately 250 senior management personnel. 

On December 17, 2013, we completed an initial public offering of 41,687,500 shares of our common stock, including 13,687,500 shares of common stock sold by our selling stockholders. We did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares sold by the selling stockholders and we used our proceeds from the initial public offering, net of costs, to pay down debt. Our common stock began trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol &#8220;ARMK&#8221; on December 12, 2013. 

Food and Support Services 

Our Food and Support Services segments manage a number of interrelated services-including food, hospitality and facility services-for school districts, colleges &#38; universities, healthcare facilities, businesses, sports, entertainment &#38; recreational venues, conference &#38; convention centers, national &#38; state parks and correctional institutions. 

We are the exclusive provider of food and beverage services at most of the locations we serve and are responsible for hiring, training and supervising the majority of the food service personnel in addition to ordering, receiving, preparing and serving food and beverage items sold at those facilities. Our facilities services capabilities are broad, and include plant operations and maintenance, custodial/housekeeping, energy management, clinical equipment maintenance, grounds keeping, and capital project management. In governmental, business, educational and healthcare facilities (for example, offices and industrial plants, schools and universities and hospitals), our clients provide us with a captive client base through their on-site employees, students and patients. At sports, entertainment and recreational facilities, our clients attract patrons to their site, usually for specific events such as sporting events and conventions. 

We manage our FSS business in two geographic reportable segments split between our North America and International operations. In fiscal 2016 , our FSS North America segment generated $10,122.3 million &#32;in sales, or 70% &#32;of our total sales, and our FSS International segment generated $2,729.8 million &#32;in sales, or 19% &#32;of our total sales. No individual client represents more than 1% &#32;of our total sales, other than, collectively, a number of U.S. government agencies. See Note 15 to the audited consolidated financial statements for information on sales, operating income and total assets for the FSS North America segment and the FSS International segment.

Education. &#32;Within the Education sector we serve Higher Education and K-12 clients. We deliver a wide range of food and facility services at more than 1,500 &#32;colleges, universities, school systems &#38; districts and private schools. We offer our education clients a single source provider for managed service solutions, including dining, catering, food service management, convenience-oriented retail operations, grounds &#38; facilities maintenance, custodial, energy management, construction management, and capital project management. 

Healthcare. &#32;We provide a wide range of non-clinical support services to approximately 1,200 &#32;healthcare clients and more than 2,000 &#32;facilities across our global footprint. We offer healthcare organizations a single source provider for managed service solutions, which include food services such as patient food and nutrition services and retail food services, and facilities services such as clinical equipment maintenance, environmental services, laundry &#38; linen distribution, plant operations, energy management, strategic/technical services, supply chain management, purchasing and central transportation. 

Business &#38; Industry . We provide a comprehensive range of business dining services, including on-site restaurants, catering, convenience stores and executive dining. 

We also provide beverage and vending services to business &#38; industry clients at thousands of locations. Our service and product offerings include a full range of coffee offerings, &#8220;grab and go&#8221; food operations, convenience stores, micromarkets and a proprietary drinking water filtration system. 

We also offer a variety of facility management services to business &#38; industry clients. These services include the management of housekeeping, plant operations and maintenance, energy management, laundry and linen, groundskeeping, landscaping, transportation, capital program management and commissioning services and other facility consulting services relating to building operations. 

We also offer remote services which include facility and business support services primarily for mining and oil operations.

We serve 146 &#32;professional (including minor league affiliates) and college sports teams, including 39 &#32;teams in Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the National Football League and the National Hockey League. We also serve 22 &#32;convention and civic centers, 19 &#32;national and state parks and other resort operations, plus other popular tourist attractions in the United States and Canada. Additionally, we provide correctional food services, operate commissaries, laundry facilities and property rooms and provide food and facilities management services for parks. 

Our FSS International segment provides a similar range of services as those provided to our FSS North America segment clients and operates in all of our sectors. We have operations in 17 &#32;countries outside the United States and Canada. Our largest international operations are in Chile, China, Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom, and in each of these countries we are one of the leading food and/or facilities service providers. We also have a strong presence in Japan through our 50% ownership of AIM Services Co., Ltd., which is a leader in providing outsourced food services in Japan. In addition to the core Business &#38; Industry sector, our FSS International segment serves many soccer stadiums across Europe, and numerous educational institutions, correctional institutions and convention centers globally. There are particular risks attendant with our international operations. Please see Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Purchasing 

We negotiate the pricing and other terms for the majority of our purchases of food and related products in the United States and Canada directly with national manufacturers. We purchase these products and other items through Sysco Corporation and other distributors. We have a master distribution agreement with Sysco that covers a significant amount of our purchases of these products and items in the United States and another distribution agreement with Sysco that covers our purchases of these products in Canada. Our distributors are responsible for tracking our orders and delivering products to our specific locations. Due to our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our suppliers, we earn vendor consideration, including discounts, rebates and other applicable credits. See &#8220;Types of Contracts&#8221; below. Our location managers also purchase a number of items, including bread, dairy products and alcoholic beverages from local suppliers, and we purchase certain items directly from manufacturers. 

Our relationship with Sysco is important to our operations&#8212;we have had distribution agreements in place for more than 20 years. In fiscal 2016 , Sysco distributed approximately 52% &#32;of our food and non-food products in the United States and Canada, and we believe that we are one of their largest clients. However, we believe that the products acquired through Sysco can, in significant cases, be purchased through other sources and that termination of our relationship with them or any disruption of their business would cause only short-term disruptions to our operations. 

Our agreements with our distributors are generally for an indefinite term, subject to termination by either party after a notice period, which is generally 60 to 120 days. The pricing and other financial terms of these agreements are renegotiated periodically. Our current agreement with Sysco is terminable by either party with 180 days notice. 

In our international segment, our approach to purchasing is substantially similar. On a country-by-country basis, we negotiate pricing and other terms for a majority of our purchases of food and related products with manufacturers operating in the applicable country, and we purchase these products and other items through distributors in that country. Due to our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our suppliers, we receive vendor consideration, including rebates, allowances and volume discounts. See &#8220;Types of Contracts&#8221; below. As in North America, our location managers also purchase a number of items, including bread, dairy products and alcoholic beverages from local suppliers, and we purchase certain items directly from manufacturers. Our agreements with our distributors are subject to termination by either party after a notice period, which is generally 60 days. The pricing and other financial terms of these agreements are renegotiated periodically. 

Our relationship with distributors in the countries outside the United States and Canada is important to our operations, but from an overall volume standpoint, no distributor outside the United States and Canada distributes a significant volume of products. We believe that products we acquire from our distributors in countries outside the United States and Canada can, in significant 

cases, be purchased from other sources, and that the termination of our relationships with our distributors outside the United States and Canada, or the disruption of their business operations, would cause only short-term disruption to our operations. 

Sales and Marketing 

We maintain selling and marketing excellence by focusing on the execution of a common selling process as well as optimal resource allocation and deployment. Our common selling process ensures that we sell our services to our clients in the same way, regardless of the sector in which such client is located. We have developed consistent tools and training that are used across all of our businesses to train our employees on this selling process. Our business development functions are aligned directly with the sectors and services in which we have leadership positions, and we combine our targeted business development strategies with our strong client relationships to deliver differentiated and innovative solutions. We target our business development by aligning our sales efforts directly with the sectors and services in which we operate. We identify individuals at various levels in our organization to match up with individuals in a variety of roles at both existing and potential clients. We believe that these connections throughout various levels within the client organization allow us to develop strong relationships with the client and gain a better understanding of the clients' requirements. Based on the knowledge of the clients' requirements and the sector, our goal is to develop solutions for the client that are unique and that help to differentiate us from our competitors. 

Types of Contracts 

We use contracts that allow us to manage our potential upside and downside risk in connection with our various business interactions. Our contracts may require that consent be obtained in order to raise prices on the food, beverages and merchandise we sell within a particular facility. The contracts that we enter into vary in length. Contracts generally are for fixed terms, many of which are in excess of one year. Contracts for education and sports and leisure services typically require larger capital investments, but have correspondingly longer and fixed terms, usually from five to fifteen years. 

When we enter into new contracts, or extend or renew existing contracts, particularly those for stadiums, arenas, convention centers, colleges and universities and business dining accounts, we are sometimes contractually required to make some form of up-front or future capital investment to help finance improvement or renovation, typically to the food and beverage facilities of the venue from which we operate. Contractually required capital expenditures typically take the form of investment in leasehold improvements, food service equipment and/or grants to clients. At the end of the contract term or upon its earlier termination, assets such as equipment and leasehold improvements typically become the property of the client, but generally the client must reimburse us for any undepreciated or unamortized capital investments. 

Food and Support Services contracts are generally obtained and renewed either through a competitive process or on a negotiated basis, although contracts in the public sector are frequently awarded on a competitive bid basis, as required by applicable law. Contracts for Food and Support Services with school districts and correctional clients are typically awarded through a formal bid process. Contracts in the private sector may be entered into without a formal bid process, but we and other companies will often compete in the process leading up to the award or the completion of contract negotiations. Typically, after the award, final contract terms are negotiated and agreed upon. 

We use two general contract types in our Food and Support Services segments: profit and loss contracts and client interest contracts. These contracts differ in their provision for the amount of financial risk that we bear and, accordingly, the potential compensation, profits or fees we may receive. Commission rates and management fees, if any, may vary significantly among contracts based upon various factors, including the type of facility involved, the term of the contract, the services we provide and the amount of capital we invest. 

Profit and Loss Contracts. &#32;Under profit and loss contracts, we receive all of the revenue from, and bear all of the expenses of, the provision of our services at a client location. Expenses under profit and loss contracts sometimes include commissions paid to the client, typically calculated as a fixed or variable percentage of various categories of sales, and, in some cases, require minimum guaranteed commissions. We benefit from greater upside potential with a profit and loss contract, although we do consequently bear greater downside risk than with a client interest contract. For fiscal &#32; 2016 , approximately 70% &#32;of our Food and Support Services sales were derived from profit and loss contracts. 

Client Interest Contracts. &#32;Client interest contracts include management fee contracts, under which our clients reimburse our operating costs and pay us a management fee, which may be calculated as a fixed dollar amount or a percentage of sales or operating costs. Some management fee contracts entitle us to receive incentive fees based upon our performance under the contract, as measured by factors such as sales, operating costs and client satisfaction surveys. Client interest contracts also include limited profit and loss contracts, under which we receive a percentage of any profits earned from the provision of our services at the facility and we generally receive no payments if there are losses. As discussed above under &#8220;Purchasing,&#8221; we earn vendor consideration, including discounts, rebates and other applicable credits that we typically retain except in those cases where the contract and/or applicable law requires us to credit these to our clients. For our client interest contracts, both 

our upside potential and downside risk are reduced compared to our profit and loss contracts. For fiscal &#32; 2016 , approximately 30% &#32;of our Food and Support Services sales were derived from client interest contracts. 

Competition 

There is significant competition in the Food and Support Services business from local, regional, national and international companies, as well as from the businesses, healthcare institutions, colleges and universities, correctional facilities, school districts and public assembly facilities that decide to provide these services themselves. Institutions may decide to operate their own services or outsource to one of our competitors following the expiration or termination of contracts with us. Clients do not necessarily choose the lowest cost provider, and tend to place a premium on the total value proposition offered. In our FSS North America segment, our external competitors include other multi-regional food and support service providers, such as Centerplate, Inc., Compass Group plc, Delaware North Companies Inc. and Sodexo SA. Internationally, our external food service and support service competitors include Compass Group plc, Elior SA, International Service System A/S and Sodexo SA. We also face competition from many regional and local service providers. 

We believe that the following competitive factors are the principal drivers of our success: 

&#8226; 

quality and breadth of services and management talent; 

&#8226; 

innovation; 

&#8226; 

reputation within the industry; 

&#8226; 

pricing; and 

&#8226; 

financial strength and stability. 

Seasonality 

Our sales and operating results have varied, and we expect them to continue to vary, from quarter to quarter as a result of different factors. Within our FSS North America segment, historically there has been a lower level of activity during our first and second fiscal quarters in operations that provide services to sports and leisure clients. This lower level of activity historically has been partially offset during our first and second fiscal quarters by the increased activity in our educational operations. Conversely, historically there has been a significant increase in the provision of services to sports and leisure clients during our third and fourth fiscal quarters, which is partially offset by the effect of summer recess at colleges, universities and schools. 

Uniform 

Our Uniform segment provides uniforms and other garments and work clothes and ancillary items such as mats and shop towels in the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada and through a joint venture in Japan. We hold the # 2 &#32;position in the North America uniform services market. We operate over 2,600 &#32;routes, giving us a broad reach to service our clients' needs. 

Clients use our uniforms to meet a variety of needs, including: 

&#8226; 

establishing corporate identity and brand awareness; 

&#8226; 

projecting a professional image: 

&#8226; 

protecting workers&#8212;work clothes can help protect workers from difficult environments such as heavy soils, heat, flame or chemicals; and 

&#8226; 

protecting products&#8212;uniforms can help protect products against contamination in the food, pharmaceutical, electronics, health care and automotive industries. 

We provide a full service employee uniform solution, including design, sourcing and manufacturing, delivery, cleaning and maintenance. We rent uniforms, work clothing, outerwear, particulate-free garments and non-garment items and related services, including industrial towels, floor mats, mops, linen products, and paper products to businesses in a wide range of industries, including manufacturing, food services, automotive, healthcare, construction, utilities, repair and maintenance services, restaurant and hospitality. In fiscal &#32; 2016 , our Uniform segment generated $1,563.7 million &#32;in sales, or 11% &#32;of our total sales. See Note 15 to the audited consolidated financial statements for information on sales, operating income and total assets for the Uniform segment. 

Clients and Services 

We serve businesses of all sizes in many different industries. We have a diverse client base from over 200 &#32;service location and distribution centers across the United States and a service center in Ontario, Canada. None of our clients individually represents 

a material portion of our sales. We typically visit our clients' sites weekly, delivering clean, finished uniforms and, at the same time, removing the soiled uniforms or other items for cleaning, repair or replacement. We also offer products for direct sale. 

Our cleanroom service offers advanced static dissipative garments, barrier apparel, sterile garments and cleanroom application accessories for clients with contamination-free operations in the technology, healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. 

We conduct our direct marketing business through three primary brands - WearGuard, Crest and Aramark. We design, source or manufacture and distribute distinctive image apparel to workers in a wide variety of industries through the internet at www.shoparamark.com, dedicated sales representatives and telemarketing sales channels. We customize and embroider personalized uniforms and logos for clients through an extensive computer assisted design center and distribute work clothing, outerwear, business casual apparel and footwear throughout the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada. 

Operations 

We operate our uniform rental business as a network of 85 &#32;laundry plants and 172 &#32;satellite plants and depots supporting over 2,600 &#32;pick-up and delivery routes. We operate a fleet of service vehicles that pick up and deliver uniforms for cleaning and maintenance. We conduct our direct marketing activities principally from our facilities in Salem, Virginia; Norwell and Rockland, Massachusetts; and Reno, Nevada. We market our own brands of apparel and offer a variety of customized personalization options such as embroidery and logos. We also source uniforms and other products to our specifications from a number of domestic and international suppliers and also manufacture a significant portion of our uniform requirements. We purchase uniform and textile products as well as equipment and supplies from domestic and international suppliers. The loss of any one supplier would not have a significant impact on us. We also operate two &#32;cutting and sewing plants in Mexico, which satisfy a substantial amount of our standard uniform inventory needs. 

Sales and Marketing 

Our sales representatives and route sales drivers are responsible for selling our services to current and potential clients and developing new accounts through the use of an extensive, proprietary database of pre-screened and qualified business prospects. We build our brand identity through local advertising, promotional initiatives and through our distinctive service vehicles. Our clients frequently come to us through client referrals, either from our uniform rental business or from our other service sectors. Our customer service representatives generally interact on a weekly basis with their clients, while our support personnel are charged with expeditiously handling client requirements regarding the outfitting of new client employees and other customer service needs. 

Types of Contracts 

We typically serve our rental clients under written service contracts for an initial term of three to five years. While clients are not required to make an up-front investment for their uniforms, in the case of nonstandard uniforms and certain specialty programs, clients typically agree to reimburse us for our costs if they terminate their agreement early. With the exception of certain governmental bid business, most of our direct marketing business is conducted under invoice arrangement with repeat clients. 

Competition 

Although the United States rental industry has experienced some consolidation, there is significant competition in all the areas that we serve, and such competition varies across geographies. Although many competitors are smaller local and regional firms, we also face competition from other large national firms such as Cintas Corporation, G&#38;K Services, Inc. and UniFirst Corporation. We believe that the primary competitive factors that affect our operations are quality, service, design, consistency of product, and distribution capability, particularly for large multi-location clients, and price. We believe that our ability to compete effectively is enhanced by the quality and breadth of our product line as well as our nationwide reach. 

Employees of Aramark 

As of September 30, 2016 , we had a total of approximately 266,500 &#32;employees, including seasonal employees, consisting of approximately 168,000 &#32;full-time and approximately 98,500 &#32;part-time employees in our three business segments. The number of part-time employees varies significantly from time to time during the year due to seasonal and other operating requirements. We generally experience our highest level of employment during the fourth fiscal quarter. The approximate number of employees by segment is as follows: FSS North America: 164,000 ; FSS International: 88,500 ; Uniform: 13,500 . In addition, the Aramark corporate staff is approximately 500 &#32;employees. Approximately 40,000 &#32;employees in the United States are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any material interruptions of operations due to disputes with our employees and consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. 

Governmental Regulation 

Our business is subject to various federal, state, local and international laws and regulations, in areas such as environmental, labor, employment, immigration, health and safety laws and liquor licensing and dram shop matters. In addition, our facilities and products are subject to periodic inspection by federal, state, local and international authorities. We have established, and periodically update, various internal controls and procedures designed to maintain compliance with these laws and regulations. Our compliance programs are subject to legislative changes, or changes in regulatory interpretation, implementation or enforcement. From time to time both federal and state government agencies have conducted audits of certain of our practices as part of routine investigations of providers of services under government contracts, or otherwise. Like others in our business, we receive requests for information from governmental agencies in connection with these audits. If we fail to comply with applicable laws, we may be subject to investigations, criminal sanctions or civil remedies, including fines, penalties, damages, reimbursement, injunctions, seizures, disgorgements, debarments from government contracts or loss of liquor licenses. 

Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, those governing: 

&#8226; 

alcohol licensing and service; 

&#8226; 

collection of sales and other taxes; 

&#8226; 

minimum wage, overtime, classification, wage payment and employment discrimination; 

&#8226; 

immigration; 

&#8226; 

governmentally funded entitlement programs and cost and accounting principles; 

&#8226; 

false claims, whistleblowers and consumer protection; 

&#8226; 

environmental protection; 

&#8226; 

food safety, sanitation, labeling and human health and safety; 

&#8226; 

customs and import and export controls; 

&#8226; 

the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws; 

&#8226; 

antitrust, competition, procurement and lobbying; 

&#8226; 

minority, women and disadvantaged business enterprise statutes; 

&#8226; 

motor carrier safety; and 

&#8226; 

privacy and data security. 

The laws and regulations relating to each of our food and support services segments are numerous and complex. There are a variety of laws and regulations at various governmental levels relating to the handling, preparation and serving of food, including in some cases requirements relating to the temperature of food, the cleanliness of food production facilities, and the hygiene of food-handling personnel, which are enforced primarily at the local public health department level. While we attempt to comply with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we are in full compliance at all times with all of the applicable laws and regulations or that we will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations. Furthermore, legislation and regulatory attention to food safety is very high. Additional or amended regulations in this area may significantly increase the cost of compliance or expose us to liability. 

In addition, various government agencies impose nutritional guidelines and other requirements on us at certain of the healthcare, education and corrections facilities we serve. We may also be subject to laws and regulations that limit or restrict the use of trans fats in the food we serve or other requirements relating to ingredient or nutrient labeling. There can be no assurance that legislation, or changes in regulatory implementation or interpretation of government regulations, would not limit our activities in the future or significantly increase the cost of regulatory compliance. 

Because we serve alcoholic beverages at many sports, entertainment and recreational facilities, including convention centers and national and state parks, we also hold liquor licenses incidental to our food service operations and are subject to the liquor license requirements of the jurisdictions in which we hold a liquor license. As of September 30, 2016 , our subsidiaries held liquor licenses in 45 &#32;states and the District of Columbia, four &#32;Canadian provinces and certain other countries. Typically, liquor licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of our operations, including minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, and storage, dispensing and service of alcoholic beverages. We have not encountered any material problems relating to liquor licenses to date. The failure to receive or retain a liquor license in a particular location could adversely affect our ability to obtain such a license elsewhere. Some of our contracts require us to pay liquidated damages during any period in which the liquor license for the facility is suspended as a result of our 

actions, and most contracts are subject to termination if the liquor license for the facility is lost as a result of our actions. Our service of alcoholic beverages is also subject to alcoholic beverage service laws, commonly called dram shop statutes. Dram shop statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as minors or visibly intoxicated persons. If we violate dram shop laws, we may be liable to the patron and/or to third parties for the acts of the visibly intoxicated patron. We sponsor regular training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation and to take advantage of certain safe harbors and affirmative defenses enacted for the benefit of alcoholic beverage service providers. However, we cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor patrons will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us. 

Our uniform rental business and our food and support service business are subject to various environmental protection laws and regulations, including the U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and similar local, state, federal and international laws and regulations governing the use, management, shipping and disposal of chemicals and hazardous materials. In particular, industrial laundries use certain detergents and cleaning chemicals to launder garments and other merchandise. The residues from such detergents and chemicals and residues from soiled garments and other merchandise laundered at our facilities may result in potential discharges to air and to water (through sanitary sewer systems and publicly owned treatment works) and may be contained in waste generated by our wastewater treatment systems. Our industrial laundries are subject to certain volume and chemical air and water pollution discharge limits, monitoring, permitting and recordkeeping requirements. We own or operate aboveground and underground storage tank systems at some locations to store petroleum products for use in our or our clients' operations. Certain of these storage tank systems also are subject to performance standards, periodic monitoring and recordkeeping requirements. We also may use and manage chemicals and hazardous materials in our operations from time to time. We are mindful of the environmental concerns surrounding the use, management, shipping and disposal of these chemicals and hazardous materials, and have taken and continue to take measures to comply with environmental protection laws and regulations. Given the regulated nature of some of our operations, we could face penalties and fines for non-compliance. In the past, we have settled, or contributed to the settlement of, actions or claims relating to the management of underground storage tanks and the handling and disposal of chemicals or hazardous materials, either on or off-site. We may, in the future, be required to expend material amounts to rectify the consequences of any such events. Under environmental laws, we may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous materials located on or in or migrating from our owned or leased property or our clients' properties, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage. Such laws may impose liability without regard to our fault, knowledge or responsibility for the presence of such hazardous substances. We may not know whether our clients' properties or our acquired or leased properties have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations or that our future uses or conditions will not result in the imposition of liability upon us under such laws or expose us to third-party actions such as tort suits. 

We do not anticipate any capital expenditures for environmental remediation that would have a material effect on our financial condition.
