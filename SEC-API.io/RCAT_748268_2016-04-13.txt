 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

GENERAL

EnergyTEK Corp. (the "Company") was originally incorporated in the State of Colorado on February 16, 1984 under the name of Oravest Interests, Inc. On March 14, 2002, after several prior name changes, we changed our name to Broadleaf Capital Partners, Inc. On April 10, 2002 we effectuated a merger with Broadleaf Capital Partners, Inc., a Nevada corporation (which had been formed on March 19, 2001) and as a result re-domiciled to the State of Nevada. On July 23, 2014 we changed our name to EnergyTEK Corp.

On March 31, 2014 we closed a transaction whereby we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Texas Gulf Oil &#38; Gas, Inc., a Nevada corporation ("TGOG"). These assets and liabilities became were contributed to our then new-formed wholly owned subsidiary Texas Gulf Exploration &#38; Production, Inc. In connection therewith, we issued 900 shares of the Company's Series A Preferred Stock to TGOG. Later, on May 21, 2014, the Company and TGOG closed a transaction whereby the 900 shares of Series A Preferred Stock were exchanged for 900 shares of Series C Preferred Stock.

On March 31, 2014, we closed a transaction whereby we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Litigation Capital, Inc., a Nevada corporation ("LCI"). These assets and liabilities became were contributed to our then new-formed wholly owned subsidiary Legal Capital Corp. In connection therewith we issued 300,000 shares of the Company's Series B Preferred Stock to LCI.

Also on March 31, 2014, we closed a transaction whereby we rescinded an agreement dated November whereby we acquired all of the capital stock of Sustained Release, Inc.

On July 23, 2014, we effectuated a 1-for-150 reverse split of the Company's common stock.

On January 6, 2015, we closed a transaction whereby we entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with Wagley Offshore-Onshore, Inc. to pursue a distressed energy asset acquisition program to take advantage of the reduction in value of these assets due to the historically low price of crude oil. The joint venture was formed as Wagley-EnergyTEK J.V. LLC, a Texas limited liability company. Pursuant to this transaction we issued 20,000,000 restricted shares of our common stock to be used to acquire such distressed energy assets.

&#160;

DESCRIPTION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

The Company conducts its business through its two wholly owned subsidiaries Texas Gulf Exploration and Production, Inc. ("TGEP") and Legal Capital Corp. ("LCC") as well as through the joint venture named Wagley-EnergyTEK J.V. LLC (the "Wagley JV").

&#160;

Due to the tremendous drop in oil prices over the last six months, the Company has developed a new plan to take advantage of the opportunity of the crisis in energy market conditions. The Company intends to become a licensed operator of wells for both its own portfolio and other entities, via our wholly owned subsidiary, TGEP. We will do turnarounds of troubled production assets for banks and investment groups in underperforming oil &#38; gas properties, using state of the art technology to improve economic operating costs and performance on wells acquired or under management. The Company intends to negotiate an equity interest as well as recovery of all operating costs in return for assuming the plugging and abandonment liability mandated by the Texas Railroad Commission for leases that the Company takes over as the operator or records for these groups of non-operating owners. We will seek to negotiate joint ventures, whereby the Company would retain a 25% working interest in each oil &#38; gas property and the investors or bankers would retain a 75% working interest. Outside of these individual lease joint ventures, the Company is seeking additional investment capital to acquire troubled assets for its own account.

Additionally, we have recently entered into the joint venture with Wagley Offshore-Onshore, Inc., the Wagley JV, which has been capitalized with 20 million shares of the Company's common stock. The mission of the Wagley JV is to acquire distressed energy assets in exchange for shares of such common stock. Our target is smaller, independent producers who cannot find a traditional cash buyer for their leases, equipment or production in the current liquidity-short energy market environment. The inherent risks to the success of the Wagley JV are competitors who have cash to buy the distressed energy assets, the limited liquidity of the Company's common stock which the sellers of the assets would receive in exchange for the assets and the dilution of the Company's current shareholders in purchasing the energy-related assets that may lose much or all of their value.

&#160;

&#160;

The business model of LCC is a development stage litigation finance company, whose predecessor entity, Litigation Capital, Inc., was founded by veteran trial attorneys Wes Christian and Alan Pollack, and their associate Robert Hackney, who is the President of LCC. They have successfully represented Plaintiffs on a contingency basis with legitimate claims against major defendants, such as Goldman Sachs, Depository Trust Corporation and others, including major banks and mortgage lenders. Their current focus is on the naked shorting of publicly traded securities, and have already settled three of these major cases. Additional research is also being done today on behalf of entities damaged by LIBOR rate manipulation and other cases with significant damage multi-million dollar damage models. These cases are time consuming and expensive, and the defendants are well funded major companies who fight mightily to avoid paying damages for their bad acts. LCC believes that many major cases of this type with merit as to their multi-million dollar claims are going unheard due to the lack of financing available. LCC has been founded to develop funding sources to allow professionals to take on more of these cases.

&#160;

The Company's goal is to provide a unique and much needed service in what LCC believes to be an untapped, growing market by providing access to capital for prejudgment lawsuit funding, particularly commercial claims in the securities and consumer fraud areas. Financing by LCC will be made only to attorneys, and not directly to plaintiffs. In addition, initially such financing will only be made on cases pending in either state courts or federal courts in Florida, with expansion to become a national litigation financing provider being the ultimate goal.

&#160;

To date, LCC has found limited funding for its startup. However, there is no assurance that LCC, on its own or through the efforts of its parent, EnergyTEK, will be able to secure additional funding to permit LCC to pursue its business plan.

&#160;

COMPETITION

&#160;

The business operations of TGEP and the Wagley JV are subject to intense competition. A large number of companies and individuals engage in the exploration for and production of oil and gas and there is competition for the most desirable leases. The competition includes major entities such as Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Chevron Corporation and Conoco Phillips. In addition, there are a number of small independent oil and gas exploration and/or production companies in the region in which TGEP and the Wagley JV currently or intend to focus their operations. All of the major oil and gas companies and a large percentage of the independent companies have larger operations and financing to support their operations, which puts the Company's operations at a disadvantage. 

&#160;

The competition faced by LCC is not nearly as extensive nor widespread, but there are larger, more established companies in the litigation finance business, such as Longford Capital, Lake Whillans, Pravati Capital and LawCash. The risks faced by LCC's business model include inadequate capital and a lack of experience when compared these other firms. Additionally, LCC faces risk in financing litigation that does not have a favorable outcome and, thus, incurs significant losses related to such case, which would have had significant impact on LCC due to its inadequate capital.
