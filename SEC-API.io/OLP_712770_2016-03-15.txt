 Item 1. Business. 

General 

We are a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, also known as a REIT. We were incorporated in Maryland on December 20, 1982. We acquire, own and manage a geographically diversified portfolio, consisting primarily of retail, industrial, flex and health and fitness properties, many of which are under long-term leases. Many of our leases are "net leases" and ground leases under which the tenant is typically responsible for real estate taxes, insurance and ordinary maintenance and repairs. As of December 31, 2015, we own 107 properties (excluding a portfolio of eight properties disposed of in February 2016) and participate in joint ventures that own five properties. These properties and the properties owned by our joint ventures are located in 30 states and have an aggregate of approximately 8.2 million square feet (including an aggregate of approximately 967,000 square feet at properties owned by our joint ventures). 

As of December 31, 2015: 

&#149; our 2016 contractual rental income (as described below) is $57.3 million. &#149; the occupancy rate of our properties is 98.4% based on square footage. &#149; the occupancy rate of properties owned by our joint ventures is 97.6% based on square footage. &#149; the weighted average remaining term of our mortgage debt is 9.1 years and the weighted average interest rate thereon is 4.71%. &#149; the weighted average remaining term of the leases generating our 2016 contractual rental income and for the leases at properties owned by our joint ventures is 8.1 years and 3.6 years, respectively. Our 2016 contractual rental income represents, after giving effect to any abatements, concessions or adjustments, the base rent payable to us in 2016 under leases in effect at December 31, 2015. Contractual rental income for 2016: (i) includes $452,000 of base rent payable in 2016 by Sports Authority located in Greenwood Village, Colorado , which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on March 2, 2016; and (ii) excludes approximately $1.2 million of straight-line rent, amortization of approximately $651,000 of intangibles, the base rent payable with respect to a portfolio of eight retail properties we sold in February 2016, and our share of the base rent payable to our joint ventures, which in 2016 is approximately $2.7 million. 

2015 Highlights and Recent Developments 

In 2015: 

&#149; our rental income, net, increased by $2.3 million, or 4.1%, from 2014. &#149; we acquired seven properties (including our partner's interest in an unconsolidated joint venture) for an aggregate purchase price of $73.5 million, including new mortgage debt of $26.9 million. The acquired properties account for $6.7 million, or 11.8%, of our 2016 contractual rental income. &#149; we acquired, through an unconsolidated joint venture in which we have a 50% equity interest, a retail center located in Manahawkin, New Jersey for $43.5 million, inclusive of $26.1 million of new mortgage debt bearing an annual interest rate of 4% and maturing in 2025. &#149; we sold a retail center in Cherry Hill, NJ for $16.0 million, net of closing costs, resulting in a gain of $5.4 million, before giving effect to a swap termination fee of $472,000 and the write-off 2 

of $249,000 of the remaining deferred financing costs. The non-controlling interest's share of income from the transaction is $1.3 million. 

&#149; we obtained (i) an aggregate of $42.2 million from mortgage financings secured by properties acquired in 2015 and 2014 and (ii) $29.2 million of net proceeds from financings and refinancings of mortgage debt secured by properties acquired prior to 2014. &#149; we increased our quarterly dividend 5.1% to $0.41 per share, commencing with the dividend declared in December 2015. &#149; we raised $6.5 million from the issuance of 295,000 shares of common stock pursuant to our at-the-market equity offering program. On February 1, 2016, we sold a portfolio of eight retail properties located in Louisiana and Mississippi with an aggregate of 25,197 square feet for $13.8 million and paid off the $7.8 million mortgage. In the quarter ending March 31, 2016, we anticipate recognizing a $785,000 gain on this sale and incurring a mortgage prepayment expense of $380,000. In 2015, this portfolio accounted for 2.3% of rental income and 3.1% of mortgage interest expense. 

In the narrative portion of this Annual Report on Form 10-K: 

&#149; the information with respect to our consolidated joint ventures is generally described as if such ventures are our wholly owned subsidiaries and information with respect to unconsolidated joint ventures is generally separately described, &#149; except as otherwise indicated, all references to joint ventures refer to unconsolidated joint ventures, &#149; except as otherwise indicated, all interest rates with respect to mortgage debt give effect to the related interest rate derivative, if any, &#149; 2016 contractual rental income derived from multiple properties leased pursuant to a master lease is allocated among such properties based on management's estimate of the appropriate allocations, and &#149; the rental, operating, mortgage and statistical information, except as otherwise indicated herein, excludes the portfolio of eight retail properties sold in February 2016. Acquisition Strategies 

We seek to acquire properties throughout the United States that have locations, demographics and other investment attributes that we believe to be attractive. We believe that long-term leases provide a predictable income stream over the term of the lease, making fluctuations in market rental rates and in real estate values less significant to achieving our overall investment objectives. Our primary goal is to acquire single-tenant properties that are subject to long-term net or ground leases that include periodic contractual rental increases or rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index. Periodic contractual rental increases provide reliable increases in future rent payments and rent increases based on the consumer price index provide protection against inflation. Historically, long-term leases have made it easier for us to obtain longer-term, fixed-rate mortgage financing with principal amortization, thereby moderating the interest rate risk associated with financing or refinancing our property portfolio by reducing the outstanding principal balance over time. We may, however, acquire a property that is subject to a short-term lease when we believe the property represents a good opportunity for recurring income and residual value. Although the acquisition of single-tenant properties subject to net and ground leases is the focus of our investment strategy, we also consider investments in, among other things, (i) properties that can be re-positioned or re-developed, (ii) community shopping centers anchored by national or regional tenants and (iii) properties ground leased to operators of multi-family 

properties. We pay substantially all the operating expenses at community shopping centers, a significant portion of which is reimbursed by tenants pursuant to their leases. 

Generally, we hold the properties we acquire for an extended period of time. Our investment criteria are intended to identify properties from which increased asset value and overall return can be realized from an extended period of ownership. Although our investment criteria favor an extended period of ownership, we will dispose of a property if we regard the disposition of the property as an opportunity to realize the overall value of the property sooner or to avoid future risks by achieving a determinable return from the property. 

We identify properties through the network of contacts of our senior management and our affiliates, which includes real estate brokers, private equity firms, banks and law firms. In addition, we attend industry conferences and engage in direct solicitations. 

Our charter documents do not limit the number of properties in which we may invest, the amount or percentage of our assets that may be invested in any specific property or property type, or the concentration of investments in any region in the United States. We do not intend to acquire properties located outside of the United States. We will continue to form entities to acquire interests in real properties, either alone or with other investors, and we may acquire interests in joint ventures or other entities that own real property. 

It is our policy, and the policy of our affiliated entities, that any investment opportunity presented to us or to any of our affiliated entities that involves the acquisition of a net leased property, a ground lease or a community shopping center, will first be offered to us and may not be pursued by any of our affiliated entities unless we decline the opportunity. Further, to the extent our affiliates are unable or unwilling to pursue an acquisition of a multi-family property (including a ground lease of a multi-family property), we may pursue such transaction if it meets our investment objectives. 

Investment Evaluation 

In evaluating potential investments, we consider, among other criteria, the following: 

&#149; the current and projected cash flow of the property; &#149; the estimated return on equity to us; &#149; an evaluation of the property and improvements, given its location and use; &#149; local demographics (population and rental trends); &#149; the terms of tenant leases, including co-tenancy provisions and the relationship between current rents and market rents; &#149; the ability of a tenant, if a net leased property, or major tenants, if a shopping center, to meet operational needs and lease obligations; &#149; the projected residual value of the property; &#149; the potential to finance or refinance the property; &#149; potential for income and capital appreciation; &#149; occupancy of and demand for similar properties in the market area; and &#149; alternate uses or tenants for the property. 4 

Our Business Objective 

Our business objective is to maintain and increase, over time, the cash available for distribution to our stockholders by: 

&#149; identifying opportunistic and strategic property acquisitions consistent with our portfolio and our acquisition strategies; &#149; obtaining mortgage indebtedness (including refinancings) on favorable terms and maintaining access to capital to finance property acquisitions; &#149; monitoring and maintaining our portfolio, including tenant negotiations and lease amendments with tenants having financial difficulty; and &#149; managing assets effectively, including lease extensions and opportunistic and strategic property sales. Typical Property Attributes 

As of December 31, 2015, the properties in our portfolio and those owned by our joint ventures typically have the following attributes: 

&#149; Net or ground leases. Substantially all of the leases are net and ground leases under which the tenant is typically responsible for real estate taxes, insurance and ordinary maintenance and repairs. We believe that investments in net and ground leased properties offer more predictable returns than investments in properties that are not net or ground leased; &#149; Long-term leases. Many of our leases are long-term leases. Excluding leases relating to properties owned by our joint ventures, the weighted average remaining term of our leases is 8.1 years, leases representing approximately 40.7% of our 2016 contractual rental income expire between 2021 and 2024, and leases representing approximately 37.0% of our 2016 contractual rental income expire after 2024; and &#149; Scheduled rent increases. Leases representing approximately 84.9% of our 2016 contractual rental income and leases representing 27.0% of our share of the base rent payable in 2016 with respect to properties owned by joint ventures provide for either periodic contractual rent increases or a rent increase based on the consumer price index. 5

(1) Eleven properties are net leased to Haverty Furniture Companies, Inc., which we refer to as Haverty Furniture, pursuant to a master lease covering all such properties. (2) Includes seven properties which are net leased to Office Depot pursuant to seven separate leases. Five of the Office Depot leases contain cross-default provisions. Also includes one property net leased to OfficeMax which was acquired by Office Depot in November 2013. 

Many of our tenants (including franchisees of national chains) operate on a national basis and include, among others, Applebees, Barnes &#38; Noble, CarMax, CVS, FedEx, Ferguson Enterprises, Kohl's, LA Fitness, Marshalls, Men's Wearhouse, Northern Tool, Office Depot, Party City, PetSmart, TGI Fridays, Sports Authority, Ross Stores, Shutterfly, Urban Outfitters, Walgreens, Wendy's and Whole Foods and some of our tenants operate on a regional basis, including Haverty Furniture, Giant Food Stores and hhgregg. 

Our Leases 

Many of our leases are net or ground leases (including the leases entered into by our joint ventures) under which the tenant, in addition to its rental obligation, typically is responsible for expenses attributable to the operation of the property, such as real estate taxes and assessments, water and sewer rents and other charges. The tenant is also generally responsible for maintaining the property and for restoration following a casualty or partial condemnation. The tenant is typically obligated to indemnify us for claims arising from the property and is responsible for maintaining insurance coverage for the property it leases and naming us an additional insured. Under some net leases, we are responsible for structural repairs, including foundation and slab, roof repair or replacement and restoration following a casualty event, and at several properties we are responsible for certain expenses related to the operation and maintenance of the property. 

Our typical lease provides for contractual rent increases periodically throughout the term of the lease or for rent increases pursuant to a formula based on the consumer price index. Some of our leases provide for minimum rents supplemented by additional payments based on sales derived from the property subject to the lease ( i.e ., percentage rent). Percentage rent contributed, and is expected to contribute, a nominal amount to 2015 rental income and 2016 rental income, respectively. 

Generally, our strategy is to acquire properties that are subject to existing long-term leases or to enter into long-term leases with our tenants. Our leases generally provide the tenant with one or more renewal options. 

The following table sets forth scheduled lease expirations of leases for our properties as of December 31, 2015:

(1) Lease expirations assume tenants do not exercise existing renewal options. (2) Subsequent to December 31, 2015, two leases accounting for an aggregate of $460,642 of the $1,492,034, or 30.9%, of 2016 contractual rental income associated with the leases scheduled to expire in 2016, were extended until 2021 and 2023. (3) Subsequent to December 31, 2015, a lease that accounts for $1,160,320 of the $4,197,408, or 27.6%, of 2016 contractual rental income with respect to leases expiring in 2018, was extended until 2028. 

Financing, Re-Renting and Disposition of Our Properties 

Our charter documents do not limit the level of debt we may incur. Our revolving credit facility matures on December 31, 2018 and, among other things, limits total debt that we may incur to 70% of the value of our properties (as determined pursuant to the credit facility). We borrow funds on a secured and unsecured basis and intend to continue to do so in the future. 

We mortgage specific properties on a non-recourse basis, subject to the standard carve-outs described under "Item 2. Properties&#151;Mortgage Debt", to enhance the return on our investment in a specific property. The proceeds of mortgage loans may be used for property acquisitions, investments in joint ventures or other entities that own real property, to reduce bank debt and for working capital purposes. The funds available pursuant to our credit facility may be used to payoff existing mortgages, fund the acquisition of additional properties, and to a more limited extent, invest in joint ventures and for working capital. Net proceeds received from the sale, financing or refinancing of properties are generally required to be used to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility. 

With respect to properties we acquire on a free and clear basis, we usually seek to obtain long-term fixed-rate mortgage financing, when available at acceptable terms, shortly after the acquisition of such property to avoid the risk of movement of interest rates and fluctuating supply and demand in the mortgage markets. We also will acquire a property that is subject to (and will assume) a 

fixed-rate mortgage. Substantially all of our mortgages provide for amortization of part of the principal balance during the term, thereby reducing the refinancing risk at maturity. Some of our properties may be financed on a cross-defaulted or cross-collateralized basis, and we may collateralize a single financing with more than one property. 

After termination or expiration of any lease relating to any of our properties, we will seek to re-rent or sell such property in a manner that will maximize the return to us, considering, among other factors, the income potential and market value of such property. We acquire properties for long-term investment for income purposes and do not typically engage in the turnover of investments. We will consider the sale of a property if a sale appears advantageous in view of our investment objectives. If there is a substantial tax gain, we may seek to enter into a tax deferred transaction and reinvest the proceeds in another property. Cash realized from the sale of properties, net of required payoffs of the related mortgage debt, if any, required paydowns of our credit facility, and distributions to stockholders, is available for general working capital purposes and the acquisition of additional properties. 

Our Joint Ventures 

As of December 31, 2015, we participated in five joint ventures that own an aggregate of five properties, with approximately 967,000 rentable square feet of space. Four of the properties are retail properties and one is an industrial property. We own 50% of the equity interest in all of these joint ventures. At December 31, 2015, our investment in joint ventures was approximately $11.4 million. 

Based on the leases in effect at December 31, 2015, we anticipate that our share of the base rent payable in 2016 to our joint ventures is approximately $2.7 million. Leases for two properties are expected to contribute 88.4% of the aggregate projected base rent payable to all of our joint ventures in 2016. Leases with respect to 7.2%, 62.5% and 30.3% of the aggregate projected base rent payable to all of our joint ventures in 2016, is payable pursuant to leases expiring from 2016 to 2017, from 2018 to 2019, and thereafter, respectively. 

Competition 

We face competition for the acquisition of properties from a variety of investors, including domestic and foreign corporations and real estate companies, financial institutions, insurance companies, pension funds, investment funds, other REITs and individuals, some of which have significant advantages over us, including a larger, more diverse group of properties and greater financial and other resources than we have. 

Our Structure 

Nine employees, including Patrick J. Callan, Jr., our president and chief executive officer, Lawrence G. Ricketts, Jr., our executive vice president and chief operating officer, Justin Clair, a vice-president, Karen Dunleavy, vice president-financial and five other employees, devote all of their business time to us. Our other executive, administrative, legal, accounting and clerical personnel provide their services to us on a part-time basis pursuant to the compensation and services agreement described below. 

We entered into a compensation and services agreement with Majestic Property Management Corp., effective as of January 1, 2007. Majestic Property is wholly-owned by our vice chairman of the board and it provides compensation to certain of our executive officers. Pursuant to this agreement, we pay an annual fee to Majestic Property and Majestic Property provides us with the services of all affiliated executive, administrative, legal, accounting and clerical personnel that we use on a part time basis, as well as property management services, property acquisition, sales and leasing and mortgage 

brokerage services. The fees we pay Majestic Property are negotiated by us and Majestic Property and are approved by our audit committee and independent directors. 

In 2015, pursuant to the compensation and services agreement, we paid Majestic Property a fee of approximately $2.3 million (including $892,500 for property management services) and $196,000 for our share of all direct office expenses, including, among other expenses, rent, telephone, postage, computer services and internet usage. Effective January 1, 2016, in lieu of a fixed fee for the property management services provided pursuant to this agreement, we will pay Majestic Property 1.5% and 2.0% of the rental payments (including tenant reimbursements) actually received by us from net lease tenants and operating lease tenants, respectively, and will not pay Majestic Property property management fees with respect to properties managed by third parties. Based on our portfolio of properties at December 31, 2015, we estimate that the property management fee in 2016 will be approximately $1.0 million. 

We believe that the compensation and services agreement allows us to benefit from (i) access to, and from the services of, a group of senior executives with significant knowledge and experience in the real estate industry and our company, (ii) other individuals who perform services on our behalf, and (iii) general economies of scale. If not for this agreement, we believe that a company of our size would not have access to the skills and expertise of these executives at the cost that we have incurred and will incur in the future. For a description of the background of our management, please see the information under the heading "Executive Officers" in Part I of this Annual Report. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding equity awards to individuals performing services on our behalf pursuant to the compensation and services agreement.

&#149; the financial condition of our tenants and the performance of their lease obligations; &#149; general economic and business conditions, including those currently affecting our nation's economy and real estate markets; &#149; the availability of and costs associated with sources of liquidity; &#149; accessibility of debt and equity capital markets; &#149; general and local real estate conditions, including any changes in the value of our real estate; &#149; compliance with credit facility covenants; &#149; increased competition for leasing of vacant space due to current economic conditions; &#149; changes in governmental laws and regulations relating to real estate and related investments; &#149; the level and volatility of interest rates; &#149; competition in our industry; and &#149; the other risks described under Item 1A. Risk Factors. Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this report and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be incorrect. Actual results may differ from our forward-looking statements because of inaccurate assumptions we might make or because of the occurrence of known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors mentioned in the discussion below will be important in determining future results. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward- looking statements. Actual future results may vary materially. 

Except as may be required under the United States federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make in our reports that are filed with or furnished to the SEC.
