Overview of Our Business 

&#160; 

Recent History 

&#160; 

We were incorporated on June 28, 2010 in the State of Nevada under the name &#8220;Island Radio, Inc.&#8221; and changed our name to &#8220;China Herb Group Holdings Corporation&#8221; effective July 17, 2012. 

&#160; 

On June 27, 2012, Eric R. Boyer and Nina Edstrom (collectively, the &#8220;Sellers&#8221;), who were then the major shareholders of the Company, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Chin Yung Kong, Qiuping Lu and Fumin Feng (collectively, the &#8220;Purchasers&#8221;), pursuant to which the Sellers sold to the Purchasers an aggregate 4,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company, which represented approximately 93% of the then total issued and outstanding stock of the Company, for a total purchase price of $159,970 (the &#8220;Change in Control&#8221;). As result of this share purchase transaction, Chin Yung Kong, Qiuping Lu and Fumin Feng became the controlling shareholders of the Company. 

&#160; 

Our original business plan was to become a commercial FM radio broadcaster. Subsequently, following the Change in Control, we changed our business plan and intended to become a medical and spa company with a focus on Asia. However, after consultation with our professional and business advisors in the United States and the People&#8217;s Republic of China (&#8220;China or the &#8220;PRC&#8221;), our management decided during the third quarter of 2014 that this would no longer be our plan of operations. No agreements had been entered into by us with any party in connection with such plan of operations. 

&#160; 

Business Model 

&#160; 

We currently have no business operations. We currently intend to evaluate new industry, geographic and market opportunities. Our entry into a new business may take the form of acquiring a business or being acquired by an existing business or, least likely, developing a business organically. Any such efforts may require significant capital, which we currently lack. There is no assurance that any such opportunity will become available. There is also no assurance that, if any opportunity becomes available, we will have the financial and other resources available to take advantage of such opportunity, since we have extremely limited liquidity. 

&#160; 

We will look for potential target companies in a broad range of industries and we may engage in a business combination with any type of business. We intend to focus on target companies that are located or operate exclusively or primarily in China, although, under certain circumstances, we would consider a business combination with a company located or operating in a different country. The circumstances under which we would consider a business combination with a company located or operating in a country other than China would be primarily those situations where we are unable to locate a suitable business combination candidate in the China or in response to a change in interest on the part of U.S. investors in investing in China such that such a business combination would no longer be considered advantageous to us.

&#160; 

The analysis of target companies and the business opportunities they may present to us will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the Company&#8217;s sole officer and director, Qiuping Lu. As of this date, we have not entered into any definitive agreement with any target company or any other party. No assurance can be given that we will consummate a transaction with any target company. We have unrestricted flexibility in seeking and analyzing target companies, and structuring and negotiating a business combination. In our efforts to analyze potential target companies, we consider numerous factors, including the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, existing brand name recognition, market penetration, anticipated market expansion and/or new products; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Competitive position as compared to other businesses of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Strength and diversity of the target company&#8217;s management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company, from operations of the target company, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The cost of participation by the Company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The extent to which the target company&#8217;s business opportunity can be advanced by means of the business combination; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Other relevant factors based on industry, geopolitical, market and other considerations. &#160; 

In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, we will attempt to analyze all facts and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures, due diligence and available data. Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries, and target companies may be at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. However, due to our limited capital available for investigation and due diligence, we may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about a target company. In addition, we will be competing against other entities that possess greater financial, technical and managerial capabilities for identifying and completing business combinations. 

&#160; 

In evaluating a target company and potential business combination, we will conduct as extensive a due diligence review of potential target companies as is reasonably possible given the relative lack of information which may be available regarding private companies, our limited personnel and financial resources and the inexperience of our management with respect to such endeavors. We expect that our due diligence will encompass, among other things, meetings with the potential target company&#8217;s incumbent management and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well as a review of financial and other information, and agreements, to the extent they are made available to us. 

&#160; &#160; 

This due diligence review will be conducted by our management and/or unaffiliated third parties, including professionals, who we may engage. Despite such efforts, our limited funds and the lack of our having full-time management will likely make it impracticable to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a target company before we consummate a business combination. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like which, if we had more funds and personnel available to us, would be suitable in analyzing a target company. We will be particularly dependent in making decisions upon information provided by the promoters, owners, sponsors, directors and officers or other affiliates or agents of the target company, and we may not be able to ascertain the accuracy or completeness of all such information that is provided to us. We will also face competitive pressures in identifying target companies and negotiating and consummating a business combination.

Form of Business Combination 

&#160; 

The manner in which we structure a business combination will depend upon numerous factors, including the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of the Company and the target company, the relative negotiating strength of the Company and the target company, and certain legal and regulatory considerations. Typical forms of business combinations include statutory mergers, stock purchases, share exchanges and asset purchase transactions. However, it is likely that, in engaging in a business combination with a target company, we will issue shares of our Common Stock or other securities to the stockholders of the target company as sole or partial consideration. 

&#160; 

Although the terms of any business combination cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called &#8220;tax free&#8221; reorganization under Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;) depends upon whether the owners of the acquired business (the target company) own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity at the conclusion of the transaction. If a business combination were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other &#8220;tax free&#8221; provisions provided under the Code, our then-existing stockholders in the aggregate would in such circumstances retain 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares of the Company upon the consummation of the business combination. Depending upon the relative negotiating strength of the parties, our then-existing stockholders may retain substantially less than 20% of the total issued and outstanding shares of the Company upon the consummation of the business combination. It is likely that as a result of a business combination, however it is structure, our then-existing stockholders would incur substantial additional dilution in their percentage ownership of the Company compared to their ownership percentage prior to the business combination. 

&#160; 

Depending upon the way the business combination is structured, it may be accomplished upon the sole determination of our then-serving directors without any vote or approval by our stockholders. However, in the case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving the Company, it will likely be necessary under Delaware law to call a stockholders&#8217; meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of our voting securities outstanding on the record date. Should it be necessary to obtain such stockholder approval, there could be a delay and additional expense involved in approving the proposed business combination. Additionally, such a structure will also likely give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders under Delaware law. For these and other reasons, our management will likely seek to structure any business combination so as not to require stockholder approval or trigger appraisal rights in favor of dissenting stockholders. 

&#160; 

The time and costs required to identify, select and conduct due diligence on a target company and to structure, negotiate, document and consummate a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. However, such efforts will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a target company and potential business combination that is not ultimately completed will result in unrecoverable expenses to us. Finally, there can be no assurance that any business combination which is consummated will be on terms that are favorable to us and our stockholders. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We are in a highly competitive market for a relatively small number of business opportunities which could reduce the likelihood of consummating a successful business combination. We are, and will continue to be, a minor participant in the business of seeking business combinations with target companies. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including small public companies, private equity firms, hedge funds and venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be suitable target companies for us. Nearly all of these entities with which we would compete for target companies have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do. Additionally, we will be competing with other companies who have a similar business model to ours, including special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) and other strategic acquirers. Consequently, we will face stiff competition and may be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination with a target company. These competitive factors may reduce the likelihood of our identifying and consummating a successful business combination on favorable terms or at all.

Certain Regulatory Matters 

&#160; 

Based on the current and proposed business activities described above, the Company is a &#8220;blank check&#8221; company. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) defines a blank check company as &#8220;any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3 (a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the {&#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Pursuant to Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, the Company is also a &#8220;shell company&#8221; because it has no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of &#8220;blank check&#8221; companies in their respective jurisdictions. 

&#160; 

We intend to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as we are subject to those requirements. 

&#160; 

Our offices are located at 77 Las Tunas Drive, Suite 203, Arcadia, California 91007, and our telephone number is (626) 608-0958. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had no employees. All functions, including development, strategy, negotiations and administration, are currently being provided by our sole director and officer, Qiuping Lu. Ms. Lu is engaged in outside business activities and anticipates that she will devote very limited time to our business until a successful business opportunity has been identified. We currently expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes, if any, incidental to a business combination.
