 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Company Overview 

We are a molecular diagnostics company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of clinically differentiated, high-value diagnostic surveillance solutions for transplant patients. Our first commercialized testing solution, the AlloMap heart transplant molecular test, or AlloMap, is a gene expression test that helps clinicians monitor and identify heart transplant recipients with stable graft function who have a low probability of moderate/severe acute cellular rejection. Since 2008, we have sought to expand the adoption and utilization of our AlloMap solution through ongoing studies to substantiate the clinical utility and actionability of AlloMap, secure positive reimbursement decisions for AlloMap from large private and public payers, develop and enhance our relationships with key members of the transplant community, including opinion leaders at major transplant centers, and explore opportunities and technologies for the development of additional solutions for post-transplant surveillance. We believe the use of AlloMap, in conjunction with other clinical indicators, can help healthcare providers and their patients better manage long-term care following a heart transplant. In particular, we believe AlloMap can improve patient care by helping healthcare providers to avoid the use of unnecessary, invasive surveillance biopsies and to determine the appropriate dosage levels of immunosuppressants. We are also pursuing the development of additional products for transplant monitoring using a variety of technologies, including AlloSure, our proprietary next-generation sequencing test to detect donor-derived cell-free DNA, or dd-cfDNA, after transplantation.

AlloMap is the only non-invasive method recommended in the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, or ISHLT, patient care guidelines for surveillance of heart transplant rejection in patients 15 years of age or older. AlloMap has received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for marketing and sale as a test to aid in the identification of recipients with a low probability of moderate or severe acute cellular rejection. A 510(k) submission is a premarketing submission made to the FDA. Clearance may be granted by the FDA if it finds the device or test provides satisfactory evidence pertaining to the claimed intended uses and indications for the device or test. Additionally, we have obtained a CE mark, which indicates a product&#8217;s compliance with European Union, or EU, legislation and enables the sale of such product within the EU. We have a certificate of accreditation under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, to perform &#8220;high complexity&#8221; testing. Almost all clinical laboratories are subject to regulation under CLIA, which is designed to ensure that laboratory testing services on materials derived from the human body are accurate and reliable. 

Since the launch of AlloMap in January 2005, we have performed more than 81,000 commercial AlloMap tests, including more than 13,000 tests in 2015, in our Brisbane, California laboratory. In 2015, AlloMap was used in 120 of the approximately 130 heart transplant centers in the United States. As of December 31, 2015, significantly all of our testing revenue has come from the United States and all of our assets and operations are located in the United States. In 2014, we began to expand our AlloMap offering through a partnership in Europe for which we have secured a dedicated laboratory.

AlloMap has received positive coverage decisions for reimbursement from Medicare and many of the largest private payers, including Aetna, Cigna, Humana, Inc., Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc., TRICARE National Insurance and WellPoint. We believe our success in achieving reimbursement confirms the value proposition of AlloMap to our key constituents. As of December 31, 2015, we had been reimbursed for approximately 79% of AlloMap results delivered in the twelve months ended June 30, 2015. 

We have also successfully completed a number of landmark clinical trials in the transplant field demonstrating the clinical utility of AlloMap for surveillance of heart transplant recipients. We initially established the analytical and clinical validity of AlloMap on the basis of our Cardiac Transplanted Organ Rejection Gene expression Observational &#160;(Crespo-Leiro M et al., AM. J. Transplantation, 2012), or CARGO, study, which was published in the American Journal of Transplantation. A subsequent clinical utility trial, Invasive Monitoring Attenuation through Gene Expression &#160;(Pham MX et al., N. Eng. J. Med., 2010), or IMAGE, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, demonstrated that clinical outcomes in recipients managed with AlloMap surveillance were equivalent to outcomes in recipients managed with biopsies. The results of our clinical trials have also been presented at major medical society congresses and published in peer-reviewed publications in leading medical journals.

&#160;

We are also engaged in efforts to develop additional testing solutions in the heart transpla nt market and new testing solutions in other organ transplant markets. For instance, AlloSure, our development stage transplant surveillance solution, applies proprietary next generation sequencing to detect and quantitate genetic differences between donor derived cell-free DNA, or dd-cfDNA, in the blood stream emanating from the donor heart. We believe this solution may help determine rejection-specific activity manifested as cell damage in the transplanted heart and other organs. As part of our efforts to demonstrate the clinical utility of AlloSure, our proprietary next-generation sequencing test that measures the percent of dd-cfDNA in solid organ transplant recipients, irrespective of the type of organ transplanted, in May 2015 we initiated the DART tri al. DART is designed to establish clinical validation, or the clinical performance characteristics of dd-cfDNA in detecting clinical and sub-clinical rejection in kidney allograft recipients. DART is a multicenter observational study of kidney transplant r ecipients where blood specimens are drawn periodically after transplant during follow up visits and also after treatment for acute rejection. DART is also designed to demonstrate the correlation of dd-cfDNA to renal function through comparison to both seru m creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate. We expect DART to run for a minimum of 18 months and we expect to complete an first analysis of the data in 2016. Once we receive relevant information from the first analysis, we expect to initiate a s econd clinical trial to establish the clinical utility of our dd-cfDNA kidney solution. At the end of December 2015, DART had enrolled over 200 patients in 13 centers. Additionally, in late 2015, we announced the completion of analytical validation for All oSure. Samples used in the analytical validation included donor recipient pairs with unrelated as well as closely related family members. 

On December 16, 2015 we entered into purchase agreements to acquire, subject to certain conditions, approximately 78% of the outstanding shares of Allenex AB, or Allenex, from its three principal shareholders in exchange for a combination of cash and our common stock. If we acquire all Allenex shares, the total purchase price for Allenex will be approximately $35.0 million, payable in a combination of cash and equity. On March 7, 2016, we launched a tender offer through the issuance of an Offer Document to acquire the remaining 22% of the shares of Allenex. In connection with, and to fund a portion of the proposed acquisition, on December 15, 2015, we entered into a commitment letter and fee letter with Oberland Capital SA Davos LLC, collectively with its affiliates and assignees, Oberland Capital, for a six month bridge loan of $18.0 million, to be borrowed in connection with the closing of the acquisition. Refer to &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition&#8212;Overview&#8212;Recent Developments&#8212;Allenex Tender Offer&#8221; included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

We are organized and operate in a single segment. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations&#8221; included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Our History 

We were originally incorporated in Delaware in December 1998 under the name Hippocratic Engineering, Inc. In April 1999, we changed our name to BioCardia, Inc., in June 2002, we changed our name to Expression Diagnostics, Inc., in July 2007, we changed our name to XDx, Inc. and in March 2014, we changed our name to CareDx, Inc. Our principal executive offices are located at 3260 Bayshore Boulevard, Brisbane, California and our telephone number is (415) 287-2300. 

On June 10, 2014, we acquired ImmuMetrix, Inc., or ImmuMetrix, a privately held development-stage company working on dd-cfDNA-based solutions in transplantation and other fields. Through this acquisition, we added to our existing know-how, expertise and intellectual property in applying dd-cfDNA technology to the surveillance of transplant recipients, which has contributed to the development of AlloSure. The intellectual property rights of ImmuMetrix included an exclusive license from Stanford University to a patent relating to the diagnosis of rejection in organ transplant recipients using dd-cfDNA.

Limitations of Existing Approaches for Surveillance of Transplant Recipients 

The care of organ transplant recipients is an intense and costly effort and requires life-long surveillance and management by highly specialized clinicians and other healthcare providers. For example, based on internal calculations based on an internal analysis as of 2011, heart transplant recipients often incur lifetime costs of more than $1.9 million and kidney transplant recipients often incur lifetime costs of more than $1.1 million. The historical standard for heart transplant surveillance has been the microscopic examination of heart tissue obtained through an 

&#160;

invasive endomyocardial biopsy. In the biopsy procedure, a catheter is inserted i nto the right internal jugular vein via the recipient&#8217;s neck and threaded through blood vessels into the inner chamber of the heart. Four pieces of tissue are cut from the wall of the heart and sent to a laboratory for examination by a pathologist who uses a microscope to look for evidence of cellular rejection. Due to the limitations of biopsies, including pathologist evaluations which are subjective and dependent upon visual assessment and qualitative interpretation, the risk of sampling errors and the po tential for complications and other health risks, these procedures are not frequently used by clinicians to tailor the use of immunosuppressants. The typical schedule of biopsy surveillance may involve eight to ten biopsies within the first six months afte r transplant and a total of ten to fifteen biopsies within the first year post-transplant. Because repeated biopsies incur cumulative risk and trauma to the recipient, the frequency of biopsy surveillance after one year has been low, despite the fact that recipients would benefit from continued monitoring for rejection and management of their immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their lives. With less biopsy data collected after the first year post-transplant, clinicians have less information upon which to tailor immunosuppression treatment for their recipients. 

The use of renal biopsies for surveillance of kidney transplants is also limited due to the risks associated with such invasive procedures. Therefore, the main clinical test indicator of transplanted kidney dysfunction is an increase in serum creatinine levels, which though widely used, literature suggests may be nonspecific and detected too late, after significant and irreversible renal function loss has occurred. As the current solutions for the surveillance of organ transplant recipients provide only limited and infrequent information on the presence or absence of rejection, clinicians tend to administer relatively high levels of immunosuppression therapy to control rejection risk, which may be more than required for an individual recipient. Due in part to this long-term high level of immunosuppression therapy, illness and mortality rates among transplant recipients remain well above those of the general population and have not significantly improved in the last ten years. 

Immunosuppression of Heart and Kidney Transplant Recipients 

The risk of rejection in heart and kidney transplant recipients is managed primarily through the use of immunosuppressive drugs. Surveillance biopsies are infrequent after the first year because of invasive procedural risks, discomfort, inconvenience, expense and the low rate of finding moderate to severe grade rejection. As a result, clinicians have limited and infrequent information about an individual recipient&#8217;s risk of rejection over the months and years following transplant. In the average recipient, the immune system gradually adapts to the organ graft, and the need for immunosuppression declines over time. However, there is meaningful variation in the level of rejection activity and need for immunosuppression among transplant recipients. Limited insight into the risk profile of the individual recipient often causes clinicians to apply a &#8216;one-size-fits&#8217; all approach to immunosuppression to help protect against the severe consequences of rejection. Although typical doses of immunosuppressants result in a low rate of rejection in the transplant population as a whole, many individuals receive more immunosuppressants than they may actually need. Improved post-transplantation diagnostics are necessary to make further gains in the long-term care and health outcomes of heart, kidney and other organ transplant recipients. 

The Need for a Better Surveillance Solution 

More effective solutions for the surveillance and risk assessment of recipients would improve the clinician&#8217;s ability to individualize immunosuppression therapy and to reduce the use of invasive biopsies. We believe that core elements of effective surveillance solutions include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

highly accurate and quantitative results; 

&#160;

&#183; 

non-invasive, without creating risks to the recipient; 

&#160;

&#183; 

easy to administer; 

&#160;

&#183; 

differentiate rejection from quiescence; 

&#160;

&#183; 

detect rejection earlier; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

timing and frequency of results that allow informed and effective treatment decisions. 

&#160;

Our Products and Services 

We develop and provide a diagnostic surveillance testing solution for heart transplant recipients. Our initial test, AlloMap, is designed to help clinicians to regularly monitor for heart transplant rejection throughout the life of the recipient, modulate the use of immunosuppression and make more personalized treatment decisions. The AlloMap test uses a sample of the patient&#8217;s blood. Blood draws are relatively painless and the process is routinely performed in laboratories around the world. AlloMap may be used instead of a surveillance heart biopsy to rule out acute cellular rejection in heart transplant recipients. AlloMap offers rapid, high quality results, and for approximately 88% of patients, we return AlloMap results to the clinician within three business days after the blood draw. Additionally, we are in the process of commercializing AlloSure, our development stage transplant surveillance solution which applies proprietary next generation sequencing to detect dd-cfDNA after transplantation.

Overview 

AlloMap uses gene expression technology to aid in the identification of heart transplant recipients at low risk of rejection. The test measures the molecular signatures that correlate with biological activity associated with moderate to severe acute cellular rejection. Gene expression may indicate acute cellular rejection well before the evidence of damage is visible from a tissue biopsy sample. AlloMap applies a proprietary mathematical algorithm comprised of the expression values, or RNA levels, of 20 genes of which 11 are informative and 9 are for quality control, and then yields a single AlloMap score. AlloMap may be used for heart transplant recipients 15 years of age or older, starting on day 55 post transplant. 

AlloMap provides a single integer score ranging from 0 to 40 and determines the probability of the absence of moderate to severe acute cellular rejection. A key benefit of the AlloMap score is its negative predictive value, or NPV. The NPV of AlloMap is the likelihood that a heart transplant recipient is at low risk for rejection. The NPV for recipients with an AlloMap score below the threshold range for one or more years post-transplant can be greater than 99% depending on the actual score. 

The clinical utility of AlloMap is well established. AlloMap is the first and only non-invasive method recommended in the ISHLT patient care guidelines for surveillance of heart transplant recipients for rejection in non-infants. AlloMap has obtained 510(k) clearance from the FDA as an In Vitro Diagnostic Multivariate Index Assay, or IVDMIA. In addition, the clinical utility of AlloMap is supported by numerous clinical trials sponsored by us, the results of which have been published in leading peer-reviewed medical journals. 

Through December 31, 2015, we have performed more than 81,000 commercial AlloMap tests in total. We estimate that there are approximately 130 centers performing heart transplants in the United States. In 2015, AlloMap was used in 120 of these centers. 

In incorporating AlloMap into their practice, clinicians may consider recipient history, a physical exam, graft function and the results of AlloMap at each post-transplant clinic visit. If the recipient&#8217;s AlloMap score is below an applicable threshold, in the absence of other clinical indicators of rejection, clinicians may elect not to conduct a surveillance biopsy at that time. Where there are signs or indications of rejection, evidence of failure or impaired function or an AlloMap score greater than the applicable threshold, a biopsy may be ordered. 

AlloMap Score Variability, or AMV, is a new service offered by us that we believe provides useful, complementary information to help personalize long-term care of heart transplant recipients. It is available only upon request by clinicians. A patient&#8217;s AMV is based on the variability of a patient&#8217;s AlloMap scores over time and may be used as a stratification tool in estimating the risk of probability that one or more of the clinical events in heart transplant recipients may occur in the future. AMV is available from four AlloMap test results within a 24-month period. A low AMV may indicate a lower risk of future events, which suggests that a patient may be a potential candidate for reduced immunosuppression. A high AMV may indicate a higher risk of future events and a patient may merit more vigilant surveillance. The concept of AMV was developed over the course of several years, beginning as an observation in clinical studies of low score variability among stable patients which suggested that AMV might be a predictor of future clinical events and rejection episodes. The Cardiac Allograft Rejection Gene Expression Observational II Study, or CARGO II, included data which demonstrated that AMV may be useful in estimating the 

&#160;

probability of future events of death, re-transplantation or graft failure in heart transplant recipients who were undergoing surveillance with AlloMap testing more th an 315 days following transplantation. 

Clinical Trials of AlloMap and AlloSure

The clinical validation and utility of AlloMap is supported by a number of major clinical trials involving more than 2,000 heart transplant recipients and published in leading peer-reviewed medical journals. Our trials have been designed to evaluate the clinical utility of our solutions and are an integral part of our business strategy, clinical development and marketing programs. In heart transplantation, two major observational trials, CARGO and CARGO II, enabled the initial development, validation and further validation of AlloMap to detect and monitor acute cellular rejection in heart transplant recipients. Blood samples and clinical data from these two trials have been preserved in a multi-year, multicenter registry which we are sponsoring. We expect these samples and data to enable further discovery and product development of new indicators of rejection activity, or biomarkers, and new diagnostic solutions. We believe these repositories, which contain over 37,000 samples, are rich sources for further new product research and development because individual recipients were followed for 10 serial visits over one year or more, on average, and in many cases associated biopsy rejection grades and other clinical outcome endpoints are available for analysis, correlative studies and validation efforts that we believe will be useful for new product development. 

Additional clinical utility trials, including IMAGE and EIMAGE, have demonstrated that clinical outcomes in recipients managed with AlloMap surveillance were equivalent to outcomes in recipients managed with biopsies. We have also published two studies retrospectively analyzing data from two (IMAGE and CARGO II) earlier trials that demonstrate how the variability in AlloMap scores over time may be useful in predicting the risks of rejection and graft dysfunction. 

In May 2015, we initiated the DART trial to clinically validate AlloSure, our proprietary next-generation sequencing test that measures the percent of dd-cfDNA in solid organ transplant recipients, regardless of the type of organ transplanted. DART is designed to establish clinical validation, or the clinical performance characteristics of dd-cfDNA in detecting acute rejection in kidney allograft recipients. DART is a multicenter observational study of the clinical status of renal transplant patients and blood specimens are collected periodically at post-transplant follow up visits and also at the time of renal biopsies following treatment for acute rejection. DART is also designed to demonstrate the correlation of dd-cfDNA to renal function through comparison to both serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Patients will be followed in DART for a minimum of 18 months. Once we receive relevant information from the first planned analysis of DART, we expect to initiate a second clinical trial to establish the clinical utility of our dd-cfDNA kidney solution. At the end of December 2015, DART had enrolled over 200 patients in 13 centers.

Research and Development 

Our research and development activities focus on developing cutting edge organ transplant surveillance solutions, and we seek to continuously explore and develop new clinically-relevant approaches to our products. Our ongoing research and development efforts include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

further refinement of the AlloMap product line; 

&#160;

&#183; 

additional studies to expand the clinical utility of AlloMap and generate additional data to enhance clinical understanding of transplant rejection; 

&#160;

&#183; 

new product development in other areas of transplant surveillance, such as validating the use of AlloSure for heart and dd-cfDNA technology as a biomarker for rejection in other organs; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

technology platform development to increase efficiency and lower costs in our testing and laboratory operations. 

Our research and development efforts are not limited to specific technology platforms, biomarkers or methodologies. Instead, we aim to leverage current and future innovations in biomarker identification and measurement in developing future solutions. 

&#160;

Our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $9.3 million, $3.8 million and $3.2 million, respectively. 

During 2015, our European commercial partner Diaxonhit SA, or Diaxonhit, assisted with the design of a health economic study for AlloMap reimbursement in Europe. Diaxonhit is a French publicly traded specialty diagnostics company with activities in France, Switzerland and Belgium, and is a leader in specialty in-vitro diagnostics for transplantation, infectious diseases and cancer. Additionally, the French Ministry of Health has recently approved the funding of a study designed to demonstrate that AlloMap is non-inferior to biopsy as a method of evaluating the risk of acute cellular rejection among French heart transplant patients.

dd-cfDNA as a Biomarker for Organ Rejection 

We are currently engaged in discovery and development efforts using dd-cfDNA to develop additional post-transplant diagnostic solutions, with a focus on a test for heart and kidney rejection. We believe dd-cfDNA may be useful as a biomarker for the detection of rejection related organ damage in solid organ transplant recipients. dd-cfDNA are short fragments of DNA that are released into the blood stream when cells die. dd-cfDNA assays have transformed pre-natal testing by providing a non-invasive, accurate method to detect genetic abnormalities in a fetus, without needing an invasive amniocentesis procedure. In a transplant recipient, we believe the differences in the relative amounts of dd-cfDNA from the donated organ and the recipient can be used to distinguish between patients with a healthy or damaged donor organ. 

Initial studies such as Heart Transplants Are Genome Transplants: Universal Noninvasive Detection of Organ Transplant Rejection &#160;(Snyder T M et al., Proceedings N. Academy Sciences, 2011) and the Highly Sensitive Non-Invasive Cardiac Transplant Rejection Monitoring Using Targeted Qualification of Donor Specific Cell Free DNA (Hidestrand M et. al., J. Am. Coll. Cardiology, 2013) indicate that dd-cfDNA may be a universally applicable marker for rejection, not only for heart, but for kidney, liver and lung transplant recipients as well. Our initial studies and other external studies have reported that the proportions of dd-cfDNA in heart transplant recipients increase as much as five-fold during rejection episodes. Measuring the level and changes in the relative amount of dd-cfDNA in the blood stream may be a useful new method for detecting rejection. This technique involves measuring the dd-cfDNA released by dying cells from the donor organ into the recipient&#8217;s blood stream. The level of donor specific dd-cfDNA from the transplanted organ can be monitored in the recipient&#8217;s blood stream over time, and changes in organ status may be detected as changes in the donor dd-cfDNA level. The rationale for this approach arises from the observation that both acute and chronic rejection processes are associated with high levels of cell death in the transplanted organ. 

In early 2015 we presented preliminary data demonstrating an increase of dd-cfDNA in the plasma of patients prior to organ rejection and the decrease of dd-cfDNA following immunosuppressive therapy for acute rejection in heart transplant recipients, using blood samples and clinical data from our CARGO II repository. These tests were conducted in our research facilities using our library of well annotated blood samples from primarily heart organ transplant patients. The results were presented at several professional medical society meetings.

dd-cfDNA for Heart Transplants 

We believe that a dd-cfDNA-based solution for heart transplant recipients could provide additional value to clinicians, particularly in situations where a recipient&#8217;s AlloMap score does not suggest a low probability of acute rejection. Studies have reported that a higher percentage of dd-cfDNA in the blood stream of patients with moderate or severe rejection as determined by an associated biopsy specimen. We believe a dd-cfDNA solution for heart could help clinicians to identify recipients with a higher probability of rejection and make any subsequent biopsy a more effective diagnostic tool, because the likelihood of detecting rejection in the biopsy specimen would be substantially enhanced. 

We have completed internal studies with our collection of samples. We have established our proprietary strategy for quantification of donor specific dd-cfDNA and we have completed initial proof of concept studies. We now offer AlloSure as a laboratory developed test for a limited number of heart transplant centers and physicians as part of the D-OAR registry study. 

&#160;

Other steps in our AlloSure development proc ess have included publication of abstracts in association with professional meetings on the results of the clinical validity of AlloSure in our CARGO II sample and data repository. 

dd-cfDNA for Kidney Transplants 

Our DART clinical trial is aimed at establishing the clinical validity of a dd-cfDNA for kidney transplant patients. We are applying expertise we gained developing AlloSure to develop a dd-cfDNA solution for other organ transplants, beginning with kidney transplants. We have a proprietary library of longitudinal blood and urine samples from kidney transplant recipients acquired during the course of our Kidney Transplanted Organ Rejection Gene expression Observational Study, or KARGO. 

An interventional clinical study to establish clinical utility of dd-cfDNA is expected to commence after initial results are obtained from the DART validation study. We may seek to acquire rights to access additional well-curated samples from other university hospitals and other sample repository consortiums in the United States with which we maintain relationships. We plan to expand the clinical validity evidence in support of commercialization for use in kidney transplant recipients. If developed, we would commercialize this solution. We recently designed and expanded our CLIA-CAP-compliant lab to accommodate clinical-grade next generation sequence testing and released a clinically validated Laboratory Developed Test, or LDT, under CLIA in December 2015.

We previously applied for and obtained FDA clearance for our AlloMap solution based on draft guidance published by the FDA in September 2006. That guidance was never finalized by the FDA and, at present, we do not anticipate seeking 510(k) clearance from the FDA for our dd-cfDNA-based kidney solution as part of our initial launch. If the FDA changes its current policy with respect to the regulation of LDTs, we may be required to seek FDA clearance or premarket approval for our dd-cfDNA-based kidney solution. The time required to develop and validate a test for kidney transplants depends on a number of factors, including the success and timing of developing a dd-cfDNA test for heart transplants and the time required to acquire sufficient samples. 

Reimbursement 

We have been successful in achieving reimbursement from many payers. The reimbursement process can take six months or more to complete depending on the payer. As of December 31, 2015, we have been reimbursed for approximately 79% of AlloMap results delivered in the twelve months ended June 30, 2015. 

Reimbursement for AlloMap comes primarily from Medicare, private third party payers such as insurance companies and managed care organizations, Medicaid and hospitals. A number of payers have adopted coverage policies approving AlloMap for reimbursement. Such policies often approve reimbursement for tests performed from six-months or one year post-transplant through five years post-transplant. For tests performed outside the scope of the payer&#8217;s policy, and for tests performed where the payer has not adopted a coverage policy, we pursue reimbursement on a case-by-case basis. If a reimbursement claim is denied, we generally pursue the appeals process for the particular payer. 

AlloMap has been billed since the inception of the test using an unlisted CPT code. This approach is consistent with the billing approach for many diagnostic tests. However, in February 2015 Medicare assigned a Category 1 CPT code for AlloMap. 

Due to the assignment of a Category 1 CPT, in September 2015, the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued a proposed Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS, Preliminary Determinations for calendar year 2016. In the draft, CMS proposed large changes in reimbursement for a number of established molecular diagnostic tests, including AlloMap. Under the proposed fee schedule, AlloMap reimbursement would have been reduced by 77% from $2,821.00 to $644.62. 

However, in October 2015, CMS reversed its preliminary CLFS and restored the final pricing determinations for AlloMap in the 2016 CLFS to $2,821.00, which is the same as the previous rate set by a number of Medicare 

&#160;

Administrative Contractors, or MACs, including Noridian Administrative Services, Cigna Governmental Services, and Palmetto GBA. CMS has deferred formal Category 1 CPT pricing determi nations until 2017. 

Medicare 

We are reimbursed for a substantial portion of our tests performed on recipients covered by Medicare. These represented 36%, 37% and 39% of all AlloMap tests in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Approximately 50%, 51% and 53% of all testing revenue was derived from Medicare reimbursements for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Medicare reimbursement for AlloMap began in 2006 and has continued through three successive Medicare Administrative Contractors, which are the local organizations that make most coverage decisions for Medicare. 

Private Payers and Medicaid Payers 

We are reimbursed for a substantial portion of the tests we perform on patients covered by private payers and Medicaid payers. Coverage policies approving AlloMap for reimbursement have been adopted by many of the largest private payers, including Aetna, Cigna, Humana, Inc., Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc., TRICARE National Insurance and WellPoint, and a number of state Medicaid programs. Many of the payers with positive coverage policies have also entered into contracts with us to formalize pricing and payment terms. With private payers and Medicaid payers that have not yet adopted positive coverage policies, we obtain reimbursement from those payers on a case-by-case basis for a significant portion of claims. 

International

In 2013 we initiated a commercial agreement with a term of 10 years that provides for exclusive rights to promote AlloMap in Europe with Diaxonhit, a leader in specialty in-vitro diagnostics for transplantation, infectious diseases and cancer. Diaxonhit has agreed to commercialize AlloMap in all countries in western and central Europe directly and through sub-partners. Under the terms of our agreement, we will provide Diaxonhit with training and a license to perform AlloMap. In Europe, we receive revenue in two ways; first, through our sale of testing materials to our partner, Diaxonhit, and second, through royalties on Diaxonhit&#8217;s net sales of AlloMap. Diaxonhit will pay royalties to us on the net sales, as defined in the agreement, of AlloMap tests, in the mid to high teens. Diaxonhit made an upfront payment to us in cash of approximately &#8364;387,500 ($503,000) and Diaxonhit&#8217;s publicly traded common stock with a value at the time of &#8364;387,000 following execution of the agreement. The cash portion of this upfront payment will offset the royalties payable to us upon the satisfaction of certain milestones in the first three years following the first commercial sale. Diaxonhit is also obligated to pay additional royalties based on certain milestones, up to a maximum of &#8364;1,450,000, and some of the royalty payments may be made pursuant to the issuance to us of Diaxonhit&#8217;s publicly traded common stock. Through Diaxonhit, we have also secured a dedicated laboratory, the Strasbourg University Hospital Central Immunology Laboratory, or HUS, in France.

Our agreement with our Canadian partner, LifeLabs Medical Laboratory Services, was terminated in August 2015 and we now sell directly in Canada with a focus on the largest province: Ontario. 

Testing and Laboratory Operations 

Our laboratory operations are headquartered at our Brisbane, California laboratory, which is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment of 1988, or CLIA, and where we perform all testing in support of our U.S. patients. Through our European commercial partner, we have contracted with a dedicated laboratory in France with HUS for AlloMap testing in Europe. We undertook a multi-step validation process to demonstrate that AlloMap test results released from the HUS laboratory are equivalent to AlloMap results generated by our main laboratory in the United States. The technology transfer was completed in January 2016, and patient samples can now be tested at HUS. We believe that our laboratory capacity will be adequate to meet demand for AlloMap in Europe for the next several years. 

We have also recently expanded existing lab facilities in Brisbane, CA to accommodate CLIA-compliant space specifically designed for clinical-grade next-generation sequencing, or NGS, testing. This new laboratory space has 

&#160;

been established to support future products that target dd-cfDNA for the surveillance of organ transplant recipients. The expanded facility also inclu des a state-of-the-art laboratory information management system containing best-in-class NGS bioinformatics and customized software modules. 

When AlloMap is ordered by a clinician, a blood sample is drawn and processed to isolate the white blood cells, which are subsequently broken down, frozen and sent via overnight courier to our laboratory. Each of the 20 genes comprising AlloMap are tested in triplicate and results are reported to the ordering clinician by fax within three business days of receipt of the sample. Rigorous quality control testing is conducted at every phase of the test process. Test samples that fail to meet quality control criteria are immediately re-tested and the ordering clinician is notified of the need to re-test if turnaround time will be affected. 

We rely solely on single suppliers to provide certain laboratory instruments and reagents that we use to perform AlloMap. These sole source suppliers include Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., or Thermo Fisher, which supplies us with instruments, laboratory reagents, a master mix formula and consumables, Becton, Dickinson, and Company which supplies us with cell preparation tubes, and Therapak Corporation, which supplies us with a proprietary buffer reagent. One of the reagents supplied to us by Therapak Corporation is, in turn, obtained by Therapak Corporation from Qiagen N.V. and is a proprietary formulation of Qiagen N.V. 

We have completed all the verification and validation studies with Thermo Fisher for the development of a custom master mix. All three full scale validation lots passed our acceptance testing. We now routinely purchase this material for routine use in the production of its AlloMap test plates.

Sales and Marketing 

Our sales organization consists of a direct sales team in the United States which interacts with all aspects of the transplantation channel, including sales, medical science, reimbursement, customer service and field laboratory/draw site support. As of December 31, 2015, our sales and marketing team consisted of 22 employees, including transplant account sales executives, reimbursement account managers, medical science liaisons and patient service center and customer service personnel. All personnel are field based except for customer service, which are based in our California headquarters. 

In 2015, AlloMap was used in 120 of the approximately 130 heart transplant centers in the United States. Our marketing focuses on the clinical and economic benefits of AlloMap and the scientific validation that supports our test. Our strategy includes continued marketing to and education of clinicians and administrators at treatment centers that have used our test to increase the number of clinicians at those centers using our test, and to have centers adopt formal protocols for AlloMap use. 

Competition 

We believe the principal competitive factors in our target markets include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

quality and strength of clinical and analytical validation data; 

&#160;

&#183; 

confidence in diagnostic results; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the extent of reimbursement; 

&#160;

&#183; 

inclusion in practice guidelines; 

&#160;

&#183; 

cost-effectiveness; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

ease of use. 

We believe we compete favorably on the factors described above. 

Existing diagnostic methods for heart transplant rejection generally involve evaluating biopsy samples to determine the presence or absence of rejection, and for kidney transplant rejection include general, non-specific clinical chemistry tests, though biopsies are also a surveillance diagnostic tool. Both of these practices have been the 

&#160;

standard of care in the United States for many years, and we will need to continue to educate clinicians, transplant recipients and payers about the various benefits of ou r test in order to change clinical practice. Also, many transplant centers are located within hospitals that have their own laboratory facilities and have capacity to conduct various tests, so hospitals may choose to rely on internally developed and/or int ernally performed surveillance and diagnostic tests. Competition for kidney surveillance diagnostics can also come from biopsies. However, because of the risks and discomforts of the invasive kidney biopsy procedure, as well as the expense and relatively l ow rate of finding moderate to severe grade rejection, biopsy is not a standard practice for surveillance of transplanted kidneys. Additional competition for kidney surveillance diagnostics currently comes from general, non-specific clinical chemistry test s such as serum creatinine, urine protein, complete blood count, lipid profile and others that are widely ordered by physician offices and routinely performed in clinical reference labs and hospital labs. 

We also expect the competition for post-transplant surveillance to increase as there are several established and early-stage companies in the process of developing novel products and services for the transplant market which may directly or indirectly compete with AlloMap or our development pipeline. In addition to companies focused on pre-transplantation such as Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.&#8217;s One Lambda and Immucor, Inc.&#8217;s LIFECODES businesses, companies who have not historically focused on transplantation, but have knowledge of dd-cfDNA technology, have indicated they are considering this market. 

Our potential competitors may have widespread brand recognition and substantially greater financial, technical and research and development resources and selling and marketing capabilities than we do. Others may develop products with prices lower than ours that could be viewed by clinicians and payers as functionally equivalent to our solution, or offer solutions at prices designed to promote market penetration, which could force us to lower the price of our current and future solutions and affect our ability to achieve or maintain profitability. 

Intellectual Property 

Patents and Proprietary Technology 

In order to remain competitive, we seek to develop and maintain protection on the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, material data transfer agreements and licenses to protect our intellectual property rights. We also rely upon unpatented trade secrets and improvements, unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We generally protect this information with confidentiality and reasonable security measures. 

Our core patent position for AlloMap is based on issued patents and patent applications disclosing identification of genes differentially expressed between activated and resting leukocytes and demonstration of correlation between gene expression patterns and specific clinical states and outcomes. Our strategy is to continue to broaden our intellectual property estate for AlloMap through the discovery and protection of gene expression patterns and their correlation with specific clinical states and outcomes, as well as the algorithms needed for clinical assessment. 

As of December 31, 2015, we have 16 issued United States patents, and one pending patent application outside the United States related to transplant rejection and autoimmunity. We have five issued United States patents covering methods of diagnosing transplant rejection using all 11 informative genes measured in AlloMap. The expiration dates of these patents range from 2021 to 2024. In the area of dd-cfDNA-based transplant diagnostics, we have filed a patent application to cover our research and development work in this field. In connection with our June 2014 acquisition of ImmuMetrix, we obtained an exclusive license from Stanford University to a patent relating to the diagnosis of rejection in organ transplant recipients using dd-cfDNA. This patent has an expiration date of November 5, 2030.

We have six issued United States patents covering a method of diagnosing or monitoring autoimmune or chronic inflammatory diseases, such as lupus, by detecting specific genes. While we have clinical samples and patents covering lupus diagnostics, we do not intend to actively pursue the lupus test opportunity. 

AlloMap, XDx and CareDx are registered trademarks of our Company in the United States. 

&#160;

We have developed trade secrets and know-how since our inception. These are found particularly in technical areas such as optimized systems for making precise and reproducible quantitative PCR measurements, and in the analysis of genomic data and algorithm development. 

License Agreements

We currently rely on license agreements to obtain rights under certain patents that we believe may be necessary to make, use and sell our AlloMap test and future solutions. We may in the future rely, at least in part, upon licensing agreements with third parties to obtain patent rights and transfers of technology, information and know-how that enable us to further our development of additional solutions for post-transplant surveillance. 

In November 2004, we entered into a license agreement with Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., or Roche, which was amended in January 2007, July 2007, October 2008 and September 2014. The agreement grants us the right to use PCR and quantitative real time PCR for use in clinical laboratory services. This is a non-exclusive license agreement in the United States covering the claims in multiple Roche patents. Under the terms of the agreement, we are required to report and pay royalties, after adjustment due to a discount for combination services, in the mid-single digits on test revenues from products using the licensed intellectual property on a quarterly basis until September 2017, pursuant to a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release, dated September 11, 2014, or Settlement Agreement. As part of the Settlement Agreement, we will continue (i) a downward adjustment of the combination services percentage used to determine the portion of the AlloMap service that is royalty bearing under the terms of the license until September 30, 2017 and (ii) to report and pay quarterly royalties within 45 days of the end of each quarter. Roche has agreed that subject to our timely payment of all applicable royalties through such date, no further royalties will be payable by us for periods after September 20, 2017.

In June 2014, we entered into an amended and restated license agreement with Stanford University (Stanford) which granted us an exclusive license to a patent relating to the diagnosis of rejection in organ transplant recipients using dd-cfDNA and a non-exclusive license to related technology provided by Stanford. Subject to various rights of extension, we are required to achieve certain development and commercialization milestones set forth in the license agreement. Under the terms of the license agreement, we are required to report and pay an annual license maintenance fee, six milestone payments and royalties in the low single digits on net sales of products incorporating the licensed technology. 

Regulation 

Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 

As a clinical laboratory, we are required to hold certain federal, state and local licenses, certifications and permits to conduct our business. Under CLIA, administered by CMS, we are required to hold a certificate applicable to the type of work we perform and to comply with standards covering personnel, facilities administration, quality systems, proficiency testing and performance. Almost all clinical laboratories are subject to regulation under CLIA, which is designed to ensure that laboratory testing services on materials derived from the human body are accurate and reliable. 

We have a certificate of accreditation under CLIA to perform &#8220;high complexity&#8221; testing. Laboratories performing high complexity testing are required to meet more stringent personnel and quality system requirements than laboratories performing less complex tests. To renew our CLIA certificate, we are subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with program standards. The standards applicable to the testing which we perform may change over time. We were inspected and recertified under CLIA in February 2014. We expect the next regular inspection under CLIA to occur in 2016. 

California Laboratory Licensing 

In addition to federal certification requirements of laboratories under CLIA, licensure is required and maintained for our laboratory under California law. Such laws establish standards for the day-to-day operation of a clinical laboratory, including the training and skills required of personnel and quality control. In addition, California laws mandate proficiency testing, which involves testing of specimens that have been specifically prepared for the 

&#160;

laboratory. We are required to maintain compliance with California standards as a condition to continued operation of our laboratory. 

Other States&#8217; Laboratory Testing 

Other states require out-of-state laboratories which accept specimens from those states to be licensed. We have obtained licenses in California, Florida, New York, Maryland and Pennsylvania and believe we are in compliance with applicable licensing laws. 

Food and Drug Administration 

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates the design, testing, development, manufacture, safety, labeling, marketing, promotion, storage, sale and distribution of medical devices pursuant to its authority under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA. The FFDCA and its implementing regulations govern, among other things, the following activities relating to our medical devices: preclinical and clinical testing, design, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, sales and distribution, post-market adverse event reporting, import/export, and advertising and promotion. The FDA has also asserted that it has the authority to regulate laboratory-developed tests, known as LDTs, as medical devices under the FFDCA. An LDT is a test developed by a single laboratory for use only in that laboratory, such as AlloMap. 

The FDA has traditionally chosen not to exercise its authority to regulate LDTs because it regulates the primary components in most laboratory-developed tests and because it believes that laboratories certified as high complexity under CLIA, such as ours, have demonstrated expertise and ability in test procedures and analysis. However, beginning in September 2006, the FDA issued draft guidance on a subset of LDTs known as &#8220;in vitro diagnostic multivariate index assays,&#8221; or IVDMIAs. According to the draft guidance, IVDMIAs do not fall within the scope of LDTs over which FDA has exercised enforcement discretion because such tests incorporate complex and unique interpretation functions which require clinical validation. We believed that AlloMap met the definition of IVDMIA set forth in the draft guidance document. As a result, we applied for and obtained in August 2008 510(k) clearance for AlloMap for marketing and sale as a test to aid in the identification of recipients with a low probability of moderate or severe rejection. 

On October 3, 2014, the FDA published two draft guidance documents that set forth the FDA&#8217;s proposed risk-based framework for regulating LDTs. The draft guidance documents provide the anticipated details through which the FDA would propose to establish an LDT oversight framework, including premarket review for higher-risk LDTs, such as those that have the same intended use as FDA-approved or cleared companion diagnostics currently on the market. The FDA allotted 90 days for comment from stakeholders in order to further advance their thinking on their regulatory oversight of LDTs. In addition, the FDA convened a public meeting January 8-9, 2015 also for the purpose of stakeholders to provide input into the FDA process. 

The FDA&#8217;s LDT guidance documents, if and when finalized, may significantly impact the timing, availability and reimbursement of our future tests, and could require us to modify our business model in order to maintain compliance with these new requirements. For our dd-cfDNA test and all similar testing solutions, we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials to demonstrate clinical validity and utility of our test, and submit to the FDA a premarket approval application, or PMA, or 510(k) premarket notification application and obtain approval or clearance for the test before it can be commercialized. We cannot predict the ultimate timing or form of any FDA final guidance or regulation of LDTs, or when we must obtain regulatory approval or clearance for our LDT solutions. There can be no assurance that any of our tests or additional uses of our tests for which we seek clearance or approval in the future will be cleared or approved on a timely basis, or at all, nor can there be any assurance that labeling claims will be consistent with our current claims or adequate to support continued adoption of and reimbursement for our current and future tests. Moreover, any new FDA requirements could conflict with CLIA requirements and thereby complicate our compliance efforts. 

&#160;

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 

Under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by healthcare providers, such as us. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in healthcare transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. Penalties for violations of HIPAA regulations include civil and criminal penalties. 

We have developed policies and procedures to comply with these regulations. The requirements under these regulations may change periodically and could have an effect on our business operations if compliance becomes substantially more costly than under current requirements. 

In addition to federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality of health information that are applicable to our operations. New laws governing privacy may be adopted in the future as well. We have taken steps to comply with health information privacy requirements to which we are aware that we are subject. 

Federal and State Self-Referral Prohibitions 

We are subject to the federal self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law, and to similar state restrictions such as California&#8217;s Physician Ownership and Referral Act, commonly known as PORA. Where applicable, these restrictions generally prohibit us from billing patients or certain governmental or private payers for clinical laboratory testing services when the physician ordering the test, or any member of such physician&#8217;s immediate family, has an investment interest in, or compensation arrangement with, us, unless the arrangement meets an exception to the prohibition. 

Both the Stark Law and PORA contain exceptions for compensation paid to a physician for personal services rendered by the physician, provided that certain conditions are satisfied. We have compensation arrangements with a number of physicians for personal services, such as speaking engagements and specimen tissue preparation. We have structured these arrangements with terms intended to comply with the requirements of the applicable exceptions to Stark and PORA. However, we cannot be certain that regulators would find these arrangements to be in compliance with Stark, PORA or similar state laws. 

Sanctions for a violation of the Stark Law include the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

denial of Medicare payment for the services provided in violation of the prohibition; 

&#160;

&#183; 

refunds of amounts collected by an entity in violation of the Stark Law; 

&#160;

&#183; 

a civil penalty of up to $15,000 for each service arising out of the prohibited referral; 

&#160;

&#183; 

exclusion from federal healthcare programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

a civil penalty of up to $100,000 against parties that enter into a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law&#8217;s prohibition. 

Further, a violation of PORA is a misdemeanor and could result in civil penalties and criminal fines. Finally, other states have self-referral restrictions with which we have to comply that differ from those imposed by federal and California law. 

Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws 

Because of the significant federal funding involved in Medicare and Medicaid, Congress and the states have enacted, and actively enforce, a number of laws to eliminate fraud and abuse in federal healthcare programs. Our business is subject to compliance with these laws. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, which we refer to collectively as &#8220;the Affordable Care Act,&#8221; was enacted in the United States. The provisions of the Affordable Care Act are effective on various dates. The Affordable Care Act expands the government&#8217;s investigative and enforcement authority and 

&#160;

increases the penalties for fraud and abuse, including amendments to both the Anti-Kickback Sta tute and the False Claims Act, to make it easier to bring suit under these statutes. The Affordable Care Act also allocates additional resources and tools for the government to police healthcare fraud, with expanded subpoena power for HHS, additional fundi ng to investigate fraud and abuse across the healthcare system and expanded use of recovery audit contractors for enforcement. 

Anti-Kickback Statutes 

The federal healthcare programs&#8217; Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid. 

The definition of &#8220;remuneration&#8221; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, certain discounts, the furnishing of free supplies, equipment or services, credit arrangements, payment of cash and waivers of payments. Several courts have interpreted the statute&#8217;s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered businesses, the statute has been violated. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. In addition, violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute also are actionable under the Federal False Claims Act. 

Many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of recipients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 

Government officials have focused their enforcement efforts on the marketing of healthcare services and products, among other activities, and recently have brought cases against companies, and certain individual sales, marketing and executive personnel, for allegedly offering unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure their business. 

Federal False Claims Act 

Another development affecting the healthcare industry is the increased use of the federal False Claims Act, and in particular, action brought pursuant to the False Claims Act&#8217;s &#8220;whistleblower&#8221; or &#8220;qui tam&#8221; provisions. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has violated the False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought against healthcare providers by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claims law analogous to the False Claims Act, and many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payer and not merely a federal healthcare program. 

When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate instance of false claim. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The federal government has used the False Claims Act to assert liability on the basis of causing physicians to order excessive or unnecessary services, providing false documentation in support of claims, kickbacks, Stark Law violations and other improper referrals, and CLIA violations, in addition to the more predictable allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. In addition, the federal government has pursued enforcement actions under the False Claims Act in connection with off-label promotion of products. Our future activities relating to billing, compliance with CLIA and Medicare reimbursement requirements, physician and other healthcare provider financial relationships and the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. 

&#160;

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had a total of 95 employees, including 22 employees in sales and marketing and 33 employees in research and development. From time to time we also employ independent contractors, consultants and temporary employees to support our operations. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We have never experienced a work stoppage and believe that our relations with our employees are good. 

Environmental Matters 

Our operations require the use of hazardous materials (including biological materials) which subjects us to a variety of federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. Some of these regulations provide for strict liability, holding a party potentially liable without regard to fault or negligence. We could be held liable for damages and fines as a result of our, or others&#8217;, business operations should contamination of the environment or individual exposure to hazardous substances occur. We could also be subject to significant fines for failure to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements. We cannot predict how changes in laws or new regulations will affect our business, operations or the cost of compliance.
