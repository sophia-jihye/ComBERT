CNA FINANCIAL CORPORATION 

CNA Financial Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, &#147;CNA&#148;) was incorporated in 1967 and is an insurance holding company. CNA&#146;s property and casualty and remaining life &#38; group insurance operations are primarily conducted by Continental Casualty Company (&#147;CCC&#148;), incorporated in 1897, and The Continental Insurance Company (&#147;CIC&#148;), organized in 1853, and certain other affiliates. CIC became a subsidiary of CNA in 1995 as a result of the acquisition of The Continental Corporation (&#147;Continental&#148;). CNA accounted for 67.8%, 67.7% and 68.0% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. 

CNA&#146;s insurance products primarily include commercial property and casualty coverages, including surety.

CNA&#146;s property and casualty field structure consists of 49 underwriting locations across the United States. In addition, there are five centralized processing operations which handle policy processing, billing and collection activities and also act as call centers to optimize service. The claims structure consists of two regional claim centers designed to efficiently handle the high volume of low severity claims including property damage, liability and workers&#146; compensation medical only claims, and 16 principal claim offices handling the more complex claims. CNA also has a presence in Canada, Europe and Singapore consisting of 19 branch operations and access to business placed at Lloyd&#146;s of London (&#147;Lloyd&#146;s&#148;) through Hardy Underwriting Bermuda Limited (&#147;Hardy&#148;).

Property and Casualty Claim and Claim Adjustment Expenses 

The following loss reserve development table illustrates the change over time of reserves established for property and casualty claim and claim adjustment expenses at the end of the preceding ten calendar years for CNA&#146;s property and casualty insurance companies. The first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year. The second section, reading down, shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to the originally reported reserve liability. The third section, reading down, shows re-estimates of the originally recorded reserves as of the end of each successive year, which is the result of CNA&#146;s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries&#146; expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims. The last section compares the latest re-estimated reserves to the reserves originally established, and indicates whether the original reserves were adequate or inadequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims. 

&#160;

The loss reserve development table is cumulative and, therefore, ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years.

Other 

Competition: &#160; The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive both as to rate and service. CNA competes with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors and customers. Insurers compete on the basis of factors including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength. CNA must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve its insurance products and services. 

There are approximately 2,700 individual companies that sell property and casualty insurance in the United States. Based on 2014 statutory net written premiums, CNA is the eighth largest commercial insurance writer and the 14th largest property and casualty insurance organization in the United States. 

Regulation: The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision. Regulatory oversight by applicable agencies is exercised through review of submitted filings and information, examinations (both financial and market conduct), direct inquiries and interviews. Each domestic and foreign jurisdiction has established supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relative to licensing insurers and agents, approving policy forms, establishing reserve requirements, prescribing the form and content of statutory financial reports and regulating capital adequacy and the type, quality and amount of investments permitted. Such regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations, which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory, governance requirements and risk assessment practice and disclosure. In addition to regulation of dividends by insurance subsidiaries, intercompany transfers of assets may be subject to prior notice or approval by insurance regulators, depending on the size of such transfers and payments in relation to the financial position of the insurance subsidiaries making the transfer or payment. 

Domestic insurers are also required by state insurance regulators to provide coverage to insureds who would not otherwise be considered eligible by the insurers. Each state dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. CNA&#146;s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state. 

Further, domestic insurance companies are subject to state guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments. Guaranty funds are governed by state insurance guaranty associations which levy assessments to meet the funding needs of insolvent insurer estates. Other insurance-related assessments are generally levied by state agencies to fund various organizations including disaster relief funds, rating bureaus, insurance departments, and workers&#146; compensation second injury funds, or by industry organizations that assist in the statistical analysis and ratemaking process and CNA has the ability to recoup certain of these assessments from policyholders. 

As CNA&#146;s insurance operations are conducted in a multitude of both domestic and foreign jurisdictions, CNA is subject to a number of regulatory agency requirements in respect of a portion, or all, of its operations. These include, but are not limited to, the State of Illinois Department of Insurance (which is CNA&#146;s global group-wide supervisor), the U.K. Prudential Regulatory Authority and Financial Conduct Authority, the Bermuda Monetary Authority and the Office of Superintendent of Financial Institutions in Canada. 

Hardy is also supervised by the Council of Lloyd&#146;s, which is the franchisor for all Lloyd&#146;s operations. The Council of Lloyd&#146;s has wide discretionary powers to regulate Lloyd&#146;s underwriting, such as establishing the capital requirements for syndicate participation. In addition, the annual business plans of each syndicate are subject to the review and approval of the Lloyd&#146;s Franchise Board, which is responsible for business planning and monitoring for all syndicates. 

&#160;

Effective January 1, 2016, the European Union&#146;s executive body, the European Commission, implemented new capital adequacy and risk management regulations, Solvency II, that apply to CNA&#146;s European operations. Additionally, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (&#147;IAIS&#148;) continues to consider regulatory proposals addressing group supervision, capital requirements and enterprise risk management. The U.S. Federal Reserve, the U.S. Federal Insurance Office and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners are working with other global regulators to define such proposals. It is not currently clear to what extent the IAIS activities will impact CNA as any final proposal would ultimately need to be legislated or regulated by each individual country or state. 

Although the federal government does not currently directly regulate the business of insurance, federal legislative and regulatory initiatives can impact the insurance industry. These initiatives and legislation include proposals relating to potential federal oversight of certain insurers; terrorism and natural catastrophe exposures; cybersecurity risk management; federal financial services reforms; and certain tax reforms. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 was enacted on January 12, 2015. The reauthorization provides for a federal government backstop for insured terrorism risks for another six years with increases to the insurer co-payment and program trigger. The existence of the mitigating effects of such law is part of the analysis of CNA&#146;s overall risk posture for terrorism and, accordingly, its risk positioning may change if such law were modified. CNA also continues to invest in the security network of its systems on an enterprise-wide basis, especially considering the implications of data and privacy breaches. This requires an investment of a significant amount of resources by CNA on an ongoing basis. Potential implications of possible cybersecurity legislation on such current investment, if any, are uncertain. The foregoing proposals, either separately or in the aggregate, create a regulatory and legal environment that may require changes in CNA&#146;s business plan or significant investment of resources in order to operate in an effective and compliant manner. 

Additionally, various legislative and regulatory efforts to reform the tort liability system have, and will continue to, impact CNA&#146;s industry. Although there has been some tort reform with positive impact to the insurance industry, new causes of action and theories of damages continue to be proposed in state court actions or by federal or state legislatures that continue to expand liability for insurers and their policyholders.

DIAMOND OFFSHORE DRILLING, INC. 

Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (&#147;Diamond Offshore&#148;) is engaged, through its subsidiaries, in the business of operating drilling rigs that are chartered on a contract basis for fixed terms by companies engaged in the exploration and production of hydrocarbons. Offshore rigs are mobile units that can be relocated based on market demand. Diamond Offshore accounted for 18.1%, 19.7% and 20.0% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. 

Rigs: Diamond Offshore provides contract drilling services to the energy industry around the world with a fleet of 32 offshore drilling rigs, which include four jack-up rigs that are being marketed for sale. Diamond Offshore&#146;s fleet consists of 23 semisubmersibles including the Ocean GreatWhite , which is under construction, five jack-up rigs and four dynamically-positioned drillships including the last of Diamond Offshore&#146;s four newbuild drillships, the Ocean BlackLion, which was delivered in the second quarter of 2015. Diamond Offshore expects its harsh environment ultra-deepwater semisubmersible rig, the Ocean GreatWhite, to be delivered in mid-2016. 

A floater rig is a type of mobile offshore drilling unit that floats and does not rest on the seafloor. This asset class includes self-propelled drillships and semisubmersible rigs. Semisubmersible rigs consist of an upper working and living deck resting on vertical columns connected to lower hull members. Such rigs operate in a &#147;semi-submerged&#148; position, remaining afloat, off bottom, in a position in which the lower hull is approximately 55 feet to 90 feet below the water line and the upper deck protrudes well above the surface. Semisubmersibles hold position while drilling by use of a series of small propulsion units or thrusters that provide dynamic positioning (&#147;DP&#148;) to keep the rig on location, or with anchors tethered to the seabed. Although DP semisubmersibles are self-propelled, such rigs may be moved long distances with the assistance of tug boats. Non-DP, or moored, semisubmersibles require tug boats or the use of a heavy lift vessel to move between locations. 

A drillship is an adaptation of a maritime vessel that is designed and constructed to carry out drilling operations by means of a substructure with a moon pool centrally located in the hull. Drillships are typically self-propelled and are positioned over a drillsite through the use of a DP system similar to those used on semisubmersible rigs. 

Diamond Offshore&#146;s floater fleet (semisubmersibles and drillships) can be further categorized based on the nominal water depth for each class of rig as follows: 

&#160;

Category &#160; Rated Water Depth (a) (in feet) &#160; Number of Units in Fleet &#160;

Ultra-Deepwater

&#160; 7,501 to 12,000

&#160; 12 (b) 

Deepwater

&#160; 5,000 to 7,500

&#160; 7 

Mid-Water

&#160; 400 to 4,999

&#160; 8 

&#160;

(a) Rated water depth for semisubmersibles and drillships reflects the maximum water depth in which a floating rig has been designed to operate. However, individual rigs are capable of drilling, or have drilled, in marginally greater water depths depending on various conditions (such as salinity of the ocean, weather and sea conditions). 

(b) Includes the Ocean GreatWhite, a harsh environment semisubmersible rig under construction. 

Jack-up rigs are mobile, self-elevating drilling platforms equipped with legs that are lowered to the ocean floor. Diamond Offshore&#146;s jack-ups are used for drilling in water depths from 20 feet to 350 feet. The water depth limit in which a particular rig is able to operate is principally determined by the length of the rig&#146;s legs. The rig hull includes the drilling equipment, jacking system, crew quarters, loading and unloading facilities, storage areas for bulk and liquid materials, heliport and other related equipment. A jack-up rig is towed to the drillsite with its hull riding in the sea, as a vessel, with its legs retracted. Once over a drillsite, the legs are lowered until they rest on the seabed and jacking continues with the legs penetrating the seabed until they are firm and stable, and resistance is sufficient to elevate the hull above the surface of the water. After completion of drilling operations, the hull is lowered until it rests in the water and then the legs are retracted for relocation to another drillsite. All of Diamond Offshore&#146;s jack-up rigs are equipped with a cantilever system that enables the rig to cantilever or extend its drilling package over the aft end of the rig. 

&#160;

As of February 16, 2016, the Ocean Scepter , built in 2008, was operating offshore Mexico for Exploraci&#243;n Producci&#243;n (&#147;PEMEX&#148;), under a long term contract. In addition, Diamond Offshore has four other jack-up rigs which it is currently marketing for sale. 

Fleet Enhancements and Additions: Diamond Offshore&#146;s long term strategy is to upgrade its fleet to meet customer demand for advanced, efficient and high-tech rigs by acquiring or building new rigs when possible to do so at attractive prices, and otherwise by enhancing the capabilities of its existing rigs at a lower cost and shortened construction period than newbuild construction would require. Since 2009, commencing with the acquisition of two newbuild, ultra-deepwater semisubmersible rigs, the Ocean Courage and Ocean Valor , Diamond Offshore has committed over $5.0 billion towards upgrading its fleet. In mid 2015, Diamond Offshore took delivery of the Ocean BlackLion , the last of four ultra-deepwater drillships constructed in South Korea during Diamond Offshore&#146;s most recent fleet enhancement cycle. The Ocean GreatWhite remains under construction in South Korea with delivery of the new rig expected to occur in mid-2016. Upon completion of acceptance testing, the rig is expected to commence drilling operations offshore Australia later this year. 

Diamond Offshore will evaluate further rig acquisition and enhancement opportunities as they arise. However, Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance whether, or to what extent, it will continue to make rig acquisitions or enhancements to its fleet. 

Pressure Control by the Hour: In February of 2016, Diamond Offshore entered into a ten-year agreement with GE Oil &#38; Gas, (&#147;GE&#148;), to provide services with respect to certain blowout preventer and related well control equipment on Diamond Offshore&#146;s four newbuild drillships. Such services include management of maintenance, certification and reliability with respect to such equipment. In connection with the services agreement with GE, Diamond Offshore will sell the equipment to a GE affiliate and will lease back such equipment over separate ten-year operating leases. 

Markets: The principal markets for Diamond Offshore&#146;s contract drilling services are the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; &#160; South America, principally offshore Brazil and Trinidad and Tobago; 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; &#160; Australia and Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam; 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; &#160; the Middle East; 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; &#160; Europe, principally in the United Kingdom (&#147;U.K.&#148;) and Norway; 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; &#160; East and West Africa; 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; &#160; the Mediterranean; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; &#160; the Gulf of Mexico, including the U.S. and Mexico. 

Diamond Offshore actively markets its rigs worldwide. From time to time Diamond Offshore&#146;s fleet operates in various other markets throughout the world. 

Drilling Contracts: Diamond Offshore&#146;s contracts to provide offshore drilling services vary in their terms and provisions. Diamond Offshore typically obtains its contracts through a competitive bid process, although it is not unusual for Diamond Offshore to be awarded drilling contracts following direct negotiations. Drilling contracts generally provide for a basic fixed dayrate regardless of whether or not such drilling results in a productive well. Drilling contracts may also provide for reductions in rates during periods when the rig is being moved or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse weather conditions or other circumstances. Under dayrate contracts, Diamond Offshore generally pays the operating expenses of the rig, including wages and the cost of incidental supplies. Historically, dayrate contracts have accounted for the majority of Diamond Offshore&#146;s revenues. In addition, from time to time, Diamond Offshore&#146;s dayrate contracts may also provide for the ability to earn an incentive bonus from its customer based upon performance. 

&#160;

The duration of a dayrate drilling contract is generally tied to the time required to drill a single well or a group of wells, which Diamond Offshore refers to as a well-to-well contract, or a fixed period of time, in what Diamond Offshore refers to as a term contract. Many drilling contracts may be terminated by the customer in the event the drilling rig is destroyed or lost or if drilling operations are suspended for an extended period of time as a result of a breakdown of equipment or, in some cases, due to events beyond the control of either party to the contract. Certain of Diamond Offshore&#146;s contracts also permit the customer to terminate the contract early by giving notice; in most circumstances, this requires the payment of an early termination fee by the customer. The contract term in many instances may also be extended by the customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional length of time, generally at competitive market rates and mutually agreeable terms at the time of the extension. In periods of decreasing demand for offshore rigs, drilling contractors may prefer longer term contracts to preserve dayrates at existing levels and ensure utilization, while customers may prefer shorter contracts that allow them to more quickly obtain the benefit of declining dayrates. Moreover, drilling contractors may accept lower dayrates in a declining market in order to obtain longer-term contracts and add backlog. 

Customers: Diamond Offshore provides offshore drilling services to a customer base that includes major and independent oil and gas companies and government-owned oil companies. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, Diamond Offshore performed services for 19, 35 and 39 different customers. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, one of Diamond Offshore&#146;s customers in Brazil, Petr&#243;leo Brasileiro S.A. (&#147;Petrobras&#148;), (a Brazilian multinational energy company that is majority-owned by the Brazilian government), accounted for 24%, 32% and 34% of Diamond Offshore&#146;s annual total consolidated revenues. During 2015, ExxonMobil and Anadarko each accounted for 12% of Diamond Offshore&#146;s annual consolidated revenues. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of Diamond Offshore&#146;s annual total consolidated revenues during 2015, 2014 or 2013. 

As of February 16, 2016, Diamond Offshore&#146;s contract backlog was $5.2 billion attributable to 11 customers. All four of its drillships are currently contracted to work in the GOM. As of February 16, 2016, contract backlog attributable to Diamond Offshore&#146;s expected operations in the GOM was $510 million, $653 million and $653 million for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, and $626 million in the aggregate for the years 2019 to 2020 attributable to three customers. 

Competition : Despite consolidation in previous years, the offshore contract drilling industry remains highly competitive with numerous industry participants, none of which at the present time has a dominant market share. The industry may also experience additional consolidation in the future, which could create other large competitors. Some of Diamond Offshore&#146;s competitors may have greater financial or other resources than it does. Based on industry data as of the date of this report, there are approximately 840 mobile drilling rigs in service worldwide, including approximately 300 floater rigs. 

The offshore contract drilling industry is influenced by a number of factors, including global economies and demand for oil and natural gas, current and anticipated prices of oil and natural gas, expenditures by oil and gas companies for exploration and development of oil and natural gas and the availability of drilling rigs. 

Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Price is typically the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job. Customers may also consider rig availability and location, a drilling contractor&#146;s operational and safety performance record, and condition and suitability of equipment. Diamond Offshore believes it competes favorably with respect to these factors. 

Diamond Offshore competes on a worldwide basis, but competition may vary significantly by region at any particular time. Competition for offshore rigs generally takes place on a global basis, as these rigs are highly mobile and may be moved, at a cost that may be substantial, from one region to another. It is characteristic of the offshore contract drilling industry to move rigs from areas of low utilization and dayrates to areas of greater activity and relatively higher dayrates. Significant new rig construction and upgrades of existing drilling units could also intensify price competition. 

Governmental Regulation : Diamond Offshore&#146;s operations are subject to numerous international, foreign, U.S., state and local laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to its operations, including regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, requiring removal and clean-up under some 

&#160;

circumstances, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, and may include laws or regulations pertaining to climate change, carbon emissions or energy use. 

Operations Outside the United States: Diamond Offshore&#146;s operations outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 79%, 85% and 89% of its total consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. 

Properties: Diamond Offshore owns an office building in Houston, Texas, where its corporate headquarters are located, offices and other facilities in New Iberia, Louisiana, Aberdeen, Scotland, Macae, Brazil and Ciudad del Carmen, Mexico. Additionally, Diamond Offshore currently leases various office, warehouse and storage facilities in Australia, Egypt, Indonesia, Louisiana, Malaysia, Romania, Singapore, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, the U.K. and Vietnam to support its offshore drilling operations. 

BOARDWALK PIPELINE PARTNERS, LP 

Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP (&#147;Boardwalk Pipeline&#148;) is engaged in integrated natural gas and natural gas liquids and hydocarbons (herein referred to together as &#147;NGLs&#148;) transportation and storage and natural gas gathering and processing. Boardwalk Pipeline accounted for 9.3%, 8.6% and 8.4% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. 

We own approximately 51% of Boardwalk Pipeline comprised of 125,586,133 common units and a 2% general partner interest. A wholly owned subsidiary of ours, Boardwalk Pipelines Holding Corp. (&#147;BPHC&#148;) is the general partner and holds all of Boardwalk Pipeline&#146;s incentive distribution rights which entitle the general partner to an increasing percentage of the cash that is distributed by Boardwalk Pipeline in excess of $0.4025 per unit per quarter. 

Boardwalk Pipeline owns and operates approximately 14,090 miles of interconnected natural gas pipelines directly serving customers in 13 states and indirectly serving customers throughout the northeastern and southeastern U.S. through numerous interconnections with unaffiliated pipelines. Boardwalk Pipeline also owns and operates more than 435 miles of NGL pipelines in Louisiana and Texas. In 2015, its pipeline systems transported approximately 2.4 trillion cubic feet (&#147;Tcf&#148;) of natural gas and approximately 46.6 million barrels (&#147;MMBbls&#148;) of NGLs. Average daily throughput on Boardwalk Pipeline&#146;s natural gas pipeline systems during 2015 was approximately 6.7 billion cubic feet (&#147;Bcf&#148;). Boardwalk Pipeline&#146;s natural gas storage facilities are comprised of 14 underground storage fields located in four states with aggregate working gas capacity of approximately 205.0 Bcf and Boardwalk Pipeline&#146;s NGL storage facilities consist of nine salt dome storage caverns located in Louisiana with an aggregate storage capacity of approximately 24.0 MMBbls. Boardwalk Pipeline also owns three salt dome caverns and a brine pond for use in providing brine supply services and to support the NGL storage operations. 

The pipeline and storage systems of Boardwalk Pipeline consist of the following: 

The Gulf South pipeline system runs approximately 7,390 miles along the Gulf Coast in the states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. The pipeline system has a peak-day delivery capacity of 8.3 Bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 2.8 Bcf per day. Gulf South has ten natural gas storage facilities. The two natural gas storage facilities located in Louisiana and Mississippi have approximately 83.5 Bcf of working gas storage capacity and the eight salt dome natural gas storage caverns in Mississippi have approximately 46.0 Bcf of total storage capacity, of which approximately 29.6 Bcf is working gas capacity. Gulf South also owns undeveloped land which is suitable for up to five additional storage caverns. 

The Texas Gas pipeline system originates in Louisiana, East Texas and Arkansas and runs approximately 6,020 miles north and east through Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, and into Ohio, with smaller diameter lines extending into Illinois. The pipeline system has a peak-day delivery capacity of 4.8 Bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 2.6 Bcf per day. Texas Gas owns nine natural gas storage fields with 84.3 Bcf of working gas storage capacity. 

&#160;

The Gulf Crossing pipeline system originates in Texas and runs approximately 375 miles into Louisiana. The pipeline system has a peak-day delivery capacity of 1.9 Bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year ended December 31, 2015 was 1.2 Bcf per day. 

Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream and Boardwalk Petrochemical Pipeline (collectively &#147;Louisiana Midstream&#148;) provide transportation and storage services for natural gas, NGL&#146;s and ethylene, fractionation services for NGL&#146;s and brine supply services. These assets provide approximately 67.1 MMBbls of salt dome storage capacity, including approximately 7.6 Bcf of working natural gas storage capacity and approximately 24.0 MMBbls of salt dome NGL storage capacity, significant brine supply infrastructure including three salt dome caverns and approximately 270 miles of pipeline assets. 

Louisiana Midstream owns and operates the Evangeline Pipeline (&#147;Evangeline&#148;), which is an approximately 180 mile interstate ethylene pipeline that is capable of transporting approximately 2.6 billion pounds of ethylene per year between Texas and Louisiana, where it interconnects with Louisiana Midstream&#146;s ethylene distribution system. Throughput for Louisiana Midstream was 46.6 MMBbls for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Boardwalk Field Services operates natural gas gathering, compression, treating and processing infrastructure primarily in south Texas with approximately 290 miles of pipeline. 

In response to the change in the natural gas industry and the growth in the petrochemical industry, Boardwalk Pipeline is currently engaged in the following growth projects. See Liquidity and Capital Resources &#150; Boardwalk Pipeline for further discussion of capital expenditures and financing. 

Ohio to Louisiana Access Project: This project will provide long term firm natural gas transportation primarily from the Marcellus and Utica production areas to Louisiana, and while not creating additional capacity, would make a portion of Boardwalk Pipeline&#146;s Texas Gas system bi-directional. The project is supported by firm transportation contracts with producers and end-users and has a weighted average contract life of approximately 13 years. The project is expected to be placed into service in the second quarter of 2016. 

Southern Indiana Lateral Project: This project will consist of the construction of approximately 30 miles of pipeline from Indiana to Kentucky, adding approximately 0.1 Bcf per day of peak-day transmission capacity to Boardwalk Pipeline&#146;s Texas Gas system. The project is expected to be placed into service in the third quarter of 2016, with a weighted-average contract life of 19 years. 

Western Kentucky Market Lateral Project: This project consists of the construction of a pipeline lateral to provide deliveries to a proposed new power plant in Western Kentucky, adding approximately 0.2 Bcf per day of peak-day transmission capacity to Boardwalk Pipeline&#146;s Texas Gas system. The project is expected to be placed into service in the third quarter of 2016, with a weighted-average contract life of 20 years. 

Power Plant Project in South Texas: Boardwalk Pipeline&#146;s power plant project consists of the addition of compression facilities and modifications of existing facilities to increase the operating capacity of certain sections of the Gulf South pipeline, providing transportation services of 0.2 Bcf per day to a new power plant in South Texas. The project is expected to be placed into service in the third quarter of 2016, with a weighted-average contract life of 20 years. 

Northern Supply Access Project: This project will increase the peak-day transmission capacity on Boardwalk Pipeline&#146;s Texas Gas system by the addition of compression facilities and other system modifications to make this portion of the system bi-directional and is supported by precedent agreements for 0.4 Bcf per day of peak-day transmission capacity. The project is expected to be placed into service in the first half of 2017, with a weighted-average contract life of 16 years. In October of 2015, one of the foundation shippers which contracted for 0.1 Bcf per day of peak-day transmission capacity failed to post the required credit support on the contractually required date. Boardwalk Pipeline continues to work with the customer as well as explore all options for the capacity associated with that customer&#146;s precedent agreement, including adjusting the scope of the project to accommodate the reduced volume commitment. This project remains subject to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&#147;FERC&#148;) regulatory approval to commence construction. 

&#160;

Sulphur Storage and Pipeline Expansion Project: Boardwalk Pipeline executed a long term agreement to provide liquids transportation and storage services to support the development of a new ethane cracker plant in Louisiana. The project will involve significant storage and infrastructure development to serve petrochemical customers near Boardwalk Pipeline&#146;s Sulphur Hub and is expected to be placed into service in the second half of 2017. 

Coastal Bend Header Project: Boardwalk Pipeline executed precedent agreements with foundation shippers to transport natural gas to serve a planned liquefied natural gas (&#147;LNG&#148;) liquefaction terminal in Freeport, Texas. As part of the project Boardwalk Pipeline will construct an approximately 65-mile pipeline supply header with approximate 1.4 Bcf per day of capacity to serve the terminal. Additionally, Boardwalk Pipeline will expand and modify its existing Gulf South pipeline facilities that will provide access to additional supply sources through various interconnects in South Texas and in the Louisiana area. The project is expected to be placed into service in 2018, with a weighted-average contract life of 20 years. This project remains subject to FERC regulatory approval to commence construction. 

Brine Development Project: Boardwalk Pipeline executed agreements with a petrochemical customer in Louisiana to provide brine supply services subject to certain minimum take requirements. The first portion of the project, which was placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2015, consisted of constructing a pipeline to the customer&#146;s facilities to supply brine over a three year period. The second portion, expected to be placed in service in 2018, consists of providing brine supply services over a 15-year period through the development of additional wells and associated facilities. 

Customers: Boardwalk Pipeline serves a broad mix of customers, including producers of natural gas, and with end-use customers including local distribution companies, marketers, electric power generators, industrial users and interstate and intrastate pipelines who, in turn, provide transportation and storage services for end-users. These customers are located throughout the Gulf Coast, Midwest and Northeast regions of the U.S. 

Competition: Boardwalk Pipeline competes with numerous other pipelines that provide transportation, storage and other services at many locations along its pipeline systems. Boardwalk Pipeline also competes with pipelines that are attached to natural gas supply sources that are closer to some of its traditional natural gas market areas. In addition, regulators&#146; continuing efforts to increase competition in the natural gas industry have increased the natural gas transportation options of Boardwalk Pipeline&#146;s traditional customers. For example, as a result of regulators&#146; policies, capacity segmentation and capacity release have created an active secondary market which increasingly competes with Boardwalk Pipeline&#146;s natural gas pipeline services. Further, natural gas competes with other forms of energy available to Boardwalk Pipeline&#146;s customers, including electricity, coal, fuel oils and alternative fuel sources. 

The principal elements of competition among pipelines are availability of capacity, rates, terms of service, access to gas supplies, flexibility and reliability of service. In many cases, the elements of competition, in particular flexibility, terms of service and reliability, are key differentiating factors between competitors. This is especially the case with capacity being sold on a longer term basis. Boardwalk Pipeline is focused on finding opportunities to enhance its competitive profile in these areas by increasing the flexibility of its pipeline systems, such as modifying them to allow for bi-directional flows, to meet the demands of customers, such as power generators and industrial users, and is continually reviewing its services and terms of service to offer customers enhanced service options. 

Seasonality: Boardwalk Pipeline&#146;s revenues can be affected by weather, natural gas price levels, gas price differentials between locations on its pipeline systems (basis spreads), gas price differentials between time periods, such as winter to summer (time period price spreads) and natural gas price volatility. Weather impacts natural gas demand for heating needs and power generation, which in turn influences the short term value of transportation and storage across Boardwalk Pipeline&#146;s pipeline systems. Colder than normal winters can result in an increase in the demand for natural gas for heating needs and warmer than normal summers can impact cooling needs, both of which typically result in increased pipeline transportation revenues and throughput. While traditionally peak demand for natural gas occurs during the winter months driven by heating needs, the increased use of natural gas for cooling needs during the summer months has partially reduced the seasonality of revenues. In 2015, approximately 53% of Boardwalk Pipeline&#146;s operating revenues were recognized in the first and fourth quarters of the year. 

&#160;

Governmental Regulation: FERC regulates Boardwalk Pipeline&#146;s natural gas operating subsidiaries under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (&#147;NGA&#148;) and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. FERC regulates, among other things, the rates and charges for the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce and the extension, enlargement or abandonment of facilities under its jurisdiction. Where required, Boardwalk Pipeline&#146;s natural gas pipeline subsidiaries hold certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by FERC covering certain of their facilities, activities and services. The maximum rates that may be charged by Boardwalk Pipeline&#146;s subsidiaries operating under FERC&#146;s jurisdiction, for all aspects of the natural gas transportation services it provides, are established through FERC&#146;s cost-of-service rate-making process. Key determinants in FERC&#146;s cost-of-service rate-making process are the costs of providing service, the volumes of gas being transported, the rate design, the allocation of costs between services, the capital structure and the rate of return a pipeline is permitted to earn. The maximum rates that may be charged by Boardwalk Pipeline for storage services on Texas Gas, with the exception of services associated with a portion of the working gas capacity on that system, are established through FERC&#146;s cost-of-service rate-making process. FERC has authorized Boardwalk Pipeline to charge market-based rates for its firm and interruptible storage services for the majority of its natural gas storage facilities. 

In October of 2014, Boardwalk Pipeline&#146;s Gulf South subsidiary filed a rate case with the FERC pursuant to Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (Docket No. RP15-65) in which Gulf South requested, among other things, a reconfiguration of the transportation rate zones on its system and, in general, an increase in its tariff rates. In 2015, an uncontested settlement was reached with Gulf South&#146;s customers and approved by the FERC. The settlement will become effective March 1, 2016. 

The settlement provides for, among other things, (a) a system-wide rate design across the majority of the pipeline system; (b) a fuel tracker for determining future fuel rates; (c) a moratorium which prevents Gulf South or its customers from modifying the settlement rates until May 1, 2023, with certain exceptions; and (d) an extension of all No Notice Service (&#147;NNS&#148;) contracts to the end of the moratorium period at maximum rates, subject to each customer&#146;s right to reduce capacity under those agreements from current levels by up to 6% on April 1, 2016 and by up to another 6% of their remaining contract capacity by April 1, 2020. The NNS customers had to elect by December 1, 2015, whether they wanted to reduce their initial contracted capacity. Only two NNS customers elected to reduce their contracted capacity effective on April 1, 2016. The settled rates were moved into effect on November 1, 2015. Refunds for the difference between the rates as filed and as settled are required to be paid to customers by May 1, 2016. Please see &#147;Gulf South Rate Case&#148; under Item 7, Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (&#147;MD&#38;A&#148;). 

Boardwalk Pipeline is also regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation (&#147;DOT&#148;) through the Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration (&#147;PHMSA&#148;) under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended by Title I of the Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 (&#147;NGPSA&#148;) and the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 (&#147;HLPSA&#148;). The NGPSA and HLPSA govern the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of interstate natural gas and NGL pipeline facilities. Boardwalk Pipeline has received authority from PHMSA to operate certain natural gas pipeline assets under special permits that will allow it to operate those pipeline assets at higher than normal operating pressures of up to 0.80 of the pipe&#146;s Specified Minimum Yield Strength (&#147;SMYS&#148;). Operating at higher than normal operating pressures will allow these pipelines to transport all of the volumes Boardwalk Pipeline has contracted for with its customers. PHMSA retains discretion whether to grant or maintain authority for Boardwalk Pipeline to operate its natural gas pipeline assets at higher pressures. PHMSA has also developed regulations that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain high risk areas along Boardwalk Pipeline&#146;s pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in highly populated areas. The NGPSA and HLPSA were most recently amended by the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (&#147;2011 Act&#148;) in 2012, with the 2011 Act requiring increased maximum civil penalties for certain violations to $200,000 per violation per day, and a total cap of $2 million. In addition, the 2011 Act reauthorized the federal pipeline safety programs of PHMSA through 2015, and directs the Secretary of Transportation to undertake a number of reviews, studies and reports, some of which may result in more stringent safety controls or additional natural gas and hazardous liquids pipeline safety rulemaking. A number of the provisions of the 2011 Act have the potential to cause owners and operators of pipeline facilities to incur significant capital expenditures and/or operating costs. New pipeline safety legislation that will reauthorize the federal pipeline safety programs of PHMSA through 2019 will be under consideration. Passage of new legislation reauthorizing the PHMSA pipeline safety 

&#160;

programs is expected to require, among other things, pursuit of those legal mandates included in the 2011 Act but not acted upon by PHMSA. 

The Surface Transportation Board (&#147;STB&#148;), has authority to regulate the rates Boardwalk Pipeline charges for service on its ethylene pipelines. The STB requires that Boardwalk Pipeline&#146;s transportation rates be reasonable and that its practices cannot unreasonably discriminate among its ethylene shippers. 

Boardwalk Pipeline&#146;s operations are also subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment. Such laws and regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste and in connection with spills, releases, discharges and emissions of various substances into the environment. Environmental regulations also require that Boardwalk Pipeline&#146;s facilities, sites and other properties be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. 

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of corrective or remedial obligations, the occurrence of delays in the development of projects and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of Boardwalk Pipeline&#146;s operations in the affected areas. While Boardwalk Pipeline believes that its past operations have not resulted in the incurrence of material costs with respect to these existing environmental laws and regulations, it can provide no assurance that continued compliance with existing requirements will not materially affect them, or that the current regulatory standards will not become more onerous in the future, resulting in more significant costs to maintain compliance or increased exposure to significant liabilities. 

Properties: Boardwalk Pipeline is headquartered in approximately 103,000 square feet of leased office space located in Houston, Texas. Boardwalk Pipeline also leases approximately 60,000 square feet of office space in Owensboro, Kentucky. Boardwalk Pipeline&#146;s operating subsidiaries own their respective pipeline systems in fee. However, substantial portions of these systems are constructed and maintained on property owned by others pursuant to rights-of-way, easements, permits, licenses or consents.

(a) The hotel is subject to a land lease. Competition: Competition from other hotels and lodging facilities is vigorous in all areas in which Loews Hotels operates. The demand for hotel rooms is seasonal and dependent on general and local economic conditions. Loews Hotels properties also compete with facilities offering similar services in locations other than those in which its hotels are located. Competition among luxury hotels is based primarily on quality of location, facilities and service. Competition among resort and commercial hotels is based on price and facilities as well as location and service. Because of the competitive nature of the industry, hotels must continually make expenditures for updating, refurnishing and repairs and maintenance, in order to prevent competitive obsolescence. 

&#160;
