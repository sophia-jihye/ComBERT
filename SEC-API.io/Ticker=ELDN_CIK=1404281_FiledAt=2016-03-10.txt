 ITEM 1. BUSINESS Overview 

We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for prostate cancer and other hormonally-driven diseases. Our lead drug candidate, galeterone, is an oral small molecule that utilizes the mechanistic pathways of current second-generation androgen signaling inhibitors, while also introducing a distinct third mechanism &#150; androgen receptor degradation. We are developing galeterone for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC. 

We are conducting a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial comparing galeterone to Xtandi &#174; (enzalutamide) in approximately 148 treatment-na&#239;ve mCRPC patients whose prostate tumors express the AR-V7 splice variant. We refer to this clinical trial as ARMOR3-SV. We believe that the AR-V7 splice variant is the most common form of C-terminal loss, or the loss of the portion of the androgen receptor that contains the ligand-binding domain. C-terminal loss generally, and AR-V7 specifically, has been associated with poor responsiveness to commonly-used oral therapies for mCRPC. ARMOR3-SV is, to our knowledge, the first precision-medicine based pivotal clinical trial in prostate cancer. Selection of patients with AR-V7 is made using a clinical trial assay developed by our collaborator, Qiagen Manchester Limited, or Qiagen. We believe that the design of ARMOR3-SV is aligned with feedback that we obtained from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. We expect to complete enrollment in ARMOR3-SV by the end of 2016 and to have top-line data available from the study by mid-2017. We have been given fast track designation by the FDA for galeterone for the treatment of mCRPC. 

As of December 31, 2015, galeterone had been administered to over 250 prostate cancer patients and healthy volunteers in clinical trials. In these trials, which included patients whose tumor cells did not express AR-V7, galeterone was well tolerated and clinically meaningful reductions in levels of prostate specific antigen, or PSA, a biochemical marker used to evaluate prostate cancer patients for signs of response to therapy, were observed in prostate cancer patients. Therefore, and subject to the availability of resources, we anticipate expanding the clinical development of galeterone in other indications or patient populations in prostate cancer. 

We initially plan to conduct two additional open-label studies of galeterone in mCRPC patients who have shown resistance following treatment with either Xtandi or Zytiga &#174; (abiraterone acetate). The first of these studies, which we anticipate initiating in the first half of 2016, is an expansion of an arm of our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial of galeterone, referred to as ARMOR2, in mCRPC patients who have developed acquired resistance to Xtandi. The other study, which we also expect to initiate in the first half of 2016, is designed to evaluate galeterone in men whose mCRPC rapidly progressed after initial treatment with either Xtandi or Zytiga. We plan to evaluate all patients enrolled in this new Phase 2 clinical trial for the presence of AR-V7, but AR-V7 positive status is not a criterion for participation in this trial. 

We have worldwide development and commercialization rights to galeterone. To maximize the value of these rights, we intend to build a urology- and oncology-focused specialty sales and marketing organization in the United States to support the commercialization of galeterone. We intend to commercialize galeterone outside the United States through collaborations with third parties. 

Our Strategy 

Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes innovative therapies for the treatment of prostate cancer and other hormonally-driven diseases. Our strategy includes the following components: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Complete the clinical development of and seek marketing approval for galeterone for the treatment of AR-V7 positive mCRPC. ARMOR3-SV is designed to evaluate whether administration of galeterone 

&#160;

&#160; results in a statistically significant increase in radiographic progression free survival as compared to Xtandi in approximately 148 treatment-naive mCRPC patients whose prostate tumor cells express the AR-V7 splice variant. We expect ARMOR3-SV to be fully enrolled by the end of 2016, and to have top-line data from the trial by mid-2017. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Develop galeterone for other prostate cancer indications and patient populations. Although we are currently focusing our initial development of galeterone on the treatment of AR-V7 positive mCRPC patients, we intend to evaluate galeterone in additional mCRPC patient populations. To this end, we plan to expand an arm of ARMOR2 in mCRPC patients who have developed acquired resistance to Xtandi. We also expect to initiate a new Phase 2 clinical trial designed to evaluate galeterone in men whose mCRPC rapidly progressed after initial treatment with either Xtandi or Zytiga. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Maximize the commercial potential of galeterone. We have worldwide development and commercialization rights to galeterone. If galeterone is approved in the United States, we intend to build a urology- and oncology-focused specialty sales organization in the United States to support the commercialization of galeterone. We intend to commercialize galeterone outside the United States through collaborations with third parties. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Advance the development of our second-generation androgen receptor degradation agents. We have a drug discovery program, known as ARDA (androgen receptor degradation agents), under which we are identifying and developing novel compounds designed to have potent androgen receptor degradation activity. Our most advanced series of compounds from this program are currently in preclinical development. We plan to target compounds developed under our ARDA program for patients with androgen receptor signaling diseases, including prostate cancer, either alone or in combination with other products. The Treatment of Prostate Cancer 

Prostate Cancer Overview 

According to the American Cancer Society, in the United States, prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men other than skin cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates that, in the United States, approximately 215,000 new cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed annually, and approximately 28,000 men will die from the disease each year. Overall, in the United States, about one in seven men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during his lifetime, and about one in 36 men will die from the disease. 

Prostate cancer is most frequently diagnosed at an early stage, when it is confined to the prostate gland and its immediate surroundings. Advances in screening and diagnosis, including the widespread use of PSA screening, have allowed detection of the disease in its early stages in approximately 85% of all cases diagnosed in the United States. Patients with early-stage disease are typically treated with surgery or radiation therapy, or in limited circumstances, with both. For the majority of men, these procedures are successful in curing the disease. However, for others, these procedures are not curative and their prostate cancer ultimately recurs. Men with recurrent prostate cancer are considered to have advanced prostate cancer. In addition, about 15% of men diagnosed with prostate cancer have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Men with metastatic disease are also considered to have advanced prostate cancer. Men with advanced prostate cancer are most often treated with drug therapy. 

Treatment of Advanced Prostate Cancer 

The growth and survival of prostate cancer tumor cells depend primarily on the functioning of the androgen receptor signaling pathway. The pathway is ordinarily activated by the binding of androgens, such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, or DHT, to the ligand binding domain of androgen receptors in prostate cancer cells. Testosterone is primarily produced in the testes, adrenal glands and, to a lesser extent, in prostate cancer tumor cells. DHT is a product of enzymatic conversion of testosterone. Once binding has occurred, the bound androgen/

&#160;

androgen receptor complex passes into the nucleus of the tumor cell where it binds to DNA in the cancer cell, triggering abnormal cell growth and tumor progression. 

Because testosterone fuels prostate cancer growth, first-line therapy for advanced prostate cancer typically entails androgen deprivation therapy, or ADT, with luteinizing hormone releasing hormone, or LHRH, analogs such as the drug Lupron &#174; (leuprolide). ADT reduces testosterone to levels that are commensurate with the levels of a male who has had surgical castration to minimize the testosterone that would otherwise fuel prostate cancer growth. Early-stage patients who receive and respond to this treatment are considered to have hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. ADT has been the principal option for the initial treatment of advanced prostate cancer for more than 50 years. 

Most advanced prostate cancer patients initially respond to ADT. However, after initiation of ADT, almost all advanced prostate cancer patients experience a recurrence in tumor growth despite the reduction of testosterone to castrate levels. These patients are considered to be &#147;castration resistant,&#148; and cancer that has reached this state is considered to be castration-resistant prostate cancer, or CRPC. The development of CRPC following initiation of ADT is due in part to tumor cells that have adapted to the hormone-deprived environment of the prostate and is generally diagnosed based on either rising levels of PSA or disease progression as evidenced by imaging tests or clinical symptoms. Patients treated with LHRH analogs typically remain on those drugs for the remainder of their lives in order to maintain castrate levels of testosterone. 

During the course of ADT or following diagnosis of CRPC, most patients are treated with anti-androgens, which block the binding of androgens to the androgen receptor. An example of an anti-androgen marketed in the United States is the drug Casodex &#174; (bicalutamide). Like LHRH analogs, the anti-androgens suppress tumor growth for a period of time in many CRPC patients. However, almost all CRPC patients develop resistance to anti-androgen therapy. Unlike LHRH analogs, however, patients do not typically remain on these drugs because these drugs have been shown to cause tumor growth once the cancer becomes resistant to the treatment. We refer to initial hormonal treatments like LHRH analogs and Casodex as primary hormonal treatments. 

Patients with CRPC may have metastatic or non-metastatic disease. Metastatic cancer is cancer that has spread from the organ of origin to one or more locations in the body. Approximately 90% of mCRPC patients will develop metastases in the bone, which can cause pain, bone fracture, decreased quality of life and death. Approximately 30% of patients will develop metastases to solid organs, which can cause pain, decreased quality of life and potentially death. Metastases in the organs are referred to as visceral metastases. The liver and the lungs are the most common sites of visceral metastases. 

Prior to 2010, the next line of treatment for patients who became resistant to primary hormonal treatment with LHRH analogs and anti-androgens was chemotherapy. At that time, the chemotherapy drug Taxotere &#174; (docetaxel) was the primary FDA-approved treatment used for CRPC patients who were resistant to primary hormonal treatments, and there were no effective FDA-approved treatments for CRPC patients following chemotherapy. Since 2010, the FDA has approved five new agents for the treatment of patients with CRPC. These new treatments have provided patients with alternatives to chemotherapy and have resulted in differentiation of disease stages and new patient populations for which treatments can be developed. 

Of these new agents, the two with the highest worldwide sales in 2015 were Zytiga and Xtandi. Zytiga was reported to have worldwide 2015 sales of $2.2 billion, and Xtandi was reported to have worldwide 2015 sales of $1.9 billion. Zytiga and Xtandi are members of a class of new drugs that act by disrupting the androgen receptor signaling pathway. We refer to this class of drugs as secondary hormonal treatments. 

Zytiga is an oral secondary hormonal treatment approved by the FDA in April 2011 for use in combination with prednisone to treat men with post-chemotherapy mCRPC. In December 2012, the FDA expanded the approval of Zytiga in combination with prednisone to include treatment of pre-chemotherapy mCRPC patients. 

&#160;

Zytiga disrupts the androgen receptor signaling pathway by inhibiting CYP17 and reducing production of testosterone in the testes, adrenal glands and prostate cancer tumor cells. 

Xtandi is an oral secondary hormonal treatment approved by the FDA in August 2012 to treat men with post-chemotherapy mCRPC. In September 2014, the FDA expanded the approval of Xtandi to include treatment of pre-chemotherapy mCRPC patients. Xtandi is an androgen receptor antagonist that disrupts the androgen receptor signaling pathway by blocking the binding of testosterone or the androgen DHT with the androgen receptor. 

Other new agents include Jevtana &#174; (cabazitaxel), a chemotherapeutic agent for use in combination with prednisone to treat men with mCRPC following first-line chemotherapy, Provenge &#174; (sipuleucel-T), a prostate cancer immunotherapy to treat men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC, whether pre-chemotherapy or post-chemotherapy, and Xofigo &#174; (radium-223), a bone targeting radiopharmaceutical for the treatment of CRPC patients with symptomatic bone metastases and no visceral metastases that are detectable upon imaging. 

Prior to the approval of the new agents, patients had no effective treatment alternatives following chemotherapy. Each of the new agents, however, has been approved for use following chemotherapy. Patients who have undergone chemotherapy treatment and treatment with Zytiga or Xtandi and whose disease has progressed are referred to as salvage patients. There are only limited treatment options for salvage patients. 

The treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer varies depending on the status of the disease, including whether it is metastatic, and depending on the prior treatments that patients have undergone. Figure 1 below identifies the various patient populations within advanced prostate cancer and the treatments that are approved by the FDA for these populations. 

Figure 1: Summary of FDA Approved Treatments for Advanced Prostate Cancer Populations 

&#160;

&#160;

We are aware of a number of additional therapies that are in late stage clinical trials for prostate cancer, including additional secondary hormonal treatment candidates that are designed to act by the same mechanisms of action of Zytiga and Xtandi. 

&#160;

Despite the new therapies, including Zytiga and Xtandi and the additional drug candidates in late-stage clinical development, we believe that there continues to be an unmet need as there are patient populations that may not be effectively addressed by these therapies, such as mCRPC patients with C-terminal loss. Zytiga and Xtandi also have treatment limitations, including efficacy limitations, risk of resistance, risks associated with the co-administration of prednisone with Zytiga, a potential seizure risk observed with Xtandi and a complicated dosing regimen for Zytiga. 

Unmet Need in Prostate Cancer Patients with C-Terminal Loss 

The growth and survival of prostate cancer tumor cells depend primarily on the functioning of the androgen receptor signaling pathway. The pathway and tumor cell growth is ordinarily activated by the binding of androgens, such as testosterone and DHT, to the ligand binding domain of androgen receptors in prostate cancer cells. All proteins, including androgen receptors, are made up of a chain of amino acids that has an N-terminus at one end of the chain and a C-terminus at the other end of the chain as shown in the full-length androgen receptor depicted in Figure 2 below. In the case of androgen receptors, the C-terminus contains the ligand binding domain. The effectiveness of therapies like Zytiga and Xtandi, which act solely through CYP17 inhibition or androgen receptor antagonism, requires a functional ligand binding domain. As depicted in Figure 2 below, in the case of prostate tumor cells that express truncated androgen receptors with C-terminal loss, there is no functional ligand binding domain. This lack of a functional ligand binding domain causes the truncated androgen receptor to be constitutively active, or continuously signaling, meaning that activation of the androgen receptor pathway and tumor growth occurs even in the absence of androgens and androgen binding. As a result, we believe that patients with truncated androgen receptors with C-terminal loss may not be effectively treated by these therapies. 

Figure 2: Full-Length Androgen Receptor and Androgen Receptor with C-Terminal Loss 

&#160;

&#160;

These limitations of CYP17 inhibitors and androgen receptor antagonists have been supported by investigator-initiated studies conducted at several leading academic medical centers in which the presence of C-terminal loss or AR-V7 in patients was associated with poor responsiveness of patients&#146; prostate tumors to Zytiga and Xtandi. Published data, however, have shown activity of docetaxel, a chemotherapeutic agent, in AR-V7 positive mCRPC patients. 

MD Anderson . At The American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, 2014 Annual Meeting, researchers from MD Anderson presented data from a clinical study in which 60 mCRPC patients with bone metastases were treated with a sequential combination regimen of Zytiga and Xtandi. In the study, the researchers defined primary resistance as discontinuation of therapy due to symptomatic or imaging evidence of disease progression within four months of initiating treatment and benefit as discontinuation of therapy due to symptomatic or imaging evidence of disease progression at least four months after initiating treatment. In a subset of 15 patients who were evaluable for C-terminal loss, four patients were identified as having C-terminal loss, including two who were identified as having AR-V7. In this study, the researchers used antibody-based assays to identify the presence of C-terminal loss and AR-V7. All four, or 100%, of these patients showed 

&#160;

primary resistance. Of the 11 patients in the subset that did not have C-terminal loss or AR-V7, nine patients, or 82%, showed benefit. These data are set forth in Table 1 below. 

Table 1: Summary of MD Anderson C-Terminal Loss and AR-V7 Findings ( ASCO 2014 ) 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; N &#160; Primary Resistance &#160; &#160; Benefit &#160; AR-V7 positive

&#160; 2 &#160; &#160; 100%(2/2) &#160; &#160; &#160; 0%(0/2) &#160; C-terminal loss (excluding AR-V7)

&#160; 2 &#160; &#160; 100%(2/2) &#160; &#160; &#160; 0%(0/2) &#160; Negative for AR-V7 and C-terminal loss

&#160; 11 &#160; &#160; 18%(2/11) &#160; &#160; &#160; 82%(9/11) &#160; In addition, researchers from MD Anderson presented the results of a second study in an article published in European Urology in May 2014. In the study, the researchers evaluated bone biopsy specimens from CRPC patients with bone metastases that had been treated with Xtandi to evaluate the effects of Xtandi on cancer and to associate these effects with clinical observations. In the study, the researchers defined resistance and benefit as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; primary resistance, as discontinuation of therapy due to symptomatic or imaging evidence of disease progression within four months of initiating Xtandi treatment; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; moderate benefit, as discontinuation of therapy due to symptomatic or imaging evidence of disease progression within four to six months of initiating Xtandi treatment; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; prolonged benefit, as discontinuation of therapy due to symptomatic or imaging evidence of disease progression at least six months after initiating Xtandi treatment. The researchers evaluated a population of 23 patients who had two evaluable biopsies for AR-V7. As shown in Table 2 below, based on identification of AR-V7 at baseline, 86% of the patients with AR-V7 showed primary resistance, and 38% of the patients that did not have AR-V7 showed primary resistance.

&#160;

Outcome 

&#160; N &#160; Primary Resistance &#160; &#160; Moderate Benefit &#160; &#160; Prolonged Benefit &#160; AR-V7 positive

In a clinical trial conducted by Johns Hopkins and published in the New England Journal of Medicine in September 2014, researchers prospectively evaluated the effect of AR-V7 in patients with mCRPC on tumor responsiveness to treatment with Xtandi and Zytiga. In the trial, 31 patients received Xtandi, and 31 patients received Zytiga. In the trial, the presence of AR-V7 was determined by an analysis of circulating tumor cells, or CTCs, isolated from the patient&#146;s blood. In the Xtandi-treated group, 12 of the 31 patients were identified as having AR-V7. None of these 12 patients with AR-V7 achieved the trial&#146;s primary endpoint of maximal PSA reduction of at least 50%. Eleven of the 12 patients with AR-V7 did not achieve any PSA reduction. Ten of the 19 patients who did not have AR-V7 achieved a maximal PSA reduction of at least 50%. In addition, the median radiographic progression free survival, or rPFS, and the median overall survival of the patients with AR-V7 was 2.1 months and 7.4 months, respectively, compared to 6.1 months and 16.0 months, respectively, in the patients without AR-V7. The differences between the AR-V7 and non-AR-V7 groups in terms of the number of patients achieving a maximal PSA reduction of 50% and the improvements in median rPFS and overall survival were statistically significant. 

In the Zytiga-treated group, six of the 31 patients were identified as having AR-V7. None of the six patients with AR-V7 achieved any PSA reduction during treatment. Seventeen of the 25 patients who did not have AR-V7 achieved a maximal PSA reduction of at least 50%. The median rPFS and the median overall survival of 

&#160;

the patients with AR-V7 was 2.3 months and 11.1 months, respectively, and in each case had not been reached in the patients without AR-V7. The differences between the AR-V7 and non-AR-V7 groups in terms of the number of patients achieving a maximal PSA reduction of 50% and the improvements in median rPFS and overall survival were statistically significant. The data from the Johns Hopkins trial are summarized in Table 3 below.

* Results are considered statistically significant if they have a P-value of less than 0.05, meaning that there is less than a one-in-20 likelihood that the observed results occurred by chance. The Johns Hopkins researchers also reported the prevalence of AR-V7 in different patient groups participating in the trial based on the prior treatment the patient had received. Table 4 below sets out the percentage of patients in each prior treatment group who had AR-V7 as detected in CTCs. 

Table 4: Prevalence of AR-V7 in CRPC in the Johns Hopkins Trial ( New England Journal of Medicine )

&#160; &#160; 25.0 % Post-abiraterone acetate only 

&#160; &#160; 51.2 % Post-enzalutamide and post-abiraterone acetate

&#160; &#160; 66.7 % Based on these data, we believe that treatment with Xtandi and Zytiga may be associated with an increase in the prevalence of AR-V7 and cross-resistance to sequential therapy, thereby leaving patients who are treated with either Xtandi or Zytiga with no currently available secondary hormonal treatment options. By contrast, we believe galeterone has the potential to reduce the prevalence of AR-V7 through its mechanism of androgen receptor degradation. 

Memorial Sloan Kettering . At the European Society for Clinical Oncology 2014 Congress, researchers from Memorial Sloan Kettering presented data from a clinical study in which 85 mCRPC patients were treated with Xtandi, Zytiga or taxane-based chemotherapy. Of the 46 patients who received either Xtandi or Zytiga, 21 showed no reduction in PSA levels and were considered resistant to therapy and 25 showed a reduction in PSA levels and were considered to have had a clinical benefit. All patients were screened at baseline for C-terminal loss. A retrospective analysis was conducted in which patients with C-terminal loss were assessed as having demonstrated primary resistance or clinical benefit. Of the six patients identified as having C-terminal loss, no patient showed a clinical benefit. Sixty-three percent of the patients who did not have C-terminal loss showed clinical benefit. These data are summarized in Table 5 below.

Vancouver Prostate Centre . At the ASCO Genitourinary Cancers Symposium held in January 2016, researchers from the Vancouver Prostate Centre and the University of British Columbia presented data from a clinical study conducted in 37 mCRPC patients who had not received either Xtandi or Zytiga. In the trial, the presence of AR-V7 was determined using a whole blood assay that did not require analysis of CTCs. Four of the 37 patients, or 11%, were identified as being AR-V7 positive. Zytiga was administered to all 37 patients enrolled in the study. None of the AR-V7 positive patients achieved a maximal PSA reduction of at least 50%, while 42% of the AR-V7 negative patients achieved a maximal PSA reduction of at least 50%. The median progression-free survival and the median overall survival of the patients with AR-V7 were 0.7 months and 6.6 months, respectively, as compared to 4.0 months and 22.1 months in the AR-V7 negative patients. The data from the Vancouver trial are summarized in Table 6 below.

Overview 

Our lead product candidate, galeterone, is an oral small molecule that utilizes the mechanistic pathways of current second-generation androgen signaling inhibitors, while also introducing a distinct mechanism &#150; androgen receptor degradation. We are developing galeterone for the treatment of patients with mCRPC. 

We are conducting ARMOR3-SV, a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial comparing galeterone to Xtandi in approximately 148 treatment-naive mCRPC patients whose prostate tumors express the AR-V7 splice variant. We believe that the AR-V7 splice variant is the most common form of C-terminal loss, or the loss of the portion of the androgen receptor that contains the ligand-binding domain. C-terminal loss generally, and AR-V7 specifically, has been associated with poor responsiveness to commonly-used oral therapies for mCRPC. ARMOR3-SV is, to our knowledge, the first precision-medicine based pivotal clinical trial in prostate cancer. Selection of patients with AR-V7 is made using a clinical trial assay developed by our collaborator, Qiagen. We believe that the design of ARMOR3-SV is aligned with feedback that we obtained from the FDA and the EMA. We expect to complete enrollment in ARMOR3-SV by the end of 2016 and to have top-line data available from the study by mid-2017. We have been given fast track designation by the FDA for galeterone for the treatment of mCRPC. 

As of December 31, 2015, galeterone had been administered to over 250 prostate cancer patients and healthy volunteers in clinical trials. In these trials, which included patients whose tumor cells did not express AR-V7, galeterone was well tolerated and clinically meaningful reductions in PSA levels were observed in prostate cancer patients. Therefore, and subject to the availability of resources, we anticipate expanding the clinical development of galeterone in other indications or patient populations in prostate cancer. 

We initially plan to conduct two additional open-label studies of galeterone in mCRPC patients who have shown resistance following treatment with either Xtandi or Zytiga. The first of these studies, which we anticipate initiating in the first half of 2016, is an expansion of an arm of our ARMOR2 trial in mCRPC patients who have developed acquired resistance to Xtandi. The other study, which we also expect to initiate in the first half of 2016, is designed to evaluate galeterone in men whose mCRPC rapidly progressed after initial treatment with either Xtandi or Zytiga. We plan to evaluate all patients enrolled in this new Phase 2 clinical trial for the presence of AR-V7, but AR-V7 positive status is not a criterion for participation in this trial. 

&#160;

We have worldwide development and commercialization rights to galeterone. To maximize the value of these rights, we intend to build a urology- and oncology-focused specialty sales and marketing organization in the United States to support the commercialization of galeterone. We intend to commercialize galeterone outside the United States through collaborations with third parties. 

Key Differentiating Attributes of Galeterone 

Based on preclinical and clinical data, we believe that galeterone has advantages over Zytiga and Xtandi because of the following key differentiating attributes: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Potential for improved efficacy. We believe that galeterone, which combines the mechanism of action of androgen receptor degradation with the mechanisms of action of Zytiga (CYP17 inhibition) and Xtandi (androgen receptor antagonism), may further improve progression-free survival and overall survival beyond that of products that depend on only a single mechanism of action. In 2014, we reported efficacy data from a total of 107 CRPC patients in our ARMOR2 trial that showed clinically meaningful reductions in maximal PSA in patients in the trial. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Potential for efficacy in CRPC patients with C-terminal loss, including AR-V7. Because galeterone&#146;s distinct mechanism of action of androgen receptor degradation does not require an intact ligand binding domain to be effective against prostate cancer tumors, we believe galeterone may be effective in prostate cancer tumors that express altered androgen receptors with C-terminal loss, including AR-V7. In contrast, the mechanisms of action of Zytiga and Xtandi and other similar drugs in clinical development all require the presence of the ligand binding domain in order to be effective. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Potential for lower risk of resistance. We believe that galeterone may reduce the risk of or delay the development of resistance to therapy because galeterone addresses multiple mechanisms of action simultaneously. We believe that reducing resistance may delay the development of disease progression. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Potential for broad utility in prostate cancer. We believe that galeterone may be well suited to treat different prostate cancer patient populations, from early-stage prostate cancer patients to end-stage salvage mCRPC patients, because of its efficacy, safety and tolerability. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Favorable safety profile. As of December 31, 2015, we had administered galeterone to over 250 prostate cancer patients and healthy volunteers in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. In these trials, galeterone demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile. In our ARMOR2 trial, approximately 90% of all treatment-emergent related adverse events reported as of December 31, 2015 were grade 1 or 2 in severity and were generally manageable and reversible. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; No requirements for steroids. Unlike Zytiga, galeterone has not been shown in clinical trials to cause mineralocorticoid excess and does not require co-administration of steroids. Because Zytiga has been shown in clinical trials to cause mineralocorticoid excess, a potentially fatal syndrome characterized by hypertension, hypokalemia, fluid retention and edema, Zytiga is required to be administered with prednisone to reduce the frequency of patients exhibiting mineralocorticoid excess. Despite the co-administration of prednisone, however, approximately 30% of patients treated with Zytiga in a pivotal Phase 3 trial developed symptoms of mineralocorticoid excess. In addition, the chronic use of prednisone poses other safety concerns. Side effects associated with chronic use of prednisone include muscle weakness, osteoporosis, diabetes and increased risk of infection. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; No associated seizure risk. Unlike Xtandi, we have not had any reports of seizures in clinical trials of galeterone. A 0.9% risk of grand mal seizures was reported in the Xtandi pivotal Phase 3 trial in post-chemotherapy CRPC patients. These seizures have been linked to the inhibition or antagonism by Xtandi of GABA A , a receptor associated with the nervous system. Galeterone is not a GABA A antagonist. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Ease of dosing. Unlike the complicated dosing regimen for Zytiga, galeterone is dosed orally once per day and does not require the co-administration of steroids. We believe that this convenient dosing 

&#160;

&#160; regimen will enhance patient compliance. In contrast, Zytiga must be taken in a fasted state to avoid large increases in absorption, which may cause side effects. Zytiga also must be co-administered with steroids. Prednisone, the steroid co-administered with Zytiga, must be taken with food in order to avoid potential development of gastric ulcers. As a result, Zytiga and prednisone cannot be taken together and dosing must be carefully coordinated with food intake, resulting in a staggered dosing regimen of pills three times per day. 

Galeterone Clinical Development 

We refer to our clinical development program for galeterone as the Androgen Receptor Modulation Optimized for Response, or ARMOR, program. We submitted an investigational new drug application, or IND, to the FDA for galeterone for the treatment of CRPC in August 2009 and began clinical trials of galeterone in November 2009. As of December 31, 2015, we had enrolled 121 CRPC patients in our ongoing ARMOR2 trial and 49 CRPC patients in our Phase 1 ARMOR1 trial, which used a prior formulation of galeterone. In four additional Phase 1 clinical trials, we also administered galeterone to 102 healthy volunteers. We are currently enrolling patients in ARMOR3-SV, our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of galeterone. 

ARMOR2 

In December 2012, we initiated our ARMOR2 trial, an open label Phase 2 clinical trial of galeterone. The trial was designed as a two-part trial. Part 1 of the trial was a dose escalation phase designed to confirm the dose of galeterone to be evaluated in Part 2 of the trial. Part 2 of the trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of galeterone at the dose selected in Part 1 in distinct CRPC patient populations. Enrollment in the trial has been completed. As of December 31, 2015, 11 patients were still participating in the trial. 

The primary efficacy endpoints of our ARMOR2 trial are based on a decrease in PSA levels. In setting the primary endpoints of the trial, we considered the standard, accepted use of monitoring PSA levels to determine if a patient&#146;s prostate cancer is responding to therapy as well as the use of reductions in PSA levels as a key efficacy endpoint in Phase 2 clinical trials of other prostate cancer agents, as set forth in guidelines developed by the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2, or PCWG2. PCWG2 is an international group of prostate cancer investigators who published guidelines for the design and evaluation of prostate cancer trials. 

Part 1 of ARMOR2 Trial. In Part 1 of the trial, we enrolled 25 CRPC treatment-na&#239;ve patients with progressive disease and three patients whose disease progressed during treatment with Zytiga, whom we refer to as Zytiga-refractory patients. The CRPC treatment-na&#239;ve patients were enrolled in one of three escalating dose cohorts: six patients at 1700 mg/day, 11 patients at 2550 mg/day and eight patients at 3400 mg/day. The Zytiga-refractory patients all received doses of 2550 mg/day. All patients in Part 1 of the trial received treatment for up to an initial period of 12 weeks followed by optional continued dosing for those patients who tolerated treatment and did not show signs of disease progression. Treatment was continued until disease progression or patient withdrawal due to adverse events or other reasons. 

At least 50% of patients at all dose levels achieved a 30% or greater decrease in PSA. Based on the recommendation of the monitoring committee for the trial following review of safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic results of the three dose groups, we chose the 2550 mg/day dose for further study in Part 2 of the ARMOR2 trial. 

Part 2 of ARMOR2 Trial. In Part 2 of ARMOR2, we initially enrolled 93 patients and are evaluating galeterone dosed at 2550 mg/day in the following CRPC populations: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; non-metastatic CRPC and mCRPC treatment-na&#239;ve patients; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Zytiga-refractory patients; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; patients whose disease progressed during treatment with Xtandi, whom we refer to as Xtandi-refractory patients. &#160;

The primary endpoints for Part 2 of ARMOR2 were as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Treatment-na&#239;ve patients: percentage of patients having a maximal reduction in PSA levels of at least 30% from baseline to the end of the primary treatment phase; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Zytiga-refractory and Xtandi-refractory patients: percentage of change in PSA levels from baseline to the end of the primary treatment phase. Additional endpoints include incidence of adverse events, change from baseline in safety parameters, response rate, and CTC enumeration and characterization, including for the evaluation of C-terminal androgen receptor expression in relation to N-terminal androgen receptor expression to identify C-terminal loss and the lack of a functional ligand binding domain. 

Patients enrolled in Part 2 of the trial were to receive treatment with galeterone at a dose of 2550 mg/day for an initial period of up to 12 weeks, followed by optional continued dosing in an extension phase for those patients who tolerated treatment and did not show signs of disease progression. Treatment is continued until disease progression or patient withdrawal due to adverse events or other reasons. Enrollment of these 93 patients was completed in July 2014 and, as of December 31, 2015, 11 patients remained on study in the extension phase. 

We recently re-opened the arm of ARMOR2 evaluating Xtandi-refractory patients to enroll up to 21 additional patients. See &#147;&#151;Galeterone Development Program&#150; Other Development Activities&#148; below. 

Phase 2 Data Presentation. In November 2014, we presented interim efficacy and safety data from our ARMOR2 trial for patients who received the 2550 mg/day dose of galeterone at the EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, or EORTC. In 60 evaluable treatment-na&#239;ve CRPC patients in Part 1 and Part 2 of the trial who received the 2550 mg/day dose of galeterone, during the first 12 weeks of dosing, 83% had a maximal reduction in PSA levels of at least 30%, and 70% had a maximal reduction in PSA levels of at least 50%, as described in Figure 3 below.

Treatment-Na&#239;ve CRPC Patients 

(n=60) (2550 mg dose) 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In 38 treatment-na&#239;ve mCRPC patients who received the 2550 mg/day dose, during the first 12 weeks of dosing, 84% had a maximal reduction in PSA levels of at least 30%, and 76% had a maximal reduction in PSA levels of at least 50%, as described in Figure 4 below. 

Figure 4: ARMOR2: 12-Week Maximal PSA Response Waterfall Plot in 

Treatment-Na&#239;ve mCRPC Patients Treated (n=38) (2550 mg dose) 

&#160;

&#160;

We also reported 12-week data for 37 Zytiga-refractory patients, 13 of whom showed a reduction in PSA levels, and nine Xtandi-refractory patients, five of whom showed a reduction in PSA levels. 

Of the 16 treatment-na&#239;ve patients evaluable by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, or RECIST, three patients had a partial response and 11 patients had stable disease. Fifteen of the Zytiga-refractory patients and three of the Xtandi-refractory patients were evaluable by RECIST. Of these patients, five Zytiga-refractory patients had stable disease, and one Xtandi-refractory patient had stable disease. As measured by RECIST criteria, stable disease is achieved when the tumor has not increased in size by 20% and has not decreased by 30%, a partial response occurs when the tumor has decreased in size by at least 30%, and progressive disease occurs when the tumor has increased in size by at least 20% or new tumor lesions are identified. 

Our ARMOR2 trial included CTC enumeration and characterization. At EORTC, we presented data from a retrospective subset analysis in which seven treatment-na&#239;ve CRPC patients in ARMOR2 were identified as having C-terminal loss as determined by the evaluation of C-terminal androgen receptor expression in relation to N-terminal androgen receptor expression. The assay used to evaluate C-terminal loss was the same one used in the study conducted at Memorial Sloan Kettering described above. As shown in Figure 5 below, six of these patients had maximal reductions in PSA levels of at least 50%. The seventh patient, who did not show any PSA reduction, discontinued therapy due to an adverse event unrelated to galeterone after approximately six weeks in the trial and did not receive the full treatment regimen. These data are supportive of galeterone&#146;s mechanism of action of androgen receptor degradation, which does not require a functional ligand binding domain. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

At EORTC, we also presented interim safety results from all 107 patients treated in the 2550 mg/day dose cohort as of October 14, 2014 in ARMOR2. In these patients, galeterone was well tolerated. Approximately 90% of all treatment-emergent related adverse events reported were grade 1 or 2 in severity and were generally manageable and reversible. The majority of these events were assessed as not related or unlikely related to galeterone. In addition, there were no reported cases of seizure or mineralocorticoid excess. The most common treatment-emergent related adverse events were nausea, fatigue, pruritus, decreased appetite, diarrhea, hypokalemia and vomiting. 

As of December 31, 2015, nine of the 121 patients enrolled in ARMOR2 experienced a serious adverse event that was assessed by the investigator as related or possibly related to the administration of galeterone. No single treatment-related serious adverse event occurred in more than one patient. To date, no adverse events have resulted in interruptions or delays of our clinical trials. 

ARMOR3-SV 

We are currently enrolling patients in ARMOR3-SV, our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of galeterone. ARMOR3-SV trial is a randomized clinical trial comparing galeterone to Xtandi in approximately 148 treatment-na&#239;ve mCRPC patients whose prostate tumors express the AR-V7 splice variant. Under the trial protocol, patients are randomized on a one-to-one basis to receive either galeterone or the control arm treatment, Xtandi. Patients in the galeterone arm receive a dose of 2550 mg/day, and patients in the Xtandi arm receive a dose of 160 mg/day. All patients will continue to receive treatment until they have radiographic evidence of disease progression as determined by a blinded, independent central imaging assessment or patient withdrawal due to adverse events or other reasons. We have established an independent data monitoring committee for the trial. We believe the design of ARMOR3-SV is aligned with feedback that we obtained from the FDA and the EMA. 

Only patients with the AR-V7 splice variant are being enrolled in the trial. These patients are identified by analysis of a blood sample at a central laboratory using an AR-V7 specific clinical trial assay developed under our collaboration with Qiagen. We expect that we may need to screen more than 1,500 patients to identify and enroll the target number of 148 patients with AR-V7. 

The primary endpoint of the trial is rPFS as determined by a blinded, independent central imaging assessment measured from the time of patient randomization to the time of radiographic evidence of disease progression or time of death from any cause. In order to achieve the primary endpoint, results from the trial must demonstrate an 82% increase in median rPFS in the galeterone arm as compared to the Xtandi arm. Such a result 

&#160;

would be statistically significant and would likely be considered a clinically relevant outcome. The secondary endpoints include overall survival, safety, and time to next anti-cancer intervention or time to next cytotoxic therapy. 

ARMOR3-SV is being conducted at over 100 clinical sites in several countries across North America, Western Europe and Australia. We expect to complete enrollment in the trial by the end of 2016 and to have top-line data from the trial by mid-2017. Our anticipated time to completion of enrollment and top-line data is subject to our continued ability to initiate clinical trial sites, our ability to recruit eligible patients, the prevalence of patients with the AR-V7 splice variant, the sensitivity of our clinical trial assay in detecting AR-V7 in patients, the satisfaction by AR-V7 positive patients of other eligibility criteria for participation in the trial, and disease progression of the patients enrolled in the trial. The rate of patient enrollment in the trial is difficult to predict as we have limited experience recruiting patients with AR-V7 for a clinical trial, and the percentage of mCRPC patients with AR-V7 is subject to widely varying projections in published literature. Moreover, because we have not previously conducted a clinical trial of galeterone in patients with AR-V7 or conducted a clinical trial using our AR-V7 clinical trial assay, and clinical trials of Xtandi in AR-V7 positive patients have only been conducted in a limited number of patients at single clinical sites, our assumptions concerning patient prevalence and rates of disease progression may be incorrect. In addition, a higher percentage of AR-V7 positive patients than we anticipate may elect not to participate in ARMOR3-SV or fail to meet the other eligibility criteria for participation in the trial. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will fully enroll, have top-line data from, or complete the trial when we anticipate. 

Prospective Identification of AR-V7 

We have entered into a collaboration with Qiagen to develop the clinical trial assay being used in ARMOR3-SV and to develop and commercialize a companion diagnostic test based on that assay for use with galeterone. Clinical data obtained with the clinical trial assay in the ARMOR3-SV trial will be used by Qiagen to support regulatory filings for the approval of the companion diagnostic for AR-V7 and by us to support our regulatory filings for approval of galeterone. We have also entered into an exclusive, worldwide license with Johns Hopkins to patent applications and know how covering certain assays to identify androgen receptor variants for use as a companion diagnostic with galeterone. One of these assays was used by Johns Hopkins in its prospectively designed clinical trial, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine , which assessed the impact of AR-V7 expression on patient responsiveness to Zytiga and Xtandi. We have discussed with the FDA our development strategy and plans for identifying AR-V7 patients in the ARMOR3-SV trial, including our plans to develop a companion diagnostic test based on our clinical trial assay. While we were not required to submit an investigational device exemption, or IDE, for the clinical trial assay to the FDA before we started screening patients in the ARMOR3-SV trial, we believe that the companion diagnostic test will need to be approved by the FDA through its Premarket Approval, or PMA, process. We anticipate that Qiagen will seek approval for the companion diagnostic test by the FDA in parallel with our seeking approval of galeterone in the United States. 

We have also consulted with the EMA regarding our development strategy and plans for identifying AR-V7 patients in our ARMOR3-SV trial. Based on these consultations, we believe that the companion diagnostic test will need to be CE marked in connection with the submission for regulatory approval in the European Union. We have arranged with Qiagen to meet this requirement. 

Under our agreement with Qiagen, Qiagen is responsible for developing, and obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for the AR-V7 companion diagnostic test in the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia and such other countries as we and Qiagen may agree. In addition, Qiagen has agreed to use commercially reasonable and diligent efforts to manufacture the companion diagnostic test and to make the companion diagnostic test commercially available in those countries in which we have obtained regulatory approval for, and have valid patent claims covering, galeterone. Qiagen will be responsible for commercializing the companion diagnostic in each such country. If Qiagen elects not to commercialize the companion diagnostic test itself in any such country, for so long as there are valid patent claims covering galeterone in such country, 

&#160;

Qiagen has agreed to procure alternative distribution channels or otherwise supply the companion diagnostic test to us in order for us to market galeterone in combination with the companion diagnostic test. Upon our request, we and Qiagen have also agreed to negotiate in good faith to expand the scope of the projects under the agreement to, among other things, provide for the development and commercialization of the AR-V7 companion diagnostic test for use with galeterone in Japan. 

Subject to the terms of our agreement with Qiagen, we will pay Qiagen an approximate aggregate amount of up to $7.4 million over the term of the development program, including amounts paid to Qiagen for us to have the exclusive right to have CTC enrichment technology used in the development of the clinical trial assay. In addition, we have agreed to reimburse Qiagen for certain direct, out-of-pocket costs incurred by Qiagen, including for sample materials, which costs are estimated to equal in the aggregate up to $2.2 million. These amounts are subject to adjustment if we and Qiagen determine that changes in the scope of the development program are required. As of December 31, 2015, we have expensed an aggregate of $3.3 million in fees and $0.9 in out-of-pocket costs under our agreement with Qiagen. Following commercialization, we will have no further payment obligations to Qiagen under the agreement. We will not, however, receive any revenues from future sales, if any, of the AR-V7 companion diagnostic test. 

The agreement with Qiagen expires on the later to occur of (i) the fifth anniversary of regulatory approval of the AR-V7 companion diagnostic test and (ii) the expiration of Qiagen&#146;s commercialization obligations under the agreement. We are permitted to terminate the agreement for convenience upon 180 days&#146; written notice to Qiagen. Either party may terminate the agreement upon 60 days&#146; written notice to the other party based on uncured material breaches by the other party and may terminate the agreement immediately based on the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. 

Other Development Activities 

Although we are currently focusing our initial development of galeterone on the treatment of AR-V7 positive mCRPC patients, we intend to evaluate galeterone in additional mCRPC patient populations. To this end, we recently re-opened the arm of ARMOR2 evaluating Xtandi-refractory patients in order to enroll up to 21 additional patients and expect to begin enrolling patients in this expansion cohort in the first half of 2016. The expansion of this arm of the study follows a compelling response seen in one Xtandi-refractory patient initially enrolled in ARMOR2. This patient did not show a PSA response until after seven months of galeterone treatment, at which time the patient&#146;s PSA level rapidly dropped by over 90 percent and, as of December 31, 2015, has remained at less than 0.1&#181;g/L for over a year. The PSA response curve of this patient is described in Figure 6 below. 

Figure 6: PSA Response of Xtandi-Refractory Patient Enrolled in ARMOR2 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

None of the Xtandi-refractory or Zytiga-refractory patients enrolled in ARMOR2 remained on study for more than seven months, other than the patient who experienced the PSA response described in Figure 6. We plan to evaluate whether, in patients who have developed acquired resistance to Xtandi following prolonged benefit, longer-term administration of galeterone is required in order to demonstrate clinical benefit with galeterone. We plan to assess reduction in PSA levels and safety in these 21 additional patients. 

We also expect to initiate in the first half of 2016 a new Phase 2 clinical trial designed to evaluate galeterone in men whose mCRPC rapidly progressed after initial treatment with either Xtandi or Zytiga. We plan to evaluate all patients enrolled in this open-label trial for the presence of AR-V7 using our clinical trial assay, but AR-V7 positive status is not a criterion for inclusion in the trial. 

Galeterone Mechanisms of Action 

The androgen receptor signaling pathway is the primary pathway that drives prostate cancer growth and has been implicated in other hormonally driven diseases. The pathway is ordinarily activated by the binding of androgens, such as testosterone and DHT, to the ligand binding domain of androgen receptors in prostate cancer cells. Galeterone disrupts the activation of the pathway through multiple mechanisms of action: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; androgen receptor degradation, which reduces the amount of androgen receptor protein in the tumor cells; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; inhibition of the enzyme CYP17, which blocks the synthesis of testosterone; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; androgen receptor antagonism, which blocks the binding of testosterone or DHT with the androgen receptor. To our knowledge, there are no approved drugs or drugs in clinical development, other than galeterone, with multiple mechanisms of action including androgen receptor degradation. 

In order to demonstrate galeterone&#146;s multiple mechanisms of action, we conducted preclinical studies with respect to each mechanism. 

Androgen Receptor Degradation 

Galeterone decreases the amount of androgen receptor protein in prostate tumor cells by enhancing degradation of the androgen receptor. This reduces the number of androgen receptors in the tumor cells to which androgen can bind and decreases the sensitivity of androgen responsive cells to androgens. During the ASCO Genitourinary Cancers Symposium held in January 2016, we presented data describing the mechanism by which galeterone induces androgen receptor degradation in forms of the disease that exhibit a full-length androgen receptor, as well as in those with a truncated androgen receptor where the ligand-binding domain is not present, such as in AR-V7 positive and AR 567es positive disease. We believe that these and earlier observations suggest that an intact ligand binding domain is not required for galeterone-induced androgen receptor degradation. 

To elucidate this galeterone mechanism further, our researchers conducted a series of biochemical and cell-based in vitro studies that identified two deubiquitinating enzymes that galeterone selectively inhibits &#150; USP12 and USP46. Neither Zytiga nor Xtandi were shown to inhibit these enzymes. By doing so, galeterone induces androgen receptor degradation through a distinct mechanism that does not exist with other currently available androgen receptor-targeting agents. These new data provide a strong preclinical rationale for galeterone&#146;s ability to induce androgen receptor degradation, even in the absence of the ligand binding domain. 

The effect of galeterone to reduce androgen receptor levels has also been observed in tumor cell lines and a xenograft model in mice. We have observed this effect of galeterone in varying degrees in prostate cancer cell lines that express non-mutated full-length androgen receptor and multiple forms of androgen receptor alterations, including splice variants such as AR-V7, and point mutations, which are single amino acid mutations in the protein sequence of the androgen receptor. 

&#160;

CYP17 Lyase Inhibition 

Like Zytiga, galeterone is an inhibitor of CYP17, a protein with two enzymatic functions: hydroxylase and lyase. Because CYP17 plays a central role in synthesizing the androgens that drive tumor cell growth, CYP17 inhibitors have been developed to treat patients with CRPC. Selectively blocking CYP17 lyase reduces the production of key androgen precursors. However, inhibition of the CYP17 hydroxylase causes an accumulation of certain steroids, such as progesterone, deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone, and a reduction in cortisol, which can result in mineralocorticoid excess. An ideal CYP17 inhibitor will selectively block the lyase function of CYP17 relative to hydroxylase so that these steroids do not accumulate to the extent that they cause mineralocorticoid excess. 

We conducted preclinical studies of galeterone and abiraterone to evaluate their relative selectivity with respect to the inhibition of the hydroxylase and lyase functions of CYP17. In these studies, galeterone was shown to selectively block the lyase function of CYP17 relative to the hydroxylase function. In contrast, abiraterone more selectively blocked the hydroxylase function relative to the lyase function, consistent with its published risk for mineralocorticoid excess. 

Consistent with these findings, in further preclinical studies in cell cultures, we observed that galeterone inhibited testosterone synthesis comparable to abiraterone, but that abiraterone significantly lowered cortisol levels as compared to galeterone. We believe that this difference is due in part to galeterone&#146;s selective inhibition of the lyase function of CYP17. 

Androgen Receptor Antagonism 

Like Xtandi, galeterone blocks androgens from binding to the androgen receptor. This results in reduced translocation of the androgen receptor into the cell nucleus, which prevents the androgen receptor from acting as a transcription factor and decreases the expression of androgen-responsive genes that drive tumor growth. In in vitro studies, galeterone has shown potency of antagonism greater than or comparable to other androgen receptor antagonists, including enzalutamide. 

Preclinical Development 

We have conducted in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies to evaluate galeterone&#146;s effect on prostate cancer, including the efficacy of galeterone in hormone-sensitive tumor cell lines, in tumors expressing AR-V7 and other splice variants, and in tumors expressing androgen receptor point mutations. 

Activity in Hormone Treatment-Resistant Prostate Cancer 

We believe that galeterone has the potential to treat tumors that are resistant to hormone treatments because of its differentiated mechanisms of action. In preclinical studies, others have reported key mechanisms of resistance in hormone treatment-resistant prostate cancer, which include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; increased CYP17 enzyme levels; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; increased production of testosterone and DHT; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; increased wild type or mutant androgen receptor levels; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; alterations in the androgen receptor, such as splice variants and point mutations; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; mutations in the androgen receptor that result in activation by steroids, such as prednisone and progesterone; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; androgen receptor mutations which convert androgen antagonists into agonists thus leading to activation of the receptor. &#160;

Activity in Tumors Expressing Splice Variants, including AR-V7 

Androgen receptor splice variants are produced in tumor cells due to an aberrant RNA splicing event. As a result, a truncated androgen receptor protein is synthesized that lacks the C-terminal end of the protein, the region of the protein responsible for androgen binding. Tumor cells that express altered androgen receptors that lack the C-terminal end of the protein are not responsive to agents whose activity requires a functional ligand binding domain. In addition, the lack of the ligand binding domain causes the remaining splice variants to be constitutively active, or continuously signaling, meaning that activation of the androgen receptor pathway and tumor growth occurs even in the absence of androgens and androgen binding. This indicates the importance of androgen receptor degradation to the prevention of tumor growth. 

As a follow-up to preclinical studies in which galeterone had caused degradation of full-length androgen receptors, preclinical studies were conducted in independent laboratories to determine whether galeterone also causes androgen receptor degradation in splice variant proteins. 

In preclinical studies, we measured androgen receptor degradation using cell lines that expressed full-length and splice variant androgen receptors. These cells model the expression patterns described in human tumor samples where full-length and splice variant androgen receptor proteins are co-expressed. In these studies, levels of both full-length androgen receptor and AR-V7 were reduced in a dose-dependent fashion following galeterone treatment. 

To demonstrate that galeterone would degrade the AR-V7 protein alone, in the absence of the full-length androgen receptor, researchers at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, or UMB, studied galeterone in a prostate cancer cell line that only expresses AR-V7, and not the full-length androgen receptor. In these studies, AR-V7 protein levels were reduced in a dose-dependent fashion in cells that only express AR-V7 and not the full-length androgen receptor, confirming that galeterone can act directly on AR-V7. 

In addition, together with the Vancouver Prostate Centre, we examined whether degradation of androgen receptors translated into reduced androgen receptor signaling and reduced tumor growth in prostate cancer tumor cells which express AR-V7. The Vancouver Prostate Centre conducted a series of studies evaluating the anti-tumor activity of galeterone and enzalutamide in AR-V7 expressing cells. In these studies, galeterone reduced tumor cell proliferation, reduced androgen receptor levels, and decreased nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor, while enzalutamide was only weakly effective in these measures of anti-tumor activity. 

Researchers at the University of Washington also evaluated the in vivo activity of galeterone in a LuCaP136 xenograft model of human prostate cancer tumor cells grown in castrated mice. LuCaP136 is a prostate cancer cell line that expresses AR-V7. In these studies, tumors grew in control animals, but castrated animals treated with galeterone showed pronounced tumor growth inhibition. 

In addition, researchers at UMB have also evaluated galeterone against a second splice variant, AR v567es . AR v567es , like AR-V7, is a truncated androgen receptor with C-terminal loss. To demonstrate that galeterone would degrade the AR v567es protein alone, in the absence of a full-length androgen receptor, galeterone was studied in a prostate cancer cell line that only expresses AR v567es , and not the full-length androgen receptor. In this study, AR v567es protein levels were reduced in a dose-dependent fashion in cells that only express AR v567es and not the full-length androgen receptor. 

Activity in Androgen Receptor Point Mutations 

Patients treated with Xtandi and Zytiga eventually develop resistance such that their tumors continue to grow despite continued treatment. In addition, some patients never respond to initial treatment with Zytiga or Xtandi. Preclinical studies have shown that this resistance may be caused by androgen receptor point mutations such as AR-F876L and AR-T878A. In preclinical studies, galeterone was active against prostate cancer cells that expressed these point mutations. 

&#160;

Androgen Receptor Degradation Compounds 

Under a license from UMB, we have a drug discovery program, known as ARDA (androgen receptor degradation agents), under which we are identifying and developing novel compounds designed to have potent androgen receptor degradation activity. Our most advanced series of compounds from this program is currently in preclinical development. We plan to target compounds developed under our ARDA program for patients with androgen receptor signaling diseases, including prostate cancer, either alone or in combination with other products. 

Manufacturing 

Galeterone is a small molecule drug candidate that is manufactured through a reproducible synthetic process from readily available raw materials. Galeterone is manufactured in a proprietary formulation based on spray dried dispersion technology that is designed to produce a product that provides consistent drug exposure. 

We have completed the production of formulated drug for use in ARMOR3-SV and our other ongoing and planned clinical trials of galeterone using manufacturers operating under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, to manufacture pivotal clinical trial materials. 

We do not have our own manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on a limited number of third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials, drug substance and finished product for our preclinical research and clinical trials. We do not have long-term agreements with any of these third parties. We also do not have any current contractual relationships for the manufacture of commercial supplies of any of our product candidates after they are approved. If any of our products are approved by any regulatory agency, we intend to enter into agreements with third-party contract manufacturers and one or more backup manufacturers for the commercial production of those products. We believe that there are a number of qualified manufacturers with which we could enter into commercial supply arrangements. Further, we believe that the process to manufacture galeterone can be scaled up to commercial levels without any unusual equipment. 

Commercialization Strategy 

We have worldwide development and commercialization rights to galeterone. To maximize the value of these rights, we intend to build a urology- and oncology-focused specialty sales and marketing organization in the United States to support the commercialization of galeterone. We believe that a specialty sales force will be able to target the key prescribing physicians in urology and oncology that treat CRPC. We currently have no sales and limited marketing capabilities and experience. We plan to establish the required capabilities within an appropriate time frame ahead of any product approval and commercialization to support a product launch. To develop the appropriate internal commercial infrastructure in the United States, we will have to invest substantial financial and management resources, some of which will have to be deployed prior to any confirmation that galeterone will be approved. We intend to commercialize galeterone outside the United States through collaborations with third parties. 

Under the terms of our agreement with Qiagen, Qiagen is responsible for the commercialization of the AR-V7 companion diagnostic. 

Competition 

The development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. Research and discoveries by others may result in breakthroughs which may render our products obsolete even before they generate any revenue. We face competition with respect to our lead product candidate, and will face competition with respect to any products that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are 

&#160;

pursuing the development of products for the treatment of the disease indications for which we are developing galeterone. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. 

Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach, and others are based on entirely different approaches. Many marketed therapies for the indications that we are currently pursuing, or indications that we may in the future seek to address, are widely accepted by physicians, patients and payors, which may make it difficult for us to replace them with any products that we successfully develop and are permitted to market. 

We are focusing our late-stage development of galeterone on the treatment of AR-V7 positive mCRPC patients. Based on their mechanisms of action, preclinical data and the data from investigator-initiated clinical trials conducted at several academic medical centers, we believe that Zytiga and Xtandi may be less responsive in patients whose androgen receptor is truncated and do not expect that other drugs in development with similar mechanisms of action will be responsive in this patient population. We expect, however, that other drugs with alternative mechanisms of action may be developed for this patient population. 

We believe that galeterone may be well suited to treat other prostate cancer patient populations. If galeterone is approved for additional indications, it may compete with other commonly-used oral hormonal treatments being marketed, such as Zytiga and Xtandi, chemotherapeutic agents, or with drug candidates currently in development. Galeterone could compete in the future with products, either hormonal or non-hormonal, marketed by several of the world&#146;s largest and most experienced pharmaceutical companies. These companies have substantially more financial resources than we do and greater flexibility to engage in aggressive price competition to gain revenues and market share. Approved second-generation hormonal treatments in the United States for CRPC include Zytiga, marketed by Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Xtandi, marketed by Astellas Pharma US, Inc. and Medivation, Inc. Approved non-hormonal agents for CRPC include Taxotere &#174; (docetaxel) and Jevtana &#174; (cabazitaxel), marketed by sanofi-aventis U.S. LLC; Provenge &#174; (sipuleucel-T), marketed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.; and Xofigo &#174; (radium-223), marketed by Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, Inc. It is uncertain whether we could compete with such products, and our failure to compete or decision to reduce the price of galeterone or other future products we may develop in order to compete could severely impact our business. 

In addition, there are numerous prostate cancer products in clinical development by many public and private biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies targeting numerous different cancer types. These include hormonal treatments such as Johnson &#38; Johnson&#146;s ARN-509, Orion Corporation&#146;s ODM-201, Innocrin&#146;s Pharmaceuticals, Inc.&#146;s VT-464 and Essa Pharma Inc.&#146;s EPI-506. Other compounds that are not hormonal treatments in clinical development include Bavarian Nordic A/S&#146;s Prostvac and AstraZeneca plc&#146;s olaparib. If a therapy for prostate cancer were developed that targeted the C-terminal loss or AR-V7 patient populations or altered the standard of care for the treatment of mCRPC, such therapy could render galeterone irrelevant. 

Our competitors may develop products that are more effective, safer, more convenient or less costly than any that we are developing or that would render galeterone or any future product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. 

Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, medical and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 

&#160;

We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of galeterone, if approved, will be efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, probability of drug resistance, convenience of dosage regimen, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 

Intellectual Property 

Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection intended to cover the composition of matter of our product candidates, their methods of use, related technology and other inventions that are important to our business. In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 

A third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights that is important or necessary to commercialize our products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms. We may not be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, in which case our business could be harmed, possibly materially. 

We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to dosage forms, methods of treatment and additional compounds and their derivatives. Specifically, we seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for novel compositions of matter covering the compounds, the chemistries and processes for manufacturing these compounds and the use of these compounds in a variety of therapies. 

The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. 

Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions can be maintained in secrecy for 18 months, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine priority of invention or in post-grant challenge proceedings at the USPTO or at a foreign patent office, such as inter partes review and post grant review proceedings at the USPTO and opposition proceedings at the European Patent Office, that challenge priority of invention or other features of patentability. Such proceedings could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. 

We generally file a provisional patent application with the USPTO first and then subsequently file a corresponding non-provisional patent application, which enables us to establish an earlier effective filing date in the subsequently filed non-provisional patent application. In order to benefit from the earlier effective filing date, we must file a corresponding non-provisional patent application, such as a utility application in the United States or an international application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, within 12 months of the date of the 

&#160;

provisional patent application filing. Based on the PCT filing, we may file national and regional patent applications in the United States, the European Union, China, Japan, Australia, Canada, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore, South Africa or the Eurasian Patent Organization. To date, we have not filed for patent protection in all national and regional jurisdictions where such protection may be available, and we may decide to abandon national and regional patent applications before a patent is granted. In addition, the patent grant proceeding for each national or regional patent application that we file is an independent proceeding. As a result, it is possible for a patent application to be granted in one jurisdiction and denied in another jurisdiction, and depending on the jurisdiction, the scope of patent protection may vary. 

Galeterone Patent Portfolio 

Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for galeterone and other product candidates, preserve our trade secrets, prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. As of December 31, 2015, we owned three issued U.S. patents, 15 U.S. provisional and non-provisional patent applications, three granted foreign patents and 46 foreign applications in our galeterone patent portfolio. We also had rights under our license agreements with UMB and Johns Hopkins to seven issued U.S. patents and 76 granted foreign patents as well as six U.S. patent applications and 23 foreign applications. Our owned and licensed patent and patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire on various dates from 2017 through 2036, without taking into account any possible patent term extensions. Upon the expiration of these patents, we, UMB and Johns Hopkins, as applicable, will lose the right to exclude others from practicing the inventions claimed by such patents. As a result, the expiration of these patents could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 

We have no patent protection specifically covering the chemical structure of galeterone. As a result, a third party that obtains regulatory approval of a product with the same active ingredient as galeterone may be able to market such product so long as the third party does not infringe any other patents owned or licensed by us with respect to galeterone. For this reason, we have filed for or licensed patents and patent applications relating to galeterone covering methods of use, pharmaceutical compositions, combination treatments, prodrugs, metabolites, and analogs of galeterone and their use. 

Method of Use . We have licensed from UMB a U.S. patent covering a method of treating prostate cancer in a human subject by administering galeterone, which is expected to expire in 2027. The license also includes granted patents in the European Patent Convention and Japan covering the use of galeterone to treat prostate disease, including prostate cancer and prostatic hyperplasia. Similar patents have been granted or allowed in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, and the Eurasian Patent Organization. These patents are expected to expire in 2026. In addition, we have pending applications in Brazil, China, India, Israel and Indonesia. We have also licensed from UMB a PCT patent application covering the use of galeterone to inhibit proliferation of a cell having a specific splice variant form of the androgen receptor. The term of a patent derived from this PCT application, if issued, would be expected to expire in 2034. 

We have also filed a PCT patent application covering the use of galeterone in treating prostate cancer mediated by androgen receptor variants, including splice variants such as AR-V7, as well as the use of biomarkers in identifying patients who are expected to respond to treatment with galeterone. This application is jointly owned with UMB and the University of Washington, and we have exclusively licensed those institutions&#146; undivided interest in such application and any resulting patents. The term of a patent derived from this PCT application, if issued, would be expected to expire in 2034. 

Pharmaceutical Compositions . We have filed U.S. and international patent applications relating to a galeterone formulation and its use where the galeterone is present in a spray dried dispersion. We have pending applications in the United States, the European Union, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India and Japan. The term of any patent in this family, if issued, would be expected to expire in 2032. In addition, we have licensed from UMB a U.S. patent application covering a pharmaceutical composition of galeterone. The term of any patent, if issued, claiming priority to this application would be expected to expire in 2026. 

&#160;

Prodrugs, Metabolites and Analogs . We have filed patent applications or licensed from UMB patent applications directed to prodrugs, metabolites or analogs of galeterone. For example, we have licensed a U.S. patent application from UMB directed to certain prodrugs of galeterone. If issued, the term of the resulting patent, if issued, would be expected to expire in 2029. We have also filed patent applications in the United States and certain other countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, India and Japan directed to other prodrugs of galeterone. If issued, the term of the resulting patents would be expected to expire in 2030. Further, we have filed patent applications in the United States and certain other countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, India and Japan directed to compounds which have been identified as metabolites of galeterone and which may be biologically active. If issued, the term of the resulting patents would be expected to expire in 2030. We have also obtained a license to a UMB PCT patent application directed to analogs of galeterone that disrupt androgen receptor signaling by degrading the androgen receptor. The term of any patent, if issued, claiming priority to this PCT patent application would be expected to extend to 2034. 

AR-V7 Specific Assay and Companion Diagnostic Test. We have an exclusive license from Johns Hopkins for patent applications in the United States, Europe, and Canada covering methods of determining whether a subject may respond to androgen therapy, and methods of determining a subject&#146;s risk of recurrence of hormone-refractory or hormone-na&#239;ve prostate cancer. If issued, the term of the resulting patents would be expected to expire in 2029. These patent applications may provide protection for an AR-V7 specific assay or companion diagnostic test using this assay that we and Qiagen may develop and commercialize. However, these patent applications do not provide any protection for galeterone or for galeterone&#146;s pharmaceutical formulations or uses. 

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other non-United States jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. 

We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual&#146;s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to our current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. 

&#160;

License Agreement with University of Maryland, Baltimore 

In May 2006, we entered into a master license agreement with UMB. Pursuant to the license agreement, UMB granted us an exclusive worldwide license, with the right to sublicense, under certain patents and patent applications to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell and import certain anti-androgen steroids including galeterone, which we refer to as licensed products, and to otherwise practice the patent rights in any manner, for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment or control of any human or animal disease. In addition, UMB granted us a first option to receive an exclusive license to UMB&#146;s rights in certain improvements to the licensed products, which improvements we refer to as licensed improvements. We have exercised our option and acquired exclusive rights to licensed improvements under three amendments to the license agreement. In March 2009, the license agreement was amended to grant us an exclusive license to oral prodrugs of the licensed products. In April 2012, the license agreement was amended to grant us an exclusive license to compositions and methods of inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress. In October 2013, the license agreement was amended to grant us an exclusive license to a patent application directed to analogs of galeterone that disrupt androgen receptor signaling by degrading the androgen receptor. 

Under the terms of the license agreement, as amended, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize one or more licensed products. We must also achieve specified milestone events by specified dates. UMB may terminate the agreement if we fail to achieve such milestone events and do not cure such failure within a specified termination notice period. UMB may also terminate the agreement upon our breach of our payment obligations or our other material breaches under the agreement if we do not cure such breach within a specified notice period or upon our bankruptcy or insolvency. We may terminate the agreement at any time, on a country-by-country basis, if we determine that a license under the licensed patent rights in an applicable country is not advantageous to our commercial success, provided that our payment obligations with respect to licensed products in such country would survive termination if we continued to develop and commercialize licensed products in such country following such a termination. Unless our license agreement with UMB is terminated earlier as provided above, our exclusive license from UMB expires on a country-by-country basis as of the later of the expiration date of the last to expire of the claims of the patent rights licensed to us under the agreement in such country or ten years after the first commercial sale of a licensed product in such country. 

In consideration for the rights granted to us, we made an upfront payment to UMB of $20,000 following the execution of the license agreement and a payment of $10,000 following the execution of each of the March 2009, April 2012 and October 2013 amendments. We are obligated to pay UMB an annual maintenance fee of $10,000 each year until the first commercial sale. In addition, we paid UMB a $50,000 milestone payment in 2009 upon the submission of our investigational new drug application, or IND, for galeterone and a $40,000 milestone payment in 2013 upon the issuance of the first patent related to UMB&#146;s prodrug patent application. We are obligated to make an additional $50,000 milestone payment to UMB for each additional IND we file for a licensed product and a $100,000 milestone payment upon the approval of each NDA for a licensed product by the FDA. We must also pay UMB a low-single digit percentage royalty on aggregate worldwide net sales of licensed products, including sales by our sublicensees, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire applicable licensed patent or ten years after first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product, in each case in the applicable country. Our royalty obligations are subject to specified reductions in the event that we are required to obtain additional licenses from third parties or in the event of specified competition from third-party products licensed by UMB. Our minimum annual royalty payment to UMB is $50,000 beginning in the year following the year in which the first commercial sale occurs. We must also pay UMB 10% of all non-royalty sublicense income received from sublicensees. Finally, as of April 10, 2012, we assumed responsibility for all patent expenses related to the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents. 

License Agreement with The Johns Hopkins University 

In January 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Johns Hopkins. Pursuant to the license agreement, Johns Hopkins granted us an exclusive worldwide license under certain patent applications and a non-

&#160;

exclusive license under certain know-how, with the right to sublicense, to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell and import certain assays to identify androgen receptor variants for use as a companion diagnostic with galeterone. In addition, Johns Hopkins granted us an option to negotiate an exclusive license to Johns Hopkins&#146;s rights in certain improvements to the licensed products. 

Under the terms of the license agreement, we are obligated to diligently develop, manufacture and sell licensed products. We are also obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve specified milestone events by specified dates. Unless the license agreement with Johns Hopkins is terminated earlier as provided below, the license from Johns Hopkins expires on a country-by-country basis as of the later of the expiration date of the last to expire of the claims of the patent rights licensed under the agreement in such country or ten years after the first commercial sale of a licensed product in such country. Johns Hopkins may terminate the agreement if we fail to achieve such milestone events and do not cure such failure within a specified termination notice period. Johns Hopkins may also terminate the agreement upon a material breach by us under the agreement if we do not cure such breach within a specified notice period or upon bankruptcy or insolvency. We may terminate the agreement at any time upon 90 days&#146; notice. 

In consideration for the rights granted to us under the license agreement, we made an upfront payment to Johns Hopkins of $75,000 following the execution of the license agreement. We are obligated to pay Johns Hopkins an annual minimum royalty of up to $30,000. We are also obligated to make milestone payments to Johns Hopkins upon the achievement of specified technical and commercial milestones. We paid $50,000 during 2015 related to the achievement of two of these milestones. If all such milestones are achieved, the total milestone payments owed to Johns Hopkins would equal in the aggregate $700,000. We must also pay Johns Hopkins single digit percentage royalties on aggregate worldwide net sales of licensed products (and not galeterone), including sales by sublicensees, on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire applicable licensed patent or ten years after first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product, in each case in the applicable country. These royalty obligations are subject to specified reductions in the event that additional licenses from third parties are required. We must also pay Johns Hopkins 20% of all non-royalty sublicense income received from sublicensees and reimburse them for patent costs. 

Government Regulation and Product Approvals 

Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, clearance, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products and medical devices. The processes for obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 

Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States 

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other governmental entities. 

&#160;

An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA&#146;s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; submission to the FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; preparation and submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product&#146;s identity, strength, quality and purity; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; compliance with any post-approval requirements, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, and post-approval studies required by the FDA. Preclinical Studies 

Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated drug or drug product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 

Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 

In addition, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct a continuing 

&#160;

review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website. 

A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA or IND so long as the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with an international guideline for the ethical conduct of clinical research known as the Declaration of Helsinki or the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the clinical trial is performed, whichever provides the greater protection to the participants in the clinical trial. 

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or, in certain indications such as cancer, patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Phase 3: Phase 3 clinical trials are commonly referred to as &#147;pivotal&#148; trials, which typically denotes a trial which generates the principal data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a drug. In Phase 3 trials, the drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#146;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted. 

Section 505(b)(2) NDAs 

NDAs for most new drug products are based on two full clinical trials that must contain substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This type of application allows the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA&#146;s previous findings of safety and efficacy for a similar product, or published literature. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for a drug for which the investigations made to show whether or not the drug is safe for use and effective in use and relied upon by the applicant for approval of the application &#147;were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.&#148; 

&#160;

Thus, Section 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the applicant. NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(2) may provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA&#146;s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical studies or clinical trials of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies, trials or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 

Submission of an NDA to the FDA 

Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product&#146;s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to an application user fee, currently exceeding $2.1 million, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently exceeding $104,000 per product and $554,000 per establishment. These fees are typically increased annually. 

The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt and informs the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA&#146;s receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date of filing, and most applications for &#147;priority review&#148; products are meant to be reviewed within six months of filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for various reasons, including for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. 

Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. 

The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 

Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review Designations 

The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation. 

&#160;

Specifically, the FDA may give a product fast track designation if the product is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product&#146;s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track designated product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA&#146;s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 

Second, in 2012, Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA. This law established a new regulatory scheme allowing for expedited review of products designated as &#147;breakthrough therapies.&#148; A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. 

Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case- by-case basis, whether the proposed drug represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA&#146;s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review. 

Accelerated Approval Pathway 

The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. 

For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has 

&#160;

limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a drug. 

The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. 

The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor&#146;s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug&#146;s clinical benefit. As a result, a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 

The FDA&#146;s Decision on an NDA 

On the basis of the FDA&#146;s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 

If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug&#146;s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 

In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product. 

&#160;

Post-Approval Requirements 

Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 

In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. The FDA regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to liability. 

In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. 

Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs 

In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD. 

&#160;

Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is &#147;bioequivalent&#148; to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if &#147;the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug&#133;&#148; 

Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is &#147;therapeutically equivalent&#148; to the RLD in its publication &#147;Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,&#148; also referred to as the &#147;Orange Book.&#148; Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA&#146;s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient. 

Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. In cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. 

Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30-Month Stay 

Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant&#146;s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval. To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. 

Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the required patent information has not been filed; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the listed patent has expired; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product&#146;s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired (other than method of use patents involving indications for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval). 

If the ANDA applicant or 505(b)(2) applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA 

&#160;

has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 

To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 

Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity 

Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the FDASIA in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDA&#146;s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. 

The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation. 

Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA&#146;s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. 

Orphan Designation and Exclusivity 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an &#147;orphan drug&#148; if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting an NDA. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 

&#160;

If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will be receiving orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. 

Patent Term Restoration and Extension 

A patent claiming a new drug product or medical device may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the FDCA, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted on a patent covering a new drug product or medical device is typically one-half the time between the date a clinical investigation on human beings is begun and the submission date of an application for approval of the product, plus the time between the submission date of an application for approval of the product and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product&#146;s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product or medical device is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs or medical devices for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA. 

Review and Approval of Companion Diagnostics in the United States 

We expect that we will rely upon an in vitro diagnostic test for use in selecting patients with AR-V7. In July 2014, the FDA issued final guidance stating that if an in vitro diagnostic is essential to the safe and effective use of a therapeutic product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. In vitro diagnostics marketed in the United States are regulated as medical devices. As a result, unless an exemption applies, a new medical device may not be marketed in the United States unless and until it has been cleared through filing of a 510(k) premarket notification, or 510(k), or approved by the FDA pursuant to the PMA process. Based on our discussions with the FDA, we believe that the companion diagnostic for galeterone will need to be approved through the PMA process. 

510(k) Premarket Notification 

To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is &#147;substantially equivalent&#148; to a predicate device, which is a previously cleared 510(k) device or a pre-amendment device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, that is a class I or II device, or a class III device for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a PMA application. The FDA&#146;s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to 12 months from the date the notification is submitted and filed with the FDA, but it can take significantly longer and clearance is never assured. The FDA has issued guidance documents meant to expedite review of a 510(k) and facilitate interactions between manufacturers and the agency. To demonstrate substantial equivalence, a manufacturer must show that the device has the same intended use as a predicate device and the same technological characteristics, or the same intended use and different technological characteristics and does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate device. Most 510(k)s do not require clinical data for clearance, but the FDA may request such data. If the FDA concludes that the device is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, the manufacturer will 

&#160;

need to submit a PMA to market the device. Alternatively, a manufacturer may request a de novo classification if the device is of low to moderate risk and there is no predicate device upon which to base a substantial equivalence determination. 

Premarket Approval 

The PMA process for approval to market a medical device is more complex, costly, and time consuming than the 510(k) clearance procedure. A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including technical information regarding device design and development, preclinical studies, clinical studies, manufacturing and controls information and labeling information, which demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. The FDA may refer a PMA to an advisory committee for its recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. If the FDA&#146;s evaluations of both the PMA and the manufacturing facility for the device are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter authorizing commercial marketing or an approvable letter that usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval. If the FDA&#146;s evaluations are not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years, and the process can be expensive and uncertain. Moreover, even if the FDA approves a PMA, the FDA may approve the device with an indication that is narrower or more limited than originally sought, and the agency may impose post-approval conditions that it believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. 

Investigational Device Exemption 

A clinical trial is typically required for a PMA and, in a small percentage of cases, the FDA may require a clinical trial in support of a 510(k) submission. A manufacturer that wishes to conduct a clinical trial involving the device is subject to the FDA&#146;s IDE regulation. The IDE regulation distinguishes between significant and nonsignificant risk device trials and the procedures for obtaining approval to begin the trial differ accordingly. 

Also, some types of trials are exempt from the IDE regulations. A significant risk device presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a subject. Significant risk devices are devices that are substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or in preventing impairment to human health. Trials of devices that pose a significant risk require both FDA and an IRB approval prior to initiation of a clinical trial. Nonsignificant risk devices are devices that do not pose a significant risk to the human subjects. A nonsignificant risk device trial requires only IRB approval prior to initiation of a clinical trial. 

An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. An IDE application is considered approved 30 days after it has been received by the FDA, unless the FDA otherwise informs the sponsor, prior to 30 calendar days from the date of receipt, that the IDE is approved, approved with conditions or disapproved. The FDA typically grants IDE approval for a specified number of subjects to be enrolled at specified trial centers. The clinical trial must be conducted in accordance with applicable regulations, including but not limited to the FDA&#146;s IDE regulations. The investigators must obtain subject informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and trial protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices, and comply with all reporting and record keeping requirements. A clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by the FDA, the IRB or the sponsor at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to the trial participants outweigh the benefits of participation in the trial. Approval of an IDE does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product&#146;s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria. 

Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union 

In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy 

&#160;

and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of drug products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 

Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of a European Union member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. Clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. 

To obtain marketing approval of a drug under European Union regulatory systems, an applicant must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. 

The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all European Union member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. 

Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the EMA is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a drug. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. 

The decentralized procedure is available to applicants who wish to market a product in various European Union member states where such product has not received marketing approval in any European Union member states before. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state designated by the applicant, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 210 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state&#146;s assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. 

If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.

Review and Approval of In Vitro Diagnostics in the European Union 

In the European Economic Area, or EEA, in vitro diagnostic medical devices are regulated as medical devices and are required to conform with the essential requirements of the E.U. Directive on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Directive No 98/79/EC, as amended). As medical devices, in vitro diagnostic medical devices must comply with the Essential Requirements in Annex I to the E.U. Medical Devices Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC), or the Essential Requirements. Specifically, a manufacturer must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low risk medical devices, where the manufacturer can issue a CE Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the Essential Requirements, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a third-party organization designated by competent authorities of a European Union country to conduct conformity assessments, or a Notified Body. Notified Bodies are independent testing houses, laboratories, or product certifiers typically based within the European Union and authorized by the European member states to perform the required conformity assessment tasks, such as quality system audits and device compliance testing. The Notified Body would typically audit and examine the product&#146;s Technical File and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of the product before issuing a CE Certificate of Conformity demonstrating compliance with the relevant Essential Requirements. 

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 

Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit net revenue and results. 

In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. A payor&#146;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development. 

In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products and devices for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, 

&#160;

increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. 

Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements. 

Healthcare Law and Regulation 

Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, and provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; the federal transparency requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the PPACA, require manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry&#146;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
