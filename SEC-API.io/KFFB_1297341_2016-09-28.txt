Forward-Looking Statements 

&#160; 

This report contains certain &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are not historical facts, rather statements based on Kentucky First Federal Bancorp&#8217;s current expectations regarding its business strategies, intended results and future performance. Forward-looking statements are preceded by terms such as &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;intends&#8221; and similar expressions. 

&#160; 

Management&#8217;s ability to predict results or the effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could affect actual results include the following: interest rate trends; the general economic climate in the market areas in which Kentucky First Federal Bancorp operates, as well as nationwide; Kentucky First Federal Bancorp&#8217;s ability to control costs and expenses; competitive products and pricing; loan delinquency rates; and changes in federal and state legislation and regulation. These factors should be considered in evaluating the forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Kentucky First Federal Bancorp assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

&#160; 

Kentucky First Federal Bancorp. Kentucky First Federal Bancorp (&#8220;Kentucky First&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated as a mid-tier holding company under the laws of the United States on March 2, 2005 upon the completion of the reorganization of First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Hazard (&#8220;First Federal of Hazard&#8221;) into a federal mutual holding company form of organization (the &#8220;Reorganization&#8221;). On that date, Kentucky First also completed its minority stock offering and its concurrent acquisition of Frankfort First Bancorp, Inc. (&#8220;Frankfort First Bancorp&#8221;) and its wholly owned subsidiary First Federal Savings Bank of Kentucky, Frankfort, Kentucky (&#8220;First Federal of Kentucky&#8221;) (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;). Following the Reorganization and Merger, the Company has operated First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky (collectively, the &#8220;Banks&#8221;) as two independent, community-oriented savings institutions.

&#160;

On December 31, 2012, Kentucky First acquired CFK Bancorp, Inc., the savings and loan holding company for Central Kentucky Federal Savings Bank, a federally chartered savings bank located in Danville, Kentucky. Central Kentucky Federal Savings Bank was merged into First Federal of Kentucky and now operates as a division of First Federal of Kentucky under the name &#8220;Central Kentucky Federal Savings Bank&#8221; through its two offices in Danville, Kentucky and its Lancaster, Kentucky branch. With the acquisition, the Company expanded its customer base in the central Kentucky area with an institution that shared its community banking orientation and thrift heritage and enjoyed a favorable reputation within the new Danville-Lancaster market area.

&#160;

Kentucky First&#8217;s and First Federal of Hazard&#8217;s executive offices are located at 655 Main Street, Hazard, Kentucky, 41702 and the telephone number for investor relations is (888) 818-3372.

&#160;

At June 30, 2016, Kentucky First had total assets of $291.9 million, deposits of $188.6 million and stockholders&#8217; equity of $67.5 million. The discussion in this Annual Report on Form 10-K relates primarily to the businesses of First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky, as Kentucky First&#8217;s operations consist primarily of operating the Banks and investing funds retained in the Reorganization.

&#160;

First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky are subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and their savings deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Both of the Banks are members of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, which is one of the 12 regional banks in the FHLB System. See &#8220; Regulation and Supervision .&#8221;

First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Hazard. First Federal of Hazard was formed as a federally chartered mutual savings and loan association in 1960. First Federal of Hazard operates from a single office in Hazard, Kentucky as a community-oriented savings and loan association offering traditional financial services to consumers in Perry and surrounding counties in eastern Kentucky. It engages primarily in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and using such funds to originate, when available, loans secured by first mortgages on owner-occupied, residential real estate and occasionally other loans secured by real estate. To the extent there is insufficient loan demand in its market area, and where appropriate under its investment policies, First Federal of Hazard has historically invested in mortgage-backed and investment securities, although since the reorganization, First Federal of Hazard has been purchasing whole loans and participations in loans originated at First Federal of Kentucky. At June 30, 2016, First Federal of Hazard had total assets of $72.3 million, net loans of $53.8 million, total mortgage-backed and other securities of $975,000, deposits of $51.5 million and total capital of $18.0 million.

&#160; 

First Federal Savings Bank of Kentucky. First Federal of Kentucky is a federally chartered savings bank, which is primarily engaged in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and originating primarily adjustable-rate loans secured by first mortgages on owner-occupied and nonowner-occupied one- to four-family residences in Franklin, Boyle, Garrard and other counties in Kentucky. First Federal of Kentucky also originates, to a lesser extent, home equity loans and loans secured by churches, multi-family properties, professional office buildings and other types of property. At June 30, 2016, First Federal of Kentucky had total assets of $228.7 million, net loans of $184.7 million, total mortgage-backed and other securities of $3.2 million, deposits of $150.0 million and total capital of $45.0 million.

&#160;

First Federal of Kentucky&#8217;s main office is located at 216 W. Main Street, Frankfort, Kentucky 40602 and its main telephone number is (502) 223-1638.

&#160; 

Market Areas 

&#160;

First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky operate in three distinct market areas.

&#160;

First Federal of Hazard&#8217;s market area consists of Perry County, where the business office is located, as well as the surrounding counties of Letcher, Knott, Breathitt, Leslie and Clay Counties in eastern Kentucky. The economy in its market area has been distressed in recent years. The local economy depends on the coal industry and other industries, such as health care and manufacturing. Still, the economy in First Federal of Hazard&#8217;s market area continues to lag behind the economies of Kentucky and the United States. In the most recent available data, using information from the Commonwealth of Kentucky Economic Development and the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, per capita personal income in Perry County averaged $34,578in 2014, compared to personal income of $39,000 in Kentucky and $47,669 in the United States. Total population in Perry County has remained stable over the last five years at approximately 29,000. However, as a regional economic center, Hazard tends to draw consumers and workers who commute from surrounding counties. Employment in the market area, particularly in Perry County, consists primarily of the trade, transportation and utilities industry (18.2%), the mining industry (17.3%), and the services sector, including health care (15.4%). During the last five years, the unemployment rate has been higher than most regions, and in June 2016, was 10.5%, compared to 5.4% in Kentucky and 4.9% in the United States.

&#160;

First Federal of Kentucky&#8217;s primary lending area includes the Kentucky counties of Franklin, Boyle, Garrard and surrounding counties, with the majority of lending originated on properties located in Franklin and Boyle Counties.

&#160;

Franklin County has a population of approximately 50,000, of which approximately 27,000 live within the city of Frankfort, which serves as the capital of Kentucky. The primary employer in the area is government, which employs about 36.3% of the workforce followed by the services sector and the trade, transportation and utilities sector, which employ about 29.4% and 10.7% of the workforce, respectively. Despite this large, relatively stable source of employment, the unemployment rate was 4.3% for June 2016 after having experienced an unemployment rate which had ranged from 4.5 to 9.0% in prior years. The per capita income in Franklin County for 2014 averaged $37,875.

&#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Boyle County has a population of approximately 29,000. The service sector, which employs about 42.9% of the work force, is the largest employer, while the trade, transportation and utilities sector is the next largest employer with approximately 20.3% of the workforce. Centre College is one of the larger employers in the community. The unemployment rate was 5.5% in June 2016, while the per capita income in Boyle County for 2014 averaged $33,163.

&#160;

Lending Activities 

&#160;

General . Our loan portfolio consists primarily of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. As opportunities arise, we also offer loans secured by churches, commercial real estate, and multi-family real estate. We also offer loans secured by deposit accounts and, through First Federal of Kentucky, home equity loans. Substantially all of our loans are made within the Banks&#8217; respective market areas.

&#160;

Residential Mortgage Loans . Our primary lending activity is the origination of mortgage loans to enable borrowers to purchase or refinance existing homes in the Banks&#8217; respective market areas. At June 30, 2016, residential mortgage loans totaled $204.5 million, or 83.5%, of our total loan portfolio. We offer a mix of adjustable-rate and fixed-rate mortgage loans with terms up to 30 years. Adjustable-rate loans have an initial fixed term of one, three, five or seven years. After the initial term, the rate adjustments on most of First Federal of Kentucky&#8217;s adjustable-rate loans are indexed to the National Average Contract Interest Rate for Major Lenders on the Purchase of Previously Occupied Homes. The interest rates on these mortgages are adjusted once a year, with limitations on adjustments generally of one percentage point per adjustment period, and a lifetime cap of five percentage points. We determine loan fees charged, interest rates and other provisions of mortgage loans on the basis of our own pricing criteria and competitive market conditions. Some loans originated by the Banks have an additional advance clause which allows the borrower to obtain additional funds at prevailing interest rates, subject to managements&#8217; approval.

&#160;

At June 30, 2016, the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio included $155.8 million in adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans, or 76.2%, of the Company&#8217;s residential mortgage loan portfolio.

&#160;

The retention of adjustable-rate loans in the portfolio helps reduce our exposure to increases in prevailing market interest rates. However, there are unquantifiable credit risks resulting from potential increases in costs to borrowers in the event of upward repricing of adjustable-rate loans. It is possible that during periods of rising interest rates, the risk of default on adjustable-rate loans may increase due to increases in interest costs to borrowers. However, despite their popularity in some parts of the country, neither bank has offered adjustable-rate loans that contractually allow for negative amortization. Such loans, under some circumstances, can cause the balance of a closed-end loan to exceed the original balance and perhaps surpass the value of the collateral. Further, although adjustable-rate loans allow us to increase the sensitivity of our interest-earning assets to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the initial fixed-rate period before the first adjustment and the periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment limitations. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that yields on our adjustable-rate loans will fully adjust to compensate for increases in our cost of funds. Finally, adjustable-rate loans may decrease at a pace faster than decreases in our cost of funds, resulting in reduced net income.

&#160;

While one- to four-family residential real estate loans are normally originated with up to 30-year terms, such loans typically remain outstanding for substantially shorter periods because borrowers often prepay their loans in full upon sale of the mortgaged property or upon refinancing the original loan. Therefore, average loan maturity is a function of, among other factors, the level of purchase and sale activity in the real estate market, prevailing interest rates and the interest rates payable on outstanding loans. As interest rates declined and remained low over the past few years, we have experienced high levels of loan repayments and refinancings.

&#160;

The Banks offer various programs for the purchase and refinance of one- to four-family loans. Most of these loans have loan-to-value ratios of 80% or less, based on an appraisal provided by a state licensed or certified appraiser. For owner-occupied properties, the borrower may be able to borrow up to 95% of the value if they secure and pay for private mortgage insurance or they may be able to obtain a second mortgage (at a higher interest rate) in which they borrow up to 90% of the value. On a rare case-by-case basis, the Boards of Directors of the Banks may approve a loan above the 80% loan-to-value ratio without such enhancements.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Construction Loans . We originate loans to individuals to finance the construction of residential dwellings for personal use or for use as rental property. On a case-by-case basis we consider construction loans on other than owner-occupied, residential property. At June 30, 2016, construction loans totaled $2.8 million, or 1.2%, of our total loan portfolio. Our construction loans generally provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which is usually less than one year. Loans generally can be made with a maximum loan to value ratio of 80% of the appraised value. Funds are disbursed as progress is made toward completion of the construction based on site inspections by qualified bank staff.

&#160;

Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property&#8217;s value at completion of construction or development and the estimated cost (including interest) of construction. During the construction phase, a number of factors could result in delays and cost overruns. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the development. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted, at or before the maturity of the loan, with a project having a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment. As a result of the foregoing, construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If we are forced to foreclose on a project before or at completion due to a default, there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover the unpaid balance and accrued interest on the loan, as well as related foreclosure and holding costs.

&#160;

Multi-Family Loans . We offer mortgage loans secured by multi-family property (residential real estate comprised of five or more units.) At June 30, 2016, multi-family loans totaled $15.6 million, or 6.3%, of our total loan portfolio. We originate multi-family real estate loans for terms of generally 25 years or less. Loan amounts generally do not exceed 80% of the appraised value and tend to range much lower.

&#160;

Nonresidential Loans . As opportunities arise, we offer mortgage loans secured by nonresidential real estate, which is generally secured by commercial office buildings, churches, condominiums and properties used for other purposes. At June 30, 2016, nonresidential totaled $27.1 million, or 11.1% of our total loan portfolio. We originate nonresidential real estate loans for terms of generally 25 years or less and loan amounts generally do not exceed 80% of the appraised value and tend to range much lower.

&#160;

Loans secured by multi-family and nonresidential real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Of primary concern in multi-family and nonresidential real estate lending is the borrower&#8217;s creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project. Payments on loans secured by income properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent than residential real estate loans to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. To monitor cash flows on income properties, we require borrowers and/or loan guarantors to provide annual financial statements on larger multi-family and commercial real estate loans. In reaching a decision on whether to make a multi-family or nonresidential real estate loan, we consider the net cash flow of the project, the borrower&#8217;s expertise, credit history and the value of the underlying property.

&#160;

Commercial Non-mortgage Loans . At June 30, 2016, commercial non-mortgage loans totaled $1.8 million, or 0.7%, of our total loan portfolio. We do not emphasize commercial non-mortgage loans, which may be secured by vehicles used in business or by inventory and equipment of the business or may be unsecured, although we do originate such loans on a limited basis and generally require a pre-existing relationship with the Bank. These loans are made only to businesses in our local market and we generally require personal guarantees of well-established individuals for these loans. Commercial loans involve an even greater degree of risk than real estate loans.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Consumer Lending. Our consumer loans include home equity lines of credit, loans secured by savings deposits, automobile loans and unsecured or personal loans. At June 30, 2016, our consumer loan balance totaled $8.6 million, or 3.5%, of our total loan portfolio. Of the consumer loan balance at June 30, 2016, $6.2 million were home equity loans, $1.8 million were loans secured by savings deposits and $766,000 were automobile or unsecured loans.

&#160;

Our home equity loans are made at First Federal of Kentucky and are made on the security of residential real estate and have terms of up to 15 years. Most of First Federal of Kentucky&#8217;s home equity loans are second mortgages subordinate only to first mortgages also held by the bank and do not exceed 80% of the estimated value of the property, less the outstanding principal of the first mortgage. First Federal of Kentucky does offer home equity loans up to 90% of the value less the balance of the first mortgage at a premium rate to qualified borrowers. These loans are not secured by private mortgage insurance. First Federal of Kentucky&#8217;s home equity loans require the monthly payment of 1.0% to 2% of the unpaid principal until maturity, when the remaining unpaid principal, if any, is due. First Federal of Kentucky&#8217;s home equity loans bear variable rates of interest indexed to the prime rate for loans with 80% or less loan-to-value ratio, and 2% above the prime rate for loans with a loan-to-value ratio in excess of 80%. Interest rates on these loans can be adjusted monthly. At June 30, 2016, the total outstanding home equity loans amounted to 2.5% of the Company&#8217;s total loan portfolio.

&#160;

Loans secured by savings are originated for up to 90% of the depositor&#8217;s savings account balance. The interest rate is varying percentage points above the rate paid on the savings account, and the account must be pledged as collateral to secure the loan. At June 30, 2016, loans on savings accounts totaled 0.7% of the Company&#8217;s total loan portfolio.

&#160;

Consumer loans generally entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans which are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciable assets. Automobile and unsecured loans at June 30, 2016, totaled 0.3% of the Company&#8217;s total loan portfolio.

&#160;

Loan Originations, Purchases and Sales . Loan originations come from a number of sources. The primary source of loan originations are our in-house loan originators, and to a lesser extent, advertising and referrals from customers and real estate agents. First Federal of Kentucky sells fixed-rate loans with longer maturities to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (&#8220;FHLB-Cincinnati&#8221;). We earn income on the loans sold through fees we charge on the origination, interest spread premiums earned when we sell the loans, and loan servicing fees on an on-going basis, because servicing rights are retained on such loans. At June 30, 2016, $11.7 million in loans were being serviced by First Federal of Kentucky for the FHLB-Cincinnati.

&#160;

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority . Our lending activities follow written, nondiscriminatory, underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by each Bank&#8217;s Board of Directors and management. First Federal of Hazard&#8217;s loan committee, consisting of its two senior officers, has authority to approve loans of up to $275,000. Loans above this amount and loans with non-standard terms such as longer repayment terms or high loan-to-value ratios, must be approved by our Board of Directors. First Federal of Kentucky&#8217;s loan approval process allows for various combinations of experienced bank officers to approve or deny loans which are one- to four-family properties totaling $350,000 or less, church loans of under $150,000, home equity lines of credit of $100,000 or less and loans to individuals whose aggregate borrowings with the Bank is less than $500,000. Loans that do not conform to these criteria must be submitted to the Board of Directors or Executive Committee composed of at least three directors, for approval.

&#160;

It is the Company&#8217;s practice to record a lien on the real estate securing a loan. The Banks generally do not require title insurance, although it may be required for loans made in certain programs. The Banks do require fire and casualty insurance on all security properties and flood insurance when the collateral property is located in a designated flood hazard area.

&#160;

Loans to One Borrower . The maximum amount either Bank may lend to one borrower and the borrower&#8217;s related entities is limited, by regulation, to generally 15% of that Bank&#8217;s stated capital and the allowance for loan losses. At June 30, 2016, the regulatory limit on loans to one borrower was $2.8 million for First Federal of Hazard and $4.7 million for First Federal of Kentucky. Neither of the banks had lending relationships in excess of their respective lending limits. However, loans or participations in loans may be sold among the Banks, which may allow a borrower&#8217;s total loans with the Company to exceed the limit of either individual bank.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Loan Commitments . The Banks issue commitments for the funding of mortgage loans. Generally, these commitments exist from the time the underwriting of the loan is completed and the closing of the loan. Generally, these commitments are for a maximum of 30 or 60 days but management routinely extends the commitment if circumstances delay the closing. Management reserves the right to verify or re-evaluate the borrower&#8217;s qualifications and to change the rates and terms of the loan at that time.

&#160;

If conditions exist whereby either Bank experiences a significant increase in loans outstanding or commits to originate loans that are riskier than a typical one- to four-family mortgage, management and the boards will consider reflecting the anticipated loss exposure in a separate liability. As residential loans are approved in the normal course of business, and those loans are underwritten to the standards of the Banks, management does not believe alteration of the allowance for loan losses is warranted. At June 30, 2016, no commitment losses were reflected in a separate liability.

&#160;

First Federal of Kentucky offers construction loans in which the borrower obtains the loan for a short term, less than one year, and simultaneously extends a commitment for permanent financing. First Federal of Hazard offers a construction loan that is convertible to permanent financing, thus no additional commitment is made.

&#160;

Interest Rates and Loan Fees. Interest rates charged on mortgage loans are primarily determined by competitive loan rates offered in our market areas and our yield objectives. Mortgage loan rates reflect factors such as prevailing market interest rate levels, the supply of money available to the savings industry and the demand for such loans. These factors are in turn affected by general economic conditions, the monetary policies of the federal government, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the general supply of money in the economy, tax policies and governmental budget matters.

&#160;

We receive fees in connection with late payments on our loans. Depending on the type of loan and the competitive environment for mortgage loans, we may charge an origination fee on all or some of the loans we originate. We may also offer a menu of loans whereby the borrower may pay a higher fee to receive a lower rate or to pay a smaller or no fee for a higher rate.

&#160;

Delinquencies . When a borrower fails to make a required loan payment, we take a number of steps to have the borrower cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status. We make initial contact with the borrower when the loan becomes 15 days past due. Subsequently, bank staff under the direct supervision of senior management and with consultation by the Banks&#8217; attorneys, attempt to contact the borrower and determine their status and plans for resolving the delinquency. However, once a delinquency reaches 90 days, management considers foreclosure and, if the borrower has not provided a reasonable plan (such as selling the collateral, securing a commitment from another lender to refinance the loan or submitting a plan to repay the delinquent principal, interest, escrow, and late charges) the foreclosure suit may be initiated. In some cases, management may delay initiating the foreclosure suit if, in management&#8217;s opinion, the Banks&#8217; chance of loss is minimal (such as with loans where the estimated value of the property greatly exceeds the amount of the loan) or if the original borrower is deceased or incapacitated. If a foreclosure action is initiated and the loan is not brought current, paid in full, or refinanced with another lender before the foreclosure sale, the real property securing the loan is sold at foreclosure. The Banks are represented at the foreclosure sale and in most cases will bid an amount equal to the Banks&#8217; investment (including interest, advances for taxes and insurance, foreclosure costs, and attorney&#8217;s fees). If another bidder outbids the Bank, the Bank&#8217;s investment is received in full. If another bidder does not outbid the Banks, the Banks acquire the property and attempt to sell it to recover their investment.

&#160;

A borrower&#8217;s filing for bankruptcy can alter the methods available to the Banks to seek collection. In such cases, the Banks work closely with legal counsel to resolve the delinquency as quickly as possible.

&#160;

We may consider loan workout arrangements with certain borrowers under certain conditions. Management of each bank provides a report to its board of directors on a monthly basis of all loans more than 60 days delinquent, including loans in foreclosure, and all property acquired through foreclosure.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Investment Activities 

&#160;

We have legal authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies and state and municipal governments, mortgage-backed securities and certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions. We also are required to maintain an investment in FHLB-Cincinnati stock, the level of which is largely dependent on our level of borrowings from the FHLB.

&#160;

At June 30, 2016, our investment portfolio consisted of mortgage-backed securities issued and guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae with stated final maturities of 30 years or less. The Company held no equity position with Fannie Mae, but acquired an equity position in Freddie Mac along with the acquisition of CKF Bancorp. At June 30, 2016, the carrying amount of our Freddie Mac stock was $53,000, which was also its estimated fair market value, while its cost basis was $8,000.

&#160;

Our investment objectives are to provide an alternate source of low-risk investments when loan demand is insufficient, to provide and maintain liquidity, to maintain a balance of high quality, diversified investments to minimize risk, to provide collateral for pledging requirements, to establish an acceptable level of interest rate risk, and to generate a favorable return. The Banks&#8217; Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for each institution&#8217;s investment portfolio, including approval of investment policies . The management of each Bank may authorize investments as prescribed in each of the Bank&#8217;s investment policies.

&#160;

Bank Owned Life Insurance 

&#160;

First Federal of Kentucky owns several Bank Owned Life Insurance policies totaling $3.1 million at June 30, 2016. The purpose of these policies is to offset future escalation of the costs of non-salary employee benefit plans such as First Federal of Kentucky&#8217;s defined benefit retirement plan and First Federal of Kentucky&#8217;s health insurance plan. The lives of certain key Bank employees are insured, and First Federal of Kentucky is the sole beneficiary and will receive any benefits upon the employee&#8217;s death. The policies were purchased from four highly-rated life insurance companies. The design of the plan allows for the cash value of the policy to be designated as an asset of First Federal of Kentucky. The asset&#8217;s value will increase by the crediting rate, which is a rate set by each insurance company and is subject to change on an annual basis. The growth of the value of the asset will be recorded as other operating income. Management does not foresee any expense associated with the plan. Because this is a life insurance product, current federal tax laws exempt the income from federal income taxes.

&#160;

Bank owned life insurance is not secured by any government agency nor are the policies&#8217; asset values or death benefits secured specifically by tangible property. Great care was taken in selecting the insurance companies, and the bond ratings and financial condition of these companies are monitored on a quarterly basis. The failure of one of these companies could result in a significant loss to First Federal of Kentucky. Other risks include the possibility that the favorable tax treatment of the income could change, that the crediting rate will not be increased in a manner comparable to market interest rates, or that this type of plan will no longer be permitted by First Federal of Kentucky&#8217;s regulators. This asset is considered illiquid because, although First Federal of Kentucky may terminate the policies and receive the original premium plus all earnings, such an action would require the payment of federal income taxes on all earnings since the policies&#8217; inception.

&#160;

Deposit Activities and Other Sources of Funds 

&#160;

General . Deposits, loan repayments and maturities, redemptions, sales and repayments of investment and mortgage-backed securities are the major sources of our funds for lending and other investment purposes. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions.

&#160;

Deposit Accounts . The vast majority of our depositors are residents of the Banks&#8217; respective market areas. Deposits are attracted from within our market areas through the offering of passbook savings and certificate accounts, and, at First Federal of Kentucky, checking accounts and individual retirement accounts (&#8220;IRAs&#8221;). We do not utilize brokered funds. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the rates offered by our competition, profitability to us, asset liability management and customer preferences and concerns. We review our deposit mix and pricing on an ongoing basis as needed . 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Borrowings . First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky borrow from the FHLB-Cincinnati to supplement their supplies of investable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements. The Federal Home Loan Bank functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member financial institutions. As members, each Bank is required to own capital stock in the FHLB-Cincinnati and is authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States), provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. Advances are made under several different programs, each having its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution&#8217;s net worth or on the Federal Home Loan Bank&#8217;s assessment of the institution&#8217;s creditworthiness.

&#160;

Subsidiary Activities 

&#160; 

The Company has no other wholly owned subsidiaries other than First Federal of Hazard and Frankfort First Bancorp. Frankfort First Bancorp has one subsidiary, First Federal of Kentucky.

&#160;

As federally chartered savings institutions, the Banks are permitted to invest an amount equal to 2% of assets in subsidiaries, with an additional investment of 1% of assets where such investment serves primarily community, inner-city and community-development purposes. Under such limitations, as of June 30, 2016, First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky were authorized to invest up to $2.2 million and $6.9 million, respectively, in the stock of or loans to subsidiaries, including the additional 1% investment for community, inner-city and community development purposes.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We face significant competition for the attraction of deposits and origination of loans. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from the banks and credit unions operating in our market areas and, to a lesser extent, from other financial services companies, such as investment brokerage firms. We also face competition for depositors&#8217; funds from money market funds and other corporate and government securities. Several of our competitors are significantly larger than us and, therefore, have significantly greater resources. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example, have lowered the barriers to enter new market areas, allowed banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the Internet and made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks. Changes in federal law permit affiliation among banks, securities firms and insurance companies, which promotes a competitive environment in the financial services industry. Competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit our growth in the future.

&#160;

According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;), at June 30, 2015 (the most recent period for which information is available,) First Federal of Hazard had a deposit market share of 10.0% in Perry County. Its largest competitors, Hazard Bancorp (Peoples Bank &#38; Trust Company of Hazard,) Community Trust Bancorp, Inc. (Community Trust Bank, Inc.) and 1 st Trust Bank, Inc. had Perry County deposit market shares of 42.4%, 18.6% and 26.9%, respectively. First Federal of Hazard&#8217;s competition for loans comes primarily from financial institutions in its market area and, to a lesser extent, from other financial services providers, such as mortgage companies and mortgage brokers. Competition for loans also comes from the increasing number of non-depository financial services companies entering the mortgage market, such as insurance companies, securities companies and specialty finance companies.

&#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

First Federal of Kentucky&#8217;s principal competitors for deposits in its market area are other banking institutions, such as commercial banks and credit unions, as well as mutual funds and other investments. First Federal of Kentucky principally competes for deposits by offering a variety of deposit accounts, convenient business hours and branch locations, customer service and a well-trained staff. According to the FDIC, at June 30, 2015, (the most recent period for which information is available,) First Federal of Kentucky had deposit market share of 9.4%, 10.9% and 17.0% for the Kentucky counties of Franklin, Boyle and Garrard. Its largest competitors for depositors are the Farmers Capital Bank Corporation (Farmers Bank and Capital Trust Company) at a 34.0% market share in the three-county area, Boyle Bancorp, Inc. (The Farmers National Bank of Danville) at 17.8% and Whitaker Bank Corporation of Kentucky at 15.5%. Farmers Capital Bank Corporation, Boyle Bancorp, Inc., and Whitaker Bank Corporation had assets at June 30, 2016, of $1.8 billion, $472.8 million and $1.8 billion, respectively. The Bank also faces considerable competition from credit unions including the Commonwealth Credit Union ($1.1 billion in assets) and the Kentucky Employees Credit Union ($74.4 million in assets). First Federal of Kentucky competes for loans with other depository institutions, as well as specialty mortgage lenders and brokers and consumer finance companies. First Federal of Kentucky principally competes for loans on the basis of interest rates and the loan fees it charges, the types of loans it originates and the convenience and service it provides to borrowers. In addition, First Federal of Kentucky believes it has developed strong relationships with the businesses, real estate agents, builders and general public in its market area.

&#160; 

Personnel 

&#160; 

At June 30, 2016, we had 71 full-time employees and two part-time employees, none of whom was represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.

&#160;

Regulation and Supervision 

&#160;

General. First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky are subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as their primary federal regulator, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as insurer of deposits. First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky are each members of the Federal Home Loan Bank System and their deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund managed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky must each file reports with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation concerning their activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals before entering into certain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial institutions. There are periodic examinations by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and, under certain circumstances, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to evaluate First Federal of Hazard&#8217;s and First Federal of Kentucky&#8217;s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulatory structure is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. The Federal Reserve Board, the agency that regulates and supervises bank holding companies, now supervises and regulates Kentucky First Federal MHC. Kentucky First and First Federal MHC, as savings and loan holding companies, are required to file certain reports with, and are subject to examination by, and otherwise are required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act made extensive changes in the regulation of federal savings banks such as First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Office of Thrift Supervision was eliminated and responsibility for the supervision and regulation of federal savings banks was transferred to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the agency that is primarily responsible for the regulation and supervision of national banks, on July 21, 2011. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency assumed responsibility for implementing and enforcing many of the laws and regulations applicable to federal savings banks. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve Board. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations and has authority to impose new requirements. However, institutions of less than $10 billion in assets, such as First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky, will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations by, and be subject to the enforcement authority of, their prudential regulator. Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act require the issuance of regulations before their impact on operations can be fully assessed by management. However, there is a significant possibility that the Dodd-Frank Act will, at a minimum, result in increased regulatory burden and compliance for First Federal MHC, Kentucky First and each of the Banks.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Certain of the regulatory requirements that are applicable to First Federal of Hazard, First Federal of Kentucky, Kentucky First and First Federal MHC are described below. This discussion does not purport to be a complete description of the laws and regulations involved, and is qualified in its entirety by the actual laws and regulations. Moreover, laws and regulations are subject to changes by the U.S. Congress or the regulatory agencies as applicable.

&#160;

Regulation of Federal Savings Institutions 

&#160;

Business Activities. Federal law and regulations, primarily the Home Owners&#8217; Loan Act and the regulations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, govern the activities of federal savings institutions, such as First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky. These laws and regulations delineate the nature and extent of the activities in which federal savings banks may engage. In particular, certain lending authority for federal savings institutions, e.g. , commercial, nonresidential real property loans and consumer loans, is limited to a specified percentage of the institution&#8217;s capital or assets.

&#160;

Branching. Federal savings institutions are authorized to establish branch offices in any state or states of the United States and its territories, subject to the approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

&#160;

Capital Requirements . In July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC approved a new rule that implemented the Basel III regulatory capital reforms. The capital regulations now require federal savings banks to meet four minimum capital standards: a 4.0% Tier 1 leverage ratio; a 4.5% common equity Tier 1 ratio; a 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio; and an 8% Total capital ratio. In addition, the prompt corrective action standards discussed below also establish, in effect, a minimum 2% tangible capital standard. The rules eliminated the inclusion of certain instruments, such as trust preferred securities, from Tier 1 capital. Instruments issued before May 19, 2010 are grandfathered for companies with consolidated assets of $15 billion or less. The rules also established a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements, which must consist entirely of common equity Tier 1 capital and would result in the following minimum ratios: (1) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (3) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and would increase by that amount each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.

&#160;

The risk-based capital standard requires federal savings banks to maintain Tier 1 and total capital (which is defined as core capital and supplementary capital, less certain specified deductions from total capital such as reciprocal holdings of depository institution capital, instruments and equity investments) to risk-weighted assets of at least 6% and 8%, respectively. In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets, recourse obligations, residual interests and direct credit substitutes, are multiplied by a risk-weight factor of 0% to 150%, as assigned by the capital regulation based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders&#8217; equity (including retained earnings), certain non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less intangibles other than certain mortgage servicing rights and credit card relationships. The components of Tier 2 capital currently include cumulative preferred stock, long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, subordinated debt and intermediate preferred stock, the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and up to 45% of unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Overall, the amount of Tier 2 capital included as part of total capital cannot exceed 100% of core capital.

&#160;

Savings and loan holding companies with less than $1 billion in assets are not subject to specific regulatory capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act, however, requires the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies, including savings and loan holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves.

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

As of June 30, 2016, current capital levels of First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky exceed the required capital amounts to be considered &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and we believe they also meet the fully-phased in minimum capital requirements, including the related capital conservation buffers, as required by the Basel III capital rules.

&#160;

Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action . Prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept broker deposits. The OCC is required to take certain supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, the severity of which depends upon the institution&#8217;s degree of undercapitalization. In addition, numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to an undercapitalized institution, including, but not limited to, increased monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth, capital distributions and expansion. The OCC could also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. Significantly and undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional mandatory and discretionary measures.

&#160;

Loans to One Borrower. Federal law provides that savings institutions are generally subject to the limits on loans to one borrower applicable to national banks. Generally, subject to certain exceptions, a savings institution may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of its unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if secured by specified readily-marketable collateral.

&#160;

Standards for Safety and Soundness. As required by statute, the federal banking agencies have adopted Interagency Guidelines prescribing Standards for Safety and Soundness. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency determines that a savings institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard.

&#160;

Limitation on Capital Distributions. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulations impose limitations upon all capital distributions by a savings institution, including cash dividends, payments to repurchase its shares and payments to shareholders of another institution in a cash-out merger. Under the regulations, an application to and the prior approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required before any capital distribution if the institution does not meet the criteria for &#8220;expedited treatment&#8221; of applications under Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulations ( i.e. , generally, examination and Community Reinvestment Act ratings in the two top categories), the total capital distributions for the calendar year exceed net income for that year plus the amount of retained net income for the preceding two years, the institution would be undercapitalized following the distribution or the distribution would otherwise be contrary to a statute, regulation or agreement with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. If an application is not required, the institution must still provide prior notice to the Federal Reserve Board of the capital distribution if, like First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky, it is a subsidiary of a holding company as well as an informational notice to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. If First Federal of Hazard&#8217;s or First Federal of Kentucky&#8217;s capital were ever to fall below its regulatory requirements or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency notified it that it was in need of increased supervision, its ability to make capital distributions could be restricted. In addition, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency could prohibit a proposed capital distribution that would otherwise be permitted by the regulation, if the agency determines that such distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.

&#160;

Qualified Thrift Lender Test. Federal law requires savings institutions to meet a qualified thrift lender test. Under the test, a savings institution is required to either qualify as a &#8220;domestic building and loan association&#8221; under the Internal Revenue Code or maintain at least 65% of its &#8220;portfolio assets&#8221; (total assets less: (i) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets; (ii) intangibles, including goodwill; and (iii) the value of property used to conduct business) in certain &#8220;qualified thrift investments&#8221; (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage-backed securities, education loans, credit card loans and small business loans) in at least 9 months out of each 12-month period.

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

A savings institution that fails the qualified thrift lender test is subject to certain operating restrictions. The Dodd-Frank Act also specifies that failing the qualified thrift lender test is a violation of law that could result in an enforcement action and dividend limitations. At June 30, 2016, First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky each met the qualified thrift lender test.

&#160;

Transactions with Related Parties. Federal law limits the authority of First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky to lend to, and engage in certain other transactions with (collectively, &#8220;covered transactions&#8221;), &#8220;affiliates&#8221; ( e.g. , any company that controls or is under common control with an institution, including Kentucky First, First Federal MHC and their non-savings institution subsidiaries). The aggregate amount of covered transactions with any individual affiliate is limited to 10% of the capital and surplus of the savings institution. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20% of the savings institution&#8217;s capital and surplus. Loans and other specified transactions with affiliates are required to be secured by collateral in an amount and of a type described in federal law. The purchase of low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited. Transactions with affiliates must be on terms and under circumstances that are at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. In addition, savings institutions are prohibited from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and no savings institution may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary. Transactions between sister depository institutions that are 80% or more owned by the same holding company are exempt from the quantitative limits and collateral requirements.

&#160;

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits a company from making loans to its executive officers and directors. However, that law contains a specific exception for loans by a depository institution to its executive officers and directors in compliance with federal banking laws. Under such laws, First Federal of Hazard&#8217;s and First Federal of Kentucky&#8217;s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10% shareholders (&#8220;insiders&#8221;), as well as entities such persons control, is limited. The law restricts both the individual and aggregate amount of loans First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky may make to insiders based, in part, on First Federal of Hazard&#8217;s and First Federal of Kentucky&#8217;s respective capital positions and requires certain board approval procedures to be followed. Such loans must be made on terms, including rates and collateral, substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals prevailing at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to the lender and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There are additional restrictions applicable to loans to executive officers.

&#160;

Enforcement. The Office of The Comptroller of the Currency has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings institutions and has the authority to bring actions against the institution and all institution-affiliated parties, including stockholders, and any attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors to appointment of a receiver or conservator or termination of deposit insurance. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and can amount to $25,000 per day, or even $1 million per day in especially egregious cases. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has authority to recommend to the Director of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency that enforcement action to be taken with respect to a particular savings institution. If action is not taken by the Director, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has authority to take such action under certain circumstances. Federal law also establishes criminal penalties for certain violations.

&#160;

Assessments. Federal savings banks pay assessments to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to fund its operations. The general assessments, paid on a semi-annual basis, are based upon the savings institution&#8217;s total assets, including consolidated subsidiaries, its financial condition and the complexity of its portfolio.

&#160;

Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The deposits of both First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Deposit insurance per account owner is currently $250,000. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation&#8217;s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned a risk category based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution&#8217;s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned, and certain adjustments specified by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations. Institutions deemed less risky pay lower assessments. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may adjust the scale uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment. No institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment.

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon each insured institution&#8217;s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation finalized a rule, effective April 1, 2011, that set the assessment range at 2.5 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity.

&#160;

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Banks. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future.

&#160;

Federal Home Loan Bank System. First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky are members of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. As members of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky are each required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in that Federal Home Loan Bank. First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky were in compliance with this requirement with investments in Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati stock at June 30, 2016, of $2.0 million and $4.5 million, respectively.

&#160;

Federal Reserve System. Pursuant to regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, a financial institution must maintain average daily reserves equal to 3% on transaction accounts of between $15.2 million and $110.2 million, plus 10% on the remainder. The first $15.2 million of transaction accounts are exempt. These percentages are subject to adjustment by the Federal Reserve Board. Because required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or in a noninterest-bearing account at the Federal Reserve Bank, the effect of the reserve requirement is to reduce the amount of the institution&#8217;s interest-earning assets. As of June 30, 2016, the Banks met their reserve requirements.

&#160;

Community Reinvestment Act. All federal savings institutions have a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The Community Reinvestment Act does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution&#8217;s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the Community Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act requires the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, in connection with its examination of a savings institution, to assess the institution&#8217;s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution.

&#160;

The Community Reinvestment Act requires public disclosure of an institution&#8217;s rating and requires the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to provide a written evaluation of an institution&#8217;s Community Reinvestment Act performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky each received a &#8220;Satisfactory&#8221; rating as a result of their most recent Community Reinvestment Act assessments.

&#160; 

Holding Company Regulation 

&#160;

General. Kentucky First and First Federal MHC are savings and loan holding companies within the meaning of federal law. As such, they are registered with the Federal Reserve Board and are subject to Federal Reserve Board regulations, examinations, supervision, reporting requirements and regulations concerning corporate governance and activities. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over Kentucky First and First Federal MHC and their non-savings institution subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to First Federal of Hazard and/or First Federal of Kentucky.

&#160;

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Restrictions Applicable to Mutual Holding Companies. According to federal law and Federal Reserve Board regulations, a mutual holding company, such as First Federal MHC, may generally engage in the following activities: (1) investing in the stock of insured depository institutions and acquiring them by means of a merger or acquisition; (2) investing in a corporation the capital stock of which may be lawfully purchased by a savings association under federal law; (3) furnishing or performing management services for a savings association subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company; (4) conducting an insurance agency or escrow business; (5) holding, managing or liquidating assets owned or acquired from a savings association subsidiary of the savings and loan holding company; (6) holding or managing properties used or occupied by a savings association subsidiary of the savings and loan holding company; (7) acting as trustee under deed of trust; (8) any activity permitted for multiple savings and loan holding companies by Federal Reserve Board regulations; (9) any activity permitted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for bank holding companies and financial holding companies; and (10) any activity permissible for service corporations. Legislation, which authorized mutual holding companies to engage in activities permitted for financial holding companies, expanded the authorized activities. Financial holding companies may engage in a broad array of financial services activities, including insurance and securities.

&#160;

Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, including a federal mutual holding company, from directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, acquiring more than 5% of the voting stock of another savings institution, or its holding company, without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Federal law also prohibits a savings and loan holding company from acquiring or retaining control of a depository institution that is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board must consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance funds, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.

&#160;

The Federal Reserve Board is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, except: (1) the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies, and (2) the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisitions. The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions.

&#160;

Capital Requirements . Savings and loan holding companies historically have not been subject to specific regulatory capital requirements. However, in July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board approved a new rule that implements the &#8220;Basel III&#8221; regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule established consolidated capital requirements for many savings and loan holding companies, including the Company. See &#8220;Regulation and Supervision&#8212;Regulation of Federal Savings Institutions &#8211; Capital Requirements,&#8221; above.

&#160; 

Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act also extends the &#8220;source of strength&#8221; doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The regulatory agencies must promulgate regulations implementing the &#8220;source of strength&#8221; policy that holding companies act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.

&#160;

Dividends. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expressed the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company&#8217;s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earning retention that is consistent with the company&#8217;s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Furthermore, under the prompt correction action regulations, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company&#8217;s bank subsidiary is classified as &#8220;undercapitalized.&#8221; See &#8220;Depository Institution Regulation &#8211; Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action.&#8221; 

&#160;

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Stock Holding Company Subsidiary Regulation. Federal Reserve Board regulations govern the two-tier mutual holding company form of organization and subsidiary stock holding companies that are controlled by mutual holding companies. Kentucky First is the stock holding company subsidiary of First Federal MHC. Kentucky First is only permitted to engage in activities that are permitted for First Federal MHC subject to the same restrictions and conditions.

&#160;

Waivers of Dividends by First Federal MHC . Federal Reserve Board regulations require First Federal MHC to notify the Federal Reserve Board if it proposes to waive receipt of our dividends from Kentucky First. The Dodd-Frank Act addresses the issue of dividend waivers in the context of the transfer of the supervision of savings and loan holding companies to the Federal Reserve Board. The Dodd-Frank Act specified that dividends may be waived if certain conditions are met, including that the Federal Reserve Board does not object after being given written notice of the dividend and proposed waiver. The Dodd-Frank Act indicates that the Federal Reserve Board may not object to such a waiver (i) if the mutual holding company involved has, prior to December 1, 2009, reorganized into a mutual holding company structure, engaged in a minority stock offering and waived dividends; (ii) the board of directors of the mutual holding company expressly determines that a waiver of the dividend is consistent with its fiduciary duties to members and (iii) the waiver would not be detrimental to the safe and sound operation of the savings association subsidiaries of the holding company. The Federal Reserve Board will not consider the amount of dividends waived by the mutual holding company in determining an appropriate exchange ratio in the event of a full conversion to stock form. Kentucky First was granted such a waiver and dividends were paid to the Company&#8217;s shareholders on August 16 and November 22, 2011, as well as February 21, 2012. First Federal MHC was not allowed to waive its dividend with respect to the dividend paid on May 21, 2012. First Federal MHC subsequently received Federal Reserve Board approval to waive quarterly dividends totaling $0.40 per share annually beginning with the dividend paid on September 28, 2012 and continuing through the dividend payable in the 3rd quarter of 2014. In an effort to comply with Regulation MM and to be able to continue to waive the dividend, First Federal MHC put the issue to a vote of the members on August 23, 2012, again on July 9, 2013, again on July 8, 2014, again on July 7, 2015, and again on July 7, 2016. Members of First Federal MHC voted in favor of the dividend waiver on all four occasions. As a result, First Federal MHC will be permitted to waive the receipt of dividends for quarterly dividends up to $0.10 per common share through the third quarter of 2017. It is expected that First Federal MHC will continue to waive future dividends, except to the extent dividends are needed to fund First Federal MHC&#8217;s continuing operations, subject to the ability of First Federal MHC to obtain regulatory approval of its requests to waive dividends and to its ability to obtain member approval of dividend waivers. For more information, see Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Our ability to pay dividends is subject to the ability of First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky to make capital distributions to Kentucky First and the waiver of dividends by First Federal MHC.&#8221;

Conversion of First Federal MHC to Stock Form. Federal Reserve Board regulations permit First Federal MHC to convert from the mutual form of organization to the capital stock form of organization. In a conversion transaction, a new holding company would be formed as successor to First Federal MHC, its corporate existence would end, and certain depositors would receive the right to subscribe for additional shares of the new holding company. In a conversion transaction, each share of common stock held by stockholders other than First Federal MHC would be automatically converted into a number of shares of common stock of the new holding company based on an exchange ratio determined at the time of conversion that ensures that stockholders other than First Federal MHC own the same percentage of common stock in the new holding company as they owned in us immediately before conversion. Under Federal Reserve Board regulations, stockholders other than First Federal MHC would not be diluted because of any dividends waived by First Federal MHC (and waived dividends would not be considered in determining an appropriate exchange ratio, provided that the mutual holding company involved was formed, engaged in a minority offering and waived dividends prior to December 1, 2009), in the event First Federal MHC converts to stock form. First Federal MHC was formed, engaged in a minority stock offering and waived dividends prior to December 1, 2009. The total number of shares held by stockholders other than First Federal MHC after a conversion transaction also would be increased by any purchases by stockholders other than First Federal MHC in the stock offering conducted as part of the conversion transaction.

Acquisition of Control. Under the federal Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve Board if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire &#8220;control&#8221; of a savings and loan holding company or savings association. An acquisition of &#8220;control&#8221; can occur upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the voting stock of a savings and loan holding company or savings institution or as otherwise defined by the Federal rd. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, the Federal Reserve Board has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the anti-trust effects of the acquisition. Any company that so acquires control would then be subject to regulation as a savings and loan holding company.

Federal and State Taxation 

&#160; 

General. We report our income on a fiscal year basis using the accrual method of accounting.

&#160;

Federal Taxation. The federal income tax laws apply to us in the same manner as to other corporations with some exceptions, including particularly the reserve for bad debts discussed below. The following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to us. Our federal income tax returns are subject to examination for years 2012 and later. For the 2016 fiscal year, First Federal of Hazard&#8217;s and Frankfort First&#8217;s maximum federal income tax rate was 34.0%.

&#160;

For fiscal years beginning before June 30, 1996, thrift institutions that qualified under certain definitional tests and other conditions of the Internal Revenue Code were permitted to use certain favorable provisions to calculate their deductions from taxable income for annual additions to their bad debt reserve. A reserve could be established for bad debts on qualifying real property loans, generally secured by interests in real property improved or to be improved, under the percentage of taxable income method or the experience method. The reserve for nonqualifying loans was computed using the experience method. Federal legislation enacted in 1996 repealed the reserve method of accounting for bad debts and the percentage of taxable income method for tax years beginning after 1995 and require savings institutions to recapture or take into income certain portions of their accumulated bad debt reserves. First Federal of Hazard did not qualify for such favorable tax treatment for any years through 1996. Approximately $5.2 million of First Federal of Kentucky First&#8217;s accumulated bad debt reserves would not be recaptured into taxable income unless Frankfort First makes a &#8220;non-dividend distribution&#8221; to Kentucky First as described below.

&#160;

If First Federal of Hazard or First Federal of Kentucky makes &#8220;non-dividend distributions&#8221; to us, the distributions will be considered to have been made from First Federal of Hazard&#8217;s and First Federal of Kentucky&#8217;s unrecaptured tax bad debt reserves, including the balance of their reserves as of December 31, 1987, to the extent of the &#8220;non-dividend distributions,&#8221; and then from First Federal of Kentucky&#8217;s supplemental reserve for losses on loans, to the extent of those reserves, and an amount based on the amount distributed, but not more than the amount of those reserves, will be included in First Federal of Kentucky&#8217;s taxable income. Non-dividend distributions include distributions in excess of First Federal of Kentucky&#8217;s current and accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated for federal income tax purposes, distributions in redemption of stock, and distributions in partial or complete liquidation. Dividends paid out of First Federal of Kentucky&#8217;s current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be so included in First Federal of Kentucky&#8217;s taxable income.

&#160;

The amount of additional taxable income triggered by a non-dividend distribution is an amount that, when reduced by the tax attributable to the income, is equal to the amount of the distribution. Therefore, if First Federal of Kentucky makes a non-dividend distribution to us, approximately one and one-half times the amount of the distribution not in excess of the amount of the reserves would be includable in income for federal income tax purposes, assuming a 34% federal corporate income tax rate. First Federal of Kentucky does not intend to pay dividends in the future that would result in a recapture of any portion of its bad debt reserves.

&#160;

State Taxation. Although First Federal MHC and Kentucky First are subject to the Kentucky corporation income tax and state corporation license tax (franchise tax), the corporation license tax is repealed effective for tax periods ending on or after December 31, 2005. Gross income of corporations subject to Kentucky income tax is similar to income reported for federal income tax purposes except that dividend income, among other income items, is exempt from taxation. For First Federal MHC and Kentucky First tax years beginning July 1, 2005, the corporations are subject to an alternative minimum income tax. Corporations must pay the greater of the income tax, the alternative tax or $175. The corporations can choose between two methods to calculate the alternative minimum; 9.5 cents per $100 of the corporation&#8217;s gross receipts, or 75 cents per $100 of the corporation&#8217;s Kentucky gross profits. Kentucky gross profits means Kentucky gross receipts reduced by returns and allowances attributable to Kentucky gross receipts, less Kentucky cost of goods sold. The corporations, in their capacity as holding companies for financial institutions, do not have a material amount of cost of goods sold. Although the corporate license tax rate is 0.21% of total capital employed in Kentucky, a bank holding company, as defined in Kentucky Revised Statutes 287.900, is allowed to deduct from its taxable capital, the book value of its investment in the stock or securities of subsidiaries that are subject to the bank franchise tax.

&#160;

First Federal of Hazard and First Federal of Kentucky are exempt from both the Kentucky corporation income tax and corporation license tax. However, both institutions are instead subject to the bank franchise tax, an annual tax imposed on federally or state chartered savings and loan associations, savings banks and other similar institutions operating in Kentucky. The tax is 0.1% of taxable capital stock held as of January 1 each year. Taxable capital stock includes an institution&#8217;s undivided profits, surplus and general reserves plus savings accounts and paid-up stock less deductible items. Deductible items include certain exempt federal obligations and Kentucky municipal bonds. Financial institutions which are subject to tax both within and without Kentucky must apportion their net capital.
