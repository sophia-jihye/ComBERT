&#160;

Premise Distribution Products: 

&#160;

Suttle provides service distribution products for cost-effective solutions using existing wiring. These products reduce installation time and labor costs, and increase the provider&#8217;s return on investment. In addition to reducing a service provider&#8217;s up-front costs, Suttle&#8217;s high throughput solutions help eliminate potential bottlenecks to &#8220;future-proof&#8221; the installation, reducing future costs.

&#160;

Suttle&#8217;s new MediaMAX TM premise distribution system provides for reliable brownfield and greenfield premise connectivity to meet the increasing demand for wired and wireless gigabit connectivity throughout the home and small office. Designed to optimize installation cost and practices while maximizing coverage and bandwidth at the point of use for multiple deployment topologies, this brand includes a premise connectivity and distribution system, featuring plastic modular enclosures and tool-less, snap-in modules to minimize wireless interference. MediaMAX TM replaces Suttle&#8217;s SOHO TM brand products for premise distribution which have been sold for approximately the last 10 years.

&#160;

Suttle&#8217;s FutureLink TM product family provides solutions for higher speed, tool-less connectivity and lower cost of ownership, such as copper and fiber connectivity systems, enclosure systems, network interface devices (NIDs), splitters, and active technologies for voice, data and video communications.

&#160;

Passive solutions provide connectivity for traditional telephony and broadband deployments. Through our highly recognized brands &#8212; SpeedStar&#8482; and Corroshield&#174; as well as our new FutureLink&#8482; product family brand for higher speeds &#8212; Suttle provides the right solution for wired distribution.

&#160;

Markets and Marketing 

&#160;

Suttle markets its outside plant and premise distribution products globally to telecommunications companies. Suttle has a solid history of offering long-term solutions to some of the largest global providers by understanding the customer&#8217;s needs and providing innovative solutions coupled with strong customer support. Suttle also markets its products to service providers, residential builders, and low-voltage installers through distributors and the Company&#8217;s sales staff. Suttle reaches its targeted customers through a variety of marketing media including trade shows, associations, advertising, social media, and the Suttle website.

&#160;

Suttle recently changed its domain name for electronic communications to SuttleSolutions.com to emphasize our focus on end-to-end customer oriented solutions for communication service providers.

&#160;

Customers 

&#160;

Suttle&#8217;s customers include the major communication companies globally, including both telephone and cable service provider companies. The Company&#8217;s major telephone company customers include Verizon, ATT, and CenturyLink. Suttle serves these major telephone companies directly by Suttle&#8217;s sales staff and through a select group of distributors. Sales (including DSL) to the major telephone companies, as a group, both directly and through distribution, represented 79% of Suttle&#8217;s sales in 2015 and 84% in 2014.

&#160;

3&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Other customers include smaller telephone companies, electrical/low-voltage contractors, home builders, and a nationwide network of distributors. Suttle serves these customers primarily through distributors, but also directly through its sales staff. Sales to cable customers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are made through the nationwide network of distributors and through the Suttle sales staff. Sales to OEMs and other distributors were 6% of Suttle&#8217;s sales in 2015 and 9% in 2014. Sales to international customers and other customers represented 15% of Suttle&#8217;s sales in 2015 and 7% in 2014.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Suttle encounters strong competition in all its product lines and competes primarily on the basis of the broad lines of products offered, product performance, quality, price, delivery, and customer support. In addition, distributors of Suttle&#8217;s products also market products for one or more of its competitors.

&#160;

Order Book 

&#160;

Suttle manufactures its products on the basis of estimated customer requirements. Outstanding customer orders at March 1, 2016 were approximately $3,828,000 compared to approximately $2,356,000 at March 1, 2015. New orders are generally filled within 60 days. Suttle does not believe its order book is a significant indicator of longer term future results.

&#160;

Manufacturing and Sources of Supply 

&#160;

Suttle manufactures its products using plastic or metal parts, wire sub-assemblies, fasteners, brackets, electronic circuit boards, and other components, most of which are fabricated by Suttle. There are multiple sources of supply for the materials and parts required and the Company is not dependent upon any single supplier, except that Suttle&#8217;s corrosion-resistant products use a moisture-resistant gel-filled fig available only from Tyco Electronics Connectivity. Although Suttle has not generally experienced significant problems in obtaining its required supplies, from time to time it experiences spot shortages and additional order lead times are required from its offshore suppliers.

&#160;

New Product Development; Patents and Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Suttle continually seeks to understand the needs of its customers and both develops new products for evolving customer requirements and enhances existing products to improve its existing product line. For competitive reasons, including duplication of its designs by foreign apparatus manufacturers, Suttle has adopted a policy to seek patent protection on innovative new products. Suttle applied for five patents in 2015 and expects to file for eight patents in 2016.

&#160;

Research and development consists primarily of designing, prototyping, and testing of equipment and supplies associated with enhancing existing products and developing new products. Research and development costs are expensed when incurred and were $4,959,000 in 2015 compared to $3,670,000 in 2014.

&#160;

Suttle and Suttle Solutions are important trademarks for its business. Suttle regularly supports these brand names by trade advertising and believes they are well known in the marketplace. Other important trademarks include FutureLink TM brand umbrella for e nd-to-end products for outside plant, connectivity and premise distribution; plastic MediaMAX TM and enclosures and modules; SpeedStar TM for passive premise connectivity; and CorroShield &#174; brand gel that prevents network corrosion. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Products 

&#160;

Transition Networks designs, assembles and sells media converter devices, NIDs, Ethernet switches and other connectivity products that make it possible to transmit telecommunications signals across networks and between systems using different types of media (for example, between copper and fiber optic networks). These products assist in resolving challenges in the areas of bandwidth constraints, security risks, and distance limitations as networks extend from local area to wide area networks and adapt to ever increasing end user demands. As enterprise networks are seemingly always in transition, our solutions enable customers to integrate fiber optics into their existing infrastructure as their networks grow, and extend advanced data services to customers at remote locations, including support of wireless networks and its backhaul requirements . Many of our products incorporate features for performing advanced levels of fault management and other benefits to aid in troubleshooting fiber optic and copper network infrastructure. Our growing Power-over-Ethernet (PoE) products provide support of remote devices such as cameras and wireless access points by passing electrical power along with data on Ethernet cabling, eliminating the need for local power in hard to reach locations. 

&#160;

Transition Networks products support a wide variety of protocols, including: 10 Gigabit Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, Ethernet, T1/E1, DS3, Circuit Emulation Services (TDM or ISDN over Ethernet or IP), RS232, RS485, OC3, OC12, and more. Transition Networks develops product hardware and software internally, and expenses the related costs as they are incurred. In connection with the sale of its hardware products, Transition Networks provides its customers with a variety of software management options including powerful Orchestration and Element Management System (EMS) software for providing superior service provisioning and monitoring of next-generation Carrier Ethernet 2.0 Services. The Company has been developing and marketing Ethernet-based networking products for approximately 28 years. Transition Networks continues to develop products that address the enterprise, service provider, industrial, government, and security markets.

&#160;

Manufacturing and Sources of Supply 

&#160;

Transition Networks uses contract manufacturers to manufacture its products in different geographical locations. In 2015, 62% of the total value of its products was manufactured in Asia while the remaining 38% was manufactured in the US. Offshore sources of supply are subject to certain risks, including political risk. The Company has alternate sources of supply for its products in different geographical locations and to date has not had problems obtaining necessary product.

&#160;

Markets and Marketing 

&#160;

Transition Networks&#8217; products are used in a broad array of markets including the federal government, enterprise, service provider, industrial, and surveillance markets. Transition Networks has a broad customer base and its products are used in a variety of applications.

&#160;

The media conversion product line is used in several applications. The ION and Point System&#8482; chassis-based modular systems are used primarily in telecommunications closets for high-density applications and when multiple protocols need to be supported. Stand-alone media converters are used typically at a workstation or for lower density applications. The line of Ethernet switches is used in last mile access, backhaul, central closet and at the end user stations. The Carrier Ethernet NID line of products addresses the high quality access requirements for both business services and wireless backhaul data communications and telecommunications applications.

&#160;

Marketing primarily consists of direct marketing using a sales force, tradeshows, trade magazine advertising, on-line advertising, website, email, social media and public relations activities. Transition Networks also provides and participates in advertising and cooperative marketing campaigns with distribution partners.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s &#8220;Transition Networks&#8221; and &#8220;MILAN&#8221; brand names are important to its business. The Company regularly supports these names by trade advertising and believes them to be well known in the marketplace.

&#160;

5&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

Transition Networks develops products for the federal government, enterprise, service provider, security and industrial markets. This includes developing converters for emerging protocols and existing protocols in new markets, as well as new industry standards. Some of these products include remote management devices built on the IEEE&#174; 802.3AH, 802.3AG, ITU-T Y.1731 standards, Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF)&#174; and MEF 2.0 standards, and Power Over Ethernet devices based on the IEEE&#174; 802.3AF and IEEE&#174; 802.3AT standards. Some design efforts are paced by the development of critical components such as integrated circuits and optical transceivers.

&#160;

Research and development consists primarily of designing, prototyping, and testing of equipment and supplies associated with enhancing existing products and developing new products. Research and development costs are expensed when incurred and were $3,332,000 in 2015 compared to $4,166,000 in 2014.

&#160;

Transition Networks&#8217; conducts its research and development operations in the United States, out of its Minnetonka, MN headquarters location. While this US location has primary engineering and product development responsibility, it will occasionally utilize third party design services and Original Design Manufacturers (ODM) to support specific product design requirements. In addition, Transition Networks&#8217; subsidiary TN EMEA, in the UK (renamed Net2Edge in 2016) has been engaged in developing a new line of Circuit Emulation products. In 2016 Net2Edge will be classified as a separate business segment.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Transition Networks faces strong competition across its entire product line. A large number of competitors exist for high volume products in the Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet families, as well as the NIDs. Low cost competitors from China and Taiwan are strongest in Asian, European, Middle Eastern, and African (EMEA) and South American markets, with limited success in the North American market for the media converter products. Transition Networks also faces new competitors as it enters new markets for industrial products, security market, and higher performance devices for the service provider market.

&#160;

Order Book 

&#160;

Outstanding customer orders for Transition Networks products were approximately $4,485,000 at March 1, 2016 and $1,683,000 at March 1, 2015. Transition Networks orders are fulfilled on a relatively short-term basis and therefore the Company does not consider the order book as a significant indicator of longer term future results.

&#160;

( iii) JDL Technologies, Inc. 

&#160;

JDL Technologies, Inc. (&#8220;JDL Technologies&#8221; or &#8220;JDL&#8221;), based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is a managed service provider and value-added reseller, supplying information technology (IT) solutions focused on IT service and support management; network design, deployment and integration; cloud, hosted and virtualized services; and network operations center management.

Managed services revenues grew to $3,496,000 in 2015 from $1,731,000 in 2014.

&#160;

Competitive Strategy 

&#160;

The Florida technology market includes a number of managed service providers (MSPs) and value-added resellers (VARs), and is a microcosm of the burgeoning managed services industry in the U.S. JDL continues to differentiate itself in strategic ways and in early response to market shifts, and is well qualified to help organizations optimize their technologies in order to meet business objectives and regulatory requirements. 

&#160;

JDL partners with organizations to provide complete support for their information technology, from servers to applications down to the network and desktop levels. Under a typical managed services agreement, JDL maintains corporate IT, resolves issues, supports the client&#8217;s user community, and adds new value to the client&#8217;s businesses. JDL&#8217;s key avenues for delivering on this commitment&#8212;and its competitive advantages&#8212;include JDL&#8217;s on-premise managed services operations center and secure, state-of-the-art hosted datacenter. The managed services operations center leverages the best available tools, applications, practices and resources to deliver a consistent, quality customer experience. JDL Technologies was named to the 2015 Elite 150 Managed Service Providers in North America, part of The Channel Company&#8217;s 2015 MSP 500 list. JDL also holds the MSP Trustmark credential from CompTIA and is a member of the MSP Alliance . 

&#160;

6&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

JDL&#8217;s portfolio of technology solutions reflects the regular introduction of new technologies and delivery methodologies and the increasing demand among businesses for innovative solutions to strengthen their competitive edge and continuity. With its team of professionally certified engineers, more than 475 years of technical experience, and talented leadership, JDL Technologies develops best-of-breed IT solutions that effectively meet these demands. To sustain its leading-edge position, JDL maintains robust partnerships with strategic manufacturers and is a McKesson Platinum Partner, Microsoft Gold Partner, HP Enterprise Gold Partner, 3CX VoIP Gold Partner and Citrix Silver Partner. In recognition of its standing, JDL was named to the 2015 Fast Growth 150 Solution Providers by The Channel Company.

&#160;

In June 2015, JDL Technologies completed its first strategic acquisition to expand into the Southeastern U.S. and strengthen its healthcare portfolio by acquiring Twisted Technologies, a small IT firm in Atlanta focused on practice management and electronic medical records solutions for healthcare organizations. JDL is aggressively leveraging the benefits of this alliance, including an enhanced partnership with McKesson, and continues to explore additional strategic acquisitions. Organically, the company also grew substantially in response to increasing demand for managed services across industries.

&#160;

These combined factors reflect a stronger, more focused, more mature JDL Technologies. The company continues to win large, multi-state managed services clients, and to earn significant incremental business as well as large new infrastructure and virtualization opportunities. JDL remains focused on growth.

&#160;

Targeted Vertical Markets 

&#160;

The year 2015 was significant for JDL Technologies for vertical specialization and branding. The company developed three related brands, JDL HealthTech, JDL EduTech, and JDL TechWatch, to identify its healthcare, education and commercial business verticals, and launched corresponding websites to further sharpen its vertical market focus.

&#160; 

Education: 

Since JDL Technologies was established in 1995, its largest client has been the School Board of Broward County, Florida (SBBC), the sixth largest public school system in the United States. JDL staffs and manages the SBBC network operations center, which monitors all network elements (servers, switches, routers) and more than 100,000 computers in 265 buildings. In March 2015, JDL was awarded a five-year contract by the SBBC to provide Local Area Network, Wireless Local Area Network and data center upgrades, as well as other IT services, to several hundred public K-12 schools in the district. JDL began providing services under the contract in the second quarter of 2015.

&#160;

Healthcare: 

Under its JDL HealthTech brand, JDL continues to penetrate the $1.3 billion healthcare market in Florida, offering an array of services that address HIPAA Security Rule and Privacy Rule compliance requirements, including McKesson practice management and revenue cycle management services. JDL&#8217;s strategic segmentation of the healthcare market by organization size and specialization began to bear fruit in 2015, with JDL supporting a robust and growing managed services practice whose clients range from single-office practices to multi-location regional specialists to their regulated suppliers and business associates.

&#160;

Commercial: 

JDL Technologies continues to build a solid roster of diverse commercial clients under its JDL TechWatch brand, delivering dramatic growth in 2015 in recurring revenues from managed services as well as incremental revenues from additional project work. A sampling of these clients includes:

&#160;

- A 60-year-old Florida financial institution with two dozen branches and more than $4 billion in assets; 

- A global fitness program whose 14 million followers take weekly classes in over 100,000 locations ; 

- The largest private international bank in South America; 

- Several of the largest private investment firms in Florida; 

- A large family-owned tobacco corporation headquartered in Florida since 1962; 

- A well-funded non-profit organization with 19 locations in the continental U.S. &#160;

7&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Technology Solutions 

&#160;

As a managed service provider and value-added reseller, JDL Technologies specializes in delivering technology solutions that free organizations to focus on the strategic business activities that are critical to their financial success. JDL&#8217;s technology solutions encompass an extensive range of networking, virtualization, cloud and infrastructure services, most of which are available under JDL managed services contracts. As technology continues its move to the cloud, JDL aggressively built its portfolio of cloud-based service offerings in 2015, and continues to ensure that its engineers are trained and certified in the newest cloud and other technology solutions. 

&#160; 

Managed Services: 

JDL Technologies continues to expand in breadth and depth as a managed service provider, more than doubling monthly recurring revenues each year since establishing the program in early 2013. The company serves a diverse base of clients with locations throughout the United States, offering managed service programs designed specifically for the healthcare, commercial and education markets. These robust programs meet HIPAA compliance standards and, while the majority is supported remotely, independent of geographic borders, the company is also able to provide on-site network management and help desk support for key enterprise clients in South Florida. The company&#8217;s managed services include network management, availability assurance, event alerting and incident management services; server, workstation, mobile device and other asset management services; security services including software patching, firewall, antivirus, antimalware and intrusion detection and prevention services; help desk support for client users; SIP trunking, voice over IP and office management services; migration, conversion and vendor management; and technical consulting services and training.

&#160;

Cloud Solutions: 

JDL Technologies continued to build its portfolio of cloud service offerings in 2015, leading this trend in the Florida and Georgia healthcare markets with services supporting HIPAA compliance. Wireless as a service, infrastructure as a service, and Citrix as a service are among the most popular cloud offerings, with others including backup, storage, voice over IP, firewall and email as cloud or hosted services. The benefits to clients are numerous and include vertical and horizontal scalability, internal bandwidth conservation, and simplification of IT management within client organizations. All JDL cloud offerings are billable as monthly recurring revenue under its managed service model, and JDL is committed to bringing the benefits of cloud services to all clients.

&#160;

Network Services: 

JDL&#8217;s roots are in network services; these services remain central to the company&#8217;s role as a managed service provider and value-added reseller. The JDL team has extensive experience and professional certifications in assessing, designing and implementing wired and wireless networks as well as entire technology infrastructures. Networking services also include MPLS, private line and IP communications, network and endpoint security, network tuning and cabling/wiring services. Public school districts and healthcare organizations, in particular, are actively leveraging wireless networks to simplify their communications systems, reduce their technology footprint in confined spaces, and lower maintenance costs. With funding of wireless as a service available through the modernized E-Rate program, wireless networking deployments have become top priority for many public school systems. One example is the School Board of Broward County, which in 2015 awarded JDL a new contract to provide wireless network upgrades throughout the district in addition to other network services.

&#160; 

Virtualization: 

Using virtualization across an organization&#8217;s IT infrastructure delivers greater agility, mobility and efficiency. JDL&#8217;s virtualization engineers assess, design, deploy, and manage virtualization programs that ensure user access to any workload, anytime, anywhere, on any device. JDL&#8217;s virtualization services encompass desktops, servers, applications, storage, and any combination thereof, including connectivity and software licensing. As JDL clients continue to adopt virtualization, they experience the economies of scale, reduced capital requirements, enhanced security, and disaster recovery protections that are inherent in virtualized environments. 

&#160;
