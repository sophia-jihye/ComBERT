In September, 2014 we acquired intellectual property rights in relation to the trademarked Carolco Pictures, a name synonymous with high quality blockbuster films from the Terminator series, Rambo series and Basic Instinct to Total Recall and the Doors, amongst many others, as described herein.

The Company 

&#160; 

Film Production 

&#160; 

The Filmmaking Process . The filmmaking process starts with an idea, from freelance writers or from existing literary or other works. Successful ideas are generally written up as a treatment (or story description) and then proceed to a screenplay, followed by the storyboarding process and then finally into the production process. Excluding the script and early development phase, the production process, from storyboarding to filming out the final image, for a full-length feature film can take approximately two to four years. We outsource individuals that are responsible for preparing and offering story-lines and ideas for the initial stages of development. These individuals, through creative development controls, are responsible for ensuring that ideas follow the best creative path within a desired budget and schedule. The complexity of each project, the background locations, the characters and all of the elements in a project create a very intricate and time-consuming process that differs from project-to-project. The four general phases for development of a full-length feature film include (1) the development phase which consists of story and visual development, (2) the pre-production phase which involves final refinement of the script and story, (3) the production phase which involves the actual filming and (4) the post-production phase where elements such as sound effects and the music/score are added. 

&#160; 

Television Production 

&#160; 

Through our subsidiary High Five Entertainment, we specialize in the development and presentation of quality television programming including specials, pilots, live events and award shows. Founded in Los Angeles, California in 1983, High Five Entertainment&#8217;s unwavering commitment to excellence in entertainment production for more than 30 years continues to foster an impressive legacy of unsurpassed client satisfaction through collaborative creative development, meticulous planning and flawless delivery of world-class entertainment properties.

&#160; 

High Five Entertainment, produced television&#8217;s first ever live musical performances weaved throughout a previously recorded network television premiere. On September 24, 2014, in connection with ABC&#8217;s Nashville premieres on both the East Coast and West Coast, High Five Entertainment mixed fantasy and reality as it brought together the Nashville stars with actual country music legends, broadcasting two concerts directly from the Bluebird Caf&#233; set. Receiving real life acclaim for the innovation and quality, High Five Entertainment continues its ground breaking work. The progressive mixture of live and taped footage comes immediately after High Five Entertainment produced the Americana Music Honors &#38; Awards, another in a series of well received accomplishments. 

&#160; 

High Five Entertainment again produced the Country Music Awards Red Carpet event for the CMT network, leading in to the 48th Annual CMA Awards. We believe High Five Entertainment will continue to produce its ground breaking and well received programming in the immediate future. 

&#160; 

In September 2014, we acquired intellectual property rights in relation to the trademarked Carolco Pictures. The Company believes it will successfully leverage the name that brought the public noteworthy films such as the Terminator series, the Rambo Series, Basic Instinct, Total Recall and The Doors, and capitalize on this acquisition. We have been awarded intellectual property rights to the concomitant service mark for use in the United States. 

&#160; 

High Five Entertainment 

&#160; 

As briefly described above, High Five Entertainment is an internationally recognized, Emmy Award-winning entertainment production company based in Nashville, Tennessee specializing in the development and presentation of quality television programming including series, specials, pilots, live events and award shows. 

&#160; 

Founded in Los Angeles, California in 1983, High Five&#8217;s unwavering commitment to excellence in entertainment production for more than 30 years continues to foster an impressive legacy of unsurpassed client satisfaction through collaborative creative development, meticulous planning and flawless delivery of world-class entertainment properties. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Relocating to Nashville in the early nineties, High Five Entertainment became synonymous with the presentation of groundbreaking music television events (&#8220;The Women of Country&#8221; CBS, &#8220;This Is Garth Brooks&#8221; NBC, &#8220;At the Ryman&#8221; CMT and &#8220;The Road&#8221; Tribune Entertainment). Today, High Five continues to be one of the premiere producers of quality music-television entertainment with ongoing episodes of Opry Live quality music-television entertainment with ongoing episodes of synonymous with the presentation of groundbreaking music television events. 

&#160; 

High Five made an extremely successful foray into the fascinating world of motorsports entertainment, producing SPEED Channel&#8217;s (soon to be Fox Sports One) top-rated series tPass Time&#8221;, a riveting, fast-paced game show for gear heads. HFE produced more than 150 episodes of the show. Also for SPEED Channel, High Five produced two seasons the popular unscripted series &#8220;Drag Race High&#8221; pitting two area high school motor-shop classes in direct head to head competition building and racing their own dragsters. HFE followed this with the series &#8220;Burnout &#8211;The Ultimate Drag Race Challenge&#8221; in Phoenix, AZ which aired on MTV2. HFE also recently produced a record-breaking PBS pledge special with Dr. Daniel Amen, iChange Your Brain, Change Your Life&#8221;, and the follow-up special &#8220;A Magnificent Mind At Any Age&#8221;. 

&#160; 

Recall Studios 

&#160; 

On July 21, 2016, we acquired Recall studios. Founded by business, media and entertainment industry leaders to meet growing demand for Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) content, Recall Studios operates within the convergence of immersive content and software. Recall Studios will allow consumers to create and share interactive experiences across all platforms. Combining modern business strategy with industry experience by bringing together highly trained relative newcomers and entertainment industry stalwarts to create low risk, high profit and artistically acclaimed feature film virtual reality and television projects, the Company and its subsidiaries are analyzing profitability across myriad entertainment sectors. We believe that Recall Studios is the future of new media entertainment and technology. 

&#160; 

New Media is a multi-billion-dollar industry even in its nascent form. Demand for VR and mixed media content is growing rapidly. 

&#160; 

Experienced at developing immersive narratives and software, we believe that Recall&#8217;s team is positioned to capitalize on the absence of high quality consumer VR experiences and software. No company has emerged as the leader in either VR production or technologies that allow consumers to edit, create, and distribute interactive VR content. Recall&#8217;s competition is limited as we do not believe that there are any companies actively providing non-linear, interactive VR software/platform solutions for consumers. 

&#160; 

Management 

&#160; 

The business side of our management team is disciplined in financial risk mitigation techniques. Aside from the commercialization of our management team&#8217;s past successes, which cannot in themselves necessarily predict future success, we are experienced at balancing projects, budgets and growth to effectively manage risk in light of our business objectives. 

&#160; 

We believe that we have unique access to Hollywood talent, scripts and third parties ripe for acquisition. We believe that the reputation of our management team in producing some of the most-well known, talked about and socially ingrained entertainment opens doors for us that are closed to others. 

&#160; 

We believe we represent a new model in entertainment industry profitability. We intend to focus on growth and efficiency. Our development plan combines modern business strategy with old-fashioned industry experience. Our early acquisition, High Five Entertainment, has given us highly regarded, industry leading talent. We have matched that talent with new and existing property development. By targeting additional revenue positive entertainment projects and companies, we expect to achieve increased profitability and efficiency through scale. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We believe that our management team&#8217;s reputation, contacts and experience give us a competitive edge. However, the market for productions currently is, and is expected to continue to be, extremely competitive. Our competitors include many companies that have substantially greater financial, management, marketing resources and experience than us. There can be no assurance that our productions will be competitive with other motion pictures or television shows, or that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had four full-time employees. As of October 31, 2016, we had four full-time employees.
