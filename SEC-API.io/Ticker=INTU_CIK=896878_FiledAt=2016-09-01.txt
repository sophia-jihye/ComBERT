CORPORATE BACKGROUND 

General 

Intuit Inc. creates business and financial management solutions that help simplify the business of life for small businesses, consumers, and accounting professionals. With flagship products and services that include QuickBooks and TurboTax, we help customers solve important business and financial management problems such as running a small business, paying bills, and filing income taxes. ProSeries and Lacerte are Intuit&#8217;s leading tax preparation offerings for professional accountants.

&#32;BUSINESS OVERVIEW 

Intuit&#8217;s Mission 

We are a global product and platform company that seeks to improve our customers&#8217; financial lives so profoundly they can&#8217;t imagine going back to the old way. 

Our customers include consumers and small businesses, and the accounting professionals who serve and advise them. We help simplify the business of life in four ways: 

&#8226; 

Improving financial strength &#8211; Helping consumers make and save money and small businesses to grow and profit. 

&#8226; 

Increasing productivity &#8211; Turning drudgery into time for what matters most. 

&#8226; 

Maintaining compliance &#8211; Helping customers comply with regulations. 

&#8226; 

Building confidence &#8211; Sharing the wisdom and experience of others. 

As emerging technology and market trends change the way people live and work, we change too. We&#8217;ve adapted our product line, moving from the desktop to the cloud and mobile devices. By offering many services online, we&#8217;re connecting customers to our solutions and with each other in ways that add more value to our products and services. 

&#32;3 

Tables of Contents 

Our growth strategy, described below, focuses on two key outcomes: 

&#8226; 

To be the operating system behind small business success. 

&#8226; 

To do the nations&#8217; taxes in the United States and Canada. 

We apply this vision globally, helping our customers expand their business to domestic and worldwide markets, creating and selling our own products internationally, and extending our recruiting efforts to new countries to find best-in-class talent. 

Our Business Portfolio 

We organize our businesses into three &#32;reportable segments &#8211; Small Business, Consumer Tax, and ProConnect (formerly known as Professional Tax). 

Small Business: &#32;This segment targets small businesses and the accounting professionals who serve and advise them and includes QuickBooks financial and business management online services and desktop software, payroll solutions, and payment processing solutions. It also includes third-party applications that integrate with our offerings. 

Consumer Tax: &#32;This segment targets consumers and includes TurboTax income tax preparation products and services. 

ProConnect: &#32;&#32;This segment targets professional accountants in the U.S. and Canada, who are essential to both small business success and doing the nations&#8217; taxes. Our ProConnect professional tax offerings include Lacerte, ProSeries, ProFile, and ProConnect Tax Online. 

Our Growth Strategy 

Our assessment of key technology and demographic trends &#8211; an increasingly borderless world, the prevalence of mobile devices, and the scalability of the cloud &#8211; reveals significant opportunities to drive future growth by continuing to solve the unmet needs of consumers, small businesses, and accounting professionals. Our evolving growth strategy includes three key elements: 

&#8226; 

Focus on the product &#8211; we call it &#8220;Delivering awesome product experiences.&#8221; &#32;As computers have moved to the palm of our hands in the form of tablets and smart phones, so have our products and services. Our TurboTax solutions, for example, let customers prepare and file their entire tax returns online via tablet, mobile phone, or computer. A key factor in growing our customer base is to deliver an amazing first-use experience so our customers can get the value they expect from our offerings as quickly and easily as possible. 

&#8226; 

Creating network effect platforms &#8211; we call it &#8220;Enabling the contributions of others.&#8221; &#32;We expect to solve our customers&#8217; problems faster and more efficiently by moving to more open platforms with application programming interfaces that integrate the contributions of end users and third-party developers. One example of this is our QuickBooks Online Ecosystem, where small businesses and accountants around the world can install apps created by third-party developers to create an experience that is personalized and configured for their specific needs. 

&#8226; 

Leveraging our data for our customers&#8217; benefit &#8211; we call it &#8220;Using data to create delight.&#8221; &#32;Our customers generate valuable data that we seek to use appropriately to deliver better products and breakthrough benefits by eliminating the need to enter data, helping them make better decisions, and improving transactions and interactions. 

This strategy recognizes the emergence and influence of the digital generation, the increasing relevance of social networks, and customers&#8217; growing reliance on the Internet, mobile devices, and information-based technology to manage important financial tasks. It also acknowledges the potential of new market opportunities around the world. The result is a global market that is shifting from traditional services that are paper-based, human-produced, and brick-and-mortar bound, to one where people understand, demand, and embrace the benefits of connected services. 

We continue to make significant progress in this environment. Connected services (total service and other revenue) generated $ 3.4 &#32;billion, or 73 &#32;percent, of our total revenue in fiscal 2016 , compared with about 50 percent of our total revenue eight years ago. 

Summary 

As the way we live and work evolves, we adapt our strategy to meet and lead these changes. Yet our commitment remains consistent: developing an ecosystem of innovative products and services that are so convenient and easy to use that customers actively recommend them to others. It&#8217;s been our success formula for more than 30 years as we&#8217;ve worked to solve people&#8217;s important business and financial management problems. And we&#8217;ll maintain that commitment as we continue to evolve, 

&#32;4

working to help people solve each other&#8217;s problems, connecting people to people and to solutions, wherever they are, whenever they want them, and on any device they choose.

Small Business 

Our Small Business segment includes online ecosystem and desktop ecosystem solutions that allow small businesses and the accounting professionals who serve and advise them to save time and grow their businesses. 

Small Business Online Ecosystem Solutions 

QuickBooks Online. &#32; Our QuickBooks Online offerings bring small business users and accounting professionals financial management tools that are designed to be easy to use and are accessible from personal computers and mobile devices.

QuickBooks Self-Employed includes easy categorization of business and personal transactions via account connection, identification and classification of tax deductible expenses, mileage tracking, calculation of estimated quarterly taxes, home office deduction tracking, healthcare deduction tracking, and when combined with TurboTax, export and payment of year-end taxes.

The platform allows developers to build applications that integrate with QuickBooks data and solve the unique needs of our customers. Developers can create applications using any development platform they choose, and must pass a standards and security check before offering their programs to customers. All applications are available at apps.com . Here QuickBooks users can find, buy, and use applications connected to the platform.

We also offer tax forms, tax return presentation folders and other supplies for professional tax preparers. 

Consumer Tax 

Our TurboTax products and services are designed to enable individuals to prepare and file their own federal and state personal income tax returns quickly and accurately. They are designed to be easy to use, yet sophisticated enough for complex tax returns. Most of these offerings are available on mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. 

Tax Return Preparation Offerings . For the 2015 &#32;tax season we offered a range of software products and services that included TurboTax Basic, for simple returns; TurboTax Deluxe, for taxpayers who itemize deductions; TurboTax Premier, for taxpayers who own investments or rental property; and TurboTax Home and Business, for small business owners. We also offered TurboTax Free Edition for the simplest returns. We offered live tax advice from U.S.-based tax professionals to TurboTax customers during the 2015 &#32;tax season. TurboTax Answer Exchange is an online forum where participants can learn from and share information with other users while preparing their income tax returns. For the 2015 tax season our online tax preparation and filing services were offered through the websites of thousands of financial institutions, electronic retailers, and other online merchants. Financial institutions can offer our online tax preparation and filing services to their customers through a link to TurboTax Online. Our TurboTax U.S. and Canada offerings consist of desktop, online, and mobile offerings.

We also offered audit defense, audit support, and identity restoration services. 

Intuit Tax Freedom Project . Under the Intuit Tax Freedom Project, we provide online federal and state income tax return preparation and electronic filing services at no charge to eligible taxpayers. For the 2015 &#32;tax season we provided approximately one million free federal returns under this initiative. We are a member of the Free File Alliance, a consortium of private sector companies that has entered into an agreement with the federal government to provide free online federal tax preparation and filing services to eligible taxpayers. See also &#8220;Competition &#8211; Consumer Tax Segment&#8221; &#32;later in this Item 1 for more information on the Free File Alliance.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 

Since the markets for software and related services are characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements, a continuous high level of investment is required to innovate and quickly develop new products and services as well as enhance existing offerings. Our product development efforts are becoming more important than ever as we pursue our connected services strategy, which reflects a world where people and businesses are increasingly connected by technology and expect access to services at any time and in any place. 

We develop many of our products and services internally. We have a number of United States and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. We supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring or licensing products and technology from third parties, and establishing other relationships that enable us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly. We expect to expand our third-party technology relationships as we continue to pursue our connected services strategy. 

Our traditional desktop software products &#8211; QuickBooks, TurboTax, Lacerte, and ProSeries &#8211; tend to have predictable annual development and product release cycles. We also develop innovative new offerings, including mobile applications, for which development cycles are often more rapid. Developing consumer and professional tax software and services presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate federal and state tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable. The development timing for our small business payroll and merchant payment processing services offerings varies with business needs and regulatory requirements and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each project. 

We continue to make substantial investments in research and development, and we expect to focus our future research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and services and on developing new products and services, including new mobile and global offerings. We also expect to continue to focus significant research and development efforts on ongoing projects to update the technology platforms for several of our offerings. Our research and development expenses were $881 &#32;million or 19% &#32;of total net revenue in fiscal 2016 ; $798 million or 19% &#32;of total net revenue in fiscal 2015 ; and $714 million or 17% &#32;of total net revenue in fiscal 2014 . 

SEASONALITY 

Our Consumer Tax offerings have significant seasonal patterns. As a result, during each of the last three fiscal years the total revenue for our third quarter ended April 30 has represented nearly half of our total revenue for those years. We expect the seasonality of our Consumer Tax business to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly financial results in the future. 

MARKETING, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS 

Markets 

Our primary target customers are small businesses, consumers, and accounting professionals. The markets in which we compete have always been characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements by competitors. Over the past several years, the widespread availability of the Internet, mobile devices, and the explosion of social media have accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that customers learn about, evaluate, and purchase products and services. 

Real-time, personalized online and mobile shopping experiences have become the standard. In addition, many customers now begin shopping in one channel and ultimately purchase in another. This has created a need for integrated, multi-channel, shop-and-buy experiences. Market and industry changes quickly make existing products and services obsolete. Our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new business models, updated competitive strategies, new or enhanced products and services, alternative distribution methods, and other changes in the way we do business. 

Marketing Programs 

We use a variety of traditional and innovative marketing programs to generate orders, stimulate demand, and generally maintain and increase customer awareness of our product portfolio. These programs include: Internet marketing and targeted advertising, such as search engine optimization and purchasing keywords from major search engine companies; placing and promoting our mobile applications in proprietary online stores; direct-response mail and e-mail campaigns; telephone solicitations; newspaper, magazine, billboard, radio, and television advertising; social media campaigns; and coordinated promotional offers with major retailers. We also use workflow-integrated, in-product discovery in some of our offerings to 

&#32;8 

Tables of Contents 

market other related products and services, including third-party products and services. In addition, we create marketing campaigns that are designed to attract new users through trial promotional offerings. 

Sales and Distribution Channels 

Multi-Channel Shop-and-Buy Experiences. &#32;Our customers increasingly use the Internet and mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, to research products and services. Some customers buy and use our products and services entirely online or through their mobile devices. Others purchase desktop products and services using the Internet. Still others make their final decision at a retail location. Although retail sales of our products and services are gradually declining as online distribution channels grow in importance, we continue to coordinate our websites, promotions, and retail displays to support an integrated, multi-channel, shop-and-buy model. 

Direct Sales Channel . We sell many of our products and services directly through our websites and call centers. Telesales continues to be an effective channel for serving customers that want live help to select the products and services that are right for their needs. We also have a direct sales force that calls on U.S. and international accountant firms and seeks to increase their awareness, usage, and recommendation of our Small Business solutions. 

Retail Channel . We sell our QuickBooks and TurboTax desktop software as well as payroll services and merchant credit card payment processing services at retail locations across the United States. We sell these products and services directly and through distributors to office supply superstores, warehouse clubs, consumer electronics retailers, general mass merchandisers, online retailers, and catalogs. In Canada and the United Kingdom we also rely on distributors and other third parties who sell products into the retail channel. The retail channel provides broad customer reach through retailer-sponsored advertising and exposure to retail foot traffic. This channel also gives us the opportunity to communicate our products, services, and messages through multiple touch points and allows us to serve our customers at relatively modest cost. 

Online Mobile Application Stores. &#32;&#32;We distribute many of our offerings for mobile devices through proprietary online stores that provide applications for specific devices. These include the Apple App Store, which provides apps for the Apple iPhone and iPad, and Google&#8217;s Play Store, which provides apps for Android-compatible smartphones and tablets. 

Other Channels. &#32;We have strategies to address the alliance partner and solution provider channels. We sell our consumer and small business products and services through selected alliance partners that help us reach new customers at the point of need and drive growth and market share by extending our online reach. Solution providers combine our products and services with value-added marketing, sales, and technical expertise to deliver a complete solution at the local level. As we expand our mobile and global offerings, we expect that strategic partnerships will become increasingly important to our business. 

COMPETITION 

Overview 

We face intense competition in all of our businesses, both domestically and internationally. Competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve have grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue. Some of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do. In addition, the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter markets in which we compete. This is particularly true for online and mobile products and services, where the barriers to entry are lower than they are for desktop software products and services. To attract customers, many online and mobile competitors are offering free or low-priced entry-level products which we must take into account in our pricing strategies. 

Our most obvious competition comes from other companies that offer technology solutions similar to ours. However, for many of our products and services, other important competitive alternatives for customers are third-party service providers such as professional accountants and seasonal assisted tax preparation businesses. Manual tools and processes, or general-purpose software, are also important competitive alternatives. 

Competition Specific to Segments 

Small Business Segment. &#32;QuickBooks is the leading small business financial management software in the U.S. Our small business desktop products and services face competitive challenges from companies such as The Sage Group plc, which offers software and associated services that directly target small business customers. Our small business online products and services face competition from online accounting offerings from companies such as Xero, free or low-cost online accounting offerings, and free online banking and bill payment services offered by financial institutions and others. In our payroll business we compete directly with Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP), Paychex, and many other companies with payroll offerings, including online payroll offerings. In our merchant services business we compete directly with large financial institutions such 

&#32;9 

Tables of Contents 

as Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, and Bank of America and with many payment processors, including First Data Corporation, Elavon, Global Payments, FIS, PayPal, and Square. 

Consumer Tax Segment . In our Consumer Tax segment, our future growth depends on our ability to attract new customers to the self-preparation tax category from tax stores and other tax preparers. In the U.S. private sector we face intense competition from H&#38;R Block, which provides tax preparation services in its stores and a competing software offering. We also face competition from several other large tax preparation service providers, from a myriad of small tax preparers, and from numerous online self-preparation offerings, including Blucora&#8217;s TaxAct. In Canada, our TurboTax Canada offerings face competition from H&#38;R Block, SimpleTax, StudioTax, and UFile. These competing offerings subject us to significant price pressure in both the U.S. and Canada. 

We also face competitive challenges from publicly funded government entities that offer electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to individual taxpayers. We are a member of the Free File Alliance, a consortium of private sector companies that has entered into an agreement with the federal government. Under this agreement, the member companies provide online federal tax preparation and filing services at no cost to eligible federal taxpayers, and the federal government has agreed not to provide a competing service. Approximately 22 states have also adopted Free File Alliance public-private agreements while approximately 20 other states offer some form of direct government tax preparation and filing services free to qualified taxpayers. We continue to actively work with others in the private and public sectors to advance the goals of the Free File Alliance policy initiative and to support successful public-private partnerships. However, future administrative, regulatory, or legislative activity in this area could harm our Consumer Tax business. 

ProConnect Segment. &#32;In the U.S., Lacerte professional tax offerings face competition from competitively-priced tax and accounting solutions that include integration with non-tax functionality. These include CCH&#8217;s ProSystems fx Office Suite and Thomson Reuters&#8217; CS Professional Suite and GoSystems Tax. Our ProSeries professional tax offerings face competition from CCH&#8217;s ATX and TaxWise offerings, Drake, and other smaller providers. In Canada, our ProFile professional tax offerings face competition from CCH&#8217;s Cantax and Taxprep offerings and from Thomson Reuters&#8217; DTMax and UFile Pro offerings. We also face growing competition from online tax and accounting offerings in the U.S. and Canada, which may be marketed more effectively or have lower pricing than our offerings for accounting professionals. 

Competitive Factors 

We believe the most important competitive factors for our core offerings &#8211; QuickBooks, TurboTax, Lacerte, and ProSeries &#8211; are ease of use, product features, size of the installed customer base, brand name recognition, value proposition, cost, reliability, and product and support quality. Access to distribution channels is also important for our QuickBooks and TurboTax software products. In addition, support from accounting professionals and the ability for customers to upgrade within product families as their businesses grow are significant competitive factors for our QuickBooks products. Productivity is an important competitive factor for the full-service accounting firms to which we market our Lacerte software products. We believe we compete effectively on these factors as our QuickBooks and TurboTax products are the leading products in the U.S. for their respective categories. 

For our service offerings such as small business payroll and merchant payment processing, we believe the most important competitive factors are functionality, ease of use, high availability, the integration of these products with related software, brand name recognition, effective distribution, quality of support, and cost. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT 

We provide customer service and technical support by telephone, e-mail, online chat, text messaging, online communities, and our customer service and technical support websites. We have full-time and outsourced customer service and technical support staffs. We supplement these staffs with seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes, such as during the tax return filing season or following a major product launch. We outsource to several firms domestically and internationally. Most of our internationally outsourced small business customer service and technical support personnel are currently located in India and the Philippines. 

We offer free self-help information through our technical support websites for our QuickBooks, TurboTax and ProConnect offerings. Customers can also use our websites to find answers to commonly asked questions and check on the status of orders. Under certain paid support plans, customers can also use our websites to receive product updates electronically. Support alternatives and fees vary by product. We sponsor online user communities such as Intuit Community for small businesses and accounting professionals, and TurboTax Answer Exchange, where consumers can share knowledge and product advice with each other. We also offer live tax advice from U.S.-based tax professionals to U.S. TurboTax users.

MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION 

Online Products and Services 

Intuit&#8217;s data centers house most of the systems, networks and databases required to operate and deliver our online products and services. These include QuickBooks Online, online payroll services, merchant payment processing services, TurboTax Online, ProConnect Tax Online, and consumer and professional electronic tax filing services. Through our data centers, we connect customers to our products and services and store customer and business information. As our businesses continue to move toward delivering more online and mobile products and services in conjunction with our connected services strategy, we expect that our infrastructure will become even more critical to our business in the future. 

Our primary data centers are a facility we own in Washington state and a co-located data center in Nevada. We also have a number of other data centers that are primarily located in the western United States and Canada. We continue to execute on a multi-year plan to transition to fewer data centers in more geographically diverse locations. In addition, we have an enterprise agreement with Amazon Web Services and over time will be hosting an increasing number of our applications and services in their secure online environment. 

Desktop Software and Supplies 

Although an increasing proportion of our desktop software customers choose to electronically download software, many customers continue to choose to purchase these products in the form of physical media. The key processes in manufacturing desktop software are manufacturing compact discs (CDs) and digital video discs (DVDs), printing boxes and related materials, and assembling and shipping the final products. 

For retail manufacturing, we have an agreement with Arvato Digital Services, Inc., a division of Bertelsmann AG, under which Arvato provides a majority of the manufacturing volume for our launches of QuickBooks and TurboTax, as well as for day-to-day replenishment after product launches. Arvato has operations in multiple locations that can provide redundancy if necessary. 

For retail distribution, we have an agreement with Arvato under which Arvato handles all logistics services. Our retail product launches are operationally complex. Our model for product delivery for retail launches and replenishment is a hybrid of direct to store deliveries and shipments to central warehouse locations. This allows improved inventory management by our retailers. We also ship products for many of our smaller retail customers through distributors. 

Arvato also provides most of the manufacturing volume and distribution services for our direct desktop software orders. We have an exclusive agreement with Harland Clarke, a division of M&#38;F Worldwide Corporation, to fulfill orders for all of our printed checks and most other products for our financial supplies business. 

We have multiple sources for all of our raw materials and availability has historically not been a significant problem for us. We continue to see consolidation among CD/DVD suppliers and reduced demand overall for this media type. As a result, we believe CD/DVD media may become more difficult and more costly to obtain in the near future. 

We typically ship products within a few days of receiving an order and backlog is minimal. 

PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF CUSTOMER AND EMPLOYEE INFORMATION AND TRANSACTIONS 

We are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations and to financial institution and healthcare provider requirements relating to the privacy and security of customer and employee personal information. We are also subject to laws and regulations that apply to the Internet, behavioral tracking and advertising, mobile applications and messaging, telemarketing, e-mail activities, data transfer, data hosting and retention, financial and health information, financial transactions, and credit reporting. Additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future, which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we can collect, use, host, store or transmit the personal information and data of our customers or employees, communicate with our customers, and deliver products and services to customers or employees, or may significantly increase our compliance costs. As our business expands to new industry segments and new uses of data that are regulated for privacy and security, or to countries outside the United States that have strict data protections laws, our compliance requirements and costs will increase. 

We are the stewards of our customers&#8217; data. Through a Master Privacy Policy Framework designed to be consistent with globally recognized privacy principles, we comply with United States federal and other country guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers and employees are aware of, and can control, how we use information about them. Our primary websites and online products, such as Intuit.com, QuickBooks and TurboTax, have been certified by TRUSTe, an independent organization that operates a website and online product privacy certification program representing industry standard practices to address users&#8217; and regulators&#8217; concerns about online privacy. We also use privacy statements to provide notice to customers 

&#32;11

of our privacy practices, as well as provide them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their personal information. We participate in industry groups whose purpose is to develop or shape industry best practices, and to influence public policy for privacy and security. 

To address security concerns, we use security safeguards to help protect the systems and the information customers and employees give to us from loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration. Whenever customers transmit sensitive information, such as credit card information or tax return data, through one of our websites or products, we use industry standards to encrypt the data as it is transmitted to us. We work to protect our systems from unauthorized internal or external access using numerous commercially available computer security products as well as internally developed security procedures and practices. 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

Our Consumer Tax and ProConnect segments are subject to federal and state government requirements, including regulations related to the electronic filing of tax returns, the provision of tax preparer assistance, and the use and disclosure of customer information. In addition, we offer certain other products and services to small businesses and consumers, such as payroll, payments, and financing, which are also subject to regulatory requirements. As we expand our products and services, both domestically and internationally, we may become subject to additional government regulation. Further, regulators may adopt new laws or regulations or their interpretation of existing laws or regulations may differ from ours or expand to cover additional products and services. These increased regulatory requirements could impose significant limitations on our business and increase our cost of compliance. 

We are subject to federal and state laws and government regulations concerning employee safety and health and environmental matters. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other federal and state agencies have the authority to put regulations in place that may have an impact on our operations. 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

Our success depends on the proprietary technology embodied in our offerings. We protect this proprietary technology by relying on a variety of intellectual property mechanisms, including copyright, patent, trade secret and trademark laws, restrictions on disclosure and other methods. For example, we regularly file applications for patents, copyrights and trademarks and service marks in order to protect intellectual property that we believe is important to our business. We hold a growing patent portfolio that we believe is important to Intuit&#8217;s overall competitive advantage, although we are not materially dependent on any one patent or particular group of patents in our portfolio at this time. We also have a number of registered trademarks that include Intuit, QuickBooks, TurboTax, Lacerte, ProSeries, and Mint. We have registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the United States and, depending on the relevance of each brand to other markets, in many foreign countries. Most registrations can be renewed perpetually at 10-year intervals. We also license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products. 

Although our portfolio of patents is growing, the patents that have been issued to us could be determined to be invalid and may not be enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction. In addition, third parties have asserted and may, in the future, assert infringement claims against us and our customers. These claims and any litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights or a finding of infringement along with an assessment of damages. Litigation, even if without merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. In addition, third-party licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of July 31, 2016 , we had approximately 7,900 &#32;full-time employees in major offices in the United States, Canada, India, the United Kingdom and other locations. We also employ a significant number of seasonal and contract employees during the second and third quarters of our fiscal years to support our consumer tax customers. For example, at the peak of the 2015 &#32;tax season we employed approximately 1,100 &#32;seasonal employees. We believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees in all areas of our business. We do not currently have any collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and we believe employee relations are generally good. Although we have employment-related agreements with a number of key employees, these agreements do not guarantee continued service. We believe we offer competitive compensation and a good working environment. We were named one of Fortune &#32;magazine&#8217;s &#8220;100 Best Companies to Work For&#8221; in each of the last fifteen years. However, we face intense competition for qualified employees, and we expect to face continuing challenges in recruiting and retention.
