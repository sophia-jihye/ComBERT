 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

CNB Financial Corporation (the &#147;Corporation&#148;) is a financial holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#147;BHC Act&#148;). It was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1983 for the purpose of engaging in the business of a financial holding company. On April 26, 1984, the Corporation acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of County National Bank, a national banking chartered institution. In December 2006, County National Bank changed its name to CNB Bank, referred to herein as the Bank, and became a state bank chartered in Pennsylvania and subject to regulation by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In October 2013, the Corporation acquired FC Banc Corp. and its subsidiary, The Farmers Citizens Bank. As previously announced, on December 29, 2015 the Corporation and the Bank entered into a definitive merger agreement with Lake National Bank, a privately held financial institution headquartered in Mentor, Ohio, pursuant to which the Corporation will acquire Lake National Bank for $22.50 per share in cash, or approximately $24.75 million in the aggregate. The completion of this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and the approval of Lake National Bank&#146;s shareholders. 

In addition to the Bank, the Corporation has three other subsidiaries. CNB Securities Corporation is incorporated in Delaware and currently maintains investments in debt and equity securities. CNB Insurance Agency, incorporated in Pennsylvania, provides for the sale of nonproprietary annuities and other insurance products. Holiday Financial Services Corporation, incorporated in Pennsylvania, offers small balance unsecured loans and secured loans, primarily collateralized by automobiles and equipment, to borrowers with higher risk characteristics. 

CNB Bank 

CNB Bank (the &#147;Bank&#148;) was incorporated in 1934 and is chartered in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. ERIEBANK, a division of CNB Bank, began operations in 2005. In October 2013, the Corporation acquired FC Banc Corp. and its subsidiary, Farmers Citizens Bank. Farmers Citizens Bank served the central Ohio markets of Bucyrus, Cardington, Fredericktown, Mount Hope and Shiloh, as well as the markets of Worthington and Upper Arlington in the greater Columbus, Ohio area, with 8 branch locations. The Corporation is continuing to operate these 8 branch locations as FCBank, a division of CNB Bank, with local decision making and oversight. An additional FCBank full service branch location was opened in 2014 in Dublin, Ohio. 

The Bank has 38 full service branch offices and two loan production offices located in various communities in its market area. CNB Bank&#146;s primary market area includes the Pennsylvania counties of Cambria, Cameron, Centre, Clearfield, Crawford, Elk, Indiana, Jefferson, and McKean. As ERIEBANK, a division of CNB Bank, the Bank operates in the Pennsylvania counties of Crawford, Erie, and Warren. As FCBank, a division of CNB Bank, the Bank operates in the Ohio counties of Crawford, Richland, Ashland, Wayne, Marion, Morrow, Knox, Holmes, Delaware, and Franklin. 

The Bank is a full service bank engaging in a full range of banking activities and services for individual, business, governmental and institutional customers. These activities and services principally include checking, savings, and time deposit accounts; real estate, commercial, industrial, residential and consumer loans; and a variety of other specialized financial services. The Bank&#146;s Wealth &#38; Asset Management Services division offers a full range of client services. 

&#160; 

Holiday Financial Services Corporation 

In 2005, the Corporation entered the consumer discount loan and finance business, which is conducted through a wholly owned subsidiary, Holiday Financial Services Corporation. Holiday currently has twelve offices within the Corporation&#146;s footprint. Management believes that it has made the necessary investments in experienced personnel and technology which has helped facilitate the growth of Holiday into a successful and profitable subsidiary. 

Competition 

The financial services industry in the Corporation&#146;s service area continues to be extremely competitive, both among commercial banks and with other financial service providers such as consumer finance companies, thrifts, investment firms, mutual funds and credit unions. The increased competition has resulted from changes in the legal and regulatory guidelines as well as from economic conditions. Mortgage banking firms, leasing companies, financial affiliates of industrial companies, brokerage firms, retirement fund management firms, and even government agencies provide additional competition for loans and other financial services. Some of the financial service providers operating in the Corporation&#146;s market area operate on a large-scale regional or national basis and possess resources greater than those of the Corporation. The Corporation is generally competitive with all competing financial institutions in its service area with respect to interest rates paid on time and savings deposits, service charges on deposit accounts and interest rates charged on loans. 

Supervision and Regulation 

The Corporation is a bank holding company and a financial holding company and the Bank is a Pennsylvania state-chartered bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve System. Accordingly, the Corporation is subject to the oversight of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking, and the Bank is subject to the oversight of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#147;FDIC&#148;). The Corporation and Bank are also subject to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law, such as requirements to maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types, amounts and terms and conditions of loans that may be granted, and limitations on the types of investments that may be made and the types of services that may be offered. Various consumer financial protection laws and regulations also affect the operation of the Bank and, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;), the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (&#147;CFPB&#148;) is authorized to write rules on consumer financial products which could affect the operations of the Bank. In addition to the impact of regulation, commercial banks are affected significantly by the actions of the Federal Reserve Board, including actions taken with respect to interest rates, as the Federal Reserve Board attempts to control the money supply and credit availability in the U.S. in order to influence the economy. 

The following summary sets forth certain of the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries and provides certain specific information about us and our subsidiaries. It does not describe all of the provisions of the statutes, regulations and policies that are identified. To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by express reference to each of the particular statutory and regulatory provisions. A change in applicable statutes, regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on our business. 

&#160; 

Bank Holding Company Regulation 

As a bank holding company that controls a Pennsylvania state-chartered bank, the Corporation is subject to regulation and examination by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and the Federal Reserve Board. We are required to file with the Federal Reserve Board an annual report and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require pursuant to the BHC Act, and applicable regulations. For instance, the BHC Act requires each bank holding company to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it may acquire substantially all the assets of any bank, or before it may acquire ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after such acquisition, it would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than five percent of any class of voting shares of such bank. Such a transaction may also require approval of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking. 

Pursuant to provisions of the BHC Act and regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board thereunder, the Corporation may only engage in, or own companies that engage in, activities deemed by the Federal Reserve Board to be permissible for bank holding companies or financial holding companies. Activities permissible for bank holding companies are those that are so closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Permissible activities for financial holding companies include those &#147;so closely related to banking&#148; as well as certain additional activities deemed &#147;financial in nature.&#148; The Corporation must obtain permission from or provide notice to the Federal Reserve Board prior to engaging in most new business activities. 

Under Federal Reserve Board regulations, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, it is the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s policy that in serving as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks, a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. A bank holding company&#146;s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve Board to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve Board regulations or both. This doctrine is commonly known as the &#147;source of strength&#148; doctrine. 

In May 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (together, the &#147;Commissions&#148;) jointly issued final rules and guidelines to require certain regulated entities to establish programs to address risks of identity theft. The rules and guidelines implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. These provisions amend Section 615(e) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and directed the Commissions to adopt rules requiring entities that are subject to the Commissions&#146; jurisdiction to address identity theft in two ways. First, the rules require financial institutions and creditors to develop and implement a written identity theft prevention program that is designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft in connection with certain existing accounts or the opening of new accounts. The rules include guidelines to assist entities in the formulation and maintenance of programs that would satisfy the requirements of the rules. Second, the rules establish special requirements for any credit and debit card issuers that are subject to the Commissions&#146; jurisdiction, to assess the validity of notifications of changes of address under certain circumstances. 

On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve Board issued final rules, and on July 9, 2013, the FDIC issued interim final rules that revise existing regulatory capital requirements to incorporate certain revisions to 

&#160; 

the Basel capital framework, including Basel III, and to implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rules seek to strengthen the components of regulatory capital, increase risk-based capital requirements, and make selected changes to the calculation of risk-weighted assets. 

The final rules, among other things: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; revise minimum capital requirements and adjust prompt corrective action thresholds; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; revise the components of regulatory capital, add a new minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets, increase the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement from 4% to 6%; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; retain the existing risk-based capital treatment for 1-4 family residential mortgage exposures; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; permit most banking organizations, including the Corporation, to retain, through a one-time permanent election, the existing capital treatment for accumulated other comprehensive income; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; implement a new capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, which will be in addition to the 4.5% common equity Tier 1 capital ratio and be phased in over a three year period beginning January 1, 2016 which buffer is generally required to make capital distributions and pay executive bonuses; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; require a minimum leverage ratio of 4%; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; require a total capital ratio of 8%; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; increase capital requirements for past-due loans, high volatility commercial real estate exposures, and certain short-term loan commitments; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; require the deduction of mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets that exceed 10% of common equity Tier 1 capital in each category and 15% of common equity Tier 1 capital in the aggregate; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; remove references to credit ratings consistent with Dodd-Frank and establish due diligence requirements for securitization exposures. 

Under the interim and final rules, compliance is required beginning January 1, 2015, for most banking organizations including the Corporation, subject to a transition period for several aspects of the final rules, including the new minimum capital ratio requirements, the capital conservation buffer, and the regulatory capital adjustments and deductions. The Corporation adopted Basel III on January 1, 2015 and continues to exceed all estimated well-capitalized regulatory requirements on a fully phased-in basis. 

Regulation of CNB Bank 

CNB Bank is a Pennsylvania-chartered bank and is subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and the FDIC. Federal and state banking laws and regulations govern, among other things, the scope of a bank&#146;s business, the investments a bank may make, the reserves against deposits a bank must maintain, the loans a bank makes and collateral it takes, the activities of a bank with respect to mergers and acquisitions, the establishment of branches, management practices, and numerous other aspects of banking operations. 

&#160; 

Legislation 

The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted into law on July 21, 2010, includes numerous provisions designed to strengthen the financial industry, enhance consumer financial protection, expand disclosures and provide for transparency, and significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and affected and will continue to affect the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act also created the CFPB, which is authorized to write rules on a number of consumer financial products, and the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which is empowered to determine which entities are systematically significant and require tougher regulations. 

It is difficult to predict at this time what specific impact certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the implementing rules and regulations, many which have yet to be written, will have on the Corporation, including regulations promulgated by the CFPB. The legislation and any implementing rules that are ultimately issued could have adverse implications on the financial industry, the competitive environment, and the Corporation&#146;s ability to conduct business. The Corporation is applying resources to ensure that it is in compliance with all applicable provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and any implementing rules, which may increase its costs of operations and adversely impact its earnings. 

Dividend Restrictions 

The Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. Declaration and payment of cash dividends depends upon cash dividend payments to the Corporation by the Bank, which is our primary source of revenue and cash flow. Accordingly, the right of the Corporation, and consequently the right of our creditors and shareholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is necessarily subject to the prior claims of creditors of the subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of the Corporation in its capacity as a creditor may be recognized. 

As a Pennsylvania state-chartered bank, the Bank is subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment and amounts of dividends under the Pennsylvania Banking Code. Further, the ability of banking subsidiaries to pay dividends is also subject to their profitability, financial condition, capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements. 

The payment of dividends by the Bank and the Corporation may also be affected by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory requirements. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution&#146;s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. A depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements that provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Federal banking regulators have the authority to prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying a dividend if the regulators deem such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice. 

Capital Adequacy and Operations 

Under applicable &#147;prompt corrective action&#148; (&#147;PCA&#148;) statutes and regulations, depository institutions are placed into one of five capital categories, ranging from &#147;well capitalized&#148; to &#147;critically undercapitalized.&#148; The FDIC, in the case of the Bank, is required to take certain, and is authorized to 

&#160; 

take other, supervisory action against a depository institution that falls below certain of these levels. The PCA statute and regulations provide for progressively more stringent supervisory measures as a depository institution&#146;s capital category declines. An institution that is not well capitalized is generally prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market. An undercapitalized depository institution must submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency. One requisite element of such a plan is that the institution&#146;s parent holding company must guarantee compliance by the institution with the plan, subject to certain limitations. 

At December 31, 2015, the Bank qualified as &#147;well capitalized&#148; under applicable regulatory capital standards. 

Community Reinvestment Act 

Under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (&#147;CRA&#148;), the FDIC is required to assess the record of all financial institutions regulated by it to determine if these institutions are meeting the credit needs of the community (including low and moderate income neighborhoods) which they serve. CRA performance evaluations are based on a four-tiered rating system: Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve and Substantial Noncompliance. CRA performance evaluations are considered in evaluating applications for such things as mergers, acquisitions and applications to open branches. The Bank received a CRA rating of &#147;Satisfactory&#148; at its most current CRA exam. 

Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders 

The Bank and Corporation also are subject to the restrictions of Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, and their implementing Regulation W, issued by the Federal Reserve Board. Section 23A requires that loans or extensions of credit by the Bank to an affiliate, purchases of securities by the Bank issued by an affiliate, purchases of assets by the Bank from an affiliate (except as may be exempted by order or regulation), the acceptance by the Bank of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral and the issuance by the Bank of a guarantee, acceptance by the Bank of letters of credit on behalf of an affiliate (collectively, &#147;Covered Transactions&#148;) be on terms and conditions consistent with safe and sound banking practices. Section 23A also imposes quantitative restrictions on the amount of and collateralization requirements on such transactions. Section 23B requires that all Covered Transactions and certain other transactions, including the sale of securities or other assets by the Bank to an affiliate and the payment of money or the furnishing of services by the Bank to an affiliate, be on terms comparable to those prevailing for similar transactions with non-affiliates. 

The Bank is also subject to Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, and their implementing Regulation O issued by the Federal Reserve Board. These provisions impose limitations on loans and extensions of credit by the Bank to its executive officers, directors and principal shareholders and their related interests as well as to the Corporation and any subsidiary of the Corporation. The limitations restrict the terms and aggregate amount of such transactions. Regulation O also imposes certain recordkeeping and reporting requirements. 

Deposit Insurance and Premiums 

The deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits per insured depositor by the FDIC. The Dodd-Frank Act has permanently increased the standard maximum deposit insurance amount to $250,000 per depositor per insured depository institution, retroactive to January 1, 2008. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act also broadens the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments will now be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. 

Other Federal Laws and Regulations 

State usury and other credit laws limit the amount of interest and various other charges collected or contracted by a bank on loans. The Bank is also subject to lending limits on loans to one borrower and regulatory guidance on concentrations of credit. The Bank&#146;s loans and other products and services are also subject to numerous federal and state consumer financial protection laws, including, but not limited to, the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Truth-In-Lending Act, which governs disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Truth-in-Savings Act, which governs disclosures of the terms of deposit accounts to consumers; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to regulators to enable determinations as to whether financial institutions are fulfilling their obligations to meet the home lending needs of the communities they serve and not discriminating in their lending practices; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, sex or other prohibited factors in extending credit; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, which imposes requirements relating to real estate settlements, including requiring lenders to disclose certain information regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlement services; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Fair Credit Reporting Act, covering numerous areas relating to certain types of consumer information and identity theft; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related regulations, which require that financial institutions provide privacy policies to consumers, to allow customers to &#147;opt out&#148; of certain sharing of their nonpublic personal information, and to safeguard sensitive and confidential customer information. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Electronic Fund Transfer Act, which is a consumer protection law regarding electronic fund transfers; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The Bank Secrecy Act and USA Patriot Act, which require financial institutions to take certain actions to help prevent, detect and prosecute money laundering and the financing of terrorism; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Numerous other federal and state laws and regulations, including those related to consumer protection and bank operations. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was enacted on July 30, 2002 and represented a comprehensive revision of laws affecting corporate governance, accounting obligations and corporate reporting. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act is applicable to all companies with equity securities registered or that file reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including publicly-held financial holding companies such as the Corporation. In particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act establishes: (i) requirements for audit committees, including independence, expertise, and responsibilities; (ii) additional 

&#160; 

responsibilities regarding financial statements for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the reporting company; (iii) standards for auditors and regulation of audits; (iv) increased disclosure and reporting obligations for the reporting company and its directors and executive officers; and (v) new and increased civil and criminal penalties for violations of the securities laws. 

Governmental Policies 

Our earnings are significantly affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives are open-market operations in U.S. Government securities and federal funds, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These instruments of monetary policy are used in varying combinations to influence the overall level of bank loans, investments and deposits, and the interest rates charged on loans and paid for deposits. The Federal Reserve Board frequently uses these instruments of monetary policy, especially its open-market operations and the discount rate, to influence the level of interest rates and to affect the strength of the economy, the level of inflation or the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of banking institutions in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. It is not possible to predict the nature of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies, or the effect which they may have on our business and earnings. 

Other Legislative Initiatives 

Proposals may be introduced in the United States Congress, in the Pennsylvania Legislature, and/or by various bank regulatory authorities that could alter the powers of, and restrictions on, different types of banking organizations and which could restructure part or all of the existing regulatory framework for banks, bank and financial holding companies and other providers of financial services. Moreover, other bills may be introduced in Congress which would further regulate, deregulate or restructure the financial services industry, including proposals to substantially reform the regulatory framework. It is not possible to predict whether any such proposals will be enacted into law or, even if enacted, the effect which they may have on our business and earnings. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, the Corporation had a total of 454 employees of which 402 were full time and 52 were part time.
