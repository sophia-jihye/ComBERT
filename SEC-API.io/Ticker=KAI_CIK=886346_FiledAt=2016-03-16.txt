The terms "we," "us," "our," "Registrant," or "Company" in this Report refer to Kadant Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 

Description of Our Business 

We are a leading global supplier of equipment used in process industries, including papermaking, paper recycling, and oriented strand board (OSB), an engineered wood panel product used primarily in home construction. In addition, we manufacture granules made from papermaking byproducts. We have a large customer base that includes most of the world's major paper and OSB manufacturers. We believe our large installed base provides us with a spare parts and consumables business that yields higher margins than our capital equipment business. 

Our continuing operations are comprised of two reportable operating segments, Papermaking Systems and Wood Processing Systems, and a separate product line, Fiber-based Products. Through our Papermaking Systems segment, we develop, manufacture, and market a range of equipment and products for the global papermaking, paper recycling, and other process industries. Through our Wood Processing Systems segment, we design, manufacture, and market stranders and related equipment used in the production of OSB and sell debarking and wood chipping equipment used in the forest products and the pulp and paper industries. Through our Fiber-based Products business, we manufacture and sell granules derived from pulp fiber for use as carriers for agricultural, home lawn and garden, and professional lawn, turf and ornamental applications, as well as for oil and grease absorption. 

Papermaking Systems Segment 

Our Papermaking Systems segment has a long and well-established history of developing, manufacturing, and marketing equipment for the global papermaking and paper recycling industries. Some of our businesses or their predecessor companies have been in operation for more than 100 years. Our customer base includes major global paper manufacturers and we believe we have one of the largest installed bases of equipment in the markets we serve within the pulp and paper industry. We manufacture our products in nine countries in Europe, North and South America, and Asia. 

Our Papermaking Systems segment consists of the following product lines: Stock-Preparation; Doctoring, Cleaning, &#38; Filtration; and Fluid-Handling. 

Stock-Preparation 

We develop, manufacture, and market complete custom-engineered systems and equipment, as well as standard individual components, for pulping, de-inking, screening, cleaning, and refining primarily recycled fiber for preparation for entry into the paper machine, and recausticizing and evaporation equipment and systems used in the production of virgin pulp.

Fluid-Handling 

We develop, manufacture and market rotary joints, precision unions, steam and condensate systems, components, and controls used primarily in the dryer section of the papermaking process and during the production of corrugated boxboard, metals, plastics, rubber, textiles, chemicals, and food. Our principal fluid-handling systems include: 

&#160; 

&#8211; 

Rotary joints: Our mechanical devices, used with rotating shafts, allow the transfer of pressurized fluid from a stationary source into and out of rotating machinery for heating, cooling, or the transfer of fluid power. 

&#160; 

&#8211; 

Syphons: Our devices, installed primarily inside the rotating cylinders of paper machines, are used to remove condensate from the drying cylinders through rotary joints located on either end of the cylinder. 

&#160; 

&#8211; 

Turbulator&#174; bars: Our steel or stainless steel axial bars, installed on the inside of cylinders, are used to induce turbulence in the condensate layer to improve the uniformity and rate of heat transfer through the cylinders. 

&#160; 

&#8211; 

Engineered steam and condensate systems: Our steam systems control the flow of steam from the boiler to the paper drying cylinders, collect condensed steam, and return it to the boiler to improve energy efficiency during the paper drying process. Our systems and equipment are also used to efficiently and effectively distribute steam in a wide variety of industrial processing applications.

Fiscal Year 

Typically, our fiscal quarters and fiscal year consist of 13 and 52 weeks, respectively, ending on the Saturday closest to the end of the corresponding calendar quarter for our fiscal quarters and on the Saturday closest to December 31 for our fourth fiscal quarter and fiscal year. As a result of the difference between the fiscal and calendar periods, a 53rd week is added to our fiscal year every five or six years. In a 53-week fiscal year, our fourth fiscal quarter contains 14 weeks. Our fiscal year ended January 2, 2016 (fiscal 2015) contained 52 weeks, our fiscal year ended January 3, 2015 (fiscal 2014) contained 53 weeks, and our fiscal year ended December 28, 2013 (fiscal 2013) contained 52 weeks. Each quarter of fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013 contained 13 weeks, except the fourth quarter of 2014, which contained 14 weeks. 

Research and Development 

We develop a broad range of products for all facets of the markets we serve. We operate research and development facilities in Europe, Canada, and the U.S., and focus our product innovations on process industry challenges and the need for improved fiber processing, heat transfer, showering, filtration, doctoring, fluid handling, and engineered wood processing. In addition to internal product development activities, our research centers allow customers to simulate their own operating conditions and applications to identify and quantify opportunities for improvement. 

Our research and development expenses were $6.7 million, $6.2 million, and $6.7 million in 2015 *, 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. 

Raw Materials 

The primary raw materials used in our Papermaking Systems segment are steel, stainless steel, ductile iron, brass, and bronze, which have generally been available through a number of suppliers. To date, we have not needed to maintain raw material inventories in excess of our current needs to ensure availability. 

The primary raw materials used in our Wood Processing Systems segment are steel and stainless steel, which have generally been available through a number of suppliers. 

The raw material used in the manufacture of our fiber-based granules is a by-product from the production of paper that we obtain from two paper mills. If the mills were unable or unwilling to supply us sufficient fiber, we would be forced to find one or more alternative suppliers for this raw material. 

Patents, Licenses, and Trademarks 

We protect our intellectual property rights by applying for and obtaining patents when appropriate. We also rely on technical know-how, trade secrets, and trademarks to maintain our competitive position. We also enter into license agreements with others to grant and/or receive rights to patents and know-how. No particular patent, or related group of patents, is so important that its expiration or loss would significantly affect our operations.

Dependency on a Single Customer 

No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues in any of the past three years. In addition, revenues in our Papermaking Systems and Wood Processing Systems segments were not dependent on any one customer. During 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , approximately 50%, 57%, and 63%, respectively, of our sales were to customers outside the United States, principally in Europe and Asia. 

Backlog 

Our backlog of firm orders for the Papermaking Systems segment was $94.9 million and $115.0 million at year-end 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. The total consolidated backlog of firm orders was $102.6 million and $124.2 million at year-end 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. In 2015, we reduced our backlog for an order totaling $16.1 million due to uncertainty regarding financing for a project in China, originally recorded in 2014. We anticipate that substantially all of the backlog at year-end 2015 &#32;will be shipped or completed during 2016. Some of these orders can be canceled by the customer upon payment of a cancellation fee.
