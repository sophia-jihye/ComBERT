General

iSign Solutions Inc. f/k/a Communication Intelligence Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in October 1986. iSign is a leading supplier of digital transaction management (DTM) software enabling the paperless, secure and cost-effective management and authentication of document-based transactions. iSign's solutions encompass a wide array of functionality and services, including electronic signatures, simple-to-complex workflow management and various options for biometric authentication. These solutions are available across virtually all enterprise, desktop and mobile environments as a seamlessly integrated platform for both ad-hoc and fully automated transactions. iSign's platform can be deployed both on premise and as a cloud-based ("SaaS") service, with the ability to easily transition between deployment models. The Company is headquartered in Redwood Shores, California.

On November 30, 2015, the Company filed an Issuer Company-Related Action Notification Form with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, ("FINRA"), requesting that the name change to iSign Solutions, Inc. and a change to the trading symbol of its common stock from "CICI" to "ISGN" be approved. On December 11, 2015, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State to change its name from Communication Intelligence Corporation to iSign Solutions Inc. Pursuant to FINRA rules, the change in the Company's name and trading symbol became effective at the open of business on December 14, 2015.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, total revenue was $1,620, an increase of $105, or 7%, compared to total revenue of $1,515 in the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2015, software product revenue was $738, a decrease of $28, or 4%, compared to product revenue of $766 in the prior year. Maintenance revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, was $882, an increase of $133, or 18%, compared to maintenance revenue of $749 in the prior year. The decrease in software product revenue is primarily attributable to the timing of sale of products during the year. The increase in maintenance revenue is due to the sale of new enterprise licenses during 2015 and 2014.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, the net loss attributable to common stockholders was $7,619, an increase of $240, or 3%, compared to $7,379 in the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2015, non-cash charges attributable to interest expense, financing and loan discount amortization and the accretion of the beneficial conversion feature were $628, a decrease of $283, or 31%, compared to $911 in the prior year. There was a gain of $18 on the derivative liability value for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to a gain of $7 in the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2015, operating expenses were $5,445, an increase of $117, or 2%, compared to operating expenses of $5,328 for the prior year. The increase in operating expense resulted from costs associated with a proposed public offering of common stock.

Core Technologies

The Company's core technologies can be referred to as "transaction-enabling" and "business process work flow" technologies. These technologies include various forms of electronic signature methods, such as handwritten, biometric, click-to-sign and others, as well as technologies related to signature verification, authentication, cryptography and the logging of audit trails to prove signers' intent. These technologies enable the appending of secure, legal and regulatory compliant electronic signatures coupled with an enhanced user experience, all at a fraction of the time and cost required by traditional, paper-based processes for signature capture.

Products

The Company's enterprise-class SignatureOne &#174; and iSign &#174; suite of electronic signature solutions enable businesses to implement truly paperless, electronic signature-driven business processes. The aggregate of the software functionality enabling the digitization of end-to-end work flow processes is sometimes referred to as "digital transaction management" (DTM). Many applications provide electronic forms and allow users to fill-in information, but most of these applications still require users to print out a paper copy for a handwritten, ink signature. Solutions powered by iSign products allow legally binding electronic signatures to be added to digital documents, eliminating the need for paper to memorialize the completion, approval or authentication of the transaction. This allows users to reduce transaction times and processing costs.

The SignatureOne &#174; and iSign &#174; suite of products includes the following:

SignatureOne &#174; Ceremony &#174; Server

The SignatureOne &#174; Ceremony &#174; Server ("Ceremony Server") provides a highly secure, scalable, patent-protected and streamlined electronic signature solution. Its flexible, easy-to-configure and agile workflow can be rapidly integrated via standard Web services to become an ultimate and cost efficient endpoint in true straight-through processing (the complete removal of paper from business processes) and to facilitate end-to-end management of multi-party approvals for PDF and XHTML documents. The Ceremony Server contains iSign's core e-signature engine and signature ceremony management tools, and can be seamlessly integrated with numerous ancillary products. Its key features include:

&#160;

&#8226; &#160; Consent/disclosure management &#8211; integral part of audit record; easily reproducible in the event of a dispute; 

&#8226; &#160; Configurable document presentment &#8211; signatory receipt, access and viewing of document tracked in audit trail; 

&#8226; &#160; Multi-party ceremonies &#8211; complex processes, simplified; allows for dynamic, multi-channel workflow changes, including remote, face-to-face and mobile scenarios; 

&#8226; &#160; Supports complex business rules and dynamic user behaviors; 

&#8226; &#160; Configurable branding and workflow; 

&#8226; &#160; Flexible tracking and reporting &#8211; includes event notification service

&#8226; &#160; Support for multiple signature methods &#8211; click-to-sign; biometric; and others. 

&#160;

iSign &#174; Console&#8482;

The iSign &#174; Console&#8482; ("Console") leverages the Ceremony Server's core signature engine and is ideal for organizations looking for a standalone electronic signature solution. Through its intuitive graphical interface, the Console allows users to upload documents for signature, select signers and signature methods, and manage and enforce document workflow for routing, reviewing, signing and notifications. The Console offers a secure and intuitive solution that requires no integration and is available on-premise or in the cloud.

&#160;

iSign&#174; Enterprise

iSign&#174; Enterprise incorporates the features and function of the Ceremony Server and the Console.

&#160;

iSign &#174; Family

The growing suite of iSign &#174; products and service includes iSign &#174; Mobile (for signing on iOS and Android mobile devices), iSign &#174; Forms (for integrated use of templates and forms), and iSign &#174; Live (iSign's patent-pending co-browsing solution for simultaneous browsing signature ceremonies).

Sign-it &#174; 

Sign-it &#174; is a family of desktop software products that enable the real-time capture of electronic and digital signatures, as well as their verification and binding within a standard set of applications, including Adobe Acrobat and Microsoft Word, web-based applications using HTML, XML and XHTML, and custom applications for .NET, C# and similar development environments for the enterprise market. The Sign-it &#174; family of products combines the strengths of biometrics, and other forms of electronic signatures, with cryptography in a patented process that insures the creation of documents containing legally compliant electronic signatures. These signatures have the same legal standing as a traditional so-called wet signature on paper and are created pursuant to the Electronic Signature in National and Global Commerce Act, as well as other related legislation and regulations. With Sign-it &#174; products, organizations wishing to process electronic forms, requiring varying levels of security, can reduce the cost and other inefficiencies inherent with paper documents by adding electronic signature technologies to their workflow solutions.

&#160;

iSign &#174; Toolkits

The iSign &#174; suite of application development tools for electronic signature capture, encryption and verification in custom applications and web-based processes captures and analyzes the image, speed, stroke sequence and acceleration of a person's handwritten electronic signature. This capability offers an effective and inexpensive solution for immediate authentication of handwritten signatures. iSign &#174; toolkits also store certain forensic elements of an electronic signature for use in determining whether a person's electronic signature is legally valid. They also include software libraries for industry standard encryption and hashing to protect a user's signature, as well as the data captured in the Ceremony &#174; process.

Research and Development

Our research and development effort is focused on the development, advancement and refinement of our core products and the development of new products. In addition, our research and development team is responsible for the continuous quality measurement and assurance of both existing and new products. We conduct research on software technology, related computer hardware, competitive offerings and alternative solution approaches to develop appropriate product and service offerings for our target markets. Our research and development efforts are often aimed at assisting clients and licensees in further streamlining new and existing workflow processes that our software solutions support and at ensuring that we meet or exceed industry standards and competitive offerings. We provide certain customization and integration services to our clients, including software integration partners and enterprise customers. These efforts are conducted by our team in Redwood Shores, California, supported by contracted staff, including offshore engineers.

We believe that our software technologies, platforms and products are now competitive and, while research and development activities will remain at the core of our operations, we intend, going forward, to invest an increasing amount of our resources in sales and marketing activities.

Our research and development expense was $1,771,000 for the year ended December 30, 2015 and $1,931,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Material Customers

Historically, the Company's revenue has been derived from hundreds of customers, but a significant percentage of the revenue has been attributable to a limited number of customers. Three customers, as described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial statements, accounted for 10%, 13% and 24%, respectively, of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015.

&#160;

Seasonality of Business

The Company believes that the sale of its products is not subject to seasonal fluctuations.

&#160;

Backlog

Backlog was approximately $839 and $957 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, representing advanced payments on product and service maintenance agreements. In 2014, the Company negotiated a long term maintenance agreement, the balance of which is $455 at December 31, 2015, which will be recognized over four years. The remaining backlog is expected to be recognized over the next twelve months.

Competition

We believe that our primary competitive advantages include the following:

&#183;

Customer options and platform flexibility : Unlike most of our competitors, we offer many flexible configuration options for enterprise clients to address many variants of complex business work flows without the need for costly and time-consuming customization. These solution configurations can be rapidly and seamlessly integrated into a variety of enterprise technology environments.

&#183;

Software deployment options : Unlike most of our competitors, our software solutions are available as an on demand, private cloud-based software as a service, and on the customer's premises, which is an important feature for most of our large enterprise clients for compliance, security and control reasons.

&#183;

Lower cost structure : Through our technology, sales and marketing partners, including Cegedim SA, we believe we offer a lower relative cost structure and higher operating margin than most of our larger competitors.

Currently, our primary competition for basic click-to-sign electronic signatures includes Adobe EchoSign, DocuSign and Silanis (recently acquired by VASCO Data Security International Inc.). We view the balance of the U.S. market as fragmented with a variety of smaller competitors focused on the consumer and small business markets rather than enterprise organizations.

Employees

As of December 31, 2015, the Company employed fifteen full-time employees and seven independent contractors. The Company has established longstanding strategic relationships that allow it to rapidly access product development and deployment capabilities that could be required to address most customer requirements. None of the Company's employees are party to any collective bargaining agreements. We believe our employee relations are good.

Geographic Areas

For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, sales in the United States as a percentage of total sales were 93% and 99%, respectively. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, long-lived assets located in the United States were $664 and $973, respectively. There were no long-lived assets located elsewhere as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.
