Our Water Resource and Water Storage Operations 

Vidler is engaged in the water resource development business and is primarily focused on developing and selling our existing water rights that we own in the southwestern United States. In this operation, we develop new sources of water for municipal and industrial use, either from existing supplies of water, such as water used for agricultural purposes, acquiring unappropriated (previously unused) water, or discovering new water sources based on science and targeted exploration. We are not a water utility, and do not currently intend to enter into regulated utility activities. 

A water right is the legal right to divert water and put it to beneficial use. Water rights are real property rights which can be bought and sold and are commonly measured in acre-feet which is a measure of the volume of water required to cover an area of one acre to a depth of one foot and is equal to 325,850 gallons. The value of a water right depends on a number of factors, which may include location, the seniority of the right, whether or not the right is transferable, or if the water can be moved from one location to another. We believe we have purchased water rights at prices consistent with their then current use, which was typically agricultural in nature, with the expectation that the value would increase as we converted the water rights through the development process to a higher use, such as municipal and industrial use. We acquired and developed water resources with the expectation that such water resources would be the most competitive source of water (the most economical source of water supply) to support new growth in municipalities or new commercial and industrial projects. 

Certain areas of the Southwest confronting long-term growth have insufficient known supplies of water to support their future economic and population growth. The inefficient allocation of available water between agricultural users and municipal or industrial users, the lack of available known water supplies in a particular location, or inadequate infrastructure to fully utilize or store existing and new water supplies provide opportunities for us to apply our water resource development expertise. 

The development of our water assets required significant capital and expertise. A complete project, from acquisition, through development, permitting and sale, is a long-term endeavor. Typically, in the regions in which we operate, new housing, commercial and industrial developments require an assured water supply (for example, in Arizona, access to water supplies for at least 100 years is required) before a permit for the development will be issued. 

We have acquired or developed water rights and water related assets in Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, and New Mexico. We also developed and operated our own water storage facility near Phoenix, Arizona, utilize water storage capacity operated by third parties in Arizona, and &#8220;bank,&#8221; or store, water with municipalities in Nevada and New Mexico. 

We have also entered into &#8220;teaming&#8221; and joint resource development arrangements with third parties who have water assets but lack the capital or expertise to commercially develop these assets. The first of these arrangements was a water delivery teaming agreement in southern Nevada with the Lincoln County Water District (&#8220;Lincoln/Vidler&#8221;), which is developing water resources in Lincoln County, Nevada. In northern Nevada, we have also entered into a joint development agreement with Carson City and Lyon County, Nevada to develop and provide water resources in Lyon County as well as a water banking agreement with Washoe County in Reno, Nevada. 

&#32;4 

We generate revenues by: 

&#8226; 

selling our developed water rights to project developers including real estate developers, power generating facilities or other commercial and industrial users who must secure rights to an assured supply of water in order to receive permits for their development projects; 

&#8226; 

selling our developed water rights to water utilities, municipalities and other government agencies for their specific needs, including to support population growth; 

&#8226; 

selling our stored water to commercial developers or municipalities that have either exhausted their existing water supplies, or, in instances where our water represents the most economical source of water, for their commercial projects or communities; and 

&#8226; 

leasing our water, farmland or ranch land while further developing the water resource. 

We owned the following significant water resource and water storage assets at December 31, 2015 : 

Fish Springs Ranch 

We own a 51% membership interest in, and are the managing partner of, Fish Springs Ranch, LLC (&#8220;FSR&#8221;), which owns the Fish Springs Ranch and other properties totaling approximately 7,360 acres in Honey Lake Valley in Washoe County, approximately 40 miles north of Reno, Nevada. FSR also owns 12,984 acre-feet of permitted water rights related to the properties of which 7,984 acre-feet are designated as water credits, transferable to other areas within Washoe County (such as Reno and Sparks) to support community development. Currently, there is no regulatory approval to export the additional 5,000 acre-feet per year of water from FSR to support development in northern Reno, and it is uncertain whether such regulatory approval will be granted in the future. To date, we have funded all of the operational expenses, development, and construction costs incurred in this partnership. We are entitled to recover the amount we have funded and in addition, we are entitled to receive an annual financing cost of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) plus 450 basis points from funding of the pipeline related expenditures, as we generate revenue from the sale of FSR water credits. 

During 2006, we began construction of a pipeline and an electrical substation to provide the power required to pump the water to the north valleys region of Reno. In July 2008, we completed construction of and dedicated our pipeline and associated infrastructure to Washoe County, Nevada under the terms of an Infrastructure Dedication Agreement (&#8220;IDA&#8221;) between Washoe County and FSR. Under the provisions of the IDA, Washoe County is responsible for the operation and maintenance of the pipeline and we own the exclusive right to the capacity of the pipeline to allow for the sale of water for future economic development in the north valley area of Reno. Our 7,984 acre-feet of water that has regulatory approval to be imported to the north valleys of Reno is available for sale under a Water Banking Agreement entered into between FSR and Washoe County. Under the Water Banking Agreement, Washoe County holds our water rights in trust. We can sell our water credits to developers, who must then dedicate the water to the local water utility for service. In December 2014, Washoe County Water Utilities merged with the Truckee Meadows Water Authority (&#8220;TMWA&#8221;), consolidating water supply service in Washoe County. Also effective at the end of 2014, FSR, Washoe County, and TMWA consented to the Assignment of the Water Banking Agreement and the IDA to the Truckee Meadows Water Authority. 

During 2011, a recession and other poor economic conditions in the area, including a high rate of unemployment in Washoe County, caused the rate of population growth to slow considerably. In addition, the then issued population growth estimates from the Nevada State Demographer were significantly lower than previous population projections. These factors caused a decline in the estimated fair value of our water credits and pipeline rights to approximately $84.9 million compared to its then carrying value of $101.1 million. Consequently during 2011, we recorded a $16.2 million impairment loss to reflect the decrease in the estimated fair value of the asset. For similar reasons, during 2013, we recorded another impairment loss on this asset of $993,000. 

Carson/Lyon 

The capital of Nevada, Carson City, and Lyon County are located in the western part of the state, close to Lake Tahoe and the border with California. While Carson City&#8217;s housing growth has been and is expected to be minimal due to land constraints, there is planned growth for the Dayton corridor, directly east of Carson City. There are currently few existing water sources to support future growth and development in the Dayton corridor area and Vidler has been working with Carson City and Lyon County for several years on ways to deliver water to support this expected growth. 

&#32;5 

In 2007, we entered into development and improvement agreements with both Carson City and Lyon County to provide water resources for planned future growth in Lyon County and to connect, or &#8220;intertie,&#8221; the municipal water systems of Carson City and Lyon County. The agreements allow for Carson River water rights owned or controlled by us to be conveyed for use in Lyon County. The agreements also allow us to bank water with Lyon County and authorize us to build the infrastructure to upgrade and inter-connect the Carson City and Lyon County water systems. 

We own water rights consisting of both Carson River agriculture designated water rights and certain municipal and industrial designated water rights. On completion of our re-designation development process of the agriculture designated water rights to municipal and industrial use, we anticipate that we will have up to 4,000 acre-feet available for municipal use in Lyon County for future development, as and when demand occurs, principally by means of delivery through the new infrastructure we constructed. 

Due to recession and prevailing economic conditions during 2010, including a high rate of unemployment in Lyon County, the rate of growth of development in the Dayton corridor had slowed considerably which caused a decline in the estimated fair value of our asset. Consequently, we recorded an impairment loss on this asset of $10.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. 

Vidler Arizona Recharge Facility 

We built and received the necessary permits to operate a full-scale water &#8220;recharge&#8221; facility that allows us to bank water underground in the Harquahala Valley, Arizona. &#8220;Recharge&#8221; is the process of placing water into storage underground. We have the permitted right, through September 2020, to recharge 100,000 acre-feet of water per year at the Vidler Arizona Recharge Facility, and we are permitted to store as much as one million acre-feet of water in the aquifer underlying much of the valley. When needed, the water will be &#8220;recovered,&#8221; or removed from storage, by ground water wells. This stored water creates a long term storage credit (&#8220;LTSC&#8221;). 

We hold our Colorado River water at this facility, which is a primary source of water for the Lower Basin States of Arizona, California, and Nevada. The water storage facility is strategically located adjacent to the Central Arizona Project (&#8220;CAP&#8221;) aqueduct, a conveyance canal running from Lake Havasu to Phoenix and Tucson. The recharged water was from surplus flows of CAP water which Arizona wanted recharged in Arizona, as opposed to that water flowing downstream. Proximity to the CAP provides a competitive advantage as it minimizes the cost of water conveyance. 

We are able to provide storage for users located both within Arizona and out of state (with approvals from the state of Arizona). Potential users include industrial companies, power-generating companies, developers, and local governmental political subdivisions in Arizona, and out-of-state users such as municipalities and water agencies in Nevada and California. The Arizona Water Banking Authority (&#8220;AWBA&#8221;) has the responsibility for intrastate and interstate storage of water for governmental entities. To date, we have not stored water at the facility for any third party. 

While Arizona is the only southwestern state with surplus flows of Colorado River water available for storage, in recent years there has been little to no surplus flows available to us as drought conditions have reduced the flow of the Colorado River and other water users have fully utilized their water allocations. In the future, we do not anticipate purchasing and storing surplus flows of Colorado River water. At the end of 2015 , we had LTSCs of approximately 251,000 acre-feet of water in storage at the facility. To date, we have not generated any revenue from selling our stored water at this facility. 

Phoenix AMA Water Storage 

As of December 31, 2015 , we owned approximately 157,000 acre-feet of LTSCs stored in the Arizona Active Management Area (&#8220;AMA&#8221;), 126,000 acre-feet of which is in the Roosevelt Water Conservation District (&#8220;RWCD&#8221;). For the purposes of storing water, the RWCD is part of the Phoenix AMA, which corresponds to the Phoenix metropolitan area. Accordingly, water stored in the AMA may be recovered and used anywhere in the AMA and could have a variety of uses for commercial developments within the Phoenix metropolitan area. During 2011 and 2012 we acquired additional LTSCs in RWCD and also LTSCs in five other storage sites in the AMA. All of the storage sites we utilize within the AMA are operated by third parties. 

Harquahala Valley Ground Water Basin 

Any new residential development in Arizona must obtain a permit from the Arizona Department of Water Resources certifying a &#8220;designated assured water supply&#8221; sufficient to sustain the development for at least 100 years. Harquahala Valley groundwater meets the designation of assured water supply. 

&#32;6 

Under Arizona law, the property and water rights in the Harquahala Valley are located in one of three areas in the state from which groundwater may be withdrawn and transferred from a rural area to a metropolitan area. In July 1998, we were granted approval for the transportation of three acre-feet of groundwater per acre of previously irrigated ground, totaling 3,837 acre-feet of groundwater, from Harquahala Valley into the Phoenix-Scottsdale metropolitan area. During 2011, we were granted approval for 9,877 acre-feet of groundwater, which included the prior 3,837 acre-feet awarded. 

We own 1,926 acres of land and have the ability to utilize 6,040 acre-feet of groundwater for development within the Harquahala Basin. The Analysis of Adequate Water Supply for the 6,040 acre-feet must be renewed before December 2021 in order to maintain these rights. 

In addition, the area in and around the Harquahala Valley appears to be a desirable area to site natural gas fired and solar power-generating plants. The site&#8217;s proximity to energy transmission lines and the high solarity in the region are strengths of the location. The water assets we own in this region could potentially provide a water source for energy plants that might be constructed in this area. 

Lincoln County, Nevada Water Delivery and Teaming Agreement 

Lincoln/Vidler entered into a water delivery teaming agreement to locate and develop water resources in Lincoln County, Nevada for planned projects under the County&#8217;s master plan. Under the agreement, proceeds from sales of water will be shared equally after Vidler is reimbursed for the expenses incurred in developing water resources in Lincoln County. Lincoln/Vidler has filed applications for more than 100,000 acre-feet of water rights with the intention of supplying water for residential, commercial, and industrial use, as contemplated by the county&#8217;s approved master plan. We believe that this is the only known new source of water for Lincoln County. Although it is uncertain, Vidler currently anticipates that up to 40,000 acre-feet of water rights will ultimately be permitted from these applications, and put to use for planned projects in Lincoln County. 

Tule Desert Groundwater Basin 

Lincoln/Vidler jointly filed permit applications in 1998 for approximately 14,000 acre-feet of water rights for industrial use from the Tule Desert Groundwater Basin in Lincoln County, Nevada. In November 2002, the Nevada State Engineer awarded Lincoln/Vidler a permit for 2,100 acre-feet of water rights, which Lincoln/Vidler subsequently sold in 2005, and ruled that an additional 7,240 acre-feet could be granted pending additional studies by Lincoln/Vidler (the &#8220;2002 Ruling&#8221;). Subsequent to the 2002 Ruling and consistent with the Nevada State Engineer&#8217;s conditions, we completed these additional engineering and scientific studies. 

On April 15, 2010, Lincoln/Vidler and the Nevada State Engineer announced that we had concluded a Settlement Agreement with respect to litigation between the parties regarding the amount of water to be permitted in the Tule Desert Groundwater Basin. The Settlement Agreement resulted in the granting to Lincoln/Vidler of the original application of 7,240 acre-feet of water rights with an initial 2,900 acre-feet of water rights available for sale or lease by Lincoln/Vidler. The balance of the water rights (4,340 acre-feet) is the subject of staged pumping and development over the next several years to further refine the modeling of the basin and potential impacts, if any, from deep aquifer pumping in the remote, unpopulated desert valley in Lincoln County, Nevada. 

The Tule Desert Groundwater Basin water resources were developed by Lincoln/Vidler to support the Lincoln County Recreation, Conservation and Development Act of 2004 (the &#8220;Land Act&#8221;) and Vidler&#8217;s proposed Toquop Power generation project, as discussed below. The water permitted under the Settlement Agreement is anticipated to provide sufficient water resources to support the development of the Toquop Power generation project and a portion of Land Act properties. 

Lincoln County Power Plant Project 

We developed the Toquop Power project. We are finalizing the required studies and National Environmental Protection Act (&#8220;NEPA&#8221;) permits for the project. We continue to engage in discussions with potential energy generation partners capable of building a power generation facility in Lincoln County. We own 100% of this power plant project, as it is not part of the Lincoln/Vidler teaming agreement. 

&#32;7 

Kane Springs 

In 2005, Lincoln/Vidler agreed to sell water to a developer of Coyote Springs, a new planned residential and commercial development 60 miles north of Las Vegas, as and when supplies were permitted from Lincoln/Vidler&#8217;s existing applications in Kane Springs, Nevada. Lincoln/Vidler currently has priority applications for approximately 17,375 acre-feet of water in Kane Springs for which the Nevada State Engineer has requested additional data before making a determination on the applications from this groundwater basin. The actual permits received may be for a lesser quantity, which cannot be accurately predicted. 

Currently, we have an option agreement with a developer to sell our remaining 500 acre-feet of water rights we own in this area at a price of $8,858 per acre-foot. In January 2015, we signed an amendment to the option agreement whereby if all 500 acre-feet are purchased by the developer, the purchase price will be reduced by $2,500 per acre-feet in exchange for the developer incurring additional drilling costs that would have been incurred by us in connection with the sale. The agreement expires in September 2017 and requires an annual option fee of $60,000 to maintain the rights under the option. To date, the developer has made all required annual option payments.

Our Real Estate Operations 

Our real estate operations are primarily conducted through UCP, our homebuilder and land developer with land acquisition and entitlement expertise in California, Washington State, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. 

We formed UCP, LLC, the predecessor company to UCP, in 2007 with the objective of acquiring attractive and well-located finished and partially-developed residential lots, primarily in select California and Washington markets. In 2010, UCP, LLC formed Benchmark Communities, LLC (&#8220;Benchmark&#8221;) to design, construct and sell high quality single-family homes on certain of the lots owned by UCP, LLC. 

&#32;9 

On July 23, 2013, UCP, Inc. completed an initial public offering (&#8220;IPO&#8221;). Since our acquisition of UCP, LLC and through the completion of UCP&#8217;s IPO, UCP, LLC operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Subsequent to the IPO, we have held a majority of the voting power of UCP, Inc. and of the economic interests of UCP, LLC, the subsidiary through which we operate our business. As of December 31, 2015 , we owned 56.9% &#32;of the voting interest in UCP, Inc. and we owned 56.9% &#32;of the economic interests of UCP, LLC and UCP, Inc. owned 43.1% &#32;of the economic interests of UCP, LLC. 

On April 10, 2014, we completed the acquisition of the assets and liabilities of Citizens Homes, Inc. (&#8220;Citizens&#8221;) used in the purchase of real estate and the construction and marketing of residential homes in North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, (the &#8220;Citizens Acquisition&#8221;) in order to position us to expand our operations into markets located in North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. The Citizens Acquisition provides increased scale and presence in established markets with immediate revenue opportunities through an established backlog. Additional synergies are expected in the areas of purchasing leverage and integrating the best practices in operational effectiveness. 

Our Business Strategy 

We actively source, evaluate and acquire land for residential real estate development and homebuilding. For each of our real estate assets, we periodically analyze ways to maximize value by either (i) building single-family homes and marketing them for sale under our Benchmark Communities brand, or (ii) completing entitlement work and horizontal infrastructure development and selling lots to third-party homebuilders. We perform this analysis using a disciplined analytical process, which we believe is a differentiating component of our business strategy. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we owned or controlled 5,878 &#32;lots, providing us with significant lot supply, which we believe will support our business strategy for a multi-year period. We believe that our sizable inventory of well-located land provides us with a significant opportunity to develop communities and design, construct, and sell homes under our Benchmark Communities brand. While we expect to opportunistically sell select residential lots to third-party homebuilders when we believe that will maximize our returns or lower our risk, we expect that homebuilding and home sales will constitute our primary means of generating revenue growth for the foreseeable future. &#32; As of December 31, 2015 , we had 134 &#32;completed and 292 &#32;under construction homes including 51 model homes, which we believe to be appropriate for our current growth plans. 

When acquiring real estate assets, we focus on seeking maximum long-term risk-adjusted returns. Our underwriting and operating philosophies emphasize capital preservation, risk identification and mitigation, and risk-adjusted returns. We seek to mitigate our exposure to market downturns and capitalize on market upturns through the following key strategies: 

&#8226; 

identifying and regularly reviewing the risks associated with our assets and business, including market, entitlement and environmental risks, and structuring transactions to minimize the impact of those risks; 

&#8226; 

maintaining high quality in our construction activities; 

&#8226; 

maintaining a strong balance sheet, using a prudent amount of leverage; 

&#8226; 

leveraging our purchasing power and controlling costs; 

&#8226; 

attracting highly experienced professionals and encouraging them to maintain a deep understanding and ownership of their respective disciplines; 

&#8226; 

maintaining a strong corporate culture that is based on our core values, including integrity, honesty, transparency, innovation, quality and excellence; and 

&#8226; 

maintaining rigorous supervision over our operations. 

&#32;10 

Markets 

We operate in five states in two distinct markets, West and Southeast. In our Western market our operations are homebuilding and land development and in our Southeastern market our operations are mainly homebuilding. We believe that these areas have attractive residential real estate investment characteristics, such as favorable long-term population demographics, a demand for single-family housing that often exceeds available supply, large and growing employment bases, and the ability to generate above-average returns. We continue to experience significant homebuilding and land development opportunities in our current markets and are evaluating potential expansion opportunities in other markets that we believe have attractive long-term investment characteristics.

Homebuilding Operations 

We build homes through our wholly owned homebuilding subsidiary, Benchmark Communities. Benchmark Communities operates under the principle that &#8220;Everything Matters!&#8221; This principle underlies all phases of our new home process including planning, design, construction, sales and the customer experience. We are diversified by product offering, which we believe reduces our exposure to any particular market or customer segment. We decide to target specific and identifiable buyer segments by project and geographic market, in part dictated by each particular asset, its location, topography and competitive market positioning, and the amenities of the surrounding area and the community in which it is located. 

We believe our customers look for distinctive new homes; accordingly, we design homes in thoughtful and creative ways to create homes that we expect buyers will find highly desirable. We seek to accomplish this by collecting and analyzing information about the characteristics of our target buyer segments and incorporating our analysis into new home designs. We source information about our target buyer segments from our experience selling new homes and through market research that enables us to identify design preferences that we believe will appeal to our customers. We target diverse buyer segments, including first-time buyers, first-time move-up buyers, second-time move-up buyers and active-adult buyers. Most of our communities target multiple buyer segments, enabling us to seek increased sales pace and reduce our dependence on any single buyer segment. 

We contract with third party architects, engineers and interior designers to assist our experienced internal product development personnel in designing homes that are intended to reflect our target customers&#8217; tastes and preferences. In addition to identifying desirable design and amenities, this process includes a rigorous value engineering strategy that allows us to seek efficiencies in the construction process. 

Customer Experience 

We seek to make the home buying experience friendly, effective and efficient. Our integrated quality assurance and customer care functions assign the same personnel at each community the responsibility for monitoring quality control and managing the customer experience. As a standard practice, we seek to communicate with each homeowner multiple times during their first two years of ownership in an effort to ensure satisfaction with their new home. Additionally, we monitor the effectiveness of our customer experience efforts with third-party surveys that measure our home buyers&#8217; perception of the quality of our homes and the responsiveness of our customer service. Our customer experience program seeks to optimize customer care in terms of availability, response time and effectiveness, and we believe that it reduces our exposure to future liability claims. We believe that our continuing commitment to quality and the customer experience provides a compelling value proposition for prospective home buyers and reduces our exposure to long-term construction defect claims.

Homebuilding, Marketing and Sales Process 

We realize that homebuilding is a local business. As a result we focus on the unique characteristics of each market. In our West homebuilding market, consistent with local market custom, we typically release for sale and construct homes in phases of four to twelve homes based upon projected sales rates. In our Southeast market, consistent with local market custom, we typically release lots for sale in phases of eight to twenty lots allowing customers to select a specific home on their chosen lot. 

In both markets, we adhere to an &#8220;even flow&#8221; construction methodology that allows us to standardize the timing of new home starts in order to reduce labor and material costs and administrative inefficiencies in the construction process. Our even-flow method provides visibility to our material suppliers, vendors and subcontractors, helping them balance their labor and material needs consistently over time, which we believe results in higher-quality craftsmanship and lower production costs to us. Our even-flow method provides us enhanced visibility, oversight, and control of the production process, and allows us to more effectively manage our working capital accounts. 

We routinely monitor and actively manage our even flow production process to align with prevailing and expected future unit absorption trends. In the event our inventory builds faster than homes are sold, we will typically halt construction when homes are structurally complete, but prior to the selection of certain amenities, such as flooring and counter tops, until we have entered into a sales contract and received a non-refundable customer deposit. This process allows us to reduce the amount of capital invested in our inventory of homes until homes are under contract and allows buyers to select and customize certain non-structural elements of the home. 

Our sales and marketing process uses extensive advertising and promotional strategies, including Benchmark Communities&#8217; website, community marketing brochures, and the use of billboards and other roadside signage. Brokerage operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries in each state, as follows: (1) BMC Realty Advisors, Inc. (&#8220;BMC Realty&#8221;) in California and Washington; (2) Builders BMC, Inc. in North Carolina; (3) BMCH Tennessee, LLC in Tennessee; and (4) Benchmark Communities, LLC in South Carolina. 

We typically staff two professional sales personnel at each of our communities. Our in-house sales teams have offices in their respective model complex and are responsible for selling homes, interfacing with customers between the time a sales contract is executed and the home sale closes, and coordinating with our escrow management department. Our sales personnel work with potential buyers to determine their unique needs and then by demonstrating the functionality and livability of our homes with floor plans, price information, development and construction timetables, tours of model homes and the selection of amenities. Our sales personnel are internally trained, generally have prior experience selling new homes in their respective markets, and are licensed by applicable real estate oversight agencies. 

Model homes are one of our primary sales tools. Depending on the amount of time we expect it will take to complete sales at a community and the number of different homes we are offering, we typically build between two and four model homes. As of December 31, 2015 , we owned 51 &#32;completed and seven under construction model homes. Our marketing staff uses interior designers, architects and color consultants to create model homes designed to appeal to our targeted buyer segments. Our models typically include features that are included in the base price of the particular home model, and options and upgrades that a home buyer may elect to purchase. We often use an on-site design center that offers our customers the opportunity to purchase various options and upgrades and provides additional revenue opportunities. The on-site design center experience enhances our customer&#8217;s experience. 

Home Buyer Financing 

The majority of our home buyers finance a significant portion of the purchase price of their home with long-term mortgage financing. We assist prospective purchasers in obtaining mortgage financing by providing referrals to one of our preferred lenders. Our preferred lenders have a track record of offering our customers competitive rates and terms, a desire to enhance our customer&#8217;s experience and the ability to perform on an agreed schedule in order to meet our expectations and those of our customers. Through our lender referral process, we seek to reduce the challenges our customers encounter when trying to obtain mortgage financing for our homes. 

Quality Control and Customer Service 

We pay particular attention to the product design process and carefully consider quality and choice of materials in order to attempt to eliminate building deficiencies. The quality and workmanship of the subcontractors we employ are monitored and we make regular inspections and evaluations of our subcontractors to seek to ensure that our standards are met. 

&#32;12 

We have quality control and customer service staff who seek to provide a positive experience for each home buyer throughout the pre-sale, sale, building, closing and post-closing periods. These employees are responsible for providing after sales customer service. Our quality and service initiatives include taking home buyers on a comprehensive tour of their home prior to closing and using customer survey results to improve our standards of quality and customer satisfaction. 

Warranty Program 

We provide a &#8220;fit and finish&#8221; warranty on our home sales that covers workmanship and materials consistent with local market custom (two years in the West homebuilding market and one year in the Southeast homebuilding market). As is customary in the homebuilding industry, our trade partners who build our homes sign contracts with the provision to provide warranty repairs inside the fit and finish warranty period, including structural and water intrusion repairs up to the period designated by the respective State&#8217;s Statute of Repose. 

Along with our homeowners receiving warranty information, they also receive important home maintenance guidelines in an effort to help them enjoy and prolong the durability of their home. Customers who actively and correctly maintain their home not only protect the value of their home, but minimize the longer-term risk to us that is normally associated with homes that are not properly maintained. 

The limited warranty covering construction defects is transferable to subsequent buyers not under direct contract with us and requires that home buyers agree to the conditions, restrictions and procedures set forth in the warranty. We accrue estimated warranty costs based upon our estimates of the expense we expect to incur for work under warranty. 

There can be no assurance, however, that the terms and limitations of the limited warranty will be effective against claims made by home buyers; that we will be able to renew our insurance coverage or renew it at reasonable rates; that we will not be liable for damages, the cost of repairs, and/or the expense of litigation surrounding possible construction defects, soil subsidence or building related claims; or that claims will not arise out of uninsurable events or circumstances not covered by insurance and not subject to the effective indemnification agreements with our subcontractors. 

Raw Materials 

When constructing homes we use various materials and components. It has typically taken us four to six months to construct a home, during which time we are subject to price fluctuations in raw materials. 

Land Development 

As a homebuilder and land developer, we are positioned to either build new homes on our lots or to sell our lots to third-party homebuilders. While our business plan contemplates building new homes on the majority of our lots, we proactively monitor market conditions and our operations allow us to opportunistically sell a portion of our lots to third-party homebuilders if we believe that will maximize our returns or lower our risk. We believe that our ability and willingness to opportunistically build on or sell our lots to third-party homebuilders afford us the following important advantages: 

&#8226; 

exploit periods of cyclical expansion by building on our lots; 

&#8226; 

manage our operating margins and reduce operating income volatility by opportunistically selling lots as operating performance and market conditions dictate; and 

&#8226; 

manage operating risk in periods where we anticipate cyclical contraction by reducing our land supply through lot sales. 

We benefit from the long-standing relationships our executive management team at UCP has with key land owners, brokers, lenders, as well as development and real estate companies in our market. These relationships have provided us with opportunities to evaluate and privately negotiate acquisitions outside of a broader marketing process. In addition, we believe that our financial position, positive reputation in our markets among potential land sellers and brokers, as well as our track record of acquiring lots since 2008, provide land sellers and brokers confidence that we will consummate transactions in a highly professional, efficient and transparent manner. Our ability to regularly do so in turn strengthens these relationships for future opportunities. We believe our relationships with land owners and brokers will continue to provide opportunities to source land acquisitions prior to a full marketing process, helping us to maintain a significant pipeline of opportunities on favorable terms and prices. 

&#32;13 

The land development process in our markets can be very complex and often requires highly-experienced individuals that can respond to numerous unforeseen challenges with a high degree of competency and integrity. We actively seek land acquisition opportunities where others might seek to avoid complexities, as we believe we can add significant value through our expertise in entitlements, re-entitlements, horizontal land planning and development. 

Acquisition Process 

Our ability to identify, evaluate and acquire land in desirable locations and on favorable terms is critical to our success. We evaluate land opportunities based on risk-adjusted returns and employ a rigorous due diligence process to identify risks, which we then seek to mitigate. 

We leverage our relationships with land owners, brokers, developers and financial institutions, and our history of purchasing land since 2008, to seek the &#8220;first look&#8221; at land acquisition opportunities or to evaluate opportunities before they are broadly marketed. We use a variety of transaction structures, including purchase and option contracts, to maximize our risk-adjusted return, with particular emphasis on reducing our risk, conserving our capital while accommodating the particular needs of each seller. 

We combine our entitlement, land development and homebuilding expertise to increase the flexibility of our business, seek enhanced margins, control our lot deliveries and maximize returns. Additionally, we believe that the integration of the entitlement, development and homebuilding process allows us to deliver communities that achieve a high level of customer satisfaction. Our entitlement expertise allows us to add value through the zoning and land planning process. Our land development entitlement expertise allows us to consider a broader range of land acquisition opportunities from which to seek superior risk-adjusted returns. 

We selectively evaluate expansion opportunities in our existing markets as well as new markets that we believe have attractive long-term investment characteristics. These characteristics include, among others, demand for single-family housing that exceeds available supply, well regarded educational systems and institutions, high educational attainment levels, desirable transportation infrastructure, proximity to major trade corridors, positive employment trends, diverse employment bases and high barriers to the development of residential real estate, such as geographic or political factors.

Our Financing Strategy 

We intend to use debt and equity as part of our ongoing financing strategy at UCP, coupled with redeployment of cash flows from continuing operations. This strategy provides us with the financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms. In that regard, we expect to employ prudent levels of leverage to finance the acquisition and development of our lots and construction of our homes. We attempt to match the duration of our real estate assets with the duration of the capital that finances each real estate asset. 

Our indebtedness in this segment is primarily comprised of senior notes due in 2017, and project-level secured acquisition, development and construction loans. Substantially all of UCP&#8217;s project debt is guaranteed by UCP, LLC and UCP, Inc. We consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of new indebtedness, including the purchase price of assets to be acquired with debt financing, the estimated market value of our assets, the expected asset&#8217;s duration, and the ability of particular assets to generate cash flow to cover the expected debt service. 

We intend to finance future acquisitions and developments with the most advantageous source of capital available to us at the time of the transaction, which may include a combination of common and preferred equity issued by UCP, secured and unsecured corporate level debt issued by UCP, property-level debt and mortgage financing and other public, private or bank debt. 

Government Regulation and Environmental Matters 

We are subject to various local, state, and federal statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning zoning, building design, construction, and similar matters, including local regulations which impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular locality. In addition, we are subject to registration and filing requirements in connection with the construction, advertisement, and sale of our communities in certain states and localities in which we operate. We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing communities due to building moratoriums that could be implemented in the future in the states in which we operate. Generally, such moratoriums relate to insufficient water or sewerage facilities or inadequate road capacity. 

In addition, some state and local governments in markets where we operate have approved, and others may approve, slow-growth, or no-growth initiatives that could negatively affect the availability of land and building opportunities within those areas. Approval of these initiatives could adversely affect our ability to build and sell homes in the affected markets and/or could require the satisfaction of additional administrative and regulatory requirements, which could result in slowing the progress or increasing the costs of our homebuilding operations in these markets. Any such delays or costs could have a negative effect on our future revenues and earnings. 

We are also subject to a variety of local, state, and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment. The particular environmental laws which apply to any given community vary greatly according to the community site, the site&#8217;s environmental conditions, and the present and former uses of the site. These environmental laws may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance, remediation, and/or other costs; and prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity. 

Despite our past ability to obtain necessary permits and approvals for our communities, we anticipate that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on developers and homebuilders in the future. Although we cannot predict the effect of these requirements, they could result in time-consuming and expensive compliance programs and in substantial expenditures, which could cause delays and increase our cost of operations. In addition, our ability to obtain or renew permits or approvals and the continued effectiveness of permits already granted or approvals already obtained is dependent upon many factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as changes in policies, rules, and regulations and their interpretation and application. 

Seasonality 

The homebuilding industry generally exhibits seasonality. We have historically experienced, and in the future expect to continue to experience, variability in our operating results and capital needs on a quarterly basis. Although we enter into home sales contracts throughout the year, a significant portion of our sales activity takes place during the spring and summer, with the corresponding closings taking place during the fall and winter. Additionally, our capital needs are typically greater during the spring and summer when we are building homes for delivery later in the year. Accordingly, our revenue may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis, and we must maintain sufficient liquidity to meet short-term operating requirements. As a result of seasonal variation, our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular quarter are not necessarily representative of the results we expect at year-end. 

&#32;15 

Competition 

The homebuilding and land development industry is highly competitive. We compete with numerous large national and regional homebuilding companies and with smaller local homebuilders and land developers for, among other things, home buyers, financing, desirable land parcels, raw materials and skilled management and labor resources. We also compete with sales of existing homes and, to a lesser extent, with the rental housing market. Our homes compete on the basis of design, quality, price and location. In addition to home sales, we sell lots to third-party homebuilders. We compete for land buyers with other land owners. Our land holdings compete on the basis of quality, market positioning, location and price. 

The homebuilding and land development industry has historically been subject to significant volatility. We may be at a competitive disadvantage with regard to certain of our national competitors whose operations are more geographically diversified than ours, as these competitors may be better able to withstand any future regional downturn in the housing market. 

We compete directly with a number of large national homebuilders such as D. R. Horton Inc., Pulte Group, Inc., and Lennar Corporation who are larger than we are and may have greater financial and operational resources than we do. This may give our competitors an advantage in marketing their products, securing materials and labor at lower prices, purchasing land and allowing their homes to be delivered to customers more quickly and at more favorable prices. This competition could reduce our market share and limit our ability to expand our business. 

Our Corporate Segment 

Our corporate segment includes investments in small businesses, typically venture capital-type situations, which are reported in this segment until they meet the requirements for separate segment reporting. In addition, the segment includes the results from a portfolio of equity securities in publicly traded companies, the results of deferred compensation investment assets held in trust for the benefit of several PICO officers and non-employee directors and the corresponding and offsetting deferred compensation liabilities, and corporate overhead expenses. 

The following are the most significant investments in small businesses that we currently own: 

We own common and preferred stock of, and have made a loan to Mindjet Inc. (&#8220;Mindjet&#8221;), a privately held company located in San Francisco, California that provides software to help business innovation by providing a framework to build sustainable, predictable, and repeatable innovation processes. The company markets its products worldwide and has offices in the United States, Germany, France, Japan, Australia, and the United Kingdom. The investment balances in Mindjet are held at cost and included in investments in our consolidated financial statements while the outstanding loan balance is included in other assets. At December 31, 2015 , we controlled 19.3% &#32;of the voting stock of the company and the carrying value of our total investment in Mindjet was $2.2 million , comprised of $1.3 million &#32;in preferred stock and a loan of $886,000 &#32;that we expect to be converted into additional preferred stock during the first quarter of 2016. 

We operate Mendell Energy, LLC (&#8220;Mendell&#8221;), a wholly owned oil and gas venture which owns and operates oil and gas leases, primarily located within the Wattenberg Field in Colorado. Currently, we own approximately 780 &#32;acres of oil and gas leases in the Wattenburg Field and have drilled and completed four wells on our leased properties. To date, we have developed the Wattenburg acreage by constructing additional drill sites and a production facility and we obtained permits for several additional wells. In addition, we also own 640 &#32;acres of oil and gas leases in Wyoming. In November 2013, we entered into an administrative service agreement with a private company that we pay to assist in the management, operation, direction, and supervision of these oil and gas operations. At December 31, 2015 , we had a net carrying value of approximately $2.5 million &#32;in this business venture. 

&#32;16 

We own preferred stock in Synthonics, a preclinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and discovery of patentable small molecule drugs that incorporate a metal coordination chemistry. The company targets approved drugs, advanced clinical candidates or previously studied compounds with pharmacokinetic properties that are believed to limit the drugs&#8217; clinical safety, tolerability or efficacy and can be improved through metal coordination. Metal coordination entails attaching a pharmaceutically acceptable metal, such as magnesium, calcium, zinc or bismuth, to an active agent to create a new, patentable compound. The company believes its approach enables more efficient and less expensive drug discovery and clinical development than conventional drug research and development approaches. The company intends to license one or more of the drugs to integrated pharmaceutical companies that would assist in the development of such drugs and assume responsibility for their approval, marketing and distribution. However, they have not commercialized any products or generated any significant revenue to date, and expect to incur operating losses into the foreseeable future. Mr. Slepicka, a director of our Company, co-founded Synthonics and is currently their Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and acting Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Slepicka, along with the other officers of Synthonics, own the majority of the outstanding stock of Synthonics. At December 31, 2015 , we owned 18.3% &#32;of the voting interest of the company. We made our initial investment in Synthonics during 2010 when we purchased 273,229 shares of series D convertible voting preferred stock for $2.1 million. In2013, we invested $110,000 for an additional 15,000 shares of the same series D convertible voting preferred stock. In February 2014, we initiated a $400,000 line of credit to Synthonics which bore interest at 15% per annum and in May 2014, we increased the line to $450,000. The outstanding balance of the line of credit and accrued interest was repaid in April 2015. The investment is held at cost and is included in investments in our consolidated financial statements and the outstanding balance of the line of credit was included in other assets. 

It is reasonably possible given the volatile nature of the oil and gas, software, and biopharmaceutical industries that circumstances may change in the future which could require us to record impairment losses on our investments in small businesses included in this segment.
