 ITEM 1 &#8211; DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

&#160;

Summary 

&#160;

ImmuCell Corporation was founded in 1982 and completed an initial public offering of common stock in 1987. After achieving approval from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to sell First Defense &#174; in 1991, we focused most of our efforts during the 1990&#8217;s developing human product applications of the underlying milk protein purification technology. Beginning in 1999, we re-focused our business strategy on First Defense &#174; and other products for the dairy and beef industries. During the first quarter of 2016, we sold 1.1 million shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), raising net proceeds of $5.3 million. Our purpose is to create scientifically-proven and practical products that improve animal health and productivity in the dairy and beef industries. We have developed products that provide significant, immediate immunity to newborn dairy and beef livestock and are also developing a product to address mastitis, the most significant cause of economic loss to the dairy industry. We have experienced consistent growth in product sales over the past five years. Our operations are generally profitable, except when we elect to make unusually large investments in product development expenses.

&#160;

During 2000, we began the development of Mast Out &#210; , our Nisin-based treatment for subclinical mastitis in lactating dairy cows. No sales of this product can be made without prior approval of our New Animal Drug Application (NADA) by the Center for Veterinary Medicine, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Nisin is an antibacterial peptide that has been demonstrated in clinical studies to be an effective aid in the reduction of mastitis-causing organisms in dairy cows. Mastitis is a very common infection in dairy cows that results in inflammation of the mammary gland. We believe that Mast Out &#210; could revolutionize the way that mastitis is treated by making earlier treatment of subclinically infected cows economically feasible by not requiring a milk discard during, or for a period of time after, treatment. No other FDA-approved mastitis treatment product on the market can offer this value proposition. Mast Out &#210; could also be used as a tool to improve milk quality, allowing producers to increase milk revenue by earning higher milk quality premiums. Regulatory achievements to date have significantly reduced the product development risks for Mast Out &#210; in the areas of safety and effectiveness. Our primary focus, with respect to Mast Out &#210; , has now turned to the manufacturing objectives required for FDA approval.

&#160;

During 2006, we initiated our ongoing efforts to maintain compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations in all of our manufacturing operations, which requires a sustained investment that further enhances the quality of all of our products. Compliance is required for Wipe Out &#210; Dairy Wipes and for Mast Out &#210; and may open access to international markets for First Defense &#174; where such standards are imposed. We have elected to enforce these quality standards across all of our product lines. During the first quarter of 2013, the FDA conducted a routine inspection of our facilities and operations. The report from this inspection was very favorable, and we responded to the few, minor observations that were noted. As we make process improvements, we are investing in personnel, equipment and facility modifications to increase the efficiency and quality of our operations.

&#160;

We had approximately 2,429,000 shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 1998 in comparison to 3,055,000 shares as of December 31, 2015. There were approximately 480,000 and 238,000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under stock options that were outstanding as of December 31, 1998 and 2015, respectively. During the seventeen years that we have been strategically focused on products for the dairy and beef industries, we have funded our operations and improved our net financial position, as demonstrated in the following table (in thousands, except for percentages):

Animal Health Products 

&#160; 

Our lead product, First Defense &#210; , is manufactured from hyperimmune cows&#8217; colostrum (the milk that a cow produces immediately after giving birth) utilizing our proprietary vaccine and milk protein purification technologies. The target disease, bovine enteritis (calf scours), causes diarrhea and dehydration in newborn calves and often leads to serious sickness and even death. First Defense &#210; is the only USDA-licensed, orally delivered scours preventive product on the market for calves with claims against E. coli K99 and coronavirus (two leading causes of scours). First Defense &#174; provides bovine antibodies that newborn calves need but are unable to produce on their own immediately after birth. Our milk antibody products provide Immediate Immunity &#8482; during the first few critical days of life when calves need this protection most. Studies have shown that calves that scour are more susceptible to other diseases later in life and under-perform calves that do not contract scours. The direct, two-part mode-of-action of First Defense &#174; delivers specific immunoglobulins at the gut level to immediately protect against disease, while also providing additional antibodies that are absorbed into the bloodstream. These circulating antibodies function like a natural timed-release mechanism, as they are re-secreted into the gut later to provide extended protection. A single dose of First Defense &#174; provides a guaranteed level of protection proven to reduce mortality and morbidity from two major causes of calf scours. First Defense &#174; is convenient to use. A calf needs to receive only one bolus of First Defense &#174; within the first twelve hours after birth (the earlier the better). The product is stored at room temperature and no mixing is required before it is given to the calf. We are a leader in the scours prevention market with this product. The third quarter of 2015 marked the 24 th anniversary of the original USDA approval of this product in 1991. During the first quarter of 2016, we sold the 17,000,000 th dose of First Defense &#210; . We believe that these milestones demonstrate the value of our technology and the long-term market acceptance of our product. In 2011, we began selling nutritional and feed supplement product applications (that are not delivered in the capsule format) of our First Defense Technology TM , which is a unique whey protein concentrate that is purified utilizing our proprietary milk protein processing methods that does not carry the claims of our USDA-licensed product. We utilize one production line and one quality system for all of our milk-based products.

&#160;

During 1999, we acquired Wipe Out &#210; Dairy Wipes , which is our second leading source of product sales. That transaction included the purchase of certain equipment, trademarks and a license of intellectual property, including several issued patents, covering the product and rights to develop skin and environmental sanitizing applications of the underlying Nisin technology. Wipe Out &#210; Dairy Wipes consist of towelettes that are pre-moistened with a Nisin-based formulation to prepare the teat area of a cow in advance of milking. Milking regulations require that the teat area of cows be cleaned, sanitized and dried before each milking. Producers use a variety of methods including dips and paper or cloth towels. Our wipes are made from a non-woven fabric that is strong enough to allow for a vigorous cleaning. The wiping process can also help promote milk letdown. Wipe Out &#210; Dairy Wipes are manufactured in compliance with cGMP regulations, as required by federal law.

&#160;

As a product line extension, we have been developing a pet application of the Nisin technology underlying Wipe Out &#174; Dairy Wipes , since many skin infections in pets are caused by Nisin-susceptible bacteria. During 2006, we completed a collaborative study of Nisin susceptibility in methicillin-resistant staphylococcal isolates from dogs with skin infections (dermatitis) with investigators at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. One hundred isolates of methicillin-resistant canine Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), S . intermedius and S. schleiferi were tested and found to be highly susceptible to Nisin&#8217;s antibacterial activity. During 2008, we completed a clinical feasibility study in collaboration with the University of Tennessee to evaluate the effectiveness of Nisin impregnated wipes used to treat skin infections in dogs. During the first quarter of 2013, we initiated sales of Nisin-based wipes for pets in a 120-count canister (Preva TM wipes) to Bayer HealthCare Animal Health of St. Joseph, Missouri.

&#160;

During 2001, we began to offer our own, internally developed California Mastitis Test (CMT) . CMT can be used for bulk tank as well as individual cow sample monitoring and can be used to determine which quarter of the udder is mastitic. This test can be performed at cow-side for early detection of mastitis. CMT products are also made by other manufacturers and are readily available to the dairy producer.

Sales and Markets 

&#160;

Our sales and marketing team currently consists of one vice president and five regional managers. Our inside sales

and customer service representative performs the order entry and inside sales duties, and our facility manager processes all shipments. The manner in which we sell and distribute our products depends, in large measure, upon the nature of the particular product, its intended users and the country in which it is sold. First Defense &#210; is sold primarily through major animal health distributors who, in turn, sell directly to veterinary clinics, fleet stores and direct to farms. We have experienced minimal bad debt with respect to this product. We provide for a 50% account credit for domestic distributors on expired First Defense &#210; product, which has a two-year shelf life, resulting in an immaterial amount of returns. Promotional merchandise is given to certain customers at times because we believe it enhances brand recognition. Additionally, advertising, training meetings, incentive programs, direct mail initiatives and face-to-face solution selling are tactics we use to create brand loyalty. Sales are normally seasonal, with higher sales expected during the first quarter. Sales of this product into the beef industry are highly seasonal because most beef calves are born between January and April each year. Harsh winter weather and severe temperature fluctuations cause stress to calves, and calves under stress are more susceptible to scours. We sell Wipe Out &#210; Dairy Wipes and CMT to distributors, bovine veterinarians and directly to producers.

&#160; 

International product sales represented approximately 16%, 15% and 16% of our total product sales for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The majority of these international sales were to Canada. We currently price our products in U.S. dollars. To the extent that the value of the dollar declines with respect to any other currency, our competitive position may be enhanced. Conversely, an increase in the value of the dollar in any country in which we sell products may have the effect of increasing the local price of our products, thereby leading to a potential reduction in demand. The value of the Canadian dollar has declined recently, but this has not correlated with a decrease in our sales into Canada. Generally, our international sales are generated through relationships with in-country distributors that have knowledge of the local regulatory and marketing requirements.

&#160;

We continue our efforts to grow sales of First Defense &#210; in North America, where there are approximately 39,800,000 dairy and beef cows in the United States and 4,750,000 dairy and beef cows in Canada. We believe that even greater market opportunities exist in other international territories. There are estimated to be approximately 66,400,000 dairy and beef cows in China, 35,550,000 in the European Union, 20,882,000 in Australia and New Zealand, 10,050,000 in Mexico, 1,405,000 in South Korea and 1,315,000 in Japan. However, industry practices, economic conditions and cause of disease may differ in these foreign markets from what we experience in North America. We introduced First Defense &#210; into South Korea in 2005 and its equivalent into Japan in 2007 through collaborations with in-country distributors.

&#160;

With Mast Out &#210; , we are working to expand our product line to include a treatment for subclinical mastitis for the mother cow. Mastitis (inflammation of the mammary gland) is the most costly and common disease affecting the dairy industry. It is estimated to cost the U.S. dairy industry approximately $2 billion in economic harm per year. The disease diminishes the saleable quantity and overall value of milk, in addition to causing other herd health and productivity losses. While the benefit of treating clinical mastitis is widely known, subclinical mastitis (those cases where cows have infected udders, but still produce saleable milk) is associated with its own significant economic losses and is recognized as a substantial contributor to clinical mastitis cases. Some industry experts have estimated that subclinical mastitis costs the U.S. dairy industry approximately $1 billion per year. There is a growing awareness of the cascade of adverse events and conditions associated with subclinical mastitis, including reduced or foregone milk quality premiums, lower milk production, shorter shelf life for fluid milk, lower yields and less flavor for cheese, higher rates of clinical mastitis, lower conception rates, increased abortions and increased cull rates. Because the milk from cows treated with traditional antibiotics must be discarded, most dairy producers simply do not treat subclinically infected cows or they cull the affected animals from the herd. Common milk discard periods cover the duration of treatment and extend from 36 to 96 hours after last treatment, depending on the antibiotic. On average, a cow produces approximately 60 to 80 pounds of milk per day. While milk prices vary significantly, at an average value of $15.00 per 100 pounds, a cow produces approximately $9 to $12 worth of milk per day. These estimated figures would result in milk discard costs ranging from approximately $32 (for 3.5 days of milk at 60 pounds per day) to $132 (for 11 days of milk at 80 pounds per day) per treated animal, which is a significant barrier to the routine treatment of subclinical mastitis with traditional antibiotics. We believe Mast Out &#210; will not be subject to this milk discard requirement in the United States. The ability to treat such cases without a milk discard could revolutionize the way mastitis is managed in a herd. Mast Out &#210; could be uniquely positioned in the market as a treatment for subclinical mastitis that prevents some subsequent cases of clinical mastitis. It is common practice to move sick cows from their regular herd group to a sick cow group for treatment and the related milk discard. This movement causes stress on the cow and a reduction in milk production. Cows treated with Mast Out &#210; would not have to be moved, allowing this costly drop in production to be avoided. Mast Out &#210; likely will be priced at a premium to the traditional antibiotic products currently on the market, which are all sold subject to a milk discard requirement. However, we believe that the product&#8217;s value proposition demonstrates a return on investment to the producer that will justify this premium.

Many fear that the possible overuse of antibiotics in livestock may be a contributing factor to the rising problem of bacterial drug resistance, which undermines the effectiveness of drugs to combat human illnesses. This would not be a concern for Mast Out &#210; because our active ingredient (Nisin) is not used for human health. The FDA is committed to addressing this public health risk. Citing concerns about untreatable, life-threatening infections in humans, new FDA and European regulations are aimed at restricting the use of cephalosporins in food animals and at improving milk quality. Regulators have recently increased their monitoring of antibiotic residues in milk and meat. During the first quarter of 2012, the USDA reduced the allowable level of somatic cell counts (SCC) in milk from 750,000 (cells per milliliter) to 400,000 at the individual farm level (not a blended calculation of comingled milk) in order to qualify for an EU health certification for export. The USDA&#8217;s National Animal Health Monitoring System through its Dairy 2014 study suggests that 21% of all dairy cows are treated with a mastitis drug, of which approximately 51% are treated with third generation cephalosporins. Several major food processors and retailers have implemented policies addressing this growing public health concern that the overuse of antibiotics is contributing to a rising number of life-threatening human infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria known as &#8220;superbugs&#8221;. This current environment could be favorable to the introduction of a new product such as Mast Out &#210; as an alternative to traditional antibiotics such as penicillin and cephalosporins. We believe that this changing environment of new regulations and public opinion supports the value of our ongoing product development efforts. Additionally, we believe that the use of First Defense &#210; is consistent with this trend of reducing the use of antibiotics because the prevention of calf scours early in life with our purified milk antibodies can reduce the need for treatment antibiotics later in a calf&#8217;s life.

&#160;

It is difficult to estimate the potential size of the market for the treatment of subclinical mastitis because this disease is largely left untreated presently. We believe that approximately 20-30% of the U.S. dairy herd is affected by subclinical mastitis caused by Gram-positive organisms falling within the Mast Out &#210; claim spectrum. This compares to approximately 2% of the U.S. herd that is thought to be infected with clinical mastitis, where approximately $60,000,000 per year is spent on drug treatments. We have estimated that first year domestic sales of our product could be approximately $5,800,000 and that sales could grow to approximately $36,100,000 by the fifth year after market launch. Actual sales results could be higher or lower. Key assumptions underlying these estimates include there being 7,650,000 cows in lactation in the United States and the treatment of 1.15 quarters per cow on average with three doses per treatment at approximately $9.99 per dose. We assumed that 2.2% of all cows in lactation would be treated during the first year after market launch and that 13.7% would be treated during the fifth year after market launch. The manufacturing facility that we are preparing to construct could have enough capacity to meet approximately 35% of the sales projected for the fifth year after product launch. We believe that similar market opportunities also exist outside of the United States and for the treatment of dry (non-lactating) cows.

&#160; 

Product Development 

&#160;

The majority of our product development spending is focused on the development of Mast Out &#174; , our Nisin-based intramammary treatment of subclinical mastitis in lactating dairy cows. During 2000, we acquired an exclusive license from Nutrition 21, Inc. (formerly Applied Microbiology Inc. or AMBI) to develop and market Nisin-based products for animal health applications, which allowed us to initiate the development of Mast Out &#210; . In 2004, we paid Nutrition 21 approximately $965,000 to buy out this royalty and milestone-based license to Nisin, thereby acquiring control of the animal health applications of Nisin. Nisin, the same active ingredient contained in our topical wipe products, is an antibacterial peptide known to be effective against most Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria. In our pivotal effectiveness study, statistically significant Mast Out &#210; cure rates were associated with a statistically significant reduction in milk somatic cell count, which is an important measure of milk quality. Nisin is an antibacterial peptide known to be effective against most Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria. Nisin is a well characterized substance, having been used in food preservation applications for over 50 years. Food-grade Nisin, however, cannot be used in pharmaceutical applications because of its low purity. Our Nisin technology includes methods to achieve pharmaceutical-grade purity.

&#160;

It is generally current practice to treat mastitis only when the disease has progressed to the clinical stage where the milk from an infected cow cannot be sold. The use of all mastitis drugs currently on the market is permitted only if the milk from treated cows is discarded during treatment and for a period of time thereafter to allow the antibiotic residues to clear from milk that is to be consumed by humans. We have estimated that the cost of this discarded milk may be approximately $300 million per year. Because milk from cows with subclinical infections can be sold, this disease is largely left untreated to avoid the milk discard penalty. Subclinical mastitis is associated with reduced milk production (some have estimated approximately 1,500 pounds of lost milk, or about $240 at $16.00 per hundredweight, per infected cow), reduced milk premiums, reproduction inefficiencies and an increased incidence of clinical mastitis. We intend to introduce the first mastitis treatment that is not subject to milk discard or meat withhold requirements, which would be a significant competitive advantage for our product.

In 2004, we entered into a product development and marketing agreement with Pfizer Animal Health (doing business as Zoetis since 2013) covering Mast Out &#210; . Zoetis elected to terminate the agreement in 2007. We believe that this decision was not based on any unanticipated efficacy or regulatory issues. Rather, we believe the decision was primarily driven by a marketing concern relating to their fear that the milk from treated cows could interfere with the manufacture of certain cultured dairy products. Due to the zero milk discard feature, there is a risk that Nisin from the milk of cows treated with Mast Out &#210; could interfere with the manufacture of certain (but not all) commercial cultured dairy products, such as some kinds of cheese and yogurt, if a process tank contains a high enough percentage of milk from treated cows. The impact of this potential interference ranges from a delay in the manufacturing process, which does happen at times for other reasons, to the less likely stopping of a cheese starter culture. Milk from cows that have been treated with Mast Out &#210; that is sold exclusively for fluid milk products presents no such risk. We worked with scientists and mastitis experts to conduct a formal risk assessment to quantify the impact that milk from treated cows may have on cultured dairy products. This study concluded that the dilution of milk from treated cows through comingling with milk from untreated cows during normal milk hauling and storage practices reduces the risk of interference with commercial dairy cultures to a negligible level when Mast Out &#210; is used in accordance with the product label. We do not believe that a premium-priced product such as Mast Out &#210; will be used as part of a whole herd (&#8220;blitz&#8221;) treatment protocol, which reduces the risk of cheese interference. We do not see this as a significant problem as modern &#8220;precision dairying&#8221; practices support reducing the indiscriminate use of drug treatments.

&#160;

Commercial introduction of Mast Out &#210; in the United States is subject to approval of our NADA by the FDA, which approval cannot be assured. Foreign regulatory approvals would be required for sales in key markets outside of the United States, which would involve some similar and some different requirements. The NADA is comprised of five principal Technical Sections and one administrative submission that are subject to the FDA&#8217;s phased review. By statute, each Technical Section submission is generally subject to a six-month review cycle by the FDA. Each Technical Section can be reviewed and approved separately. Upon review and assessment by the FDA that all requirements for a Technical Section have been met, the FDA may issue a Technical Section Complete Letter. The current status of our work on these submissions to the FDA is as follows:

&#160;

1) Environmental Impact: During the third quarter of 2008, we received the Environmental Impact Technical Section Complete Letter from the FDA.

&#160;

2) Target Animal Safety: During the second quarter of 2012, we received the Target Animal Safety Technical Section Complete Letter from the FDA.

&#160;

3) Effectiveness: During the third quarter of 2012, we received the Effectiveness Technical Section Complete Letter from the FDA. The draft product label carries claims for the treatment of subclinical mastitis associated with Streptococcus agalactiae , Streptococcus dysgalactiae , Streptococcus uberis , and coagulase-negative staphylococci in lactating dairy cattle.

&#160;

4) Human Food Safety (HFS): The HFS Technical Section submission was made during the fourth quarter of 2010. This Technical Section includes several subsections such as: a) toxicology, b) total metabolism, c) effects of drug residues in food on human intestinal microbiology, d) effects on bacteria of human health concern (antimicrobial resistance) and e) pivotal residue chemistry. During the second quarter of 2011, we announced that the FDA had accepted the subsections described above and granted Mast Out &#210; a zero milk discard period and a zero meat withhold period during and after treatment. Before we can obtain this Technical Section Complete Letter, we must transfer our analytical method that measures Nisin residues in milk to a government laboratory. Due to unexpected regulatory demands and review delays, completion of the HFS Technical Section is currently anticipated during the middle of 2017. 

&#160;

5) Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC): Obtaining FDA approval of the CMC Technical Section defines the critical path to FDA approval and to initial commercial sales. During the third quarter of 2014, we completed an investment in facility modifications and processing equipment necessary to produce the Drug Substance (the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient, which is our pharmaceutical-grade Nisin) at small-scale. This small-scale facility has been used to i) test for and define the minor impurities in the Drug Substance, ii) establish the equivalence of the Drug Substance produced in this facility to the Drug Substance that was used in our pivotal batches for all clinical studies, iii) optimize process yields and iv) verify the cost of production. We believe these efforts will reduce risk as we invest in a commercial-scale production facility. We may make a first submission of the CMC Technical Section based on results from small-scale production batches to establish a path with the FDA, knowing that it will not be accepted as complete until we submit commercial-scale data.

The construction of and the financing for the commercial-scale Drug Substance production facility is the most critical action in front of us on our path to regulatory approval. Our initial plan was to have the Drug Substance produced for us under a Development and Manufacturing Agreement with Lonza Sales, Ltd. of Basel, Switzerland, in order to avoid the investment in a manufacturing facility. By the end of 2011, we determined that the required minimum volumes were too large to permit efficient, continuous production and that the cost of goods under this contract would not be commercially feasible. This contract was terminated during the fourth quarter of 2014 by mutual consent. We presented this product development opportunity to a variety of large and small animal health companies. During the second quarter of 2013, we received a non-refundable $250,000 exclusive license option fee from a prospective partner that considered manufacturing the Drug Substance in a plant of its own. During the third quarter of 2013, this prospective partner decided not to execute a development and marketing license because it had determined that, in its opinion, it could not cost-effectively commercialize the product. While such a corporate partnership could have allowed us to avoid the large investment in a commercial-scale production facility, it would have taken a large share of the gross margin from product sales. We are encouraged by the regulatory and marketing feedback from prospective partners, following their due diligence, that our novel mastitis treatment can achieve FDA approval and have a significant, positive impact on the dairy industry.

&#160;

We acquired land nearby to our existing Portland facility for this facility during the fourth quarter of 2015. During the first quarter of 2016, we raised equity financing and signed a bank debt commitment letter aggregating approximately $9.8 million. We are now preparing to construct our own facility for the commercial-scale production of the Drug Substance. We have estimated the cost to complete this project to be approximately $17,500,000. If we complete the construction and equipping of the Drug Substance facility during 2017, we could make the first commercial-scale CMC Technical Section submission to the FDA during late 2017 or 2018. It is common for the CMC Technical Section submission to require two, six-month review periods by the FDA.

&#160;

We are party to a long-term, exclusive supply agreement with Plas-Pak Inc. of Norwich, Connecticut covering the proprietary syringe that was developed specifically for treating cows with Mast Out &#210; . These syringes were used for all pivotal studies of Mast Out &#210; . During the fourth quarter of 2015, this contract was extended through December 31, 2020.

&#160;

Since 2010, we have been party to long-term, exclusive Contract Manufacture Agreement with Norbrook Laboratories Limited of Newry, Northern Ireland, an FDA-approved Drug Product (filled and packaged syringes) manufacturer, covering the formulating and sterile-filling of the Drug Substance into Drug Product for Mast Out &#210; . Norbrook provided these services for clinical material used in all pivotal studies of Mast Out &#210; . During the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into a revised agreement with Norbrook covering the final development and commercial-scale (but not at small-scale) launch of Mast Out &#210; after FDA approval. This means we would no longer seek FDA approval at small-scale, which would not have provided inventory for significant commercial sales.

&#160;

6) Administrative Submission: After obtaining the final Technical Section Complete Letter and after preparing materials responsive to other administrative requirements, the administrative NADA submission will be assembled for review by the FDA. This final administrative submission is subject to a statutory sixty-day review period. We will continue to provide detailed disclosures about the current status of this drug development process in our periodic filings with the SEC.

&#160;

In addition to our work on Mast Out &#210; , we are actively developing further improvements, extensions or additions to our current First Defense &#174; product line. For example, we currently are developing treatments that could prevent calf scours caused by enteric pathogens in addition to E. coli K99 and bovine coronavirus (the current disease claims for First Defense &#174; ). In connection with that effort, during the second quarter of 2009 we entered into an exclusive license with the Baylor College of Medicine covering the underlying rotavirus vaccine technology used to generate the specific antibodies. This perpetual license (if not terminated for cause) is subject to milestone and royalty payments. If approved by the USDA, this would be the first passive antibody product on the market with disease claims against the three leading causes of calf scours, E. coli , coronavirus and rotavirus. Results from pilot studies completed during the first quarter of 2009 justified continued product development. We initiated a second pivotal effectiveness study at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine during the second quarter of 2014 and announced positive effectiveness results from this pivotal study during the first quarter of 2015. During the third quarter of 2015, we obtained concurrence from the USDA that we have been granted disease claims against bovine rotavirus. We are working to complete the other laboratory and manufacturing objectives required for product license approval. This could position us to achieve product licensure and market launch in 2017. At the same time, we are working to expand our product development pipeline of bacteriocins that can be used as alternatives to traditional antibiotics. During the second quarter of 2015, we entered into an exclusive option agreement to license new bacteriocin technology from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. This technology focuses on bacteriocins having activity against Gram-negative infections for use in combating mastitis in dairy cattle. Subject to the availability of needed financial and other resources, we intend to begin new development projects that are aligned with our core competencies and market focus. We also remain interested in acquiring, on suitable terms, other new products and technologies that fit with our sales focus on the dairy and beef industries.

Competition 

&#160;

Our competition in the animal health market includes other biotechnology companies and major animal health companies. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and human resources and more extensive product development capabilities than we do.

&#160;

We would consider any company that sells an antibiotic to treat mastitis, such as Zoetis (formerly Pfizer Animal Health, a division of Pfizer, Inc.), Merck Animal Health and Boehringer Ingelheim, to be among the potential competitors for Mast Out &#210; . We expect the FDA to grant a period of five years of market exclusivity for Mast Out &#210; (meaning the FDA would not grant approval to a second NADA with the same active drug for a period of five years after the first NADA approval is granted) under Section 512(c)(2)F of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

&#160;

Zoetis, Elanco Animal Health (a division of Eli Lilly and Company) and Boehringer Ingelheim sell products that compete directly with First Defense &#210; in preventing scours via oral delivery to newborn calves. Zoetis sells a modified-live virus, vaccine product (Calf-Guard &#174; ) for use in the prevention of scours in newborn calves, but we know that newborn calves respond poorly to vaccines and that the immune system must be given time to develop a response to vaccines. Like First Defense &#210; , Calf-Guard &#174; carries a claim against coronavirus infections, but this product does not carry a claim against E. coli infections like First Defense &#210; does. Calf-Guard &#174; carries a claim against rotavirus that First Defense &#210; does not currently carry. First Defense &#210; is priced at a premium to Calf-Guard &#174; . It is common practice to delay colostrum feeding when dosing a calf with Calf-Guard &#174; so that the antibodies in the colostrum do not inactivate the vaccine product. In contrast, we encourage the feeding of four quarts of high quality colostrum immediately after birth when dosing a calf with First Defense &#210; , which is standard practice for good calf health. Because the antibodies in First Defense &#210; would likely work to inactivate a modified-live vaccine, rendering it useless or less useful, our product label historically included a precaution that First Defense &#210; should not be used within five days of such a vaccine. During the first quarter of 2015, the USDA granted us permission to remove this precaution from our label because our product is compatible with the feeding of antibodies from colostrum. We believe that this precaution should be required on the Calf-Guard &#174; label to prevent inactivation of that product by First Defense &#210; or colostrum. The Elanco product (Bovine Ecolizer &#210; + C20) was acquired through Elanco&#8217;s January 2015 acquisition of Novartis Animal Health and carries claims to prevent scours in newborn calves caused by E. Coli and Clostridium perfringens . We also compete for market share against a Boehringer Ingelheim product (Bar-Guard-99&#8482;). This product carries claims to prevent scours in newborn calves caused by E. coli . These latter two products are both derived from equine serum in contrast to the bovine colostrum used for First Defense &#210; . Equine antibodies are less efficiently absorbed into the bloodstream, so fewer antibodies are re-secreted for additional protection.

&#160;

There are several other products on the market, some with claims and some without, that are delivered to newborn calves to prevent scours. We believe that First Defense &#210; offers two significant competitive advantages over these other USDA-approved scours preventatives. First, First Defense &#210; is the only product that provides protection against both E. coli and coronavirus, the two leading causes of calf scours. Second, First Defense &#210; , being derived from colostrum, offers Immediate Immunity TM through antibodies that function both at the gut level and are absorbed into the blood stream for future protection. To complement this, First Defense &#210; is easier to use, requires no mixing or refrigeration, and can be administered without delaying maternal colostrum.

&#160;

First Defense &#174; competes against scours vaccines sold by Zoetis and Merck that are given to the dam (mother cow) to increase her production of antibodies that can then be transferred through her colostrum to the calf. Despite the best-managed dam vaccine program, colostrum quality is naturally variable and newborn calves do not always get the antibodies they need from maternal colostrum. We believe that the guaranteed dose of antibodies in First Defense &#210; provides more consistent protection than such vaccine products.

&#160;

There are many products on the market that may be used in place of Wipe Out &#210; Dairy Wipes , and our product sells at a premium to most of them. These products include teat dips, teat sprays and other disposable and washable towel products offered by several different companies. Competitive advantages of Wipe Out &#210; Dairy Wipes include that they are convenient to use, they do not irritate the udder and they do not adulterate the milk. Our product is differentiated from most others as the One Step Cow Prep &#210; because a second drying process is not required when using our product.

&#160;

We may not be aware of competition that we face, or may face in the future, from other companies. Our competitive position will be highly influenced by our ability to attract and retain key scientific and managerial personnel, to develop proprietary technologies and products, to obtain USDA or FDA approval for new products, to effectively promote and market our products, to have available properly licensed, efficient and effective raw material and finished product manufacturing resources and to continue to profitably sell our current products. We currently compete on the basis of product performance, price and distribution capability. We continue to monitor our network of independent distributors to maintain our competitive position.

&#160; 

Patents, Proprietary Information and Trademarks 

&#160;

In connection with the December 1999 acquisition of Wipe Out &#210; Dairy Wipes and the April 2000 license to all veterinary applications of Nisin from Nutrition 21, Inc., we acquired a license to six patents. In November 2004, we bought out certain future milestone and royalty obligations under the 1999 and 2000 licenses, which principally resulted in a fully paid, perpetual license related to the animal health applications of Nisin. Five of these six patents have expired. In 2004, we were issued U.S. Patent No. 6,794,181 entitled &#8220;Method of Purifying Lantibiotics&#8221; covering a manufacturing process for Drug Substance (pharmaceutical-grade Nisin).

&#160;

During 2000, we were issued U.S. Patent No. 6,074,689 entitled &#8220;Colonic Delivery of Protein or Peptide Compositions&#8221; covering the method of formulation that can be used to deliver proteins to the colon. In 1999, we acquired an exclusive license for pharmaceutical applications to U.S. Patent No. 5,773,000 entitled &#8220;Therapeutic Treatment of Clostridium difficile Associated Diseases&#8221; from GalaGen, Inc. In 2002, we acquired ownership of this patent from the court administering the bankruptcy proceedings of GalaGen. These patents are included in a royalty-bearing license we granted to Immuron, Ltd. (formerly known as Anadis) of Australia in 2008 for their use in the development of milk antibody products for humans.

&#160;

In the future, we may file additional patent applications for certain products under development. There can be no assurance that patents will be issued with respect to any pending or future applications. In some cases, we have chosen (and may choose in the future) not to seek patent protection for certain products or processes. Instead, we have sought (and may seek in the future) to maintain the confidentiality of any relevant proprietary technology through operational measures and contractual agreements.

&#160;

We have registered certain trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in connection with the sale of our products. We own federal trademark registrations of the following trademarks: ImmuCell; First Defense &#210; , our calf scours preventive product; Wipe Out &#210; Dairy Wipes and the related design and the trademark &#8220; One Step Cow Prep &#210; &#8221;, our pre-milking wipe product; and Mast Out &#210; , our mastitis treatment product under development. During the first quarter of 2015, we applied to register the following marks: Immediate Immunity&#8482; , First Defense Technology&#8482; and Your Calf Crew&#8482; .

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160;

We believe that we are in compliance with current regulatory requirements relating to our business and products. The manufacture and sale of animal health biologicals within the United States is generally regulated by the USDA. We have received USDA and Canadian Food Inspection Agency approval for First Defense &#210; . Mast Out &#210; is regulated by the FDA, Center for Veterinary Medicine, which regulates veterinary drugs. Regulations in the European Union will likely require that Mast Out &#210; be sold subject to a milk discard requirement in that territory, although the duration of the milk discard requirement may be shorter than the discard requirement applicable to competitive antibiotic products in that market. The manufacture of Wipe Out &#210; Dairy Wipes also is regulated by the FDA. Comparable agencies exist in foreign countries and foreign sales of our products will be subject to regulation by such agencies. Many countries have laws regulating the production, sale, distribution or use of biological products, and we may have to obtain approvals from regulatory authorities in countries in which we propose to sell our products. Depending upon the product and its applications, obtaining regulatory approvals may be a relatively brief and inexpensive procedure or it may involve extensive clinical tests, incurring significant expenses and an approval process of several years&#8217; duration. We generally rely on in-country experts to assist us with or to perform international regulatory applications.
