 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

General 

Kronos Worldwide, Inc. (NYSE: KRO) (Kronos), a Delaware corporation, is a leading global producer and marketer of value-added titanium dioxide pigments, or TiO 2 , a base industrial product used in a wide range of applications. We, along with our distributors and agents, sell and provide technical services for our products to approximately 4,000 customers in 100 countries with the majority of sales in Europe and North America. We believe we have developed considerable expertise and efficiency in the manufacture, sale, shipment and service of our products in domestic and international markets. 

TiO 2 is a white inorganic pigment used in a wide range of products for its exceptional durability and its ability to impart whiteness, brightness and opacity. TiO 2 is a critical component of everyday applications, such as coatings, plastics and paper, as well as many specialty products such as inks, food and cosmetics. TiO 2 is widely considered to be superior to alternative white pigments in large part due to its hiding power (or opacity), which is the ability to cover or mask other materials effectively and efficiently. TiO 2 is designed, marketed and sold based on specific end-use applications. 

TiO 2 is the largest commercially used whitening pigment because it has a high refractive rating, giving it more hiding power than any other commercially produced white pigment. In addition, TiO 2 has excellent resistance to interaction with other chemicals, good thermal stability and resistance to ultraviolet degradation. Although there are other white pigments on the market, we believe there are no effective substitutes for TiO 2 because no other white pigment has the physical properties for achieving comparable opacity and brightness or can be incorporated in as cost-effective a manner. Pigment extenders such as kaolin clays, calcium carbonate and polymeric opacifiers are used together with TiO 2 in a number of end-use markets. However, these products are not able to duplicate the opacity performance characteristics of TiO 2 and we believe these products are unlikely to have a significant impact on the use of TiO 2 . 

TiO 2 is considered a &#8220;quality-of-life&#8221; product. Demand for TiO 2 has generally been driven by worldwide gross domestic product and has generally increased with rising standards of living in various regions of the world. According to industry estimates, TiO 2 consumption has grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 3.0% since 1990. Per capita consumption of TiO 2 in Western Europe and the United States far exceeds that in other areas of the world, and these regions are expected to continue to be the largest consumers of TiO 2 on a per capita basis. We believe that Western Europe and North America currently account for approximately 20% and 18% of global TiO 2 consumption, respectively. Markets for TiO 2 are generally increasing in South America, Eastern Europe, the Asia Pacific region and China and we believe these are significant markets where we expect continued growth as economies in these regions continue to develop and quality-of-life products, including TiO 2 , experience greater demand. 

At December 31, 2015, approximately 50% of our common stock was owned by Valhi, Inc. (NYSE: VHI) and approximately 30% was owned by NL Industries, Inc. (NYSE: NL). Valhi also owns approximately 83% of NL Industries&#8217; outstanding common stock. A wholly-owned subsidiary of Contran Corporation held approximately 93% of Valhi&#8217;s outstanding common stock. As discussed in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, Lisa K. Simmons and Serena Simmons Connelly may be deemed to control Contran, Valhi, NL and us.

Products and e nd-use m arkets 

Including our predecessors, we have produced and marketed TiO 2 in North America and Europe, our primary markets, for almost 100 years. We believe that we are the largest producer of TiO 2 in Europe with approximately one-half of our sales volumes attributable to markets in Europe. The table below shows our market share for our significant markets, Europe and North America, for the last three years.

We believe we are the leading seller of TiO 2 in several countries, including Germany, with an estimated 9% share of worldwide TiO 2 sales volume in 2015. Overall, we are one of the top five producers of TiO 2 in the world.

We offer our customers a broad portfolio of products that include over 40 different TiO 2 pigment grades under the Kronos &#174; trademark, which provide a variety of performance properties to meet customers&#8217; specific requirements. Our major customers include domestic and international paint, plastics, decorative laminate and paper manufacturers. We ship TiO 2 to our customers in either a powder or slurry form via rail, truck and/or ocean carrier. Sales of our core TiO 2 pigments represented approximately 90% of our net sales in 2015. We and our agents and distributors primarily sell our products in three major end-use markets: coatings, plastics and paper. 

The following tables show our approximate TiO 2 sales volume by geographic region and end use for the year ended December 31, 2015:

Some of the principal applications for our products include the following. 

TiO 2 for coatings - Our TiO 2 is used to provide opacity, durability, tinting strength and brightness in industrial coatings, as well as coatings for commercial and residential interiors and exteriors, automobiles, aircraft, machines, appliances, traffic paint and other special purpose coatings. The amount of TiO 2 used in coatings varies widely depending on the opacity, color and quality desired. In general, the higher the opacity requirement of the coating, the greater the TiO 2 content. 

TiO 2 for plastics - We produce TiO 2 pigments that improve the optical and physical properties in plastics, including whiteness and opacity. TiO 2 is used to provide opacity in items such as containers and packaging materials, and vinyl products such as windows, door profiles and siding. TiO 2 also generally provides hiding power, neutral undertone, brightness and surface durability for housewares, appliances, toys, computer cases and food packages. TiO 2 &#8217;s high brightness along with its opacity, is used in some engineering plastics to help mask their undesirable natural color. TiO 2 is also used in masterbatch, which is a concentrate of TiO 2 and other additives and is one of the largest uses for TiO 2 in the plastics end-use market. In masterbatch, the TiO 2 is dispersed at high concentrations into a plastic resin and is then used by manufacturers of plastic containers, bottles, packaging and agricultural films. 

TiO 2 for paper - Our TiO 2 is used in the production of several types of paper, including laminate (decorative) paper, filled paper and coated paper to provide whiteness, brightness, opacity and color stability. Although we sell our TiO 2 to all segments of the paper end-use market, our primary focus is on the TiO 2 grades used in paper laminates, where several layers of paper are laminated together using melamine resin under high temperature and pressure. The top layer of paper contains TiO 2 and plastic resin and is the layer that is printed with decorative patterns. Paper laminates are used to replace materials such as wood and tile for such applications as 

&#160;

counter tops, furniture and wallboard. TiO 2 is beneficial in these applications because it assists in preventing the material from fading or changing color after prolonged exposure to sunlight and other weathering agents. 

TiO 2 for other applications - We produce TiO 2 to improve the opacity and hiding power of printing inks. TiO 2 allows inks to achieve very high print quality while not interfering with the technical requirements of printing machinery, including low abrasion, high printing speed and high temperatures. Our TiO 2 is also used in textile applications where TiO 2 functions as an opacifying and delustering agent. In man-made fibers such as rayon and polyester, TiO 2 corrects an otherwise undesirable glossy and translucent appearance. Without the presence of TiO 2 , these materials would be unsuitable for use in many textile applications. 

We produce high purity sulfate process anatase TiO 2 used to provide opacity, whiteness and brightness in a variety of cosmetic and personal care products, such as skin cream, lipstick, eye shadow and toothpaste. Our TiO 2 is also found in food products, such as candy and confectionaries, and in pet foods where it is used to obtain uniformity of color and appearance. In pharmaceuticals, our TiO 2 is used commonly as a colorant in pill and capsule coatings as well as in liquid medicines to provide uniformity of color and appearance. Kronos &#174; purified anatase grades meet the applicable requirements of the CTFA (Cosmetics, Toiletries and Fragrances Association), USP and BP (United States Pharmacopoeia and British Pharmacopoeia) and the FDA (United States Food and Drug Administration). 

Our TiO 2 business is enhanced by the following three complementary businesses, which comprised approximately 10% of our net sales in 2015: 

&#160;

&#183; 

We own and operate two ilmenite mines in Norway pursuant to a governmental concession with an unlimited term. Ilmenite is a raw material used directly as a feedstock by some sulfate-process TiO 2 plants. We believe that we have a significant competitive advantage because our mines supply our feedstock requirements for all of our European sulfate-process plants. We also sell ilmenite ore to third parties, some of whom are our competitors, and we sell an ilmenite-based specialty product to the oil and gas industry. The mines have estimated ilmenite reserves that are expected to last at least 50 years. 

&#160;

&#183; 

We manufacture and sell iron-based chemicals, which are co-products and processed co-products of the sulfate and chloride process TiO 2 pigment production. These co-product chemicals are marketed through our Ecochem division and are primarily used as treatment and conditioning agents for industrial effluents and municipal wastewater as well as in the manufacture of iron pigments, cement and agricultural products. 

&#160;

&#183; 

We manufacture and sell titanium oxychloride and titanyl sulfate, which are side-stream specialty products from the production of TiO 2 . Titanium oxychloride is used in specialty applications in the formulation of pearlescent pigments, production of electroceramic capacitors for cell phones and other electronic devices. Titanyl sulfate productions are used in pearlescent pigments, natural gas pipe and other specialty applications. 

&#160;

Manufacturing, o perations and p rop erties 

We produce TiO 2 in two crystalline forms: rutile and anatase. Rutile TiO 2 is manufactured using both a chloride production process and a sulfate production process, whereas anatase TiO 2 is only produced using a sulfate production process. Manufacturers of many end-use applications can use either form, especially during periods of tight supply for TiO 2 . The chloride process is the preferred form for use in coatings and plastics, the two largest end-use markets. Due to environmental factors and customer considerations, the proportion of TiO 2 industry sales represented by chloride process pigments has increased relative to sulfate process pigments, and in 2015, chloride process production facilities represented approximately 49% of industry capacity. The sulfate process is preferred for use in selected paper products, ceramics, rubber tires, man-made fibers, food products and cosmetics. Once an intermediate TiO 2 pigment has been produced by either the chloride or sulfate process, it is &#8220;finished&#8221; into products with specific performance characteristics for particular end-use applications through proprietary processes involving various chemical surface treatments and intensive micronizing (milling). 

&#160;

&#183; 

Chloride process - The chloride process is a continuous process in which chlorine is used to extract rutile TiO 2 . The chloride process produces less waste than the sulfate process because much of the chlorine is recycled and feedstock bearing higher titanium content is used. The chloride process also has lower energy requirements and is less labor-intensive than the sulfate process, although the chloride process requires a higher-skilled labor force. The chloride process produces an intermediate base pigment with a wide range of properties. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Sulfate process - The sulfate process is a batch process in which sulfuric acid is used to extract the TiO 2 from ilmenite or titanium slag. After separation from the impurities in the ore (mainly iron), the TiO 2 is precipitated and calcined to form an intermediate base pigment ready for sale or can be upgraded through finishing treatments. 

We produced 528,000 metric tons of TiO 2 in 2015, up from the 511,000 metric tons we produced in 2014. Our production amounts include our share of the output produced by our TiO 2 manufacturing joint venture discussed below in &#8220;TiO 2 Manufacturing Joint Venture.&#8221; Our average production capacity utilization rates were approximately 86%, 92% and 95% of capacity in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Our production utilization rates in 2013 were impacted by the previously-reported lockout at our Canadian production facility that began in June 2013. We operated our Canadian plant at approximately 15% of the plant&#8217;s capacity with non-union management employees during the lockout. Our production rates in 2014 were also impacted by such lockout, as restart of production at the facility did not begin until February 2014. Our production rates in 2014 and in the first quarter of 2015 were also impacted by the implementation of certain productivity-enhancing improvement projects at other facilities, as well as necessary improvements to ensure continued compliance with our permit regulations, which resulted in longer-than-normal maintenance shutdowns in some instances.

We operate four TiO 2 plants in Europe (one in each of Leverkusen, Germany; Nordenham, Germany; Langerbrugge, Belgium; and Fredrikstad, Norway). In North America, we have a TiO 2 plant in Varennes, Quebec, Canada and, through the manufacturing joint venture described below in &#8220;TiO 2 Manufacturing Joint Venture,&#8221; a 50% interest in a TiO 2 plant in Lake Charles, Louisiana. 

Our production capacity in 2015 was 555,000 metric tons, approximately three-fourths of which was from the chloride production process.

(1) 

The Leverkusen facility is located within an extensive manufacturing complex owned by Bayer AG. We own the Leverkusen facility, which represents about one-third of our current TiO 2 production capacity, but we lease the land under the facility from Bayer under a long-term agreement which expires in 2050. Lease payments are periodically negotiated with Bayer for periods of at least two years at a time. A majority-owned subsidiary of Bayer provides some raw materials including chlorine, auxiliary and operating materials, utilities and services necessary to operate the Leverkusen facility under separate supplies and services agreements. 

(2) 

The Fredrikstad plant is located on public land and is leased until 2063.

(3) 

We operate the Lake Charles facility in a joint venture with Tioxide Americas LLC (Tioxide), a subsidiary of Huntsman Corporation and the amount indicated in the table above represents the share of TiO 2 produced by the joint venture to which we are entitled. See Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements and &#8220;TiO 2 Manufacturing Joint Venture.&#8221; 

We own the land underlying all of our principle production facilities unless otherwise indicated in the table above. 

Our production capacity has increased by approximately 12% over the past ten years due to debottlenecking programs, with only moderate capital expenditures. We believe that our annual attainable production capacity for 2016 is approximately 555,000 metric tons, and we currently expect our production capacity rate will be at near-capacity levels in 2016.

We also operate two ilmenite mines in Norway pursuant to a governmental concession with an unlimited term. In addition, we operate a rutile slurry manufacturing plant in Lake Charles, Louisiana, which converts dry pigment manufactured for us at the Lake Charles TiO 2 facility into a slurry form that is then shipped to customers. 

We have various corporate and administrative offices located in the U.S., Germany, Norway, Canada and Belgium and various sales offices located in the U.S., Canada, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. 

&#160;

TiO 2 Manufacturing Joint Venture 

Kronos Louisiana, Inc., one of our subsidiaries, and Tioxide each own a 50% interest in a manufacturing joint venture, Louisiana Pigment Company, L.P., or LPC. LPC owns and operates a chloride-process TiO 2 plant located in Lake Charles, Louisiana. We and Huntsman share production from the plant equally pursuant to separate offtake agreements, unless we and Huntsman otherwise agree (such as in 2015, when we purchased approximately 52% of the production from the plant). 

A supervisory committee directs the business and affairs of the joint venture, including production and output decisions. This committee is composed of four members, two of whom we appoint and two of whom Huntsman appoints. Two general managers manage the operations of the joint venture acting under the direction of the supervisory committee. We appoint one general manager and Huntsman appoints the other. 

The joint venture is not consolidated in our financial statements, because we do not control it. We account for our interest in the joint venture by the equity method. The joint venture operates on a break-even basis and therefore we do not have any equity in earnings of the joint venture. We are required to purchase one half of the TiO 2 produced by the joint venture. All costs and capital expenditures are shared equally with Huntsman with the exception of feedstock (purchased natural rutile ore or slag) and packaging costs for the pigment grades produced. Our share of net costs is reported as cost of sales as the TiO 2 is sold. See Notes 5 and 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Raw materials 

The primary raw materials used in chloride process TiO 2 are titanium-containing feedstock (purchased natural rutile ore or slag), chlorine and coke. Chlorine is available from a number of suppliers, while petroleum coke is available from a limited number of suppliers. Titanium-containing feedstock suitable for use in the chloride process is available from a limited but increasing number of suppliers principally in Australia, South Africa, Canada, India and the United States. We purchase chloride process grade slag from Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Limited under a long-term supply contract that expires at the end of 2018, subject to two-year renewal periods if both parties agree. We also purchase upgraded slag from Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Limited under a long-term supply contract that expires at the end of 2019. We purchase natural rutile ore under contracts primarily from Iluka Resources, Limited and Sierra Rutile Limited, all of which expire in 2016. In the past we have been, and we expect that we will continue to be, successful in obtaining short-term and long-term extensions to these and other existing supply contracts prior to their expiration. We expect the raw materials purchased under these contracts, and contracts that we may enter into, will meet our chloride process feedstock requirements over the next several years. 

The primary raw materials used in sulfate process TiO 2 are titanium-containing feedstock, primarily ilmenite or purchased sulfate grade slag and sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid is available from a number of suppliers. Titanium-containing feedstock suitable for use in the sulfate process is available from a limited number of suppliers principally in Norway, Canada, Australia, India and South Africa. As one of the few vertically-integrated producers of sulfate process TiO 2 , we operate two rock ilmenite mines in Norway, which provided all of the feedstock for our European sulfate process TiO 2 plants in 2015. We expect ilmenite production from our mines to meet our European sulfate process feedstock requirements for the foreseeable future. For our Canadian sulfate process plant, we purchase sulfate grade slag primarily from Rio Tinto Fer et Titane Inc. under a supply contract that renews annually, subject to termination upon twelve months written notice. We expect the raw materials purchased under these contracts, and contracts that we may enter into, to meet our sulfate process feedstock requirements over the next several years. 

Many of our raw material contracts contain fixed quantities we are required to purchase, or specify a range of quantities within which we are required to purchase. The pricing under these agreements is generally negotiated quarterly.

Sales and marketing 

Our marketing strategy is aimed at developing and maintaining strong customer relationships with new and existing accounts. Because TiO 2 represents a significant raw material cost for our customers, the purchasing decisions are often made by our customers&#8217; senior management. We work to maintain close relationships with the key decision makers, through in-depth and frequent in-person meetings. We endeavor to extend these commercial and technical relationships to multiple levels within our customers&#8217; organization using our direct sales force and technical service group to accomplish this objective. We believe this has helped build customer loyalty to Kronos and strengthened our competitive position. Close cooperation and strong customer relationships enable us to stay closely attuned to trends in our customers&#8217; businesses. Where appropriate, we work in conjunction with our customers to solve formulation or application problems by modifying specific product properties or developing new pigment grades. We also focus our sales and marketing efforts on those geographic and end-use market segments where we believe we can realize higher selling prices. This focus includes continuously reviewing and optimizing our customer and product portfolios. 

Our marketing strategy is also aimed at working directly with customers to monitor the success of our products in their end-use applications, evaluate the need for improvements in product and process technology and identify opportunities to develop new product solutions for our customers. Our marketing staff closely coordinates with our sales force and technical specialists to ensure that the needs of our customers are met, and to help develop and commercialize new grades where appropriate. 

We sell a majority of our products through our direct sales force operating from six sales offices in Europe and one sales office in North America. We also utilize sales agents and distributors who are authorized to sell our products in specific geographic areas. In Europe, our sales efforts are conducted primarily through our direct sales force and our sales agents. Our agents do not sell any TiO 2 products other than Kronos &#174; brand products. In North America, our sales are made primarily through our direct sales force and supported by a network of distributors. In addition to our direct sales force and sales agents, many of our sales agents also act as distributors to service our smaller customers in all regions. We offer customer and technical service to the customers who purchase our products through distributors as well as to our larger customers serviced by our direct sales force. 

We sell to a diverse customer base with only one customer representing 10% or more of our sales in 2015 (Behr Process Corporation &#8211; 10%). Our largest ten customers accounted for approximately 34% of sales in 2015. 

Neither our business as a whole nor any of our principal product groups is seasonal to any significant extent. However, TiO 2 sales are generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year, due in part to the increase in paint production in the spring to meet demand during the spring and summer painting seasons. With certain exceptions, we have historically operated our production facilities at near full capacity rates throughout the entire year, which among other things helps to minimize our per-unit production costs. As a result, we normally will build inventories during the first and fourth quarters of each year, in order to maximize our product availability during the higher demand periods normally experienced in the second and third quarters. 

&#160;

Competition 

The TiO 2 industry is highly competitive. We compete primarily on the basis of price, product quality, technical service and the availability of high performance pigment grades. Since TiO 2 is not a traded commodity, its pricing is largely a product of negotiation between suppliers and their respective customers. Although certain TiO 2 grades are considered specialty pigments, the majority of our grades and substantially all of our production are considered commodity pigments with price and availability being the most significant competitive factors along with quality and customer service. During 2015, we had an estimated 9% share of worldwide TiO 2 sales volume, and based on sales volumes, we believe we are the leading seller of TiO 2 in several countries, including Germany. 

Our principal competitors are The Chemours Company, or Chemours (which was spun-off from E.I. du Pont de Nemours &#38; Co. into a separate publicly-traded company in 2015); Millennium Inorganic Chemicals, Inc. (a subsidiary of National Titanium Dioxide Company Ltd.), or Cristal; Huntsman Corporation; and Tronox Incorporated. The top five TiO 2 producers (i.e. we and our four principal competitors) account for approximately 56% of the world&#8217;s production capacity. Huntsman completed its purchase of the TiO 2 business of Sachtleben Chemie GmbH in 2014, and has also announced its intent to exit the TiO 2 business by December 31, 2016. In February 2015, Huntsman announced a plan to reduce its TiO 2 capacity by approximately 100,000 metric tons at one of its European sulfate process facilities. In August 2015, Chemours announced plans to close its plant in Delaware and shut down a production line at its facility in Tennessee, reducing its overall capacity by approximately 150,000 metric tons. 

The following chart shows our estimate of worldwide production capacity in 2015:

Chemours has over one-half of total North American TiO 2 production capacity and is our principal North American competitor. 

Over the past ten years, we and our competitors increased industry capacity through debottlenecking projects, which in part compensated for the shut-down of various TiO 2 plants in France, the United States, the United Kingdom and China. Chemours has announced the scheduled production start-up of a 200,000 metric ton line at its plant in Mexico in mid-2016. Although overall industry demand is expected to be generally higher in 2016 as compared to 2015 as a result of improving worldwide economic conditions, we do not expect any other significant efforts will be undertaken by us or our principal competitors to further increase capacity for the foreseeable future, other than through debottlenecking projects. If actual developments differ from our expectations, the TiO 2 industry&#8217;s performance and that of our own could be unfavorably affected. 

The TiO 2 industry is characterized by high barriers to entry consisting of high capital costs, proprietary technology and significant lead times (typically three to five years in our experience) required to construct new facilities or to expand existing capacity. We believe it is unlikely any new TiO 2 plants will be constructed in Europe or North America in the foreseeable future. 

&#160;

Research and d evelopment 

We employ scientists, chemists, process engineers and technicians who are engaged in research and development, process technology and quality assurance activities in Leverkusen, Germany. These individuals have the responsibility for improving our chloride and sulfate production processes, improving product quality and strengthening our competitive position by developing new applications. Our expenditures for these activities were approximately $18 million in 2013, $19 million in 2014 and $16 million in 2015. We expect to spend approximately $14 million on research and development in 2016. 

We continually seek to improve the quality of our grades and have been successful at developing new grades for existing and new applications to meet the needs of our customers and increase product life cycles. Since 2010, we have added seven new grades for pigments and other applications. 

Patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights 

We have a comprehensive intellectual property protection strategy that includes obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our patents, primarily in the United States, Canada and Europe. We also protect our trademark and trade secret rights and have entered into license agreements with third parties concerning various intellectual property matters. We have also from time to time been involved in disputes over intellectual property. 

Patents - We have obtained patents and have numerous patent applications pending that cover our products and the technology used in the manufacture of our products. Our patent strategy is important to us and our continuing business activities. In addition to maintaining our patent portfolio, we seek patent protection for our technical developments, principally in the United States, Canada and Europe. U.S. Patents are generally in effect for 20 years from the date of filing. Our U.S. patent portfolio includes patents having remaining terms ranging from one year to 19 years. 

Trademarks and trade secrets - Our trademarks, including Kronos &#174; , are covered by issued and/or pending registrations, including in Canada and the United States. We protect the trademarks that we use in connection with the products we manufacture and sell and have developed goodwill in connection with our long-term use of our trademarks. We conduct research activities in secret and we protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets through reasonable measures, including confidentiality agreements and security procedures, including data security. We rely upon unpatented proprietary knowledge and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our proprietary chloride production process is an important part of our technology and our business could be harmed if we fail to maintain confidentiality of our trade secrets used in this technology.

Certain employees at each of our production facilities are organized by labor unions. In Europe, our union employees are covered by master collective bargaining agreements for the chemical industry that are generally renewed annually. In Canada, our union employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires in June 2018. At December 31, 2015, approximately 87% of our worldwide workforce is organized under collective bargaining agreements. It is possible that there could be future work stoppages or other labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

Regulatory and e nvironmental m atters 

Our operations and properties are governed by various environmental laws and regulations, which are complex, change frequently and have tended to become stricter over time. These environmental laws govern, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water; and the health and safety of our employees. Certain of our operations are, or have been, engaged in the generation, storage, handling, manufacture or use of substances or compounds that may be considered toxic or hazardous within the meaning of applicable environmental laws and regulations. As with other companies engaged in similar businesses, certain of our past and current operations and products have the potential to cause environmental or other damage. We have implemented and continue to implement various policies and programs in an effort to minimize these risks. Our policy is to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations at all our facilities and to strive to improve our environmental performance. It is possible that future developments, such as stricter requirements in environmental laws and enforcement policies, could adversely affect our operations, including production, handling, use, storage, transportation, sale or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or require us to make capital and other expenditures to comply, and could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations or liquidity. 

Our U.S. manufacturing operations are governed by federal, state and local environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations. These include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, or CERCLA, as well as the state counterparts of these statutes. Some of these laws hold current or previous owners or operators of real property liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination, even if these owners or operators did not know of, and were not responsible for, such contamination. These laws also assess liability on any person who arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances, regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person. Although we have not incurred and do not currently anticipate any material liabilities in connection with such environmental laws, we may be required to make expenditures for environmental remediation in the future. 

While the laws regulating operations of industrial facilities in Europe vary from country to country, a common regulatory framework is provided by the European Union, or the EU. Germany and Belgium are members of the EU and follow its initiatives. Norway is not a member but generally patterns its environmental regulatory actions after the EU. 

At our sulfate plant facilities in Germany, we recycle spent sulfuric acid either through contracts with third parties or at our own facilities. In addition, at our German locations we have a contract with a third-party to treat certain sulfate-process effluents. At our Norwegian plant, we ship spent acid to a third party location where it is used as a neutralization agent. These contracts may be terminated by either party after giving three or four years advance notice, depending on the contract. 

From time to time, our facilities may be subject to environmental regulatory enforcement under U.S. and non-U.S. statutes. Typically we establish compliance programs to resolve these matters. Occasionally, we may pay penalties. To date such penalties have not involved amounts having a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. We believe that all of our facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws. 

Our capital expenditures related to ongoing environmental compliance, protection and improvement programs, including capital expenditures which are primarily focused on increased operating efficiency but also result in improved environmental protection such as lower emissions from our manufacturing facilities, were $6.9 million in 2015 and are currently expected to be approximately $9 million in 2016.
