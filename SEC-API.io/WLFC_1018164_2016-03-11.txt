 ITEM 1. BUSINES S 

&#160; 

INTRODUCTION 

&#160; 

Willis Lease Finance Corporation with its subsidiaries is a leading lessor of commercial aircraft engines. Our principal business objective is to build value for our shareholders by acquiring commercial aircraft engines and managing those engines in order to provide a return on investment, primarily through lease rent and maintenance reserve revenues, as well as through management fees earned for managing aircraft engines owned by other parties. As of December 31, 201 5 , we had a total lease portfolio consisting of 20 1 engines and related equipment, 10 aircraft and 5 spare parts packages with 8 5 lessees in 4 6 countries and an aggregate net book value of $1,122.9 million. As of December 31, 201 5 , we managed a total lease portfolio of 4 0 engines and related equipment for other parties. We also seek, from time to time, to act as a leasing agent of engines for other parties. In 2013, we launched Willis Aeronautical Services, Inc. (&#8220; Willis Aero &#8221;) , a wholly-owned subsidiary, whose primary focus is the sale of aircraft engine parts and materials through the acquisition or consignment from third parties of aircraft and engines. 

&#160; 

We are a Delaware corporation, incorporated in 1996. Our executive offices are located at 773 San Marin Drive, Suite 2215, Novato, California 94998. We transact business directly and through our subsidiaries unless otherwise indicated. 

&#160; 

We maintain a website at www.willislease.com where our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports are available without charge, as soon as reasonably practicable following the time they are filed with or furnished to the SEC. You may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC&#8217;s public reference room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0300. The SEC also maintains an electronic Internet site that contains our reports, prox ies and information statements, and other information at http://www.sec.gov. 

&#160; 

We separate our business into two reportable segments, Equipment Leasing and Spare Parts Sales. Our business activities by reportable segment are described below. 

&#160; 

Equipment Leasing 

&#160; 

Our strategy is to lease aircraft engines and aircraft and provide related services to a diversified group of commercial aircraft operators and maintenance, repair and overhaul organizations (&#8220;MROs&#8221;) worldwide. Commercial aircraft operators need engines in addition to those installed on the aircraft that they operate. These spare engines are required for various reasons including requirements that engines be inspected and repaired at regular intervals based on equipment utilization. Furthermore, unscheduled events such as mechanical failure, FAA airworthiness directives or manufacturer-recommended actions for maintenance, repair and overhaul of engines result in the need for spare engines. Commercial aircraft operators and others in the industry generally estimate that the total number of spare engines needed is between 10% and 14% of the total number of installed engines. Today it is estimated that there are nearly 42,000 engines installed on commercial aircraft. Accordingly, we estimate that there are between 4,200 and 5,900 spare engines in the market, including both owned and leased spare engines. 

&#160; 

Our engine portfolio consists of noise-compliant Stage III commercial jet engines manufactured by CFMI, General Electric, Pratt &#38; Whitney, Rolls Royce and International Aero Engines. These engines generally may be used on one or more aircraft types and are the most widely used engines in the world, powering Airbus, Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, Bombardier and Embraer aircraft. 

&#160; 

The Company acquires engines for its leasing portfolio in a number of ways. It enters into sale and lease back transactions with operators of aircraft and providers of engine maintenance cost per hour services. We also purchase both new and used engines, on a speculative basis (i.e. without a lease attached from manufacturers or other parties which own such engines). 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Spare Parts Sales 

&#160; 

Our wholly owned subsidiary Willis Aero primarily engages in the sale of aircraft engine parts and materials through the acquisition or consignment from third parties of aircraft and engines. The launch of this business segment in November 2013 positioned our Company to provide end-of-life solutions for the growing supply of surplus aircraft and engines . With the establishment of Willis Aero , we are able to manage the full lifecycle of our lease assets, enhance the returns on our engine portfolio and create incremental value for our shareholders. 

&#160; 

THE WEST II SECURITIZATION 

&#160; 

Willis Engine Securitization Trust II, or &#8220;WEST II&#8221;, is a special-purpose, bankruptcy-remote, Delaware statutory trust that is wholly-owned by us and consolidated in our financial statements. We established WEST II in September 2012, when WEST II issued and sold $390 million aggregate principal amount of Class 2012-A Term Notes (the &#8220;Notes&#8221;) and received $384.9 million in net proceeds. We used these funds, net of transaction expenses and swap termination costs, together with our revolving credit facility, to pay off the prior Will i s Engine Securitization Trust, or &#8220;WEST&#8221; notes totaling $435.9 million. At closing, the net book values of 22 engines were pledged as collateral from WEST to the Company&#8217;s revolving credit facility, which provided the remaining funds to pay off the WEST notes. The assets and liabilities of WEST II will remain on the Company&#8217;s balance sheet. A portfolio of 63 commercial jet aircraft engines and leases thereof secures the obligations of WEST II. 

&#160; 

WEST II&#8217;s obligations under these notes are serviced by revenues from the lease and disposition of its engines, and are secured by all of its assets, including all of its interests in its engines, its subsidiaries, restricted cash accounts, engine maintenance reserve accounts, all proceeds from the sale or disposition of engines, and all insurance proceeds. We have not guaranteed any obligations of WEST II and no assets outside of the WEST II trust secure such obligations. 

&#160; 

We are the servicer and administrative agent for WEST II. Our annual fees for these services are 11.5% as servicer and 2.0% as administrative agent of the aggregate net rents actually received by WEST II on its engines, and such fees are payable to us monthly. We are also paid a fee of 3.0% of the net proceeds from the sale of any engines. As WEST II is consolidated in our financial statements these fees eliminate in consolidation. Proceeds from engine sales will be used, at WEST II&#8217;s election, to reduce WEST II&#8217;s debt or to acquire other engines. 

&#160; 

WEST II gives us the flexibility to manage the portfolio to adapt to changes in aircraft fleets and customer demand over time, benefiting both us and our investors. The asset-backed securitization is well suited to our engine leasing business as it provides long term capital in which debt maturity is better matche d &#160; to our long term asset lives . 

&#160; 

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND - THE DEMAND FOR LEASED AIRCRAFT ENGINES 

&#160; 

Historically, commercial aircraft operators owned rather than leased their spare engines. As engines become more powerful and technically sophisticated, they also become more expensive to acquire and maintain. In part due to cash constraints on commercial aircraft operators and the costs associated with engine ownership, commercial aircraft operators have become more cost-conscious and now utilize operating leases for a portion of their spare engines and are therefore better able to manage their finances in this capital-intensive business. Engine leasing is a specialized business that has evolved into a discrete sector of the commercial aviation market. Participants in this sector need access to capital, as well as specialized technical knowledge, in order to compete successfully. 

&#160; 

Growth in the spare engine leasing industry is dependent on two fundamental drivers: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the number of commercial aircraft, and therefore engines, in the market; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the proportion of engines that are leased, rather than owned, by commercial aircraft operators. 

&#160; 

We believe both drivers will increase over time. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Increased number of aircraft, and therefore engines, in the market 

&#160; 

We believe that the number of commercial and cargo aircraft, and hence spare engines, will increase. Boeing estimates that there are roughly 2 2 ,000 aircraft as of 201 4 and projects this will grow to approximately 4 4 ,000 aircraft by 203 4 . Aircraft equipment manufacturers have predicted such an increase in aircraft to address the rapid growth of both passenger and cargo traffic in the Asian markets, as well as demand for new aircraft in more mature markets. 

&#160; 

Increased lease penetration rate 

&#160; 

Spare engines provide support for installed engines in the event of routine or other engine maintenance or unscheduled removal. The number of spare engines needed to service any fleet is determined by many factors. These factors include: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the number and type of aircraft in an aircraft operator&#8217;s fleet; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the geographic scope of such aircraft operator&#8217;s destinations; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the time an engine is on-wing between removals; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

average shop visit time; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the number of spare engines an aircraft operator requires in order to ensure coverage for predicted and unscheduled removals. 

&#160; 

We believe that commercial aircraft operators are increasingly considering their spare engines as significant capital assets, where operating leases may be more attractive than capital leases or ownership of spare engines. Some believe that currently as many as 35% to 40% of the spare engine market falls under the category of leased engines. Industry analysts have forecast that the percentage of leased engines is likely to increase over the next 15 years as engine leasing follows the growth of aircraft leasing. We believe this is due to the increasing cost of newer engines, the anticipated modernization of the worldwide aircraft fleet and the significant cost associated therewith, and the emergence of new niche-focused airlines which generally use leasing in order to obtain their capital assets. 

&#160; 

ENGINE LEASING 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 201 5 , all of our leases to air carriers, manufacturers and MROs are operating leases as opposed to finance leases. Under operating leases, we retain the potential benefit and assume the risk of the residual value of the aircraft equipment, in contrast to capital or financing leases where the lessee has more of the potential benefits and risks of ownership. Operating leases allow commercial aircraft operators greater fleet and financial flexibility due to the relatively small initial capital outlay necessary to obtain use of the aircraft equipment, and the availability of short and long term leases to better meet their needs. Operating lease rates are generally higher than finance lease rates, in part because of the risks associated with the residual value. 

&#160; 

We describe all of our current leases as &#8220;triple-net&#8221; operating leases. A triple-net operating lease requires the lessee to make the full lease payment and pay any other expenses associated with the use of the engines, such as maintenance, casualty and liability insurance, sales or use taxes and personal property taxes. The leases contain detailed provisions specifying the lessees&#8217; responsibility for engine damage, maintenance standards and the required condition of the engine upon return at the end of the lease. During the term of the lease, we generally require the lessee to maintain the engine in accordance with an approved maintenance program designed to meet applicable regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which the lessee operates. 

&#160; 

We try to mitigate risk where possible. For example, we make an analysis of the credit risk associated with the lessee before entering into any significant lease transaction. Our credit analysis generally consists of evaluating the prospective lessee&#8217;s financial standing by utilizing financial statements and trade and/or banking references. In certain 

&#160;

&#160; 

circumstances, we may require our lessees to provide additional credit support such as a letter of credit or a guaranty from a bank or a third party or a security deposit. We also evaluate insurance and expropriation risk and evaluate and monitor the political and legal climate of the country in which a particular lessee is located in order to determine our ability to repossess our engines should the need arise. Despite these guidelines, we cannot give assurance that we will not experience collection problems or significant losses in the future. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; below. 

&#160; 

At the commencement of a lease, we may collect, in advance, a security deposit normally equal to at least one month&#8217;s lease payment. The security deposit is returned to the lessee after all lease return conditions have been met. Under the terms of some of our leases, during the term of the lease, the lessees pay amounts to us based on usage of the engine, which is referred to as maintenance reserves or use fees, which are designed to cover the expected future maintenance costs. For those leases in which the maintenance reserves are reimbursable to the lessee, maintenance reserves are collected and are reimbursed to the lessee when qualifying maintenance is performed. Under longer-term leases, to the extent that cumulative use fee billings are inadequate to fund expenditures required prior to return of the engine to us, the lessee is obligated to cover the shortfall. Recovery is therefore dependent upon the financial condition of the lessee. 

&#160; 

During the lease period, our leases require that maintenance and inspection of the leased engines be performed at qualified maintenance facilities certified by the FAA or its foreign equivalent. In addition, when an engine becomes off-lease, it undergoes inspection to verify compliance with lease return conditions. Our management believes that our attention to our lessees and our emphasis on maintenance and inspection helps preserve residual values and generally helps us to recover our investment in our leased engines. 

&#160; 

Upon termination of a lease, we will lease, sell or part out the related engines. The demand for aftermarket engines for either sale or lease may be affected by a number of variables, including: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

general market conditions; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

regulatory changes (particularly those imposing environmental, maintenance and other requirements on the operation of engines); 

&#160; 

&#183; 

changes in demand for air travel; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

fuel costs; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

changes in the supply and cost of aircraft equipment; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

technological developments. 

&#160; 

The value of particular used engines varies greatly depending upon their condition, the maintenance services performed during the lease term and, as applicable, the number of hours or cycles remaining until the next major maintenance is required. If we are unable to lease or sell engines on favorable terms, our financial results and our ability to service debt may be adversely affected. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; below. 

&#160; 

The value of a particular model of engine is heavily dependent on the status of the types of aircraft on which it is installed. We believe values of engines tend to be stable so long as the host aircraft for the engines as well as the engines themselves are still being manufactured. Prices will also tend to remain stable and even rise after a host aircraft is no longer manufactured so long as there is sufficient demand for the host aircraft. However, the value of an engine begins to decline rapidly once the host aircraft begins to be retired from service and/or parted out in significant numbers. Values of engines also may decline because of manufacturing defects that may surface subsequently. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 201 5 , we had a total lease portfolio of 20 1 aircraft engines and related equipment, 5 spare parts packages, 10 aircraft and various parts and other engine-related equipment with a cost of $1, 4 39 .4 million in our lease portfolio. As of December 31, 2014, we had a total lease portfolio of 207 aircraft engines and related equipment, 5 

&#160;

&#160; 

spare parts packages, 5 aircraft and various parts and other engine-related equipment with a cost of $1,347.5 million in our lease portfolio. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 201 5 , minimum future rentals under non-cancelable operating leases of these engines, parts and aircraft assets were as follows:

&#160; 

As of December 31, 201 5 , we had 8 5 lessees of commercial aircraft engines, aircraft, and other aircraft-related equipment in 46 countries. We believe the loss of any one customer would not have a significant long-term adverse effect on our business. We operate in a global market in which our engines are easily transferable among lessees located in many countries, which stabilizes demand and allows us to recover from the loss of a particular customer. As a result, we do not believe we are dependent on a single customer or a few customers , the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our revenues. 

&#160; 

On May 25, 2011, we entered into an agreement with Mitsui &#38; Co., Ltd. to participate in a joint venture formed as a Dublin-based Irish limited company &#8212; Willis Mitsui &#38; Company Engine Support Limited (&#8220;WMES&#8221;) for the purpose of acquiring and leasing jet engines. Each partner holds a fifty percent interest in the joint venture. Our investment in the joint venture is $ 27. 3 million as of December 31, 201 5 . 

&#160; 

On June 3, 2014 we entered into an agreement with China Aviation Supplies Import &#38; Export Corporation Limited (&#8220;CASC&#8221;) to participate in a joint venture named CASC Willis Engine Lease Company Limited (&#8220;CASC Willis&#8221;), a new joint venture based in Shanghai, China. Each partner holds a fifty percent interest in the joint venture. In October 2014, we made a $15.0 million &#160; initial capital contribution representing the up-front funding for the new joint venture. The new company will acquire and lease jet engines to Chinese airlines and will concentrate on meeting the fast growing demand for leased commercial aircraft engines and aviation assets in the People&#8217;s Republic of China. CASC Willis owns a lease portfolio of 2 engines with a net book value of $39.5 million as of December 31, 2015. Our investment in the joint venture is $ 14.0 million as of December 31, 201 5 . 

&#160; 

AIRCRAFT LEASING 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 201 5 , we owned four Boeing 737 aircraft, f our ATR72-202 turboprop , and two &#160; Embraer E-190LR aircraft with an aggregate net book value of $ 112.6 million. 

&#160; 

Our aircraft leases are &#8220;triple-net&#8221; leases and the lessee is responsible for making the full lease payment and paying any other expenses associated with the use of the aircraft, such as maintenance, casualty and liability insurance, sales or use taxes and personal property taxes. In addition, the lessee is responsible for normal maintenance and repairs, engine and airframe overhauls, and compliance with return conditions of flight equipment on lease. Under the provisions of many leases, for certain engine and airframe overhauls, we reimburse the lessee for costs incurred up to but not exceeding maintenance reserves the lessee has paid to us. Maintenance reserves are designed to cover the expected maintenance costs. The lessee is also responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to the aircraft. We require our lessees to comply with FAA requirements. We periodically inspect our leased aircraft. Generally, we require a deposit as security for the lessee&#8217;s performance of obligations under the lease and the condition of the aircraft upon return. In addition, the leases contain extensive provisions regarding our remedies and rights in the event of a default by the lessee and specific provisions regarding the condition of the aircraft upon return. The lessee is required to continue to make lease payments under all circumstances, including periods during which the aircraft is not in operation due to maintenance or grounding. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Prior to September 18, 2013, we held a fifty percent membership interest in a joint venture, WOLF A340, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, (&#8220;WOLF&#8221;). On December 30, 2005, WOLF completed the purchase of two Airbus A340-313 aircraft from Boeing Aircraft Holding Company for a purchase price of $96.0 million. Since their purchase, these two aircraft had been leased to Emirates, with the leases terminating in March and May 2013. The return of both aircraft from the prior lessee, Emirates, was completed by June 2013, with the airframes being disassembled and parted out and the eight engines being marketed for lease separately to airline customers. 

&#160; 

On September 18, 2013, we completed the acquisition of the fifty percent membership interest held by the other joint venture partner in WOLF for a purchase price of $1.0 million, with the purchase price representing a $12.7 million discount from the JV partner&#8217;s equity interest. The transaction has been accounted for as an asset acquisition. We recorded the assets at the cost basis, which represents the allocation of our prior investment basis plus the cash paid to the third party investor. 

&#160; 

The purchase price was allocated to the eight aircraft engines and two airframes. The fair value of the net assets acquired from this transaction is estimated to be $12.6 million comprising $27.0 million of equipment, $1.6 million of cash and receivables, offset by $16.0 million of debt and other liabilities. As a result of the transaction, we now own one hundred percent of WOLF. The WOLF assets and liabilities and the results of operations have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of the acquisition date, September 18, 2013. 

&#160; 

SPARE PARTS SALES 

&#160; 

The sale of spare parts is managed by the Company&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiary, Willis Aero . Willis Aero primarily engages in the sale of aircraft engine parts and materials through the acquisition or consignment from third parties of aircraft and engines. The launch of this new business segment in November 2013 positioned our Company to provide end-of-life solutions for the growing supply of surplus aircraft and engines . With the establishment of Willis Aero , we are able to manage the full lifecycle of our lease assets, enhance the returns on our engine portfolio and create incremental value for our shareholders. As of December 31, 201 5 , spare parts inventory had a carrying value of $20.5 million. 

&#160; 

OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES 

&#160; 

We are uniquely positioned in the market and remain competitive, in part, due to the following advantages: 

&#183; 

We have an entrepreneurial culture and our size and independent ownership structure gives us a unique ability to move faster than our competition . We were founded in 1985 as a startup venture by our Chief Executive Officer, Charles F. Willis, IV, and we continue to foster an entrepreneurial attitude among our executives and employees. Unlike most other aircraft engine leasing companies, we are not tied to a particular manufacturer and are not part of a larger corporate entity. As a result, we can react more nimbly to customer demands and changes in the industry. 

&#183; 

Our independent ownership allows us to meet our customer needs without regard to any potentially conflicting affiliate demands to use their engines or services . Many of the aircraft engine leasing companies with which we compete are owned in whole or part by aircraft engine manufacturers. As a result, these leasing companies are inherently motivated to sell to customers the aircraft equipment that is manufactured by their owners, regardless of whether that equipment best meets the needs of their customers. As an independent public company we have the ability to work with customers to correctly identify their needs and provide them with the engines, equipment and services that are best suited to those needs. 

&#183; 

We have significant technical expertise and experience. Our senior management , marketing and sales teams all have extensive experience in leasing aircraft engines and equipment. Our technical group makes up approximately half of our total company staff levels. As a result, we possess a deep knowledge of the technical details of commercial aircraft engines and maintenance issues associated with these engines that enables us to provide our customers with comprehensive and up to date information on the various engine types available for lease. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; 

We have extensive industry contacts/relationships&#8212;worldwide . We have developed long-standing relationships with aircraft operators, equipment manufacturers and aircraft maintenance organizations around the world. Our extensive network of relationships enables us to quickly identify new leasing opportunities, procure engines and equipment and facilitate the repair of equipment owned by us and equipment leased by our customers. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

We have a trusted reputation for quality engines and engine records . We have been an independent lessor of aircraft engines and engine equipment since 1985. Since that time we have focused on providing customers with high quality engines and engine records. As a result of our commitment to these high standards, a significant portion of our customer base consists of customers who have leased engines from us previously. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

We have a diverse portfolio by customer, geography and engine type . As of December 31, 201 5 , we had a total lease portfolio consisting of 201 engines and related equipment, 10 aircraft and 5 spare parts packages with 8 5 lessees in 4 6 countries and an aggregate net book value of $1,122.9 million. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

We have a diverse product offering (by engine type and types of leases ). We lease a variety of noise-compliant, Stage III commercial jet engines manufactured by CFMI, General Electric, Pratt &#38; Whitney, Rolls Royce and International Aero Engines. These engines generally may be used on one or more aircraft types and are the most widely used engines in the world, powering Airbus, Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, Bombardier and Embraer aircraft. We offer short and long-term leases, sale/leaseback transactions and engine pooling arrangements where members of the pool have quick access to available spare engines from us or other pool members, which are typically structured as short-term leases. 

&#160; 

COMPETITION 

&#160; 

The markets for our products and services are very competitive, and we face competition from a number of sources. These competitors include aircraft engine and aircraft parts manufacturers, aircraft and aircraft engine lessors, airline and aircraft service and repair companies and aircraft and aircraft engine spare parts distributors. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than us. Those resources may include greater name recognition, larger product lines, complementary lines of business, greater financial, marketing, information systems and other resources. In addition, equipment manufacturers, aircraft maintenance providers, FAA certified repair facilities and other aviation aftermarket suppliers may vertically integrate into the markets that we serve, thereby significantly increasing industry competition. We can give no assurance that competitive pressures will not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

&#160; 

We compete primarily with aircraft engine manufacturers as well as with other aircraft engine lessors. It is common for commercial aircraft operators and MROs to utilize several leasing companies to meet their aircraft engine needs and to minimize reliance on a single leasing company. 

&#160; 

Our competitors compete with us in many ways, including pricing, technical expertise, lease flexibility, engine availability, supply reliability, customer service and the quality and condition of engines. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do, or are affiliates of larger companies. We emphasize the quality of our portfolio of aircraft engines, supply reliability and high level of customer service to our aircraft equipment lessees. We focus on ensuring adequate aircraft engine availability in high-demand locations, dedicate large portions of our organization to building relationships with lessees, maintain close day-to-day coordination with lessees and have developed an engine pooling arrangement that allows pool members quick access to available spare aircraft engines. 

&#160; 

INSURANCE 

&#160; 

In addition to requiring full indemnification under the terms of our leases, we require our lessees to carry the types of insurance customary in the air transportation industry, including comprehensive third party liability insurance and physical damage and casualty insurance. We require that we be named as an additional insured on liability insurance with ourselves and our lenders normally identified as the loss payee for damage to the equipment on policies carried by 

&#160;

&#160; 

lessees. We monitor compliance with the insurance provisions of the leases. We also carry contingent physical damage and third party liability insurance as well as product liability insurance. 

&#160; 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

&#160; 

Our customers are subject to a high degree of regulation in the jurisdictions in which they operate. For example, the FAA regulates the manufacture, repair and operation of all aircraft operated in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, such as the European Aviation Safety Agency (&#8220;EASA&#8221;) in Europe, regulate aircraft operated in those countries. Such regulations also indirectly affect our business operations. All aircraft operated in the United States must be maintained under a continuous condition-monitoring program and must periodically undergo thorough inspection and maintenance. The inspection, maintenance and repair procedures for commercial aircraft are prescribed by regulatory authorities and can be performed only by certified repair facilities utilizing certified technicians. The FAA can suspend or revoke the authority of air carriers or their licensed personnel for failure to comply with regulations and ground aircraft if their airworthiness is in question. 

&#160; 

While our leasing and reselling business is not regulated, the aircraft, engines and related parts that we purchase, lease and sell must be accompanied by documentation that enables the customer to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. Furthermore, before parts may be installed in an aircraft, they must meet certain standards of condition established by the FAA and/or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied by compliance with FAA requirements. With respect to a particular engine or engine component, we utilize FAA and/or EASA certified repair stations to repair and certify engines and components to ensure marketability. 

&#160; 

Effective January 1, 2000, federal regulations stipulate that all aircraft engines hold, or be capable of holding, a noise certificate issued under Chapter 3 of Volume 1, Part II of Annex 16 of the Chicago Convention, or have been shown to comply with Stage III noise levels set out in Section 36.5 of Appendix C of Part 36 of the FAA Regulations of the United States if the engines are to be used in the continental United States. Additionally, much of Europe has adopted similar regulations. As of December 31, 201 5 , all of the engines in our lease portfolio are Stage III engines and are generally suitable for use on one or more commonly used aircraft. 

&#160; 

We believe that the aviation industry will be subject to continued regulatory activity. Additionally, increased oversight will continue to originate from the quality assurance departments of airline operators. We have been able to meet all such requirements to date, and believe that we will be able to meet any additional requirements that may be imposed. We cannot give assurance, however, that new, more stringent government regulations will not be adopted in the future or that any such new regulations, if enacted, would not have a material adverse impact on us. 

&#160; 

GEOGRAPHIC AREAS IN WHICH WE OPERATE 

&#160; 

Approximately 9 0 % of our on-lease engines, related aircraft parts, and equipment (all of which we sometimes refer to as &#8220;equipment&#8221;) by net book value are leased and operated internationally.

FINANCING/SOURCE OF FUNDS 

&#160; 

We, directly or through WEST II, typically acquire engines with a combination of equity capital and funds borrowed from financial institutions. In order to facilitate financing and leasing of engines, each engine is generally owned through a statutory or common law trust that is wholly-owned by us or our subsidiaries. We usually borrow 85 % of an engine purchase price. Substantially all of our assets secure our related indebtedness. We typically acquire engines from airlines in a sale-lease back transaction, from engine manufacturers or from other lessors. From time to time, we selectively acquire engines prior to a firm commitment to lease or sell the engine, depending on the price of the engine and market demand with the expectation that we can lease or sell such engines. 

&#160; 

EMPLOYEES 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 201 5 , we had 104 full -time employees (excluding consultants), in sales and marketing, technical service and administration. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we believe our employee relations are satisfactory.
