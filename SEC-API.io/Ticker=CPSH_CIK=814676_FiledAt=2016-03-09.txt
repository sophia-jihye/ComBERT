 Item 1. Business. 

&#160;

CPS Technologies Corporation (the &#8216;Company&#8217; or &#8216;CPS&#8217;) provides advanced material solutions to the transportation, automotive, energy, computing/internet, telecommunications, aerospace, defense and oil and gas end markets.

&#160;

Our primary material solution is metal matrix composites. We design, manufacture and sell custom metal matrix composite components which improve the performance and reliability of systems in these end markets.

&#160;

The Company is an important participant in the growing movement towards alternative energy and &#34;green&#34; lifestyles. For example, the Company&#8217;s products are used in high-speed trains, mass transit, hybrid and electric cars, wind-turbines for electricity generation as well as routers and switches for the internet which enable telecommuting. These applications involve energy use or energy generation; the Company&#8217;s products allow higher performance and improved energy efficiency.

&#160;

Metal matrix composites (MMCs) are a class of materials consisting of a combination of metals and ceramics. Compared to conventional materials, MMCs provide superior thermal conductivity, improved thermal expansion matching, greater stiffness and lighter weight.

&#160;

For 30 years CPS has been the leader in manufacturing MMC components. Products we provide include baseplates for motor controllers used in high-speed electric trains, subway cars, wind turbines, and hybrid and electric vehicles. We provide baseplates and housings used in radar, satellite and avionics applications. We provide lids and heatspreaders used with high performance integrated circuits for in internet switches and routers. We provide baseplates and housings used in modules built with Wide Band Gap Semiconductors like SiC and GaN. CPS also assembles housings and packages for hybrid circuits. These housings and packages may include MMC components; they may include components made of more traditional materials such as aluminum, copper-tungsten, etc.

&#160;

CPS is a fully qualified manufacturer for many of the world&#8217;s largest electronics OEMs.

&#160;

CPS is actively working with customers in end markets other than electronics. . An example is CPS&#8217;s HybridTech Armor&#174; for use in armoring military and commercial vehicles. In 2008 the Company entered into a cooperative agreement with the Army Research Laboratory to further develop large MMC HybridTech Armor&#174; module panels. Although this program ended in 2015, the Company continues to receive funded orders from the U.S. Army, primarily for ballistic armor associated with the development for future combat vehicles and enhancements to present vehicles. CPS&#8217;s HybridTech Armor&#174; offers lighter weight, improved multi-hit capability, and easier attachment to the vehicle compared to alternatives.

&#160;

CPS management believes our business model of providing advanced material solutions to a portfolio of high growth end markets in various stages of the technology adoption lifecycle provides CPS with the opportunity for sustained growth and a diversified customer base. We believe we have validated this model as we are now supplying customers at all stages of the technology adoption lifecycle.

&#160;

Our products are manufactured by proprietary processes we have developed including the QuicksetTM Injection Molding Process (&#8216;Quickset Process&#8217;) and the QuickCastTM Pressure Infiltration Process (&#8216;QuickCast Process&#8217;).

&#160;

CPS was incorporated in Massachusetts in 1984 as Ceramics Process Systems Corporation and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1987 through a merger into a wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary organized for purposes of the reincorporation. In July 1987, CPS completed our initial public offering of 1.5 million shares of our Common Stock. In March 2007, the Company changed its name from Ceramics Process Systems Corporation to CPS Technologies Corporation.

&#160;

Overview of Markets and Products 

&#160;

Electronics Markets Overview 

&#160;

End-user demand continues to motivate the electronics industry to produce products which: - operate at higher speeds; - are smaller in size; and - operate with higher reliability.

&#160;

While these three requirements result in products of ever-increasing performance, these requirements also create a fundamental challenge for the designer to manage the heat generated by the system operating at higher speeds and/or higher power. Smaller assemblies further concentrate the heat and increase the difficulty of removing it.

&#160;

This challenge is found at each level in an electronic assembly: at the integrated circuit level speeds are increasing and line widths are decreasing; at the circuit board level higher density devices are placed closer together on circuit boards; and at the system level higher density circuit boards are being assembled closer together.

&#160;

The designer must resolve the thermal management issues or the system will fail. For every 10 degree Celsius rise in temperature above a threshold level, the reliability of a circuit is decreased by approximately half. In addition, heat usually causes changes in parameters which degrade the performance of both active and passive electronic components.

&#160;

To resolve thermal management issues the designer is primarily concerned with two properties of the materials which comprise the system: 1) thermal conductivity, which is the rate at which heat moves through materials, and 2) thermal expansion rate (Coefficient of Thermal Expansion or CTE) which is the rate at which materials expand or contract as temperature changes. The designer must ensure that the temperature of an electronic assembly stays within a range in which the differences in the expansion rates of the materials in the assembly do not cause a failure from breaking, delaminating, etc.

&#160;

CPS combines at the microstructural level a ceramic with a metal to produce a metal matrix composite which has the thermal conductivity needed to remove heat, and a thermal expansion rate which is sufficiently close to other components in the assembly to ensure the assembly is reliable. The ceramic is silicon carbide (SiC), the metal is aluminum (Al), and the composite is aluminum silicon carbide (AlSiC), a metal-matrix composite. CPS can adjust the thermal expansion rate of AlSiC components to match the specific application by modifying the amount of SiC compared to the amount of Al in the component. The Company also has the capability of encapsulating Pyrolytic Graphite inserts to enhance the thermal conductivity of the AlSiC composite.

&#160;

CPS produces products made of AlSiC in the shapes and configurations required for each application, for example, in the form of lids, substrates, housings, etc. Every product is made to a customer&#8217;s blueprint. The CPS process technology allows most products to be made to net shape, requiring no or little final machining.

&#160;

Although the Company&#8217;s focus today is on AlSiC components, it believes its proprietary Quickset- Quickcast process technology can be used to produce other metal-matrix composites which may meet future market needs.

&#160;

Today, the problem of thermal management is most acute in high-performance, high-density applications such as high-performance microprocessors, application-specific integrated circuits for internet routers and switches, motor controllers for trains, subway cars and wind turbines, and components for satellite communications. However, as the trends towards faster speeds, reduced size and increased reliability continue, and as high-density circuitry is used in a larger number of applications, we believe our products will be used in an increasing number of applications across many end markets.

&#160;

Structural Markets Overview 

&#160;

Structural applications perform primarily a mechanical rather than electrical function. In any mechanical assembly with moving parts the stiffness and weight of moving parts can have a significant impact on the performance and energy efficiency of the assembly. In particular, in equipment with reciprocating components increasing the stiffness and reducing the weight of reciprocating components improves the performance and energy efficiency of the equipment.

&#160;

Today many mechanical components are made of steel because steel has the stiffness required for the particular application. AlSiC has approximately the same stiffness as steel, but is only one-third the weight of steel. AlSiC is, however, higher cost than steel. However, we believe there are many mechanical applications where the customer will pay the higher cost for AlSiC because of significant improvements in performance resulting from the superior stiffness-to-weight ratio of AlSiC.

&#160;

Examples of structural applications for which we have developed and supplied components include robotic arms for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and components. The Company continues to identify opportunities for using advanced materials in such diverse areas as fracking in oil and gas, non-skid coatings, fire/heat barriers, consumer electronics and working with nuclear waste.

&#160;

Specific Markets and Products 

&#160;

Motor Controller Applications (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (&#34;IGBT&#34;) Applications )

&#160;

The use of power modules to control electric motors of all sizes is growing. This growth is the result of several factors including emerging high-power applications which demand power controllers such as trains, subways and certain industrial equipment, and cost declines in power modules which increasingly make variable speed drives cost effective. Power semiconductors are a very significant portion of the cost of variable speed drives, and the cost of the module housing and thermal management system are also significant; declines in the costs of all these components is driving increased use of variable speed drives.

&#160;

We provide baseplates and heat spreaders on which power semiconductors are mounted to produce modules for motor control. The power semiconductors are typically IGBTs and these applications are often referred to as IGBT applications. Our AlSiC baseplates have sufficient thermal conductivity to allow for removal of heat through the baseplate, and have a thermal expansion rate sufficiently similar to the other components in the assembly to ensure reliability over time as the assembly thermally cycles. We believe this market will continue to grow as the use of power modules penetrates additional motor applications, and as electric motors themselves penetrate new applications such as the hybrid electric vehicle.

&#160;

Today our primary products for IGBT applications are used in electric trains, subway cars, wind-generating turbines and hybrid and electric vehicles.

&#160;

Major automobile companies around the world are introducing hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and electric vehicle (EVs) at an increasing rate. This focus on more energy efficient vehicles is being driven by increases in energy costs and concerns about climate change. There are many varieties of HEVs and EVs, but all HEVs and EVs contain an electric motor and contain one or more motor controller modules. The Company provides baseplates on which motor controller modules are assembled; these baseplates are lighter weight and provide greater reliability than baseplates made from more conventional materials.

&#160;

The Company is working with multiple tier one and tier two suppliers to the automobile industry on several new designs for future introduction. The Company believes the HEV and EV markets will be the source of significant and long-term growth for the Company.

&#160;

Lids and Heat Spreaders for High-Performance Microprocessors, Application-Specific Integrated Circuits and Other Integrated Circuits (&#34;Flip-chip Applications&#34;) 

&#160;

Increases in speed, circuit density, and the number of connections in microprocessor chips (CPUs) and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are accelerating a transition in the way in which these circuits are packaged. Packages provide mechanical protection to the integrated circuit (IC), enable the IC to be connected to other circuits via pins, solder bumps or other connectors, and allow attachment of a heat sink or fan to ensure the IC does not overheat. In the past most high-performance ICs were electrically connected to the package by fine wires in a process known as wire bonding. Today, most high-performance semiconductors are connected to the package by placing metal bumps on the connection points of the die, turning the die upside down in the package, and directly connecting the bumps on the die with corresponding bumps on the package base by reflowing the bumps. This is referred to as a &#34;flip-chip package&#34;. Flip chip packages allow for connection of a larger number of leads in a smaller space, and can provide other electrical performance advantages compared to wire bonded packages.

&#160;

In many flip chip configurations a lid or heat spreader is placed over the die to protect the die from mechanical damage and to facilitate the removal of heat from the die. Often a heat sink or fan is then attached to the lid. For a high-density die the package designer must ensure that the lid has sufficient thermal conductivity to remove heat from the die and that all components of the package assembly - the die itself, the package base, and the package lid - are made from materials with sufficiently similar thermal expansion rates to ensure the assembly will not break apart over time as it thermally cycles.

&#160;

Our composite material, AlSiC, has been developed to meet these two needs: it is engineered to have sufficient thermal conductivity to allow the heat generated by the die to be removed through the lid, and it is engineered to expand upon heating at a rate similar to other materials used in the package assembly in order to ensure reliability of the package over time as it thermally cycles. We produce lids made of AlSiC for high performance microprocessors and application-specific integrated circuits used in servers, internet switches and other applications.

&#160;

Most participants in the semiconductor industry believe the densities of ICs will continue to increase following the well-known &#34;Moore&#8217;s Law&#34;. As IC densities increase, generally so does the IC size, and the amount of heat generated by the IC. We believe the need for thermal management will continue to grow rapidly.

&#160;

Customers 

We sell primarily to major microelectronics systems houses in the United States, Europe and Asia. Our customers typically purchase prototype and evaluation quantities of our products over a one to three year period before purchasing production volumes.

In 2015, our three largest customers accounted for 27%, 23% and 10% of revenues, respectively. In 2015, approximately 91% of our revenues were derived from commercial applications and 9% from defense-related applications.

Research and Development 

In 2015, costs incurred related to funding under the Cooperative Agreement totaled $42 thousand of which essentially 100% was reimbursed by the U.S. Army and was recorded as revenue. This revenue of $42 thousand resulted in a gross margin of $8 thousand.

Availability of Raw Materials 

We use a variety of raw materials from numerous domestic and foreign suppliers. These materials are primarily aluminum ingots, ceramic powders and chemicals. The raw materials we use are available from domestic and foreign sources and none is believed to be scarce or restricted for national security reasons. We use no conflict metals.

Patents and Trade Secrets 

As of December 26, 2015, the Company had 11 United States patents. In addition the Company had several international patents covering the same subject matter as the U.S. patents. Licensees of these patents have rights to use certain patents as defined in their respective license agreements.

We intend to continue to apply for domestic and foreign patent protection in appropriate cases. In other cases, we believe we are better served by reliance on trade secret protection. In all cases, we seek protection for our technological developments to preserve our competitive position.

Backlog and Contracts 

Over 90% of the Company's product sales are custom in that they are based on customers&#8217; drawings and the large majority of these sales are &#34;designed in&#34; and are sold over multiple years. Major customers typically give the Company a non-binding forecast of demand for a one-year period and then negotiate a pricing agreement with the Company valid for that one-year period. Each week customers then issue releases or authorizations to ship under the pricing agreements. At any point in time the contractually binding backlog represented by the releases in hand does not necessarily reflect underlying demand. Given this situation, the Company does not believe backlog data is helpful to investors.

Competition 

We have developed and expect to continue to develop products for a number of different end markets and we will encounter competition from different producers of metal-matrix composites and other competing materials.

We believe that the principal competitive factors in our end markets today include technical competence, product performance, quality, reliability, price, corporate reputation, and strength of sales and marketing resources. We believe our proprietary processes, reputation, and the price at which we can offer products for sale will enable us to compete successfully in the many electronics end markets. However, we do have one major direct competitor producing metal matrix composites. That company, Denka, is based in Japan and sells to our major customers in Europe.

Government Regulation 

We produce non-nuclear, non-medical hazardous waste in our development and manufacturing operations. The disposal of such waste is governed by state and federal regulations. Various customers, vendors, and collaborative development agreement partners of CPS may reside abroad, thereby possibly requiring export and import of raw materials, intermediate products, and finished products, as well as potential technology transfer abroad under collaborative development agreements. These types of activities are regulated by bureaus within the Departments of Commerce, State and Treasury.

In 2008, the Company entered into a cooperative agreement with the US Army Research Laboratory to perform research and development concerning hybrid metal matrix composite encapsulated ceramic armor technology. The Cooperative Agreement was a four-year agreement, recently expired March 31, 2015, which was 95% funded by the US Department of Defense and 5% funded by CPS.

Revenues from this Cooperative Agreement are recognized proportionally as costs are incurred. We are reimbursed for reasonable and allocable costs up to the reimbursement limits set by the Cooperative Agreement. All payments to the Company for work performed on this Cooperative Agreement are subject to audit and adjustment by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. Adjustments, if any, are recognized in the period made.

Employees 

As of December 26, 2015, we had 146 permanent full-time employees and 4 temporary full-time employees. 131 were engaged in manufacturing and engineering and 12 in sales and administration, including finance, purchasing, IT, and customer service.

None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with our employees to be excellent.
