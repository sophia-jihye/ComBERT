Business 

Overview 

Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc. is a biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing novel oncology therapies. We are seeking to translate our unique knowledge of the tumor microenvironment to create therapies that have the potential to improve cancer patient survival. Our research primarily focuses on human enzymes that alter the extracellular matrix and tumor microenvironment. The extracellular matrix is a complex matrix of proteins and carbohydrates surrounding the cell that provides structural support in tissues and orchestrates many important biological activities, including cell migration, signaling and survival. Over many years, we have developed unique technology and scientific expertise enabling us to pursue this target-rich environment for the development of therapies. 

Our proprietary enzymes are used to facilitate the delivery of injected drugs and fluids, potentially enhancing the efficacy and the convenience of other drugs or can be used to alter tissue structures for potential clinical benefit. We exploit our technology and expertise using a two pillar strategy that we believe enables us to manage risk and cost by: (1) developing our own proprietary products in therapeutic areas with significant unmet medical needs, with a focus on oncology, and (2) licensing our technology to biopharmaceutical companies to collaboratively develop products that combine our technology with the collaborators&#8217; proprietary compounds. 

The majority of our approved product and product candidates are based on rHuPH20, our patented recombinant human hyaluronidase enzyme. rHuPH20 is the active ingredient in our first commercially approved product, Hylenex &#174; &#32;recombinant, and it works by temporarily breaking down hyaluronan (or HA), a naturally occurring complex carbohydrate that is a major component of the extracellular matrix in tissues throughout the body such as skin and cartilage. We believe this temporary degradation creates an opportunistic window for the improved subcutaneous delivery of injectable biologics, such as monoclonal antibodies and other large therapeutic molecules, as well as small molecules and fluids. We refer to the application of rHuPH20 to facilitate the delivery of other drugs or fluids as our ENHANZE &#8482; &#32;Technology. We license the ENHANZE Technology to form collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies that develop or market drugs requiring or benefiting from injection via the subcutaneous route of administration. 

We currently have ENHANZE collaborations with F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd. and Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. (Roche), Baxalta US Inc. and Baxalta GmbH (Baxalta), Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer), Janssen Biotech, Inc. (Janssen), AbbVie, Inc. (AbbVie), and Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly). We receive royalties from two of these collaborations, including royalties from sales of one product approved in both the United States and outside the United States from the Baxalta collaboration and from sales of two products approved for marketing outside the United States from the Roche collaboration. Future potential revenues from the sales and/or royalties of our approved products, product candidates, and ENHANZE collaborations will depend on the ability of Halozyme and our collaborators to develop, manufacture, secure and maintain regulatory approvals for approved products and product candidates and commercialize product candidates. 

Our proprietary development pipeline consists primarily of clinical stage product candidates in oncology. Our lead oncology program is PEGPH20 (PEGylated recombinant human hyaluronidase), a molecular entity we are developing for the systemic treatment of tumors that accumulate HA. When HA accumulates in a tumor, it can cause higher pressure in the tumor, reducing blood flow into the tumor and with that, reduced access of cancer therapies to the tumor. PEGPH20 works by temporarily degrading HA surrounding cancer cells resulting in reduced pressure and increased blood flow to the tumor thereby enabling increased amounts of anticancer treatments administered concomitantly gaining access to the tumor. We are currently in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical testing for PEGPH20 in stage IV pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) (Studies 109-202 and 109-301), in Phase 1b clinical testing in non-small cell lung cancer (Study 107-201) and in Phase 1b clinical testing in non-small cell lung cancer and gastric cancer (Study 107-101).

Technology 

rHuPH20 can be applied as a drug delivery platform to increase dispersion and absorption of other injected drugs and fluids that are injected under the skin or in the muscle thereby potentially enhancing efficacy or convenience. For example, rHuPH20 has been used to convert drugs that must be delivered intravenously into subcutaneous injections or to reduce the number of subcutaneous injections needed for effective therapy. When ENHANZE Technology is applied subcutaneously, the rHuPH20 acts locally and has a tissue half-life of less than 15 minutes. HA at the local site reconstitutes its normal density within a few days and, therefore, we anticipate that any effect of rHuPH20 on the architecture of the subcutaneous space is temporary. 

Additionally, we are expanding our scientific work to develop other enzymes and agents that target the extracellular matrix&#8217;s unique aspects, giving rise to potentially new molecular entities with a particular focus on oncology. We are developing a PEGylated version of the rHuPH20 enzyme (PEGPH20), that lasts for an extended period in the bloodstream (half-life of one to two days), and may therefore better target solid tumors that accumulate HA by degrading the surrounding HA and reducing the interstitial fluid pressure within malignant tumors to allow better penetration by co-administered agents. 

Strategy 

During 2015, we continued our strategy of focusing on developing our PEGPH20 product candidate for oncology as well as entering into new collaborations for ENHANZE Technology. This business model allows for growth in which revenue garnered from collaboration products helps fund our investment in PEGPH20 clinical development, with the goal of a future product approval that will support sustained growth. 

Key aspects of our corporate strategy include the following: 

&#8226; 

Focus on developing PEGPH20, our investigational new drug candidate, in multiple different tumors that accumulate high levels of HA. PEGPH20 is in Phase 2 and Phase 3 development in stage IV PDA and in Phase 1b development in non-small cell lung cancer and gastric cancer. Over time, it is our goal to study additional types of cancer and to advance this program toward regulatory approval and commercial launch. 

&#8226; 

Focus on ENHANZE collaborations. We currently have six collaborations with three current product approvals and additional product candidates in development. We intend to work with our existing collaborators to expand our collaborations to add new targets and product candidates under the terms of the operative agreements. In addition, we will continue our efforts to enter into new collaborations to further exploit and derive additional value from our proprietary technology. 

Product and Product Candidates 

We have one marketed proprietary product and one proprietary product candidate targeting several indications in various stages of development. The following table summarizes our proprietary product and product candidate as well as products and product candidates under development with our collaborators: 

Proprietary Pipeline 

Hylenex Recombinant (hyaluronidase human injection) 

Hylenex &#32;recombinant is a formulation of rHuPH20 that has received FDA approval to facilitate subcutaneous fluid administration for achieving hydration, to increase the dispersion and absorption of other injected drugs and, in subcutaneous urography, to improve resorption of radiopaque agents. Hylenex &#32;recombinant is currently the number one prescribed branded hyaluronidase. 

PEGPH20 

We are developing PEGPH20 as a candidate for the systemic treatment of tumors that accumulate HA in combination with currently approved cancer therapies. &#8216;PEG&#8217; refers to the attachment of polyethylene glycol to rHuPH20, thereby creating PEGPH20. One of the novel properties of PEGPH20 is that it lasts for an extended duration in the bloodstream and, therefore, can be administered systemically to maintain its therapeutic effect to treat disease. 

Cancer malignancies, including pancreatic, lung, breast, gastric, colon and prostate cancers can accumulate high levels of HA and therefore we believe that PEGPH20 has the potential to help patients with these types of cancer when used with currently approved cancer therapies. Among solid tumors, PDA has been reported to be associated with the highest frequency of HA accumulation. Approximately 90,000 patients in the United States and the European Union will be diagnosed with PDA in 2016. 

The pathologic accumulation of HA, along with other matrix components, creates a unique microenvironment for the growth of tumor cells compared to normal cells. We believe that depleting the HA component of the tumor microenvironment with PEGPH20 remodels the tumor microenvironment, resulting in tumor growth inhibition in animal models. Removal of HA from the tumor microenvironment results in expansion of previously constricted blood vessels allowing increased blood flow, potentially increasing the access of activated immune cells and factors in the blood into the tumor microenvironment. If PEGPH20 is administered in conjunction with other anti-cancer therapies, the increase in blood flow may allow anti-cancer therapies to have greater access to the tumor, which may enhance the treatment effect of therapeutic modalities like chemotherapies, monoclonal antibodies and other agents. 

Study Halo 109-201 : 

In January 2015, we presented the final results from Study 109-201, a multi-center, international open label dose escalation Phase 1b clinical study of PEGPH20 in combination with gemcitabine for the treatment of patients with stage IV PDA at the 2015 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium (also known as ASCO-GI meeting). This study enrolled 28 patients with previously untreated stage IV PDA. Patients were treated with one of three doses of PEGPH20 (1.0, 1.6 and 3.0 &#181;g/kg twice weekly for four weeks, then weekly thereafter) in combination with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 administered intravenously. In this study, the confirmed overall response rate (complete response + partial response confirmed on a second scan as assessed by an independent radiology review) was 29 percent (7 of 24 patients) for those treated at therapeutic dose levels of PEGPH20 (1.6 and 3.0 &#181;g/kg). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 154 days (95% CI, 50-166) in the efficacy-evaluable population (n = 24). Among efficacy-evaluable patients with baseline tumor HA staining (n = 17), the median PFS in patients with high baseline tumor HA staining (6/17 patients) was substantially longer, 219 days, than in the patients with low baseline tumor HA staining (11/17 patients), 108 days. Median overall survival (OS) was 200 days (95% CI, 123-370) in the efficacy-evaluable population (n = 24). Among efficacy-evaluable patients with baseline tumor HA staining (n = 17), the median OS in patients with high baseline tumor HA staining (6/17 patients) was substantially longer, 395 days, than in the patients with low baseline tumor HA staining (11/17 patients), 174 days. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (occurring in &#8805; 15% of patients) were peripheral edema, muscle spasms, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, myalgia, anemia, and nausea. Thromboembolic (TE) events were reported in 8 patients (28.6%) and musculoskeletal events were reported in 21 patients (75%) which were generally grade 1/2 in severity. 

Study Halo 109-202 : 

In the second quarter of 2013, we initiated Study 109-202, a Phase 2 multicenter randomized clinical trial evaluating PEGPH20 as a first-line therapy for patients with stage IV PDA. The study was designed to enroll patients who would receive gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (ABRAXANE &#174; ) either with or without PEGPH20. The primary endpoint is to measure the improvement in PFS in patients receiving PEGPH20 plus gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel compared to those who are receiving gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel alone. In April 2014, after 146 patients had been enrolled, the trial was put on clinical hold by Halozyme and the 

FDA to assess a question raised by the Data Monitoring Committee regarding a possible difference in the TE events rate between the group of patients treated with PEGPH20, nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine (PAG arm) versus the group of patients treated with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine without PEGPH20 (AG arm). This portion of the study and patients in this portion are now referred to as Stage 1. It should be noted that at the time of the clinical hold all patients remaining in the study continued on gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. In July 2014, the Study 109-202 was reinitiated (Stage 2) under a revised protocol, which excludes patients that are expected to be at a greater risk for TE events. The revised protocol provides for thromboembolism prophylaxis of all patients in both arms of the study with low molecular weight heparin, and adds evaluation of the TE events rate in Stage 2 PEGPH20-treated patients as a co-primary end point. Stage 2 of Study 109-202 enrolled an additional 133 patients, to add to the 146 patients already accrued in the clinical trial, with a 2:1 randomization for PAG compared to AG. We project to present mature PFS data and overall response rate in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

In May 2015, interim findings from the ongoing Phase 2 clinical study of PEGPH20 for the potential treatment of patients with stage IV PDA were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting. The trial included 135 treated patients in Stage 1, of whom a total of 44 patients -- 23 receiving PEGPH20 in combination with ABRAXANE &#174; &#32;and gemcitabine (PAG treatment arm) and 21 receiving ABRAXANE and gemcitabine alone (AG treatment arm) -- had available biopsies that were determined utilizing the Halozyme prototype HA assay in a retrospective analysis to have high levels of hyaluronan. PEGPH20 targets HA to help improve cancer therapy access to tumor cells. Results reported include: 

&#8226; 

A more than doubling of median PFS of 9.2 months versus 4.3 months in high-HA patients treated with PAG vs. AG (hazard ratio of 0.39; p-value of 0.05); 

&#8226; 

A more than doubling of overall response rate of 52 percent versus 24 percent (p-value of 0.038) and a duration of response of 8.1 months compared to 3.7 months in high-HA patients treated with PAG versus AG; 

&#8226; 

In the 30 high-HA patients (15 PAG treatment arm versus 15 AG treatment arm) who were evaluated for response prior to the April 2014 clinical hold and subsequent PEGPH20 treatment discontinuation, the overall response rate was 73 percent versus 27 percent (p-value of 0.01), respectively, consistent with findings presented in January; 

&#8226; 

A trend toward improvement in median overall survival of 12 months compared to 9 months in high-HA patients treated with PAG versus AG (hazard ratio of 0.62) despite discontinuation of PEGPH20 in more than half of the PAG-treated patients at the time of the clinical hold in April 2014. 

Data was also presented on the rate of TE events in 55 patients treated in Stage 2 of the trial, which is currently randomizing patients at a 2:1 ratio of PAG versus AG. As noted above, Stage 2 began after a protocol amendment in July 2014, excluding patients at high risk of TE events and adding prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) to all patients in both treatment arms. Reported results included a TE event rate of 13% in 38 patients treated with PAG versus 18% in 17 patients receiving AG. 

We and the Data Monitoring Committee for Study 109-202 continue to closely monitor the occurrence of TE events in enrolled patients after the revision to the protocol. The revised protocol includes pre-specified analyses to evaluate the rate of TE events. While the pre-specified TE event rate analysis established in the protocol at the time of the clinical hold in 2014 have been passed, the continuation of Study 202 may be halted again if the FDA determines that imbalances in safety findings, including TE events, occur, or for any other emergent safety concerns. 

In March 2015, we met with the FDA to discuss both the interim efficacy and safety data from Study 109-202, which included the potential risk profile including TE event rate. Based on the feedback from that meeting, we proceeded with a Phase 3 clinical study (Study 109-301) of PEGPH20 in patients with stage IV PDA, using a design allowing for potential marketing application based on either PFS or overall survival. &#160; The study will enroll patients whose tumors accumulate high levels of HA using a companion diagnostic test. The FDA provided feedback on the current companion diagnostic approach and confirmed that an approved companion diagnostic strategy is required for Phase 3 related tumor biopsy. 

The use of PFS as the basis for marketing approval will be subject to the overall benefit and risk associated with PEGPH20 combined with nab-paclitaxel (ABRAXANE &#174; ) and gemcitabine therapy, including the: 

&#8226; 

Magnitude of the PFS treatment effect observed; 

&#8226; 

Toxicity profile; and 

&#8226; 

Interim overall survival data. 

In June 2015, we received scientific advice/protocol assistance from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) regarding our Phase 3 study. The EMA agreed to the patient population, and the use of both PFS and OS as co-primary endpoints stating that OS is the preferred endpoint and that ultimate approval would require an overall positive benefit:risk balance. 

In January 2016, an update on the Stage 1 PFS data utilizing the companion diagnostic that is currently in development with Ventana Medical Systems (Ventana) was presented. In a total of 43 high-HA patients, the data continued to show an improvement in median PFS when patients with high HA received PAG compared to AG (9.2 months compared to 6.3 months respectively); hazard ratio of 0.48 (95% CI: 0.16, 1.48). In addition, the overall response rate in the PAG treated patients was 55% (12 out of 22 patients) compared to 33% (7 out of 21 patients), which was not statistically significant. A modest improvement in median overall survival was seen in the PAG-treated high-HA patients. PEGPH20 was discontinued in over 40% of patients in the new companion diagnostic analysis due to the clinical hold in April 2014. We remain blinded to the efficacy results and project to present mature PFS and overall response rate from Stage 2 of Study 202 in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the secondary primary endpoint of the rate of TE events, we have passed the pre-specified analyses for TE events and are continuing with the Data Monitoring Committee to monitor the rate of TE events since implementing low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) prophylaxis. 

Additionally, an update on the rate of TE events in the PEGPH20 treatment arm in Stage 2 of Study 202 was provided. Reported results included a TE event rate with LMWH prophylaxis of 12% in 73 patients treated with PAG versus 9% in 34 patients receiving AG, and for those treated with 1mg/kg/day of LMWH, a TE event rate of 7% in 55 patients treated with PAG versus 4% in 27 patients receiving AG. 

We also reported an update on the development of the companion diagnostic. Halozyme has partnered with Ventana to develop the companion diagnostic and announced the methodology and scoring algorithm have been finalized. Based on the cutpoint for the Ventana diagnostic, we now expect approximately 35 to 40 percent of stage IV PDA patients to have high-HA tumors, similar to the previously reported interim results from Stage 1 of Study 202 using the Halozyme prototype assay. 

In February 2016, our partner Ventana submitted an investigational device exemption (IDE) application for our companion diagnostic test to enable patient selection in our Phase 3 Study 301 of PEGPH20 in high-HA patients. 

Study Halo 109-301 : 

In the first quarter of 2016, we initiated Study 109-301, a Phase 3 multicenter randomized clinical trial evaluating PEGPH20 as a first-line therapy for patients with stage IV PDA. The study will explore PEGPH20 with gemcitabine and ABRAXANE in stage IV PDA patients at approximately 200 sites in 20 countries located in North America, Europe, South America and Asia Pacific. First dosing of a patient is expected to occur in March 2016. 

SWOG Study S1313 : 

In October 2013, SWOG, a cancer research cooperative group of more than 4,000 researchers in over 500 institutions around the world, initiated a 144 patient Phase 1b/2 randomized clinical trial in some of their study centers, examining PEGPH20 in combination with modified FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy (mFOLFIRINOX) compared to mFOLFIRINOX treatment alone in patients with stage IV PDA (funded by the National Cancer Institute). This study was also placed on clinical hold temporarily at the time of the hold on Study 109-202. In September 2014, the FDA removed the clinical hold on patient enrollment and dosing of PEGPH20 in this SWOG cooperative study. The study has resumed under a revised protocol, and patient enrollment is continuing. The Phase 2 portion of the study, where up to 172 patients are planned to be enrolled, began in June 2015. As with Study 109-202, the occurrence of TE events will be closely monitored in enrolled patients, and the continuation of this study may be halted again in accordance with event rate rules established in the protocol, or for other safety reasons. 

Other indications outside of pancreatic cancer : 

Study HALO 107-201, PRIMAL Study : In December 2014, we initiated a Phase 1b/2 trial, to evaluate PEGPH20 in second line in combination with docetaxel (Taxotere &#174; ) in non-small cell lung cancer patients. In this study, we expect to evaluate and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and safety of PEGPH20 plus docetaxel in previously treated patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Upon identification of the MTD we plan to expand the trial into a dose expansion phase in patients prospectively tested for HA status, and then ultimately a Phase 2 portion of the study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PEGPH20 in second line HA-high non-small cell lung cancer patients in combination with docetaxel. 

Study HALO 107-101, the immuno-oncology trial: &#32;&#32;We recently initiated a Phase 1b study exploring the combination of PEGPH20 and KEYTRUDA &#174; , an immuno-oncology agent in relapsed non-small cell lung cancer and gastric cancer. We expect to evaluate and identify the dose and safety of PEGPH20 plus KEYTRUDA prior to embarking on dose expansion in high-HA patients in this study. 

Halozyme Eisai Clinical Collaboration: We expect a Phase 1b/2 study to be initiated in the second quarter of 2016, exploring the combination of PEGPH20 and eribulin in first line HER2-negative HA-high metastatic breast cancer. Halozyme and Eisai will jointly share the costs to conduct this global study. 

Regulatory : 

In September 2014, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for our program investigating PEGPH20 in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of patients with stage IV PDA to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival. The Fast Track designation process was developed by the FDA to facilitate the development, and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening diseases and address unmet medical needs. 

In October 2014, the FDA granted Orphan Drug designation for PEGPH20 for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The FDA Office of Orphan Products Development&#8217;s mission is to advance the evaluation and development of products (drugs, biologics, devices, or medical foods) that demonstrate promise for the diagnosis and/or treatment of rare diseases or conditions. In December 2014, the European Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products of the EMA designated PEGPH20 an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. 

In March 2015, we met with the FDA to discuss both the interim efficacy and safety data from Study 109-202 and to discuss the Phase 3 Study 109-301 as a potential registration study in stage IV PDA patients whose tumors are determined to have high levels of HA accumulation. In June 2015, we received scientific advice/protocol assistance from the EMA regarding our Phase 3 study. In addition, we continue our dialog with the FDA regarding the development of a companion diagnostic agent for detection and quantification of hyaluronan in the tumor tissue of cancer patients. 

In February 2016, our partner Ventana submitted an IDE application for our companion diagnostic test to enable patient selection in our Phase 3 Study 301 of PEGPH20 in high-HA patients. 

Collaborations 

Roche Collaboration 

In December 2006, we and Roche entered into a collaboration and license agreement under which Roche obtained a worldwide, exclusive license to develop and commercialize product combinations of rHuPH20 and up to thirteen Roche target compounds (the Roche Collaboration). Roche initially had the exclusive right to apply rHuPH20 to only three pre-defined Roche biologic targets with the option to exclusively develop and commercialize rHuPH20 with ten additional targets. As of December 31, 2015 , Roche has elected a total of five targets, two of which are exclusive, and retains the option to develop and commercialize rHuPH20 with three additional targets. 

In September 2013, Roche launched a subcutaneous (SC) formulation of Herceptin (trastuzumab) (Herceptin SC) in Europe for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. This formulation utilizes our patented ENHANZE Technology and is administered in two to five minutes, rather than 30 to 90 minutes with the standard intravenous form. Roche received European marketing approval for Herceptin SC in August 2013. The European Commission&#8217;s approval was based on data from Roche&#8217;s Phase 3 HannaH study which showed that the subcutaneous formulation of Herceptin was associated with comparable efficacy 

(pathological complete response, pCR) to Herceptin administered intravenously in women with HER2-positive early breast cancer and resulted in non-inferior trastuzumab plasma levels. Overall, the safety profile in both arms of the HannaH study was consistent with that expected from standard treatment with Herceptin and chemotherapy in this setting. No new safety signals were identified. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Each year, about 1.7 million new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed worldwide, and over 500,000 women will die of the disease annually. In HER2-positive breast cancer, increased quantities of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) are present on the surface of the tumor cells. This is known as &#8220;HER2 positivity&#8221; and affects approximately 15% to 20% of women with breast cancer. HER2-positive cancer is reported to be a particularly aggressive form of breast cancer. 

In June 2014, Roche launched MabThera SC in Europe for the treatment of patients with common forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). This formulation utilizes our patented ENHANZE Technology and is administered in approximately five minutes compared to the approximately 2.5 hour infusion time for intravenous MabThera. The European Commission approved MabThera SC in March 2014. The European Commission&#8217;s approval was based primarily on data from Roche&#8217;s Phase 3 pivotal clinical studies, which was published in The Lancet Oncology. NHL is a type of cancer that affects lymphocytes (white blood cells). NHL represents approximately 85% of all lymphomas diagnosed and was responsible for approximately 200,000 annual deaths worldwide in 2012. Lymphomas are a cancer of the lymphatic system (composed of lymph vessels, lymph nodes and organs) which helps to keep the bodily fluid levels balanced and to defend the body against invasion by disease. Lymphoma develops when white blood cells (usually B-lymphocytes) in the lymph fluid become cancerous and begin to multiply and collect in the lymph nodes or lymphatic tissues such as the spleen. Some of these cells are released into the bloodstream and spread around the body, interfering with the body&#8217;s production of healthy blood cells. Roche announced that it filed MabThera SC in Europe for previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia in the fourth quarter of 2014. 

Additional information about the Phase 3 Herceptin SC and Phase 3 MabThera SC clinical trials can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov &#32;and www.roche-trials.com . Information available on these websites is not incorporated into this report. 

Baxalta Collaboration 

In September 2007, we and Baxalta entered into a collaboration and license agreement under which Baxalta obtained a worldwide, exclusive license to develop and commercialize product combinations of rHuPH20 with GAMMAGARD LIQUID (HYQVIA) (the Baxalta Collaboration). GAMMAGARD LIQUID is a current Baxalta product that is indicated for the treatment of primary immunodeficiency disorders associated with defects in the immune system. 

In October 2014, Baxalta announced the launch and first shipments of Baxalta&#8217;s HYQVIA product for treatment of adult patients with primary immunodeficiency in the U.S. HYQVIA was approved by the FDA in September 2014 and is the first subcutaneous immune globulin (IG) treatment approved for adult primary immunodeficiency patients with a dosing regimen requiring only one infusion up to once per month (every three to four weeks) and one injection site per infusion in most patients, to deliver a full therapeutic dose of IG. The majority of primary immunodeficiency patients today receive intravenous infusions in a doctor&#8217;s office or infusion center, and current subcutaneous IG treatments require weekly or bi-weekly treatment with multiple infusion sites per treatment. The FDA&#8217;s approval of HYQVIA was a significant milestone for us as it represented the first U.S. approved Biologic License Application (BLA) which utilizes our rHuPH20 platform. 

In May 2013, the European Commission granted Baxalta marketing authorization in all EU Member States for the use of HYQVIA (solution for subcutaneous use) as replacement therapy for adult patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiencies. Baxalta launched HYQVIA in the first EU country in July 2013 and has continued to launch in additional countries. 

Pfizer Collaboration 

In December 2012, we and Pfizer entered into a collaboration and license agreement, under which Pfizer has the worldwide license to develop and commercialize products combining our rHuPH20 enzyme with Pfizer proprietary biologics directed to up to six targets in primary care and specialty care indications. Targets may be selected on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis. In September 2013, Pfizer elected the fourth therapeutic target on an exclusive basis. One of the targets is proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) which is the gene that provides instructions for making a protein that helps regulate the amount of cholesterol in the bloodstream. Pfizer initiated dosing of a subcutaneous formulation of rHuPH20 and bococizumab, an investigational PCSK9 inhibitor, in a Phase 1 trial in February 2016. Pfizer is also developing rivipansel directed to another target 

under the collaboration to treat vaso-occlusive crisis in individuals with sickle cell disease and initiated dosing of a subcutaneous formulation of rHuPH20 and rivipansel in a Phase 1 clinical trial in October 2015. 

Janssen Collaboration 

In December 2014, we and Janssen entered into a collaboration and license agreement, under which Janssen has the worldwide license to develop and commercialize products combining our rHuPH20 enzyme with Janssen proprietary biologics directed to up to five targets. Targets may be selected on an exclusive basis. Janssen has elected CD38 as the first target on an exclusive basis. In November 2015, Janssen initiated dosing in a Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating subcutaneous delivery of daratumumab, using ENHANZE Technology, in multiple myeloma. 

AbbVie Collaboration 

In June 2015, we and AbbVie entered into a collaboration and license agreement, under which AbbVie has the worldwide license to develop and commercialize products combining our rHuPH20 enzyme with AbbVie proprietary biologics directed to up to nine targets. Targets may be selected on an exclusive basis. AbbVie has elected TNF alpha as the first target on an exclusive basis. AbbVie is developing rHuPH20 with adalimumab (HUMIRA &#174; ) which may allow a reduced number of induction injections and deliver additional performance benefits. 

Lilly Collaboration 

In December 2015, we and Lilly entered into a collaboration and license agreement, under which Lilly has the worldwide license to develop and commercialize products combining our rHuPH20 enzyme with Lilly proprietary biologics directed to up to five targets. Targets may be selected on an exclusive basis. Lilly has elected one target on an exclusive basis and one target on a semi-exclusive basis. 

For a further discussion of the material terms of our collaboration agreements, refer to Note 4, Collaborative Agreements , to our consolidated financial statements.

Patents and Proprietary Rights 

Patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our inventions, to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Our strategy is to actively pursue patent protection in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions for technology that we believe to be proprietary to us and that offers us a potential competitive advantage. Our patent portfolio includes 21 issued patents in the U.S., more than 235 issued patents in Europe and other countries in the world and more than 260 pending patent applications. In general, patents have a term of 20 years from the application filing date or earlier claimed priority date. Our issued patents will expire between 2022 and 2032. We have multiple patents and patent applications throughout the world pertaining to our recombinant human hyaluronidase and methods of use and manufacture, including an issued U.S. patent which expires in 2027 and an issued European patent which expires in 2024, which we believe cover the products and product candidates under our existing 

collaborations, Hylenex &#32;recombinant, PEGPH20 and our endocrinology product candidates. In addition, we have, under prosecution throughout the world, multiple patent applications that relate specifically to individual product candidates under development, the expiration of which can only be definitely determined upon maturation into our issued patents. We believe our patent filings represent a barrier to entry for potential competitors looking to utilize these hyaluronidases. 

In addition to patents, we rely on unpatented trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation. We seek protection of these trade secrets, proprietary know-how and innovation, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. Our policy is to require our employees, directors, consultants, advisors, collaborators, outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers, other advisors and other individuals and entities to execute confidentiality agreements upon the start of employment, consulting or other contractual relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual or entity during the course of the relationship is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees and some other parties, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual will be our exclusive property. Despite the use of these agreements and our efforts to protect our intellectual property, there will always be a risk of unauthorized use or disclosure of information. Furthermore, our trade secrets may otherwise become known to, or be independently developed by, our competitors. 

We also file trademark applications to protect the names of our products and product candidates. These applications may not mature to registration and may be challenged by third parties. We are pursuing trademark protection in a number of different countries around the world. There can be no assurances that our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names will not infringe on rights of third parties or will be acceptable to regulatory agencies. 

Research and Development Activities 

Our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the development and manufacturing of our product candidates, compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel, supplies and materials, costs for consultants and related contract research, clinical trials, facility costs and amortization and depreciation. We charge all research and development expenses to operations as they are incurred. Our research and development activities are primarily focused on the development of our various product candidates. 

Due to the uncertainty in obtaining the FDA and other regulatory approvals, our reliance on third parties and competitive pressures, we are unable to estimate with any certainty the additional costs we will incur in the continued development of our proprietary product candidates for commercialization. However, we expect our research and development expenses for PEGPH20 to increase as our program advances into additional tumors and later stages of clinical development. 

Manufacturing 

We do not have our own manufacturing facility for our product and product candidates, or the capability to package our products. We have engaged third parties to manufacture bulk rHuPH20, PEGPH20 and Hylenex recombinant. 

We have existing supply agreements with contract manufacturing organizations Avid Bioservices, Inc. (Avid) and Cook Pharmica LLC (Cook) to produce supplies of bulk rHuPH20. These manufacturers each produce bulk rHuPH20 under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) for clinical and commercial uses. Cook currently produces bulk rHuPH20 for use in Hylenex &#32;recombinant, product candidates and collaboration product candidates. Avid currently produces bulk rHuPH20 for use in collaboration products. We rely on their ability to successfully manufacture these batches according to product specifications. In addition, we are working to scale-up, validate and qualify a new facility operated by Avid as a manufacturer of bulk rHuPH20 for use in the products and product candidates under the Roche collaboration. It is important for our business for Cook and Avid to (i) retain their status as cGMP-approved manufacturing facilities; (ii) to successfully scale up bulk rHuPH20 production; and/or (iii) manufacture the bulk rHuPH20 required by us and our collaborators for use in our proprietary and collaboration products and product candidates. In addition to supply obligations, Avid and Cook will also provide support for data and information used in the chemistry, manufacturing and controls sections for FDA and other regulatory filings. 

We have a commercial manufacturing and supply agreement with Patheon Manufacturing Services, LLC (Patheon) under which Patheon will provide the final fill and finishing steps in the production process of Hylenex &#32;recombinant. Under our commercial services agreement with Patheon, Patheon has agreed to fill and finish Hylenex recombinant product for us until December 31, 2019, subject to further extensions in accordance with the terms of the agreement. In addition, we are in the early stages of scaling 

up our manufacturing of PEGPH20 with third party suppliers to support additional clinical trials, including a registration-enabling trial, and ultimately, if approved, potential commercial supply. 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 

HYLENEX Recombinant 

Our commercial activities currently focus on Hylenex &#32;recombinant. We have a team of sales specialists that provide hospital and surgery center customers with the information about Hylenex &#32;recombinant and information needed to obtain formulary approval for, and support utilization of, &#32;Hylenex &#32;recombinant. Our commercial activities also include marketing and related services and commercial support services such as commercial operations, managed markets and commercial analytics. We also employ third-party vendors, such as advertising agencies, market research firms and suppliers of marketing and other sales support related services to assist with our commercial activities. 

We sell Hylenex &#32;recombinant in the U.S. to wholesale pharmaceutical distributors, who sell the product to hospitals and other end-user customers. We have engaged Integrated Commercial Solutions (ICS), a division of AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group, a subsidiary of AmerisourceBergen, to act as our exclusive distributor for commercial shipment and distribution of Hylenex &#32;recombinant to our customers in the United States. In addition to distribution services, ICS provides us with other key services related to logistics, warehousing, returns and inventory management, contract administration and chargebacks processing and accounts receivable management. In addition, we utilize third parties to perform various other services for us relating to regulatory monitoring, including call center management, adverse event reporting, safety database management and other product maintenance services. 

Competition 

The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary therapeutics. We face competition from a number of sources, some of which may target the same indications as our product or product candidates, including large pharmaceutical companies, smaller pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions, many of which have greater financial resources, drug development experience, sales and marketing capabilities, including larger, well established sales forces, manufacturing capabilities, experience in obtaining regulatory approvals for product candidates and other resources than us. We face competition not only in the commercialization of Hylenex &#32;recombinant, but also for the in-licensing or acquisition of additional product candidates, and the out-licensing of our ENHANZE Technology. In addition, our collaborators face competition in the commercialization of the product candidates for which the collaborators seek marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities. 

HYLENEX Recombinant 

Hylenex &#32;recombinant is currently the only FDA approved recombinant human hyaluronidase on the market. The competitors for Hylenex recombinant include, but are not limited to, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc.&#8217;s FDA approved product, Vitrase &#174; , an ovine (ram) hyaluronidase, and Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc.&#8217;s product, Amphadase &#174; , a bovine (bull) hyaluronidase. In addition, some commercial pharmacies compound hyaluronidase preparations for institutions and physicians even though compounded preparations are not FDA approved products. 

Government Regulations 

The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in foreign countries regulate the manufacture and sale of the pharmaceutical products that we have developed or currently are developing. The FDA has established guidelines and safety standards that are applicable to the laboratory and preclinical evaluation and clinical investigation of therapeutic products and stringent regulations that govern the manufacture and sale of these products. The process of obtaining regulatory approval for a new therapeutic product usually requires a significant amount of time and substantial resources. The steps typically required before a product can be introduced for human use include: 

&#8226; 

animal pharmacology studies to obtain preliminary information on the safety and efficacy of a drug; or 

&#8226; 

laboratory and preclinical evaluation in vitro &#32;and in vivo &#32;including extensive toxicology studies. 

The results of these laboratory and preclinical studies may be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND (Investigational New Drug) application. The sponsor of an IND application may commence human testing of the compound 30 days after submission of the IND, unless notified to the contrary by the FDA. 

The clinical testing program for a new drug typically involves three phases: 

&#8226; 

Phase 1 investigations are generally conducted in healthy subjects (in certain instances, Phase 1 studies that determine the maximum tolerated dose and initial safety of the product candidate are performed in patients with the disease); 

&#8226; 

Phase 2 studies are conducted in limited numbers of subjects with the disease or condition to be treated and are aimed at determining the most effective dose and schedule of administration, evaluating both safety and whether the product demonstrates therapeutic effectiveness against the disease; and 

&#8226; 

Phase 3 studies involve large, well-controlled investigations in diseased subjects and are aimed at verifying the safety and effectiveness of the drug. 

Data from all clinical studies, as well as all laboratory and preclinical studies and evidence of product quality, are typically submitted to the FDA in a new drug application (NDA). The results of the preclinical and clinical testing of a biologic product candidate are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA, for evaluation to determine whether the product candidate may be approved for commercial sale. In responding to a BLA or NDA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information, or deny the application. Although the FDA&#8217;s requirements for clinical trials are well established and we believe that we have planned and conducted our clinical trials in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s applicable regulations and guidelines, these requirements, including requirements relating to testing the safety of drug candidates, may be subject to change as a result of recent announcements regarding safety problems with approved drugs. Additionally, we could be required to conduct additional trials beyond what we had planned due to the FDA&#8217;s safety and/or efficacy concerns or due to differing interpretations of the meaning of our clinical data. (See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. ) 

The FDA&#8217;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research must approve an NDA and the FDA&#8217;s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research must approve a BLA for a drug before it may be marketed in the United States. If we begin to market our proposed products for commercial sale in the U.S., any manufacturing operations that may be established in or outside the U.S. will also be subject to rigorous regulation, including compliance with cGMP. We also may be subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substance Control Act, the Export Control Act and other present and future laws of general application. In addition, the handling, care and use of laboratory animals are subject to the Guidelines for the Humane Use and Care of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health. 

Regulatory obligations continue post-approval, and include the reporting of adverse events when a drug is utilized in the broader patient population. Promotion and marketing of drugs is also strictly regulated, with penalties imposed for violations of FDA regulations, the Lanham Act and other federal and state laws, including the federal anti-kickback statute. 

We currently intend to continue to seek, directly or through our collaborators, approval to market our products and product candidates in foreign countries, which may have regulatory processes that differ materially from those of the FDA. We anticipate that we will rely upon independent consultants to seek and gain approvals to market our proposed products in foreign countries or may rely on other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies to license our proposed products. We cannot assure you that approvals to market any of our proposed products can be obtained in any country. Approval to market a product in any one foreign country does not necessarily indicate that approval can be obtained in other countries. 

From time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of drug products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency or reviewing courts in ways that may significantly affect our business and development of our product candidates and any products that we may commercialize. It is impossible to predict whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, or what the impact of any such changes may be.
