 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#65279; 

Our Business 

&#65279; 

Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (&#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is the largest producer and marketer of shell eggs in the United States. In fiscal 201 6 , we sold approximately 1,0 5 3. 6 million dozen shell eggs, which we believe represented approximately 23% of domestic shell egg consumption. Our total flock of approximately 3 3. 9 million layers and 9.4 million pullets and breeders is the largest in the U.S. Layers are mature female chickens, pullets are young female chickens usually under 18 weeks of age, and breeders are male and female chickens used to produce fertile eggs to be hatched for egg production flocks. 

&#65279; 

The C ompany has one operating segment, which is the production, grading, packaging, marketing and distribution of shell eggs. The majority of our customers rely on us to provide most of their shell egg needs, including specialty and non-specialty eggs. Specialty eggs represent a broad range of products. We classify nutritionally enhanced, cage free, organic and brown eggs as specialty products for accounting and reporting purposes. We classify all other shell eggs as non-specialty products. While we report separate sales information for these types of eggs, there are a number of cost factors which are not specifically available for non-specialty or specialty eggs due to the nature of egg production. We manage our operations and allocate resources to these types of eggs on a consolidated basis based on the demands of our customers. 

&#65279; 

We sell most of our shell eggs in the southwestern, southeastern, mid-western and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. We market our shell eggs through our extensive distribution network to a diverse group of customers, including national and regional grocery store chains, club stores, foodservice distributors and egg product consumers. Some of our sales are completed through co-pack agreements &#8211; a common practice in the industry whereby production and processing of certain products is outsourced to another producer. The strength of our position is evidenced by having the largest market share in the grocery segment for shell eggs . &#160; W e sell shell eggs to a majority of the largest food retailers in the U.S. 

&#65279; 

We are one of the largest producers and marketers of value-added specialty shell eggs in the U.S. For accounting and tax purposes, we classify nu tritionally enhanced, cage- free, organic and brown eggs as specialty shell eggs . &#160; They have been a significant and growing segment of the market in recent years. During our fiscal 2016 an increasing number of food service customers, large restaurant chains, and major retailers , including our largest customers, have committed to exclusive offerings of cage-free egg s by specified future dates. We are working with our customers to ensure &#160; a smooth transition in meeting their goals, and have been 

&#160;

making and expect to continue to make significant investments in new and remodeled facilities to meet this demand. In fiscal 201 6 , specialty shell eggs and co-pack specialty shell eggs represented 2 9.1 % and 2. 7 % of our shell egg sales dollars , respectively, and accounted for approximately 22.9 % and 2 .0 %, respectively, of our total shell egg volumes. In fiscal 201 5 , specialty shell eggs and co-pack specialty shell eggs represented 27.2 % and 2 .8 % of our shell egg sales dollars , respectively, and accounted for approximately 19.8 % and 2. 0 %, respectively, of our total shell egg volumes. P rices for specialty eggs are less cyclical than non-specialty shell egg prices and are generally higher due to consumer willingness to pay for the perceived increased benefits from those products. We market our specialty shell eggs under the following brands: Egg-Land&#8217;s Best &#174; , Land O&#8217; Lakes&#174;, Farmhouse &#174;, and 4-Grain&#174; . &#160; We are a member of the Egg-Land&#8217;s Best, Inc. (&#8220;EB&#8221;) cooperative and produce, market and distribute Egg-Land&#8217;s Best&#174; and Land O&#8217; Lakes&#174; branded eggs , along with our associated joint ventures, under exclusive license agreements for a number of states in the southeast, south central, and southwest U.S. &#160; as well as the New York City area. We market cage - free eggs under our trademarked Farmhouse&#174; brand and distribute them across the southeast and southwest regions of the U.S. We market organic, wholesome , cage-free, vegetarian, and omega-3 eggs under our 4-Grain &#174; brand. We also produce, market, and distribute private label specialty shell eggs to several customers. 

&#65279; 

We are a leader in industry consolidation. Since 1989, we have completed eighteen acquisitions ranging in size from 600,000 layers to 7.5 million layers. Despite a market that has been characterized by increasing consolidation, the shell egg production industry remains highly fragmented. At December 31, 201 5 , 5 6 producers, owning at least one million layers, own ed approximately 9 6 % of total industry layers and the ten largest producers own ed approximately 50 % of total industry layers. We believe industry consolidation will continue and we plan to capitalize on opportunities as they arise. 

&#65279; 

Industry Background 

Based on historical consumption trends, demand for shell eggs increases in line with overall population growth, averaging growth of about 1% per year. I n 2013 and 2014 , consumption of eggs grew approximately 2% per year. However in 2015, egg consumption decreased approximately 4% over the prior year primarily due to a shortage of supply of egg products . According to U.S. Department of Agriculture (&#8220;USDA&#8221;), annual per capita U.S. consumption varied between 24 9 and 2 63 eggs, since 2000. In calendar year 201 5 , per capita U.S. consumption was estimated to be 2 5 3 eggs, or approximately five eggs per person per week. Per capita consumption is determined by dividing the total supply of eggs by the entire population in the U.S. (i.e. all eggs supplied domestically by the egg industry are consumed). 

&#65279; 

While the data can vary somewhat from year to year, of eggs produced in the U.S., approximately 55% are sold to retail consumers (e.g. through grocery and convenience stores), approximately 31% are sold as egg products (shell eggs broken and sold in liquid, frozen, or dried form) to institutions (e.g. companies producing baked goods), approximately 9% are sold to food service companies and 5% or less are exported. Our sales are predominately to retail consumers; in fiscal 2016 and 2015, approximately 4% and 3% of our net sales was egg products, respectively. 

&#65279; 

Prices for Shell Eggs 

&#65279; 

Shell egg prices are a critical component of profitability for the Company and the industry as a whole . We believe the majority of shell eggs sold in the U.S. in the retail and foodservice channels are sold at prices related to the Urner Barry wholesale quotation for shell eggs. We sell the majority of our non-specialty shell eggs at prices related to Urner Barry Spot Egg Market Quotations or formulas related to our costs of production which include the cost of corn and soybean meal. For fiscal 2016, wholesale large shell egg prices in the southeast region, as quoted by Urner Barry, averaged $1.79 per dozen compared to an average of $1.38 per dozen for fiscal years 2012 to 2015. Egg prices during fiscal 2016 were impacted by the outbreak of avian influenza (&#8220;AI&#8221;) primarily in the upper Midwestern U.S. from April to June 2015, which initially caused a significant reduction in egg supplies and increase in egg prices and had a disproportionately large impact on suppliers of egg products . While the AI outbreak significantly impacted the supply and prices of eggs during fiscal 2016, there were no positive tests for AI at any of our locations. According to a USDA report as of June 1, 2016, the number of layers in the U.S. flock was up 10.2% compared to June 1, 2015, but remained 1.6% below the number of layers for June 1, 2014. This increase , from June 1, 2015 to 2016, is due to the repopulation of flocks depleted by the AI outbreak. The number of chicks hatched from January through May of 2016 was up 9.6% compared to the same period in 2015. Market prices for shell eggs have dropped significantly from the historically high levels we experienced at the beginning of this fiscal year. The Urner Barry price index hit a decade-low level during our fourth quarter, before recovering a portion of these declines in recent weeks. While retail demand trends for shell eggs have been favorable, there has been demand erosion for egg products and reduced egg exports. Based on USDA reports, the laying flock is expected to increase through the end of calendar 2016, creating more supply and the potential for further price declines. Egg prices will likely remain volatile and future 

&#160;

prices will depend on levels of supply and the recovery of institutional demand for eggs which was adversely impacted as a result of the 2015 shortages caused by AI. 

&#65279; 

Feed Costs for Shell Egg Production 

&#65279; 

Feed is a primary cost component in the production of shell eggs and represents over half of industry farm level production costs. Most shell egg producers , including us, are vertically integrated , manufacturing the majority of the feed they require for their operations. Although feed ingredients, primarily corn and soybean meal, are available from a number of sources, prices for ingredients can fluctuate and are affected by weather , speculators, and various supply and demand factors. Our feed prices for fiscal 201 6 were 5.7 % l ower than fiscal 201 5 . The large 2015 harvest increased available supplies of corn and soybean meal and favorably impacted our fiscal 2016 results, compared to the same period of fiscal 2015. Increased U.S. acreage for both corn and soybeans in 2016 should provide adequate domestic supplies for both of our primary feed ingredients. Domestic c orn supplies could be particularly robust , &#160; although domestic soybean stocks could be negatively impacted by increased exports due to reduced supplies from S outh America. &#160; 

&#160; 

Growth Strategy and Acquisitions 

&#65279; 

For many years, we have pursued a growth strategy focused on the acquisition of existing shell egg production and processing facilities, as well as the construction of new and more efficient facilities. Since the beginning of fiscal 1989, we have completed eighteen acquisitions. In addition, we have built numerous &#8220;in-line&#8221; shell egg production and processing facilities as well as pullet growing facilities which added to our capacity. The capacity increases have been accompanied by the retirement of older and less efficient facilities. The &#8220;in-line&#8221; facilities provide gathering, grading and packaging of shell eggs by less labor-intensive, more efficient, mechanical means. Additionally, we continue to upgrade and modify our facilities , and invest in new facilities, to meet changing demand as many food service customers , restaurant chains, and retailers have committed to exclusive offerings of cage-free eggs over the next several years . &#160; 

&#65279; 

As a result of our strategy, our total flock, including pullets, layers and breeders, increased from approximately 33. 5 million at May 2 8 , 201 1 to approximately 4 3.3 million as of May 28 , 201 6 . The dozens of shell eggs sold increased from approximately 8 21 .4 million in fiscal 20 1 1 to approximately 1,0 5 3. 6 million for fiscal 201 6 . Net sales amounted to $ 9 42.0 million in fiscal 20 1 1 compared to net sales of $1, 908.7 million in fiscal 201 6 . 

We continue to pursue opportunities to acquire companies engaged in the production and sale of shell eggs. We will continue to evaluate and selectively pursue acquisitions that will expand our shell egg production capabilities in existing markets and broaden our geographic reach. We have extensive experience identifying, valuing, executing, and integrating acquisitions and we intend to leverage that experience in the evaluation and execution of future acquisitions. We will seek to acquire regional shell egg businesses with significant market share and long-standing customer relationships. We believe enhancing our national presence will help us further strengthen our relationships with existing customers, many of whom have operations across the U.S. 

&#65279; 

Federal antitrust laws require regulatory approval of acquisitions that exceed certain threshold levels of significance, and we are subject to federal and state laws prohibiting anti-competitive conduct. We believe our sales of shell eggs during the last fiscal year represented approximately 23% of domestic shell egg sales, making us the largest producer and distributor of shell eggs in the U.S. However, because the shell egg production and distribution industry is so fragmented, we believe there are many acquisition opportunities available to us that would not be restricted pursuant to antitrust laws. 

&#160; 

Through exclusive license agreements with EB in several key territories and our trademarked Farmhouse&#174; and 4Grain&#174; brands, we are one of the leading producers and marketers of value-added specialty shell eggs. We also produce, market, and distribute private label specialty shell eggs to several customers. Since selling prices of specialty shell eggs are generally less volatile than &#160; non-specialty shell egg prices, we believe growing our specialty eggs business will enhance the stability of our margins. We expect the price of specialty eggs to remain at a premium to regular shell eggs, and intend to grow our specialty shell egg business. 

&#65279; 

The construction of new, more efficient production and processing facilities is an integral part of our growth strategy. Any such construction will require compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, including the receipt of permits that could cause schedule delays, although we have not experienced any significant delays in the past. 

&#65279; 

&#160;

Shell Eggs 

&#65279; 

Production . Our operations are fully integrated. We hatch chicks, grow and maintain flocks of pullets, layers, and breeders, manufacture feed, and produce, process, package, and distribute shell eggs. We produce approximately 7 8 % of our total shell eggs sold, with 9 6 % of such production coming from company-owned facilities, and the other 4 % coming from contract producers. Under a typical arrangement with a contract producer, we own the flock, furnish all feed and critical supplies, own the shell eggs produced and assume market risks. The contract producers own and operate their facilities and are paid a fee based on production with incentives for performance. We purchase a pproximately 2 2 % of the total shell eggs we sell from outside producers. 

&#65279; 

The commercial production of shell eggs requires a source of baby chicks for laying flock replacement. We produce the majority of our chicks in our own hatcheries and obtain the balance from commercial sources. We own breeder and hatchery facilities capable of producing 21.2 million pullet chicks per year in a computer-controlled environment. These pullets are distributed to 4 4 state-of-the-art laying operations around the southwestern, southeastern, mid-western and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. The facilities produce an average of 2. 2 million dozen shell eggs per day . The shell eggs are process ed, grad ed and packag ed predominantly without handling by human hands. We have spent a cumulative total of $ 270.7 million over the past five years to expand and upgrad e our facilities with the most advanced equipment and technology available in our industry. We believe our constant attention to production efficiencies and focus on automation throughout the supply chain enables us to be a low cost supplier in all the markets in which we compete. 

&#65279; 

Feed cost represents the largest element of our farm egg production cost, ranging from 60 % to 69% of total farm production cost in the last five fiscal years. Although feed ingredients are available from a number of sources, we have little, if any, control over the prices of the ingredients we purchase, which are affected by weather , speculators, and various supply and demand factors. For example, the severe drought in the summer of 2012 and resulting damage to the national corn and soybean crop resulted in high and volatile feed costs. Increases in feed costs un accompanied by increases in the selling price of eggs can have a material adverse effect on our operations. However, higher feed costs can encourage shell egg producers to reduce production, resulting in higher egg prices. Alternatively, low feed costs can encourage industry overproduction, possibly resulting in lower egg prices. 

&#65279; 

After the eggs are produced, they are graded and packaged. Substantially all of our farms have modern &#8220;in-line&#8221; facilities to mechanically gather, grade and package the eggs produced. The increased use of in-line facilities has generated significant cost savings compared to the cost of eggs produced from non-in-line facilities. In addition to greater efficiency, the in-line facilities produce a higher percentage of USDA Grade A eggs, which sell at higher prices. Eggs produced on farms owned by contractors are brought to our processing plants to be graded and packaged. Since shell eggs are perishable, we maintain very low egg inventories, usually consisting of approximately four days of production. 

&#65279; 

Egg production activities are subject to risks inherent in the agriculture industry, such as weather conditions and disease. These risks are outside our control and could have a material adverse effect on our operations. The marketability of shell eggs is subject to risks such as possible changes in food consumption preferences and practices reflecting perceived health concerns. 

&#65279; 

We operate in a cyclical industry with total demand that is generally steady and a product that is generally price-inelastic. Thus, small increases in production or decreases in demand can have a large adverse effect on prices and vice-versa. However, economic conditions in the egg industry are expected to exhibit less cyclicality in the future. The industry is concentrating into fewer but stronger hands, which should help lessen the extreme cyclicality of the past. 

Marketing . Of the 1, 0 53.6 million dozen shell eggs sold by us in fiscal &#160; 201 6 , our flocks produced 819.3 million. 

&#65279; 

We sell our shell eggs to a diverse group of customers, including national and local grocery store chains, club stores, foodservice distributors, and egg product consumers. We utilize electronic ordering and invoicing systems that enable us to manage inventory for certain of our customers. Our top ten customers accounted for an aggregate of 70.6 %, 6 7 . 9 %, and 6 8 . 5 % of net sales dollars for fiscal 201 6 , 201 5 , and 201 4 , respectively. Two customers, Wal-Mart Stores and Sam&#8217;s Club, on a combined basis, accounted for 28.9 %, 2 5 . 7 %, and 28 . 2 % of net sales dollars during fiscal 20 1 6 , 201 5 , and 201 4 , respectively. 

&#65279; 

The majority of eggs sold are sold based on the daily or short-term needs of our customers . Most sales to established accounts are on open account with payment terms ranging from seven to 30 days. Although we have established long-term relationships with many of our customers, many of them are free to acquire shell eggs from other sources. 

&#65279; 

&#160;

The shell eggs we sell are either delivered to our customers&#8217; warehouse or retail stores by our own fleet or contracted refrigerated delivery trucks, or are picked up by our customers at our processing facilities. 

&#65279; 

We sell our shell eggs at prices generally related to independently quoted wholesale market prices or at formulas related to our costs of production. Wholesale prices are subject to wide fluctuations. The prices of shell eggs reflect fluctuations in the quoted market and changes in corn and soybean meal prices, and the results of our shell egg operations are materially affected by changes in market quotations and feed costs. Egg prices reflect a number of economic conditions, such as the supply of eggs and the demand level, which, in turn, are influenced by a number of factors we cannot control. No representation can be made as to the future level of prices. 

&#65279; 

According to USDA reports, for the past five years, U.S. annual per capita egg consumption &#160; grew from 2 50 in 20 11 to 2 63 &#160; in 2014 , before dropping back to 253 in 2015 . We believe the decrease in consumption in 2015 is attributable to a shortage of supply and increase d shell egg prices caused by a severe outbreak of avian influenza. Looking ahead, w e believe fast food restaurant consumption, high protein diet trends, reduced egg cholesterol levels, and industry advertising campaigns may result in increased per capita egg consumption levels; &#160; however , &#160; no assurance can be given that per capita consumption will not decline in the future. 

&#65279; 

We sell the majority of our shell eggs across the southwestern, southeastern, mid-western and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. We are a major factor in egg marketing in a majority of these states. Many states in our market area are egg deficit regions which are areas where production of fresh shell eggs is less than total consumption. Competition from other producers in specific market areas is generally based on price, service, and quality of product. Strong competition exists in each of our markets. 

&#65279; 

Seasonality. Retail sales of shell eggs are greatest during the fall and winter months and lowest during the summer months. Prices for shell eggs fluctuate in response to seasonal demand factors and a natural increase in egg production during the spring and early summer. We generally experience lower sales and net income in our fourth and first fiscal quarters ending in May and August, respectively. During the past ten fiscal years, t wo of our first quarters resulted in net operating losses, and during this same period, two of our fourth quarters resulted in net operating losses. 

&#65279; 

Specialty Eggs. We produce specialty eggs such as Egg-Land&#8217;s Best&#174;, Land O&#8217; Lakes&#174;, 4Grain&#174;, and Farmhouse&#174; branded eggs. Specialty eggs are intended to meet the demands of consumers who are sensitive to environmental, health and/or animal welfare issues. Specialty shell eggs are becoming a more significant segment of the shell egg market. During our fiscal 2016 an increasing number of large restaurant chains, food service companies and grocery chains, including our largest customers, announced goals to transition to a cage-free egg supply chain by specified future dates. For fiscal 201 6 , specialty eggs accounted for 29.1 % of our shell egg dollar sales and 22.9 % of our shell egg dozens sold, as compared to 27 . 2 % of shell egg dollar sales and 1 9 . 8 % of shell egg dozens sold in fiscal 201 5 . Additionally, specialty eggs sold through our co-pack arrangements accounted for an additional 2.7 % of shell egg dollar sales and 2.0 % of shel l egg dozens sold in fiscal 201 6, compared with 2 . 8 % of shell egg dollar sales and 2. 0 % of shell egg dozens sold in fiscal 20 1 5 . We produce and process Egg-Land&#8217;s Best&#174; branded eggs under license from EB at our facilities under EB guidelines. The product is marketed to our established base of customers at premium prices compared to non-specialty shell eggs. Egg-Land&#8217;s Best&#174; branded eggs accounted for approximately 16.8 % of our shell egg dollar sales in fiscal 201 6 , compared to 1 5 . 5 % in fiscal 20 1 5 . Based on dozens sold, Egg-Land&#8217;s Best&#174; branded eggs accounted for 13.6 % of dozens sold for fiscal 201 6 , compared to 11 . 4 % in fiscal 201 5 . Land O&#8217; Lakes&#174; branded eggs are produced by hens that are fed a whole grain diet, with no animal fat, and no animal by-products. Farmhouse&#174; brand eggs are produced at our facilities by cage- free hens that are provided with a diet of all grain, vegetarian feed. Our 4Grain&#174; brand consists of both caged and cage - free eggs. Farmhouse&#174;, Land O&#8217; Lakes&#174;, 4Grain&#174; and other non- Egg-Land&#8217;s Best&#174; specialty eggs accounted for 12.3 % of our shell egg dollar sales in fiscal 201 6, compared to 11 . 7 % in fiscal 201 5 , and 9.3 % of dozens sold for fiscal 201 6 , compared to 8 . 4 % for fiscal 20 1 5 . 

Egg Products. Egg products are shell eggs broken and sold in liquid, frozen, or dried form. &#160; In fiscal 201 6 egg products represented approximately 4 % of our net sales compared with approximately 3% in fiscal 2015 . We sell egg products primarily into the institutional and food service sectors in the U.S. Our egg products are sold through our consolidated subsidiaries American Egg Products, LLC located in Blackshear, Georgia and Texas Egg Products, LLC located in Waelder, Texas. Prices for egg products are directly related to Urner Barry quoted price levels. 

&#65279; 

Competition . The production, processing, and distribution of shell eggs is an intensely competitive business, which traditionally has attracted large numbers of producers. Shell egg competition is generally based on price, service, and product quality. 

&#65279; 

&#160;

The U.S. shell egg industry remains highly fragmented but is characterized by a growing concentration of producers. In 201 5 , 5 6 producers with one million or more layers owned 9 6 % of the 291 million total U.S. layers, compared to 2000, when 63 producers with one million or more layers owned 79% of the 273 million total layers, and 1990, when 56 producers with one million or more layers owned 64% of the 232 million total layers. We believe a continuation of the concentration trend will result in reduced cyclicality of shell egg prices, but no assurance can be given in that regard. A continuation of this trend could also create greater competition among fewer producers. 

&#65279; 

Patents and Trade Names . We own the trademarks Farmhouse&#174;, Rio Grande&#174; , Sunups&#174;, Sunny Meadow&#174; and 4Grain&#174; . We do not own any patents or proprietary technologies. We produce and market Egg-Land's Best &#174; &#160; and Land O&#8217; Lakes&#174; branded eggs under license agreements with EB. We believe these trademarks and license agreements are important to our business. We do not know of any infringing uses that would materially affect the use of these trademarks, and we actively defend and enforce them. 

&#65279; 

Government Regulation . Our facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local agencies, including, but not limited to, the United States Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;), USDA, Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) , Occupational Safety and Health Administration and corresponding state agencies. The applicable regulations relate to grading, quality control, labeling, sanitary control and waste disposal. Our shell egg facilities are subject to periodic USDA , FDA and EP A inspections. Our feed production facilities are subject to FDA regulation and inspections. In addition, we maintain our own inspection program to ensure compliance with our own standards and customer specifications. We are not aware of any major capital expenditures necessary to comply with current statutes and regulations; however, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs for compliance with such statutes and regulations in the future. In addition, rules are often proposed that, if adopted as proposed, could have the effect of increasing our costs. For example, in April 2016 the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service proposed rules that, if adopted, would change requirements, and increase our costs, for the production of organic eggs. 

&#65279; 

Environmental Regulation. Our operations and facilities are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation, disposal, and remediation of hazardous materials. Under these laws and regulations, we are required to obtain permits from governmental authorities, including, but not limited to, wastewater discharge permits. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures relating to compliance with existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and permits. We are not currently aware of any major capital expenditures necessary to comply with such laws and regulations; however, because environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent, including those relating to animal wastes and wastewater discharges, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs for compliance with such laws and regulations in the future. 

&#65279; 

Employees . As of May 28 , 201 6, we had 3,277 employees, of whom 2,649 worked in egg production, processing and marketing, 178 worked in feed mill operations and 450 were administrative employees, including our executive officers. Approximately 4.1 % of our personnel are part-time. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relations with employees to be good.
