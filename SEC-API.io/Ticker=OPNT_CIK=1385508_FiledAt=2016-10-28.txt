 Item 1. Business. 

&#160; 

Our Company 

&#160;

Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;), a Nevada corporation, is a specialty pharmaceutical company which develops pharmacological treatments for substance use, addictive and eating disorders. The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 21, 2005 as Madrona Ventures, Inc. and, on September 16, 2009, the Company changed its name to Lightlake Therapeutics Inc. On January 28, 2016, the Company again changed its name to Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year end is July 31.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s strategy is to develop pharmacological treatments for substance use, addictive and eating disorders based on the Company&#8217;s expertise using opioid antagonists. The Company has worked on developing a treatment for reversing opioid overdoses in collaboration with the National Institute on Drug Abuse (&#8220;NIDA&#8221;), part of the National Institutes of Health (&#8220;NIH&#8221;). This treatment, now known as NARCAN&#174; (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) in November 2015, and is marketed by Adapt Pharma Operations Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Adapt Pharma Limited (&#8220;Adapt&#8221;), an Ireland-based pharmaceutical company.

&#160;

The Company has not consistently attained profitable operations and has historically depended upon obtaining sufficient financing to fund its operations. The Company anticipates if revenues are not sufficient then additional funding will be required in the form of debt financing and/or equity financing from the sale of the Company&#8217;s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the &#8220;Common Stock&#8221;), and/or financings from the sale of interests in the Company&#8217;s prospective products and/or royalty transactions. However, the Company may not be able to generate sufficient revenues or raise sufficient funding to fund the Company&#8217;s operations.

&#160;

The Company has not had a bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding. The Company has not had material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations, or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business. The Company is required to comply with all regulations, rules and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the clinical testing and manufacturing and sale of pharmaceutical products.

&#160;

In December 2014, the Company effected a one-for-one hundred reverse stock split of its Common Stock (the &#8220;1:100 Reverse Stock Split&#8221;) which decreased the number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding from approximately 182.0 million shares to approximately 1.82 million shares. Unless otherwise noted, all share amounts listed in this Annual Report have been retroactively adjusted for the 1:100 Reverse Stock Split as if such stock split occurred prior to the issuance of such shares. Impacted amounts include but are not limited to shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding, stock options, shares reserved, exercise prices of warrants or options, and loss per share. There was no impact on preferred or Common Stock authorized resulting from the 1:100 Reverse Stock Split.

&#160;

The Company developed NARCAN&#174; (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray, a treatment to reverse opioid overdoses, which was conceived, licensed, developed, approved by the FDA and commercialized in less than three years. The Company plans to replicate this relatively low cost, successful business strategy primarily through developing nasal opioid antagonists in the field of developing pharmacological treatments for substance use, addictive, and eating disorders. The Company aims to identify and progress drug development opportunities with the potential to file additional New Drug Applications (&#8220;NDA&#8221;) with the FDA within three years. The Company also plans to identify and progress drug development opportunities with potentially larger markets, potentially larger addressable patient populations and greater revenue potential. In addition, the Company plans to invest in long-term development opportunities by identifying early stage product candidates with novel modes of action.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s current pipeline of product candidates includes a treatment for Binge Eating Disorder (&#8220;BED&#8221;), a treatment for Bulimia Nervosa (&#8220;BN&#8221;), a treatment for Cocaine Use Disorder (&#8220;CocUD&#8221;) and a heroin vaccine. The Company also is focused on other treatment opportunities.

Opioid Overdose Reversal 

&#160;

Naloxone is a medicine that can reverse the overdose of prescription and illicit opioids and that historically has been available through injection. The Company&#8217;s intranasal delivery system of naloxone could widely expand its availability and use in preventing opioid overdose deaths.

&#160;

On April 16, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement and subsequently received funding from an investor, Potomac Construction Limited (&#8220;Potomac&#8221;), in the amount of $600,000 for the research, development, marketing and commercialization of a product relating to the Company&#8217;s treatment to reverse opioid overdoses (the &#8220;Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product&#8221;). In exchange for this funding, the Company agreed to provide the investor with a 6.0% interest (the &#8220;6.0% Investor Interest&#8221;) in the &#8220;OORT Net Profit&#8221; generated from the product in perpetuity. &#8220;OORT Net Profit&#8221; is defined as any pre-tax profits received by the Company that was derived from the sale of the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product less any and all expenses incurred by and payments made by the Company in connection with the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product, including but not limited to an allocation of Company overhead based on the proportionate time, expenses and resources devoted by the Company to product-related activities, which allocation shall be determined in good faith by the Company. The investor also has rights with respect to the 6.0% Investor Interest if the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product is sold or the Company is sold. If the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product is not introduced to the market and not approved for marketing within 24 months, the investor will have a 60 day option to exchange its 6.0% Investor Interest for 75,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company. During the year ended July 31, 2015, the Company recognized $600,000 as revenue because the investor&#8217;s option to receive the shares of Common Stock expired unexercised, and the research and development work related to the product was completed as of July 31, 2015.

&#160;

On May 30, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement with an investor, Potomac, and subsequently received additional funding totaling $150,000 for the research, development, marketing and commercialization of the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product. In exchange for this funding, the Company agreed to provide the investor with a 1.5% interest (the &#8220;2013 1.5% Investor Interest&#8221;) in the OORT Net Profit generated from the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product in perpetuity. The investor also has rights with respect to the 2013 1.5% Investor Interest if the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product is sold or the Company is sold. If the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was not introduced to the market and not approved for marketing within 24 months of the date of the agreement, the investor would have had a 60 day option to exchange its 2013 1.5% Investor Interest for 18,750 shares of Common Stock of the Company. During the year ended July 31, 2015, the Company recognized $150,000 as revenue because the investor&#8217;s option to receive the shares of Common Stock expired unexercised, and the research and development work related to the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was completed as of July 31, 2015. 

&#160;

On March 14, 2014, the Company filed U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/953,379. This application addresses delivery devices and methods of treating opioid overdoses through the administration of intranasal naloxone.

&#160;

On May 15, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement and subsequently received funding from an investor, Ernst Welmers, in the amount of $300,000 for use by the Company for any purpose. In exchange for this funding, the Company agreed to provide the investor with a 1.5% interest (the &#8220;2014 1.5% Investor Interest&#8221;) in the OORT Net Profit generated from the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product in perpetuity. The investor also has rights with respect to the 2014 1.5% Investor Interest if the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product is sold or the Company is sold. If the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was not approved by the FDA by May 15, 2016, the investor would have had a 60 day option to exchange its 2014 1.5% Investor Interest for 37,500 shares of Common Stock of the Company. The Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was approved by the FDA on November 18, 2015, and, as a result, the investor did not realize the option to exchange its 2014 1.5% Investor Interest for shares of Common Stock of the Company. During the year ended July 31, 2016, the Company recognized $300,000 as revenue because the investor&#8217;s option to receive the shares of Common Stock was not realized, and the research and development work related to the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was completed as of July 31, 2016.

&#160;

On July 9, 2014, the Company filed U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/022,268 with respect to the Company&#8217;s treating opioid overdoses through the administration of intranasal naloxone.

&#160;

On July 22, 2014, the Company received a $3,000,000 commitment from a foundation (the &#8220;Foundation&#8221;) which later assigned its interest to Valour Fund, LLC (&#8220;Valour&#8221;), from which the Company had the right to make capital calls from the Foundation for the research, development, marketing, commercialization and any other activities connected to the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product, certain operating expenses and any other purpose consistent with the goals of the Foundation. In exchange for funds invested by the Foundation, Valour currently owns a 6.0% interest in the OORT Net Profit (the &#8220;6.0% Fund Interest&#8221;) generated from the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product in perpetuity. Valour also has rights with respect to the 6.0% Fund Interest if the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product is sold or the Company is sold. Additionally, the Company may buy back, in whole or in part, the 6.0% Fund Interest within 2.5 years or after 2.5 years of the July 22, 2014 initial investment date at a price of two times or 3.5 times, respectively, the relevant investment amount represented by the interests to be bought back. If the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was not approved by the FDA or an equivalent body in Europe for marketing and was not actually marketed by July 22, 2016, the Foundation would have had a 60 day option to receive shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock in lieu of the 6.0% Fund Interest in the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product at an exchange rate of 10 shares for every dollar of its investment. On July 28, 2014, the Company received an initial investment of $111,470 from the Foundation in exchange for a 0.22294% interest. On August 13, 2014, September 8, 2014, November 13, 2014 and February 17, 2015, the Company made capital calls of $422,344, $444,530, $1,033,614 and $988,042, respectively, from the Foundation in exchange for 0.844687%, 0.888906%, 2.067228% and 1.976085% interests, respectively, in the OORT Net Profit. The Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was approved by the FDA on November 18, 2015, and, as a result, the investor did not realize the option to exchange its 6.0% Fund Interest for shares of Common Stock of the Company. During the year ended July 31, 2016, the Company recognized $3,000,000 as revenue because the option to receive the shares of Common Stock was not realized, and the research and development work related to the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was completed as of July 31, 2016.

&#160;

On September 9, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with an investor, Potomac, and subsequently received funding from an individual investor in the amount of $500,000 for use by the Company for any purpose. In exchange for this funding, the Company agreed to provide the investor with a 0.98% interest in the OORT Net Profit (the &#8220;September 2014 0.98% Investor Interest&#8221;) generated from the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product in perpetuity. The investor also has rights with respect to the 0.98% Investor Interest if the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product is sold or the Company is sold. Additionally, the Company may buy back, in whole or in part, the September 2014 0.98% Investor Interest (i) within 2.5 years or (ii) after 2.5 years, but no later than four years, of the September 9, 2014 initial investment date, at a price equal to two times or 3.5 times, respectively, the relevant investment amount represented by the interests to be bought back. If the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was not introduced to the market and not approved by the FDA or an equivalent body in Europe and not marketed within 24 months of the September 9, 2014 initial investment date, the investor would have had a 60 day option to exchange the September 2014 0.98% Interest for 50,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company. The Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was approved by the FDA on November 18, 2015 and, as a result, the investor did not realize the option to exchange the September 2014 0.98% Interest for 50,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company. During the year ended July 31, 2016, the Company recognized $500,000 as revenue because the option to receive the shares of Common Stock was not realized, and the research and development work related to the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was completed as of July 31, 2016.

&#160;

On October 31, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with an investor, Potomac, and subsequently received funding from an individual investor in the amount of $500,000 for use by the Company for any purpose.

The investor also has rights with respect to its 0.98% interest if the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product is sold or the Company is sold. Additionally, the Company may buy back, in whole or in part, the October 2014 0.98% Investor Interest from the investor (i) within 2.5 years or (ii) after 2.5 years, but no later than four years, of the October 31, 2014 investment date at a price equal to two times or 3.5 times, respectively, the relevant investment amount represented by the interests to be bought back.

On December 15, 2014, the Company and Adapt entered into a license agreement (the &#8220;Adapt Agreement&#8221;). The Adapt Agreement has no set duration but may be terminated, among other ways, by Adapt in its sole discretion, either in its entirety or in respect of one or more countries, at any time by providing 60 days prior notice to the Company. Pursuant to the Adapt Agreement, Adapt received from the Company a global license to develop and commercialize the Company&#8217;s intranasal naloxone Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product. In exchange for licensing its treatment to Adapt, the Company could receive total potential regulatory and sales milestone payments of more than $55 million, plus up to double-digit percentage royalties on net sales. The Adapt Agreement provided for an upfront and nonrefundable payment of $500,000, and monthly payments for up to one year for participation in joint development committee calls and the production and submission of an initial development plan. The Adapt Agreement also required the Company to contribute $2,500,000 of development, regulatory, and commercialization costs, some of which was credited for costs incurred by the Company prior to the execution of the Adapt Agreement. The Company fulfilled its requirement to contribute $2,500,000 during the three months ended October 31, 2015. Upon termination of the Adapt Agreement, (i) all rights granted by the Company thereunder shall immediately terminate; (ii) Adapt shall grant the Company an exclusive license, with the right to grant multiple tiers of sublicenses, under the &#8220;Adapt Applied Patents&#8221;, &#8220;Adapt Applied Know-How&#8221;, and Adapt&#8217;s rights under the &#8220;Joint Patents&#8221; and &#8220;Joint Know-How to Exploit Products&#8221; (as such terms in quotation marks are defined in the Adapt Agreement); (iii) Adapt shall assign to the Company, at Adapt&#8217;s expense, all of its right, title, and interest in and to all &#8220;Regulatory Approvals&#8221; applicable to any &#8220;Product&#8221;, and all &#8220;Regulatory Documentation&#8221; specific to such Regulatory Approvals then owned by Adapt or any of its &#8220;Affiliates&#8221;, and shall use &#8220;Commercially Reasonable Efforts&#8221; to cause any and all &#8220;Sublicensees&#8221; (as such terms in quotation marks are defined in the Adapt Agreement) to assign to the Company any such Regulatory Approvals and related Regulatory Documentation then owned by such Sublicensee; (iv) Adapt shall grant the Company an exclusive, license and right of reference, with the right to grant multiple tiers of sublicenses and further rights of reference, under all Regulatory Documentation (including any Regulatory Approvals) then owned or &#8220;Controlled&#8221; by Adapt or any of its Affiliates that are not assigned to the Company pursuant to (iii) above that are necessary or useful for the Company or any of its Affiliates or sublicensees to &#8220;Exploit&#8221; any Product and any improvement to any of the foregoing, as such Regulatory Documentation exists as of the effective date of such termination of the Adapt Agreement and Adapt shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause its &#8220;Commercial Sublicensees&#8221; (as such terms in quotation marks are defined in the Adapt Agreement) to grant comparable rights under all Regulatory Documentation (including any Regulatory Approvals) then owned or Controlled by such Commercial Sublicensees; (v) at the Company&#8217;s request, assign to the Company all right, title, and interest of Adapt in each &#8220;Product Trademark&#8221; (as defined in the Adapt Agreement) at Adapt&#8217;s expense; and (vi) at the Company&#8217;s request, assign to the Company all right, title, and interest in and to the &#8220;Development Data&#8221; (as defined in the Adapt Agreement) that Adapt is not precluded from disclosing or assigning to the Company pursuant to the terms of any applicable agreement with a &#8220;Third Party&#8221; (as defined in the Adapt Agreement); provided , however , that Adapt shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts (which shall not include any obligation to expend money) to obtain the consent of the applicable Third Party for such disclosure and/or assignment in the event that Adapt is so precluded.

&#160;

On February 17, 2015, the Company announced that Adapt received &#8220;Fast Track&#8221; designation by the FDA.

&#160;

On April 22, 2015, the Company announced that Adapt successfully completed a pharmacokinetic study of intranasal naloxone. This study had been designed and conducted by the Company in collaboration with NIDA. The pharmacokinetic study compared intranasal naloxone with an injectable formulation of naloxone. The study met its objectives and demonstrated the intranasal formulation of naloxone delivered the targeted naloxone dose as expected. 

&#160;

On June 3, 2015, the Company announced that Adapt commenced a rolling submission of a NDA to the FDA for a nasal spray formulation of naloxone. A rolling submission allows completed portions of the NDA to be submitted and reviewed by the FDA on an ongoing basis.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

On July 29, 2015, the Company announced that Adapt submitted a NDA to the FDA for NARCAN&#174; (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray, an investigational drug intended to treat opioid overdose.

&#160;

On November 18, 2015, the FDA approved NARCAN&#174; (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray for the emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose, to be marketed by Adapt.

&#160;

On December 8, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with an investor, Potomac, to receive $500,000 for use by the Company for any purpose, which $500,000 was invested by December 18, 2015. In exchange for this funding, the Company granted the investor a 0.75% interest in the OORT Net Profit (the &#8220;0.75% Investor Interest&#8221;) generated from the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product in perpetuity. The investor also has rights with respect to its 0.75% Investor Interest if the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product is sold or the Company is sold. Additionally, the Company may buy back, in whole or in part, the 0.75% Investor Interest, from the investor (i) within 2.5 years or (ii) after 2.5 years, but no later than four years, of the December 8, 2015 initial investment date, at a price of two times or 3.5 times, respectively, the relevant investment amount represented by the interests to be bought back. Such buyback can be for a portion of the 0.75% Investor Interest rather than for the entire interest. The investor also had an option to invest an additional $1,000,000 by February 29, 2016 for use by the Company for any purpose in exchange for a 1.50% interest in the OORT Net Profit. If such investment were made, then the investor also would have rights with respect to its 1.50% interest if the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was sold or the Company was sold. This investor option expired unexercised. During the year ended July 31, 2016, the Company recognized $500,000 as revenue because the investment did not contain any option to exchange the 0.75% Investor Interest for shares of Common Stock of the Company, and the research and development work related to the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product was completed as of July 31, 2016.

This program will collaborate with the Clinton Health Matters Initiative, an initiative of the Clinton Foundation, as part of its work to scale naloxone access efforts nationally. In addition, Adapt has provided a grant to the National Association of School Nurses (NASN) to support their educational efforts concerning opioid overdose education materials.

&#160;

On March 7, 2016, the Company announced the receipt of a $2.5 million milestone payment from Adapt. This milestone payment was triggered by the first commercial sale of NARCAN&#174; (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray in the U.S.

&#160;

On April 29, 2016, the Company received $105,097 in royalty payments due from Adapt from commercial sales of NARCAN&#174; (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray in the U.S during the first quarter of Adapt&#8217;s fiscal year.

On September 15, 2016, the Company and Adapt received notice from TEVA Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (&#8220;TEVA&#8221;), pursuant to 21 U.S.C. &#167; 355(j)(2)(B)(ii) (the &#8220;Notice Letter&#8221;), that TEVA had filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application (&#8220;ANDA&#8221;) with the FDA seeking regulatory approval to market a generic version of NARCAN&#174; (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray before the expiration of U.S. Patent No. 9,211,253 (the &#8220;&#8217;253 patent&#8221;). The &#8216;253 patent is listed with respect to NARCAN&#174; (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray in the FDA&#8217;s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalents Evaluation publication (commonly referred to as the &#8220;Orange Book&#8221;) and expires on March 16, 2035. TEVA&#8217;s Notice Letter asserts that its generic product will not infringe the &#8216;253 patent or that the &#8216;253 patent is invalid or unenforceable. The Company and Adapt have been evaluating TEVA&#8217;s Notice Letter. The Company has full confidence in its intellectual property portfolio related to NARCAN&#174; (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray and expects that the &#8216;253 patent will be vigorously defended from any infringement. The Company may receive additional Notice Letters from other companies seeking to market generic versions of NARCAN&#174; (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray in the future and, after evaluation, the Company may commence patent infringement lawsuits against such companies.

&#160;

On October 5, 2016, the Company announced that Health Canada approved Adapt&#8217;s naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray to treat opioid overdose, to be marketed as NARCAN&#174; Nasal Spray.

&#160;

On October 21, 2016, Adapt, Adapt Pharma Operations Limited and the Company (collectively, the &#8220;Plaintiffs&#8221;) filed a complaint for patent infringement against TEVA and TEVA Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. (collectively, the &#8220;Defendants&#8221;) in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey arising from TEVA&#8217;s U.S.&#8217;s filing of the ANDA with the FDA. The Plaintiffs seek, among other relief, an order that the effective date of FDA approval of the ANDA be a date later than the expiration of the &#8216;253 patent, as well as equitable relief enjoining the Defendants from infringing the &#8216;253 patent and monetary relief as a result of any such infringement. The Company has full confidence in its intellectual property portfolio related to NARCAN&#174; (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray and expects that the &#8216;253 patent will continue to be vigorously defended from any infringement.

&#160;

On October 27, 2016, the Company announced that its patent for NARCAN&#174; Nasal Spray is now listed in the FDA publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book, patent number 9468747.

Binge Eating Disorder 

&#160;

The Company is developing a treatment for BED. BED is defined in the American Psychiatric Association&#8217;s (&#8220;APA&#8221;) fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (&#8220;DSM-5&#8221;) chapter on feeding and eating disorders as a diagnosis for individuals who experience persistent, recurrent episodes of overeating, marked by loss of control and significant clinical distress. DSM-5 is used by clinicians and researchers to diagnose and classify mental disorders in order to improve diagnoses, treatment and research.

&#160;

BED is the most common eating disorder in the U.S. Approximately 8 million Americans are diagnosed with BED and it is correlated with obesity. In addition, according to the APA, BED is associated with significant physical and psychological problems.&#8221;

&#160;

In 2015, Shire PLC received FDA approval to use Vyvanse to treat BED in adults. The Company considers naloxone to be a potentially compelling drug for the pharmacological treatment of BED. It has a well-known safety profile and has the potential to block the reward that patients experience from bingeing.

&#160;

On May 23, 2013, the Company presented the results of the Company&#8217;s Phase II clinical trial of its nasal spray treatment for BED at the APA Annual Meeting in San Francisco.

&#160;

On December 17, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement with an investor, Potomac, and subsequently received additional funding totaling $250,000 for use by the Company for any purpose. In exchange for this funding, the Company agreed to provide the investor with a 0.5% interest in the Company&#8217;s BED treatment product (the &#8220;BED Treatment Product&#8221;) and pay the investor 0.5% of the BED Net Profit in perpetuity (the &#8220;2013 0.5% Investor Interest&#8221;). &#8220;BED Net Profit&#8221; is defined as the pre-tax profit generated from the BED Treatment Product after the deduction of all expenses incurred by and payments made by the Company in connection with the BED Treatment Product, including but not limited to an allocation of Company overhead. If the BED Treatment Product is not approved by the FDA by December 17, 2016, the investor will have a 60 day option to exchange its entire 0.5% Investor Interest for 31,250 shares of Common Stock of the Company.

&#160;

On September 17, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with an investor, Potomac, and subsequently received funding totaling $500,000 for use by the Company for any purpose. In exchange for this funding, the Company agreed to provide the investor with a 1.0% interest in the Company&#8217;s BED Treatment Product and pay the investor 1.0% of the BED Net Profit generated from the BED Treatment Product in perpetuity (the &#8220;1.0% Investor Interest&#8221;). If the BED Treatment Product is not approved by the FDA by September 17, 2017, the investor will have a 60 day option to exchange its entire 1.0% Investor Interest for 62,500 shares of Common Stock of the Company.

&#160;

On July 20, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with an investor, Potomac, and subsequently received funding from an individual investor in the amount of $250,000 for use by the Company for any purpose. In exchange for this funding, the Company agreed to provide the investor with a 0.50% interest in the BED Net Profit (the &#8220;2015 0.5% Investor Interest&#8221;) generated from the BED Treatment Product in perpetuity. The investor also has rights with respect to the 2015 0.5% Investor Interest if the BED Treatment Product is sold or the Company is sold. If the product is not introduced to the market and not approved by the FDA or an equivalent body in Europe and not marketed by July 20, 2018, the investor will have a 60 day option to exchange the 2015 0.5% Investor Interest for 25,000 shares of Common Stock of the Company.

&#160;

The Company now aims to collaborate with other parties and progress its drug development program for BED and plans to initiate a BED study in the first half of 2017.

&#160;

Bulimia Nervosa 

&#160;

Bulimia Nervosa (&#8220;BN&#8221;) is an eating disorder characterized by binging and purging, and is most common in young women. BN is thought to be significantly under-recognized. According to Hudson, JI, Hirpi, E, Pope, HG, et al. (The Prevalence and Correlates of Eating Disorders in National Comorbidity Survey Replication. Biol Psychiatry. 2&#8212;7;61:348-358), in the U.S., the lifetime prevalence of BN is 1% to 2%. Patients with BN have a 94.5% comorbidity with other psychiatric illnesses. For example, approximately 50% have major depressive episodes, and 33.7% engage in substance abuse. In extreme cases patients can develop life-threatening complications such as acute pancreatitis from repeat purging.

&#160;

The only medication currently approved for BN is Prozac (fluoxetine). Only with a high dose do patients have a reduction in binge eating of 67% and vomiting of 56%. Only 50% of patients respond to this treatment.

&#160;

The Company plans to evaluate the use of a nasal opioid antagonist to treat this condition. The Company aims to initiate a study before Q2 2017.

&#160;

Cocaine Use Disorder 

&#160;

The Company has been conducting pilot studies to explore the potential of a nasal opioid antagonist as a treatment for CocUD. There are approximately 1.5 million current cocaine users in the U.S., as reported by The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). There are no FDA-approved pharmacological treatments for CocUD.

&#160;

Cocaine is a strong central nervous system stimulant that increases levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine in brain circuits regulating pleasure and movement, with the opioid system strongly linked to the dopamine reward circuitry. The extraordinary cost of cocaine addiction, financially, medically and socially, is directly related to relapse: up to 80% of addicted individuals relapse within six months of treatment.

&#160;

On December 23, 2015, the Company announced that an opioid antagonist drug will be tested in patients with CocUD at the University of Pennsylvania. The study has been conducted by the Department of Psychiatry at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and began recruitment in December 2015. Funded by a Medications Development Centers of Excellence Cooperative (U54) Program from NIDA, the study uses functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to better understand the impact of an opioid antagonist drug in the brain of patients with CocUD. Using an opioid antagonist and blocking the downstream release of dopamine through blocking the release of endorphins may reduce the reward patients receive from cocaine use.

&#160;

Heroin Vaccine 

&#160; 

Opioid addiction is a major global health issue, particularly in the U.S., where opioid painkiller abuse and subsequent addiction has become widespread and driven the increase in prevalence. As these painkillers have become more expensive, undergone tighter controls for distribution, and abuse deterrent formulations have become available, there has been an increase in heroin use, which is cheaper and often easier to obtain than painkillers.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Current FDA-approved treatments for heroin addiction are based on methadone-based and buprenorphine-based substitution therapies, and the use of naltrexone depot injections. With respect to these substitution therapies, patients still take opioid-based treatments, which for many is undesirable, and there is frequently diversion and misuse of these treatments amongst addicts. With respect to naltrexone depot injections, patients must undergo detoxification before initiating treatment, which for several patients severely limits compliance and willingness to undergo this method of treatment. Therefore, being able to provide a vaccine to patients that potentially provides specific immunity against heroin and its metabolites without the need for prior detoxification and enabling patients to remain opioid-free is an attractive solution.

&#160;

In October 2016, the Company in-licensed a heroin vaccine from Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (&#8220;Walter Reed&#8221;). This is an early stage pre-clinical asset, based on adjuvant technology, and requires further pre-clinical research before human testing. The Company plans to work alongside Walter Reed scientists to advance the program into the clinic and to determine whether the product is viable in a heroin addict population.

&#160;

Other Activities 

&#160;

On December 1, 2014, the Company and Aegis Therapeutics, LLC (&#8220;Aegis&#8221;), entered into a Material Transfer, Option and Research License Agreement (the &#8220;Aegis Agreement&#8221;) that provides the Company with an exclusive royalty-free research license for a period of time to Aegis&#8217; proprietary delivery enhancement and stabilization agents, including Aegis&#8217; ProTek&#174; and Intravail&#174; technologies (collectively, the &#8220;Technology&#8221;) to enable the Company to conduct a feasibility study of opioid antagonists when used with the Technology (the &#8220;Study&#8221;). During this period of time, the Company may also evaluate its interest in having an exclusive license to the Technology for use with opioid antagonists to treat, diagnose, predict, detect or prevent any disease, disorder, state, condition or malady in humans (the &#8220;Possible License&#8221;). Aegis has granted the Company an exclusive option to obtain the Possible License for a certain period after the study is completed. In consideration of the license granted to the Company pursuant to the Aegis Agreement, the Company is required to pay to Aegis a nonrefundable study fee.

&#160;

On October 6, 2015, the Company entered into an amendment to the Aegis Agreement. This amendment had an effective date of May 19, 2015 and allowed the Company to evaluate the Technology through August 17, 2015. The amendment also provided an opportunity for the Company to elect to further extend the period of time during which the Company could evaluate the Technology through February 13, 2016. In exchange for electing to further extend this period of time, the Company paid Aegis $75,000 and issued 13,697 shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock. The shares issued in this transaction were using the stock price at issuance date and amounted to $106,152. During February 2016, the Company elected to further extend the period of time during which the Company could evaluate Aegis&#8217; Technology through August 11, 2016. During February 2016, the Company paid Aegis $75,000 and issued 10,746 shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock. The shares issued in this transaction were using the stock price at issuance date and amounted to $106,385. On April 26, 2016, the Company entered into the Restated Aegis Agreement.

&#160;

On September 22, 2015, the Company received a $1,600,000 commitment from the Foundation which later assigned its interest to Valour, from which the Company had the right to make capital calls from the Foundation for the research, development, any other activities connected to the Company&#8217;s opioid antagonist treatments for addictions and related disorders that materially rely on certain studies funded by the Foundation&#8217;s investment, excluding the Opioid Overdose Reversal Treatment Product (the &#8220;Certain Studies Products&#8221;), certain operating expenses, and any other purpose consistent with the goals of the Foundation. In exchange for funds invested by the Foundation, Valour currently owns a 2.1333% interest in the Certain Studies Products Net Profit (the &#8220;2.1333% Interest&#8221;). The &#8220;Certain Studies Net Profit&#8221; is defined as any pre-tax revenue received by the Company that was derived from the sale of the Certain Studies Products less any and all expenses incurred by and payments made by the Company in connection with the Certain Studies Products, including but not limited to an allocation of Company overhead based on the proportionate time, expenses and resources devoted by the Company to Certain Studies Product-related activities, which allocation shall be determined in good faith by the Company. Valour also has rights with respect to its 2.1333% Interest if the Certain Studies Product is sold or the Company is sold. Additionally, the Company may buy back, in whole or in part, the 2.1333% Interest from Valour within 2.5 years or after 2.5 years of the initial investment at a price of two times or 3.5 times, respectively, the relevant investment amount represented by the interests to be bought back. If an aforementioned treatment is not introduced to the market by September 22, 2018, Valour will have a 60 day option to exchange its 2.1333% Interest for shares of the Common Stock of the Company at an exchange rate of one-tenth of a share for every dollar of its investment. On October 2, 2015, December 23, 2015, and May 28, 2016, the Company made capital calls of $618,000, $715,500 and $266,500 from the Foundation in exchange for 0.824%, 0.954% and 0.355333% interests in the aforementioned treatments, respectively. The Company will defer recording revenue until such time as Valour&#8217;s option expires or milestones are achieved that eliminates Valour&#8217;s right to exercise the option. Upon expiration of the exercise option, the deliverables of the arrangement will be reviewed and evaluated under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 605. In the event Valour chooses to exchange its 2.1333% Interest, in whole or in part, for shares of Common Stock of the Company, that transaction will be accounted for similar to a sale of shares of Common Stock for cash.

&#160;

&#160;

On April 26, 2016, the Company and Aegis entered into the Amended and Restated Material Transfer, Option and Research License Agreement (the &#8220;Restated Aegis Agreement&#8221;) which amends and restates in its entirety the Aegis Agreement. Under the Restated Aegis Agreement, the Company has been granted an exclusive royalty-free research license to Aegis&#8217; Technology for a period of time (the &#8220;Compound Research Period&#8221;), to enable the Company to conduct a feasibility study of opioid antagonists when used with the Technology and evaluate the Company&#8217;s interest in licensing the Technology through use of a &#8220;Compound&#8221; (as defined in the Restated Aegis Agreement) in additional studies.

&#160;

The Company agreed to pay Aegis (i) an aggregate of $300,000, of which the Company may elect to pay up to 50% by issuing shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock to Aegis, with the number of shares to be issued equal to 75% of the average closing price of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock over the 20 trading days preceding the date of payment as consideration for extending the Compound Research Period pursuant to two separate extension payments of $150,000 each, and (ii) 50,000 shares of Common Stock as partial consideration for entering into the Restated Aegis Agreement. The Company exercised such extensions through payment of the first and second extension fees prior to October 13, 2015 and prior to February 13, 2016, respectively. The Restated Aegis Agreement shall expire on the earlier of (i) the expiration of the &#8220;Opiant Negotiation Periods&#8221; (as defined in the Restated Aegis Agreement) and (ii) on 30 days&#8217; prior written notice by the Company; provided , however , that Aegis shall have the right to terminate the license granted in the event the Company does not pursue commercially reasonable efforts to exploit a &#8220;Product&#8221;, defined as (i) pharmaceutical formulations containing the Compound as an active ingredient and (ii) Aegis&#8217;s proprietary chemically synthesizable excipient(s), including without limitation the Intravail&#174; excipients pharmaceutical formulations containing certain ingredients of Aegis&#8217; proprietary technology.

&#160;

During the term of the Restated Aegis Agreement, the Company has a right of first refusal and option to add any, or all of the &#8220;Additional Compounds&#8221; (as defined in the Restated Aegis Agreement), which the Company may exercise at any time upon written notice to Aegis. The Company has granted Aegis a co-exclusive license with the Company to use the data from the Company&#8217;s Studies under the Restated Aegis Agreement for certain purposes. Pursuant to the Restated Aegis Agreement, Aegis granted the Company an exclusive option (the &#8220;Opiant Option&#8221;) to obtain an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license (with the right to grant sublicenses through multiple tiers) under Aegis&#8217;s interests in the Technology and any &#8220;Joint Invention&#8221; (as such term is defined in the Restated Aegis Agreement) to the Technology to research, develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, and import products containing the Compound or an Additional Compound. The Company may exercise such Opiant Option with respect to the Compounds by written notice to Aegis within 90 days of the completion of the Study for (i) the Compounds or (ii) the Additional Compounds. In the event the Company exercises the Opiant Option, the parties have 120 days to negotiate and execute a definitive license agreement. The terms of such license agreement have been contemplated and agreed upon by the parties under a letter agreement dated April 26, 2016 (the &#8220;Letter Agreement&#8221;). In the event the Company exercises the Opiant Option specific to the &#8220;Opioid Field&#8221; (as defined in Exhibit 1 to the Letter Agreement), the Company shall pay Aegis an additional $100,000 fee and any such products in the Opioid Field shall be subject to the same milestones, royalties and other monetary obligations set forth in the Letter Agreement and summarized below.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Under the Letter Agreement containing the terms of such license, the Company will pay Aegis development milestones for the Products ranging from $250,000 to $4,000,000. Additionally, commencing on the first anniversary and through the first Product approval, the Company is required to make minimum quarterly nonrefundable payments to Aegis in the amount of $25,000 (the &#8220;Quarterly Payments&#8221;), which Quarterly Payments are fully creditable and treated as a prepayment against future milestones or royalties. During the &#8220;Royalty Term&#8221; (as defined in Exhibit 1 to the Letter Agreement), the Company shall pay Aegis royalties (the &#8220;Royalties&#8221;) on annual net sales of Products ranging from (A) low single digits for Products with an aggregate annual &#8220;Net Sales&#8221; (as defined in Exhibit 1 to the Letter Agreement) during a calendar year of $50 million or less to (B) mid-single digits for Products with Net Sales of greater than $1 billion. Such Royalties are subject to reduction as provided in Exhibit 1 to the Restated Agreement but shall not be reduced by more than 50% of the regularly scheduled royalty payment.

&#160;

On February 17, 2016, the Company announced the first convening of its medical advisory board in 2016 to discuss its development programs in substance use, addictive and eating disorders.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The Company faces competition from other companies focused on pharmacological treatments for substance use, addictive and eating disorders. Some of these companies are larger and better-funded than the Company and there are no assurances that the Company can effectively compete with these competitors. Potential competitors include Indivior PLC, Alkermes PLC, H. Lundbeck A/S, Shire PLC, Camurus AB, Orexo AB, BioDelivery Services International, Inc., Titan Pharmaceuticals Inc., Cerecor Inc. In 2015, Shire PLC received FDA approval to use Vyvanse to treat BED in adults.

&#160;

With respect to NARCAN&#174; (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray, the Company faces competition from other treatments, including injectable naloxone, auto-injectors and improvised nasal kits. Amphastar Pharmaceuticals, Inc. competes with NARCAN&#174; (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray with their naloxone injection. Kal&#233;o competes with NARCAN&#174; (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray with their auto-injector known as EVZIO&#8482; (naloxone HCl injection) Auto-Injector. In 2015, Indivior PLC received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA with respect to a naloxone nasal spray. In 2016, TEVA filed an NDA with the FDA seeking regulatory approval to market a generic version of NARCAN&#174; (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray before the expiration of the &#8216;253 patent. Although NARCAN&#174; (naloxone hydrochloride) Nasal Spray was the first FDA-approved naloxone nasal spray for the emergency reversal of opioid overdoses and has advantages over certain other treatments, the Company expects the treatment to face additional competition.

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

During the years ended July 31, 2016, the Company incurred research and development expenses of $1,747,077 and $2,414,973 respectively.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of July 31, 2016, the Company had six permanent employees, comprised of five full time employees and one part-time employee. In addition, the Company has numerous outside consultants that are not on the Company&#8217;s payroll. During the years ended July 31, 2016, the Company incurred research and development expenses of $1,747,077 and $2,414,973 respectively.
