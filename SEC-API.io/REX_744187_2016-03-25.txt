References to &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221;, &#8220;REX&#8221; or &#8220;the Company&#8221; refer to REX American Resources Corporation and its majority owned subsidiaries. 

&#160;

Overview

&#160;

REX was incorporated in Delaware in 1984 as a holding company. Our principal offices are located at 7720 Paragon Road, Dayton, Ohio 45459. Our telephone number is (937) 276-3931. We have been an investor in various alternative energy entities beginning with synthetic fuel partnerships in 1998 and later ethanol production facilities beginning in 2006. Historically, we were a specialty retailer in the consumer electronics and appliance industry serving small to medium-sized towns and communities. Recognizing the change in our business, we changed our corporate name from REX Stores Corporation to REX American Resources Corporation in 2010 as we completed the transition out of the retail business into the ethanol business.

&#160;

We are currently invested in three ethanol production entities, two of which we have a majority ownership interest in. We may make additional investments in the energy industry in the future.

&#160;

Our ethanol operations are highly dependent on commodity prices, especially prices for corn, ethanol, distillers grains, non-food grade corn oil and natural gas. As a result of price volatility for these commodities, our operating results can fluctuate substantially. The price and availability of corn is subject to significant fluctuations depending upon a number of factors that affect commodity prices in general, including crop conditions, weather, federal policy and foreign trade. Because the market price of ethanol is not always directly related to corn prices (for example, crude and other energy prices can impact ethanol prices), at times ethanol prices may lag movements in corn prices and, in an environment of higher corn

prices or lower ethanol prices, reduce the overall margin structure at the plants. As a result, at times, we may operate our plants at negative or marginally positive operating margins.

&#160;

We expect our ethanol plants to produce approximately 2.8 gallons of denatured ethanol for each bushel of grain processed in the production cycle. We refer to the difference between the price per gallon of ethanol and the price per bushel of grain (divided by 2.8) as the &#8220;crush spread.&#8221; Should the crush spread decline, it is possible that our ethanol plants will generate operating results that do not provide adequate cash flows for sustained periods of time. In such cases, production at the ethanol plants may be reduced or stopped altogether in order to minimize variable costs at individual plants.

&#160;

We attempt to manage the risk related to the volatility of grain and ethanol prices by utilizing forward grain purchase and forward ethanol, distillers grains and non-food grade corn oil sale contracts. We attempt to match quantities of these sales contracts with an appropriate quantity of grain purchase contracts over a given period of time when we can obtain an adequate gross margin resulting from the crush spread inherent in the contracts we have executed. However, the market for future ethanol sales contracts is not a mature market. Consequently, we generally execute fixed price contracts for no more than two months into the future at any given time and we may lock in our corn or ethanol price without having a corresponding locked in ethanol or corn price for short durations of time. As a result of the relatively short period of time our fixed price contracts cover, we generally cannot predict the future movements in the crush spread for more than two months; thus, we are unable to predict the likelihood or amounts of future income or loss from the operations of our ethanol facilities. We utilize derivative financial instruments, primarily exchange traded commodity future contracts, in conjunction with certain of our grain procurement activities.

&#160;

The crush spread realized in fiscal year 2015 was subject to significant volatility. For fiscal year 2015, the average Chicago Board of Trade (&#8220;CBOT&#8221;) near-month corn price ranged from a low of approximately $3.48 per bushel in June 2015 to a high of approximately $4.41 per bushel in July 2015. Corn prices benefitted throughout the year from the three strongest corn harvests in U. S. history in 2013, 2014 and 2015 (in order of strength of harvest production). Ethanol prices had significant fluctuations ranging from approximately $1.31 per gallon in January 2016 to a high of approximately $1.69 per gallon in May 2015. Ethanol prices were influenced by many factors throughout the year including low energy prices, particularly late in fiscal year 2015 and over-production of ethanol. The CBOT crush spread during fiscal year 2015 ranged from approximately $0.02 in February 2015 to approximately $0.37 in May 2015.

&#160;

Income from continuing operations, net of tax was approximately $31.4 million in fiscal year 2015 compared to approximately $86.8 million in fiscal year 2014. The decrease in profitability primarily resulted from lower crush spreads (compared to the prior year) experienced in the ethanol industry for a majority of fiscal year 2015 as lower energy prices and over supply of ethanol reduced ethanol pricing during fiscal year 2015. We expect that future operating results, from our consolidated plants, will be based upon combined annual production of between 215 and 240 million gallons of ethanol, which assumes that our consolidated ethanol plants will operate at or above nameplate capacity. However, due to the inherent volatility of the crush spread, we cannot predict the likelihood of future operating results being similar to the fiscal year 2015 results.

&#160;

We plan to seek and evaluate various investment opportunities including energy related, agricultural or other ventures we believe fit our investment criteria. We can make no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to find such opportunities.

&#160;

Through a wholly owned subsidiary REX I.P., LLC, we have entered into a joint venture with Hytken HPGP LLC (&#8220;Hytken&#8221;) to file and defend patents for eSteam technology relating to heavy oil and oil sands production methods, and to attempt to commercially exploit the technology to generate license fees, royalty income and development opportunities. The patented technology is an enhanced method of heavy oil

recovery involving zero emissions downhole steam generation. To date, we have paid approximately $1.6 million for our ownership interest, patent and other expenses, but have not successfully demonstrated that the technology is commercially feasible. We own 60% and Hytken owns 40% of the entity named Future Energy, LLC (&#8220;Future Energy&#8221;), an Ohio limited liability company. Future Energy is managed by a board of three managers, two appointed by us and one by Hytken.

&#160;

Fiscal Year 

&#160; 

All references in this report to a particular fiscal year are to REX&#8217;s fiscal year ended January 31. For example, &#8220;fiscal year 2015&#8221; means the period February 1, 2015 to January 31, 2016. We refer to our fiscal year by reference to the year immediately preceding the January 31 fiscal year end date.

&#160;

Alternative Energy Overview

&#160;

We began investing in the ethanol industry during fiscal year 2006. We seek to identify quality ethanol plant opportunities located near adequate feedstock supply with good transportation capabilities or other economically beneficial attributes, and that utilize leading ethanol production technology.

&#160;

The form and structure of our investments is tailored to the specific needs and goals of each project and the local farmer group or investor with whom we are partnering. We generally participate in the management of our projects through our membership on the board of managers of the limited liability companies that own the plants.

&#160;

Ethanol Investments 

&#160;

We have equity investments in three entities as of January 31, 2016. The following table is a summary of our ethanol investments at January 31, 2016 (gallons in millions):

Big River also operates six agricultural elevators with a storage capacity of 15 million bushels. During fiscal year 2015, Big River completed construction of a zein protein plant, which is expected to begin production in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016.

&#160;

Ethanol Industry

&#160;

Ethanol is a renewable fuel source produced by processing corn and other biomass through a fermentation process that creates combustible alcohol that can be used as an additive or replacement to fossil fuel based gasoline. The majority of ethanol produced in the United States is made from corn because of its wide availability and ease of convertibility from large amounts of carbohydrates into glucose, the key ingredient in producing alcohol that is used in the fermentation process. Ethanol production can also use feedstocks such as grain sorghum, switchgrass, wheat, barley, potatoes and sugarcane as carbohydrate sources. Most ethanol plants have been located near large corn production areas, such as Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio and South Dakota. Railway access and interstate access are vital for ethanol facilities due to the large amount of raw materials and finished goods required to be shipped to and from the ethanol plant facilities.

&#160;

According to the Renewable Fuels Association, or RFA, the United States ethanol industry produced an estimated 14.8 billion gallons of ethanol in 2015. Approximately 13.7 billion gallons were blended domestically and approximately 0.8 billion gallons were exported in 2015. According to the RFA, as of January 2016, the United States ethanol industry has grown to 214 plants (199 operating) in 29 states with an annual nameplate capacity of approximately 15.6 billion gallons (approximately 15.1 billion gallons at operating plants) of ethanol production.

&#160;

On December 19, 2007, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (the &#8220;Energy Act of 2007&#8221;) was enacted. The Energy Act of 2007 established new levels of renewable fuel mandates, including two different categories of renewable fuels: conventional biofuels and advanced biofuels. Corn-based ethanol is considered conventional biofuels which was subject to a renewable fuel standard (&#8220;RFS&#8221;) of at least 14.4 billion gallons in 2014 and 15.0 billion gallons thereafter through 2022. The Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) has the authority to waive the mandates in whole or in part if one of two conditions is met: 1) there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply, or 2) implementation of the mandate requirement severely harms the economy or environment of a state, region or the United States.

&#160;

In November 2013, the EPA released its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for the 2014 RFS, seeking comment on a range of total renewable fuel volumes and proposing a level of 15.2 billion gallons, including approximately 13.0 billion gallons of conventional corn-derived renewable fuel. The proposal included a

variety of approaches for setting the 2014 standard and a number of production and consumption ranges of biofuels covered by Renewable Fuel Standard II (&#8220;RFS II&#8221;) to address two constraints of RFS II: (1) the volume limitations of ethanol given the practical constraints of vehicles that can use higher ethanol blends, and (2) the industry&#8217;s ability to produce sufficient volumes of qualifying renewable fuel. In November 2014, the EPA rescinded its 2013 proposal. Furthermore, the EPA did not finalize the 2014 standard under the RFS program before the end of that year.

&#160;

On June 10, 2015, the EPA proposed volume targets for conventional ethanol of 13.25 billion gallons, 13.40 billion gallons and 14.00 billion gallons for 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. On November 30, 2015, the EPA announced final volume requirements for conventional ethanol that were higher than levels proposed in June 2015 of 13.61 billion gallons, 14.05 billion gallons and 14.50 billion gallons for 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. The EPA has not yet announced its proposed volume requirements for subsequent years.

&#160;

Ethanol Production 

&#160; 

The plants we have invested in are designed to use the dry milling method of producing ethanol. In the dry milling process, the entire corn kernel is first ground into flour, which is referred to as &#8220;meal,&#8221; and processed without separating out the various component parts of the grain. The meal is processed with enzymes, chemicals and water, and then placed in a high-temperature cooker. It is then transferred to fermenters where yeast is added and the conversion of sugar to ethanol begins. After fermentation, the resulting liquid is transferred to distillation columns where the ethanol is separated from the remaining &#8220;stillage&#8221; for fuel uses. The anhydrous ethanol is then blended with denaturant, such as natural gasoline, to render it undrinkable and thus not subject to beverage alcohol tax. With the starch elements of the corn consumed in the above described process, the principal co-product produced by the dry milling process is dry distillers grains with solubles, or DDGS. DDGS is sold as a protein used in animal feed and recovers a portion of the corn cost not absorbed in ethanol production. During fiscal year 2012, we began generating revenues from the sale of non-food grade corn oil at our One Earth and NuGen facilities. Non-food grade corn oil is sold to the animal feed market, as well as biodiesel and other chemical markets. 

&#160; 

The Primary Uses of Ethanol 

&#160; 

Blend component. Today, much of the ethanol blending in the U.S. is done to meet the RFS. Currently, ethanol is blended into approximately 97% of the gasoline sold in the United States, the majority as E-10 (a blend of 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline), according to the RFA. Going forward, the industry is attempting to expand the E-85 market, as well as to raise the federal cap on ethanol blend above the current 10% for most vehicles in use. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approved the use of 15% ethanol in gasoline for cars, SUV&#8217;s and light duty trucks made in 2001 and later. Despite this, it will take time for this measure to be implemented and is still being met with great resistance. 

&#160; 

Clean air additive. Ethanol is employed by the refining industry as a fuel oxygenate, which when blended with gasoline, allows engines to combust fuel more completely and reduce emissions from motor vehicles. Ethanol contains 35% oxygen, which results in more complete combustion of the fuel in the engine cylinder. Oxygenated gasoline is used to help meet certain federal and air emission standards. 

&#160;

Octane enhancer. Ethanol increases the octane rating of gasoline with which it is blended. As such, ethanol is used by gasoline suppliers as an octane enhancer both for producing regular grade gasoline from lower octane blending stocks and for upgrading regular gasoline to premium grades. 

Legislation 

&#160;

The United States ethanol industry is highly dependent upon federal and state legislation. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of legislation affecting the U.S. ethanol industry.

&#160;

Facilities

&#160;

At January 31, 2016, our consolidated ethanol entities own a combined 477 acres of land and two facilities that shipped a combined quantity of approximately 232 million gallons of ethanol in fiscal year 2015. In addition, we own three former retail store properties that are leased to outside, unrelated parties, and one vacant former retail store property that we are attempting to either lease or sell. We also own the office building (approximately 7,500 square feet) our corporate headquarters is located in.

&#160;

Employees

&#160;

At January 31, 2016, we had 116 employees at our two consolidated ethanol plants and at our corporate headquarters. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We expect this employment level to remain relatively stable. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

&#160;

Service Marks 

&#160;

We have registered the service marks &#8220;REX&#8221;, and &#8220;Farmers Energy&#8221;, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We are not aware of any adverse claims concerning our service marks.
