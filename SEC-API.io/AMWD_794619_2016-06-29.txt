 Item 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

American Woodmark Corporation (&#8220;American Woodmark&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) manufactures and distributes kitchen cabinets and vanities for the remodeling and new home construction markets. American Woodmark was incorporated in 1980 by the four principal managers of the Boise Cascade Cabinet Division through a leveraged buyout of that division. American Woodmark was operated privately until 1986 when it became a public company through a registered public offering of its common stock. 

&#160; 

American Woodmark currently offers framed stock cabinets in approximately 500 different cabinet lines, ranging in price from relatively inexpensive to medium-priced styles. Styles vary by design and color from natural wood finishes to low-pressure laminate surfaces. The product offering of stock cabinets includes 85 door designs in 21 colors. Stock cabinets consist of cabinet interiors of varying dimensions and construction options and a maple, oak, cherry, or hickory front frame, door and/or drawer front. 

&#160; 

Products are sold under the brand names of American Woodmark&#174;, Simply Woodmark TM , Timberlake&#174;, Shenandoah Cabinetry&#174;, Shenandoah Value Series&#174;, and Waypoint Living Spaces&#174;. 

&#160; 

American Woodmark&#8217;s products are sold on a national basis across the United States to the remodeling and new home construction markets. The Company services these markets through three primary channels: home centers, builders, and independent dealers and distributors. The Company provides complete turnkey installation services to its direct builder customers via its network of seven service centers that are strategically located throughout the United States. The Company distributes its products to each market channel directly from four assembly plants through a third party logistics network. 

&#160; 

The primary raw materials used include hard maple, soft maple, oak, cherry, and hickory lumber and plywood. Additional raw materials include paint, particleboard, medium density fiberboard, high density fiberboard, manufactured components, and hardware. The Company currently purchases paint from one supplier; however, other sources are available. Other raw materials are purchased from more than one source and are readily available. 

&#160; 

American Woodmark operates in a highly fragmented industry that is composed of several thousand local, regional, and national manufacturers. The Company&#8217;s principal means for competition is its breadth and variety of product offering, expanded service capabilities, geographic reach and affordable quality. The Company believes it is one of the three largest manufacturers of kitchen cabinets in the United States. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s business has historically been subject to seasonal influences, with higher sales typically realized in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. General economic forces and changes in the Company&#8217;s customer mix have reduced seasonal fluctuations in revenue over the past few years. The Company does not consider its level of order backlog to be material. 

&#160; 

In recognition of the cyclicality of the housing industry, the Company&#8217;s policy is to operate with a minimal amount of financial leverage. The Company regularly maintains a debt to capital ratio of well below 20%, and working capital exclusive of cash of less than 6% of net sales. At April 30, 2016, debt to capital was 7.4%, and working capital net of cash was 3.7% of net sales. 

&#160; 

During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 (fiscal 2016), American Woodmark had two primary customers, The Home Depot and Lowe&#8217;s Companies, Inc., which together accounted for approximately 41% of the Company&#8217;s sales. The loss of either customer would have a material adverse effect on the Company. 

The Company holds patents, patent applications, licenses, trademarks, trade names, trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing processes. The Company views its trademarks and other intellectual property rights as important to its business. 

&#160; 

As of May 31, 2016, the Company had 5,600 employees. None of the Company&#8217;s employees are represented by labor unions. The Company believes that its employee relations are good.
