 ITEM 1. &#160; BUSINESS. 

THE COMPANY

Great Southern Bancorp, Inc.

Great Southern Bancorp, Inc. ("Bancorp" or "Company") is a bank holding company and a financial holding company and the parent of Great Southern Bank ("Great Southern" or the "Bank"). Bancorp was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in July 1989 as a unitary savings and loan holding company. The Company became a one-bank holding company on June 30, 1998, upon the conversion of Great Southern to a Missouri-chartered trust company. In 2004, Bancorp was re-incorporated under the laws of the State of Maryland.

As a Maryland corporation, the Company is authorized to engage in any activity that is permitted by the Maryland General Corporation Law and is not prohibited by law or regulatory policy. The Company currently conducts its business as a financial holding company. Through the financial holding company structure, it is possible to expand the size and scope of the financial services offered by the Company beyond those offered by the Bank. The financial holding company structure provides the Company with greater flexibility than the Bank has to diversify its business activities, through existing or newly formed subsidiaries, or through acquisitions of or mergers with other financial institutions as well as other companies. At December 31, 2015, Bancorp's consolidated assets were $4.10 billion, consolidated net loans were $3.34 billion, consolidated deposits were $3.27 billion and consolidated total stockholders' equity was $398 million. For details about the Company's assets, revenues and profits for each of the last five fiscal years, see Item 6. "Selected Consolidated Financial Data." The assets of the Company consist primarily of the stock of Great Southern, available-for-sale securities and cash.

Through the Bank and subsidiaries of the Bank, the Company has historically offered insurance, travel, investment and related services, which are discussed further below. The travel and investment services divisions were sold on November 30, 2012. The activities of the Company are funded by retained earnings and through dividends from Great Southern. Activities of the Company may also be funded through borrowings from third parties, sales of additional securities or through income generated by other activities of the Company.

The executive offices of the Company are located at 1451 East Battlefield, Springfield, Missouri 65804, and its telephone number at that address is (417) 887-4400.

Great Southern Bank

Great Southern was formed as a Missouri-chartered mutual savings and loan association in 1923, and, in 1989, converted to a Missouri-chartered stock savings and loan association. In 1994, Great Southern changed to a federal savings bank charter and then, on June 30, 1998, changed to a Missouri-chartered trust company (the equivalent of a commercial bank charter). Headquartered in Springfield, Missouri, Great Southern offers a broad range of banking services through its 108 banking centers located in southern and central Missouri; the Kansas City, Missouri area; the St. Louis, Missouri area; eastern Kansas; northwestern Arkansas; eastern Nebraska, the Minneapolis, Minnesota area and eastern, western and central Iowa. At December 31, 2015, the Bank had total assets of $4.10 billion, net loans of $3.34 billion, deposits of $3.29 billion and stockholders' equity of $403.2 million, or 9.8% of total assets. Its deposits are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF") to the maximum levels permitted by the FDIC.

The size and complexity of the Bank's operations increased substantially in 2009 with the completion of two Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC")-assisted transactions, and again in 2011, 2012 and 2014 with the completion of another FDIC-assisted transaction in each of those years. In 2009, the Bank entered into two separate purchase and assumption agreements (including loss sharing) with the FDIC to assume all of the deposits (excluding brokered deposits) and certain liabilities and acquire certain assets of TeamBank, N.A. and Vantus Bank. In these two transactions we acquired assets with a fair value of approximately $628.2 million (approximately 17.3% of the Company's total consolidated assets at acquisition) and $294.2 million (approximately 8.8% of the Company's total consolidated assets at acquisition), respectively, and assumed liabilities with a fair value of $610.2 million (approximately 16.8% of the Company's total consolidated assets at acquisition) and $440.0 million (approximately 13.2% of the Company's total consolidated assets at acquisition), respectively. They also resulted in gains of $43.9 million and $45.9 million, respectively, which were included in Noninterest Income in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2009. Prior to these acquisitions, the Company operated banking centers in Missouri with loan production offices in Arkansas and Kansas. These acquisitions added 31 banking centers and expanded our footprint to cover five states &#8211; Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas and Nebraska. In 2011, the Bank entered into a purchase and assumption agreement (including loss sharing) with the FDIC to assume all of the deposits and certain liabilities and acquire certain assets of Sun Security Bank, which added locations in southern Missouri and St. Louis. In this transaction we acquired assets with a fair value of approximately $248.9 million 

&#160;

&#160;

(approximately 8.1% of the Company's total consolidated assets at acquisition) and assumed liabilities with a fair value of $345.8 million (approximately 10.1% of the Company's total consolidated assets at acquisition). It also resulted in a gain of $16.5 million which was included in Noninterest Income in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2011. In 2012, the Bank entered into a purchase and assumption agreement (including loss sharing) with the FDIC to assume all of the deposits and certain liabilities and acquire certain assets of Inter Savings Bank, FSB ("InterBank"), which added four locations in the greater Minneapolis, Minnesota area. In this transaction we acquired assets with a fair value of approximately $364.2 million (approximately 9.4% of the Company's total consolidated assets at acquisition) and assumed liabilities with a fair value of approximately $458.7 million (approximately 11.9% of the Company's total consolidated assets at acquisition). It also resulted in a gain of $31.3 million which was included in Noninterest Income in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2012.

In 2014, the Bank entered into a purchase and assumption agreement (excluding loss sharing) with the FDIC to assume all of the deposits and certain liabilities and acquire certain assets of Valley Bank ("Valley"), which added five locations in the Quad Cities area of eastern Iowa and six locations in central Iowa, primarily in the Des Moines market area. These represented new markets for the Company in eastern Iowa and enhanced our market presence in central Iowa. In this transaction we acquired assets with a fair value of approximately $378.7 million (approximately 10.0% of the Company's total consolidated assets at acquisition) and assumed liabilities with a fair value of approximately $367.9 million (approximately 9.8% of the Company's total consolidated assets at acquisition). It also resulted in a gain of $10.8 million which was included in Noninterest Income in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Also in 2014, the Bank entered into a purchase and assumption agreement to acquire certain assets and depository accounts from Neosho, Mo.-based Boulevard Bank ("Boulevard"), which added one location in the Neosho, Mo. market, where the Company already operated. In this transaction we acquired assets (primarily cash and cash equivalents) with a fair value of approximately $92.5 million (approximately 2.6% of the Company's total consolidated assets at acquisition) and assumed liabilities (all deposits and related accrued interest) with a fair value of approximately $93.3 million (approximately 2.6% of the Company's total consolidated assets at acquisition). This acquisition resulted in recognition of $792,000 of goodwill.

The Company also opened commercial loan production offices in Dallas, Texas and Tulsa, Oklahoma during 2014. The primary products offered in these offices are commercial real estate, commercial business and commercial construction loans.

In 2015, the Company announced plans to consolidate operations of 16 banking centers into other nearby Great Southern banking center locations. As part of an ongoing performance review of its entire banking center network, Great Southern evaluated each location for a number of criteria, including access and availability of services to affected customers, the proximity of other Great Southern banking centers, profitability and transaction volumes, and market dynamics. Subsequent to this announcement, the Bank entered into separate definitive agreements to sell two of the 16 banking centers, including all of the associated deposits (totaling approximately $20 million), to separate bank purchasers. One of those sale transactions was completed on February 19, 2016 and the other is expected to be completed on or around March 18, 2016. The closing of the remaining 14 facilities, which resulted in the transfer of approximately $127 million in deposits and banking center operations to other Great Southern locations, occurred at the close of business on January 8, 2016. In 2015, the Company announced that it entered into a purchase and assumption agreement to acquire 12 branches and related deposits and loans in the St. Louis, Mo., area from Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bank. The acquisition was completed at the close of business on January 29, 2016. The deposits assumed totaled approximately $228 million and had a weighted average rate of approximately 0.28%. The loans acquired totaled approximately $159 million and had a weighted average yield of approximately 3.92%.

The loss sharing agreements related to the FDIC-assisted transactions in 2009, 2011 and 2012 added to the complexity of our operations by creating the need for new employees and processes to ensure compliance with the loss sharing agreements and the collection of problem assets acquired. See Note 4 included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Information" for a more detailed discussion of these FDIC-assisted transactions and the loss sharing agreements.

Great Southern is principally engaged in the business of originating residential and commercial real estate loans, construction loans, other commercial loans and consumer loans and funding these loans by attracting deposits from the general public, originating brokered deposits and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (the "FHLBank") and others.

For many years, Great Southern has followed a strategy of emphasizing loan origination through residential, commercial and consumer lending activities in its market areas. The goal of this strategy is to be one of the leading providers of financial services in its market areas, while simultaneously diversifying assets and reducing interest rate risk by originating and holding adjustable-rate loans and fixed-rate loans, primarily with terms of five years or less, in its portfolio and by selling longer-term fixed-rate single-family 

&#160;

&#160;

mortgage loans in the secondary market. The Bank continues to place primary emphasis on residential mortgage and other real estate lending while also expanding and increasing its originations of commercial business and consumer loans.

The corporate office of the Bank is located at 1451 East Battlefield, Springfield, Missouri 65804 and its telephone number at that address is (417) 887-4400.

Market Areas

During 2015, the Company increased its banking center network from 108 to 110 banking centers. The Company's first banking center in Columbia, Mo., opened in April 2015. The Company's Kansas City commercial and retail loan headquarters and new retail banking center opened in Overland Park, Kan., in September 2015. At the end of 2015, the Company operated 110 full-service banking centers serving more than 169,000 households in six states &#8211; Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota and Nebraska.

In September 2015, the Bank announced plans to consolidate operations of 16 banking centers into other nearby Great Southern banking center locations. As part of an ongoing performance review of its entire banking center network, Great Southern evaluated each location for a number of criteria, including access and availability of services to affected customers, the proximity of other Great Southern banking centers, profitability and transaction volumes, and market dynamics. Subsequent to this September 2015 announcement, the Bank entered into separate definitive agreements to sell two of the 16 banking centers, including all of the associated deposits. The office (including deposits) in Thayer, Mo., was sold to a separate bank purchaser on February 19, 2016, and the office (including deposits) in Buffalo, Mo., is expected to be sold to a separate bank purchaser on or around March 18, 2016. The 

&#160;

&#160;

closing of the remaining 14 facilities, which resulted in the transfer of approximately $127 million in deposits and banking center operations to other Great Southern locations, occurred at the close of business on January 8, 2016. Of these 14 consolidated banking centers, nine are in Missouri, four are in Iowa and one is in Kansas. Nine of these banking centers were acquired as part of various FDIC-assisted acquisitions. Great Southern ATMs remain operational indefinitely at each of the 14 affected banking center sites.

Also in September 2015, the Company entered into a purchase and assumption agreement to acquire 12 branches and related deposits and loans in the St. Louis area from Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bank. This acquisition was completed at the close of business on January 29, 2016. The acquisition, representing approximately $228 million in deposits and $159 million in loans, increased Great Southern's St. Louis-area banking center total from eight to 20 offices.

Great Southern's largest concentration of loans and deposits are in the Springfield, Mo., and St. Louis, Mo., market areas. In the last several years, the Company's loan and deposit portfolios have become more diversified because of its participation in five FDIC-assisted acquisitions and organic growth. The FDIC-assisted acquisitions significantly expanded the Company's geographic footprint, which prior to 2009 was primarily in southwest and central Missouri, by adding operations in Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota and Nebraska. Besides the Springfield and St. Louis market areas, the Company has loan and deposit concentrations in the following market areas: Kansas City, Mo.; Branson, Mo.; Sioux City, Iowa; Des Moines, Iowa; Northwest Arkansas; Omaha, Neb.; Minneapolis, Minn.; and Eastern Iowa in the area known as the "Quad Cities." Loans and deposits are also generated in banking centers in rural markets in Missouri, Iowa, Kansas and Nebraska. At December 31, 2015, apart from its deposits in various markets in Missouri, the Company had deposits of $556 million, $248 million and $238 million in Iowa, Minnesota and Kansas, respectively. In addition, the Company operates commercial loan production offices in Dallas, Tex. and Tulsa, Okla.

As of December 31, 2015, the Company's total loan portfolio balance, excluding acquired loans, was $3.0 billion. Geographically, the loan portfolio consists of loans collateralized by property (real estate and other assets) located in the following regions (including loan balance and percentage of total loans): St. Louis ($556 million, 18%); Springfield ($447 million, 15%); Iowa/Nebraska/South Dakota ($258 million, 8%); Kansas City ($197 million, 6%); Texas ($175 million, 6%); Oklahoma ($174 million, 6%); Northwest Arkansas ($111 million, 4%); Minnesota ($111 million, 4%); Branson ($105 million, 3%); other Missouri regions ($357 million, 12%); and other states and regions ($540 million, 18%). 

The Company's net book balance of its portfolio of loans covered by FDIC loss sharing agreements was $236 million as of December 31, 2015. The FDIC loss sharing agreements, which were a part of two FDIC-assisted transactions completed in 2009, one FDIC-assisted transaction completed in 2011, and one FDIC-assisted transaction completed in 2012, provide the Company at least 80% protection against losses on the loans in this portfolio. The FDIC loss sharing agreements are subject to limitations on the types of losses covered and the length of time losses are covered and are conditioned upon the Bank complying with its requirements in the agreements with the FDIC. These limitations are described in detail in Note 4 of the accompanying audited financial statements (see Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Information"). Geographically, the total loan portfolio covered by FDIC loss sharing agreements at December 31, 2015, consists of loans collateralized by property (real estate and other assets) located in the following regions (including gross loan balance and percentage of total loans): Minneapolis ($179 million, 68%); St. Louis ($20 million, 7%); Kansas City ($7 million, 3%); Sioux City, Iowa ($6 million, 2%); Des Moines, Iowa ($5 million, 2%); other Missouri regions ($24 million, 9%); and other regions ($23 million, 9%).

The Company's net book balance of its portfolio of loans which were previously covered by FDIC loss sharing agreements, but are no longer covered due to the expiration of the non-single-family portion of the agreements, was $33 million as of December 31, 2015. These loans were acquired as part of the two FDIC-assisted transactions completed in 2009.

The Company's net book balance of its portfolio of loans which were acquired in the Valley Bank FDIC-assisted transaction was $93 million as of December 31, 2015. These loans were initially recorded at their fair value on the acquisition date of June 20, 2014. No loss sharing agreement was included in this transaction.

Lending Activities

General

From its beginnings in 1923 through the early 1980s, Great Southern primarily made long-term, fixed-rate residential real estate loans that it retained in its loan portfolio. Beginning in the early 1980s, Great Southern increased its efforts to originate short-term and adjustable-rate loans. Beginning in the mid-1980s, Great Southern increased its efforts to originate commercial real estate and other residential loans, primarily with adjustable rates or shorter-term fixed rates. In addition, some competitor banking organizations merged with larger institutions and changed their business practices or moved operations away from the Springfield, Mo. area, and others consolidated operations from the Springfield, Mo. area to larger cities. This provided Great Southern expanded opportunities in residential and commercial real estate lending as well as in the origination of commercial business and consumer loans, primarily in indirect automobile lending.

&#160;

In addition to origination of these loans, the Bank has expanded and enlarged its relationships with smaller banks and other peer banks to purchase participations (at par, generally with no servicing costs) in loans these other banks originate but are unable to retain in their portfolios due to capital or borrower relationship size limitations. The Bank uses the same underwriting guidelines in evaluating these participations as it does in its direct loan originations. At December 31, 2015, the balance of participation loans purchased and held in the portfolio, excluding those covered by loss sharing agreements, was $186.7 million, or 6.2% of the total loan portfolio. All of these participation loans were performing at December 31, 2015. 

One of the principal historical lending activities of Great Southern is the origination of fixed and adjustable-rate conventional residential real estate loans to enable borrowers to purchase or refinance owner-occupied homes. Great Southern originates a variety of conventional, residential real estate mortgage loans, principally in compliance with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae standards for resale in the secondary market. Great Southern promptly sells most of the fixed-rate residential mortgage loans that it originates. To date, Great Southern has not experienced difficulties selling these loans in the secondary market and has had minimal requests for repurchase. Depending on market conditions, the ongoing servicing of these loans is at times retained by Great Southern, but generally servicing is released to the purchaser of the loan. Great Southern retains in its portfolio substantially all of the adjustable-rate mortgage loans that it originates. 

Another principal lending activity of Great Southern is the origination of commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial construction loans. Since the early 1990s, commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial construction loans have represented the largest percentage of the loan portfolio. At December 31, 2015, commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial construction loans, excluding loans acquired in FDIC-assisted transactions, accounted for approximately 28%, 11% and 15%, respectively, of the total portfolio. Of the portfolio of acquired loans, commercial real estate loans (net of fair value discounts) accounted for approximately 2% of the total portfolio at December 31, 2015.

In addition, Great Southern in recent years has increased its emphasis on the origination of other commercial loans, home equity loans and consumer loans, and is also an issuer of letters of credit. Letters of credit are contingent obligations and are not included in the Bank's loan portfolio. See "-- Other Commercial Lending," "- Classified Assets," and "Loan Delinquencies and Defaults" below.

The percentage of collateral value Great Southern will loan on real estate and other property varies based on factors including, but not limited to, the type of property and its location and the borrower's credit history. As a general rule, Great Southern will loan up to 95% of the appraised value on one-to four-family residential properties. Typically, private mortgage insurance is required for loan amounts above the 80% level. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, loans secured by second liens on residential properties were $146.1 million, or 4.3%, and $159.8 million, or 5.0%, respectively, of our total loan portfolio. For commercial real estate and other residential real property loans, Great Southern may loan up to 85% of the appraised value. The origination of loans secured by other property is considered and determined on an individual basis by management with the assistance of any industry guides and other information which may be available. Collateral values are reappraised or reassessed as loans are renewed or when significant events indicating potential impairment occur. On a quarterly basis, management reviews impaired loans to determine whether updated appraisals or reassessments are necessary based on loan performance, collateral type and guarantor support. While not specifically required by our policy, we seek to obtain cross-collateralization of loans to a borrower when it is available and it is most frequently done on commercial loans.

Loan applications are approved at various levels of authority, depending on the type, amount and loan-to-value ratio of the loan. Loan commitments of more than $750,000 (or loans exceeding the Freddie Mac loan limit in the case of fixed-rate, one- to four-family residential loans for resale) must be approved by Great Southern's loan committee. The loan committee is comprised of the Chief Executive Officer of the Bank, the Chief Lending Officer of the Bank (chairman of the committee), and other senior officers of the Bank involved in lending activities. All loans, regardless of size or type, are required to conform to certain minimum underwriting standards to assure portfolio quality. These standards and procedures include, but are not limited to, an analysis of the borrower's financial condition, collateral, repayment ability, verification of liquid assets and credit history as required by loan type. It has been, and continues to be, our practice to verify information from potential borrowers regarding assets, income or payment ability and credit ratings as applicable and as required by the authority approving the loan. Underwriting standards also include loan-to-value ratios which vary depending on collateral type, debt service coverage ratios or debt payment to income ratios, where applicable, credit histories, use of guaranties and other recommended terms relating to equity requirements, amortization, and maturity. Generally, deviations from approved underwriting standards can only be allowed when doing so is not in violation of regulations or statutes and when appropriate lending authority is obtained. The loan committee reviews all new loan originations in excess of lender approval authorities. For secured loans originated and held, most lenders have approval authorities of $250,000 or below while ten senior lenders have approval authority of varying amounts up to $1 million. Lender approval authorities are also subject to loans-to-one borrower limits of $500,000 or below for most lenders and of varying amounts up to $3 million for ten senior lenders. These standards, as well as our collateral requirements, have not significantly changed in recent years.

&#160;

&#160;

In general, state banking laws restrict loans to a single borrower and related entities to no more than 25% of a bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, plus an additional 10% if the loan is collateralized by certain readily marketable collateral. (Real estate is not included in the definition of "readily marketable collateral.") As computed on the basis of the Bank's unimpaired capital and surplus at December 31, 2015, this limit was approximately $108.6 million. See "Government Supervision and Regulation." At December 31, 2015, the Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limit. At December 31, 2015, the Bank's largest relationship for purposes of this limit totaled $48.1 million. All loans included in this relationship were current at December 31, 2015. Our policy does not set a loans-to-one borrower limit that is below the legal limits described; however, we do recognize the need to limit credit risk to any one borrower or group of related borrowers upon consideration of various risk factors. Extensions of credit to borrowers whose past due loans were charged-off or whose loans are classified as substandard require appropriate lending approval for total credit relationships of $250,000 or less or Loan Committee or Special Assets Committee approval on total credit relationships over $250,000.

Great Southern is permitted under applicable regulations to originate or purchase loans and loan participations secured by real estate located in any part of the United States. In addition to the market areas where the Company has a presence, the Bank has made or purchased loans, secured primarily by commercial real estate, in other states, primarily Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. At December 31, 2015, loans in these states comprised less than 1% each, respectively, of the total loan portfolio, except for Illinois, which comprised 2.7% of the total loan portfolio.

Loan Portfolio Composition

The following tables set forth information concerning the composition of the Bank's loan portfolio in dollar amounts and in percentages (before deductions for loans in process, deferred fees and discounts and allowance for loan losses) as of the dates indicated. The tables are based on information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and are qualified by reference to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this report.

The loans acquired in the four FDIC-assisted transactions completed in 2009 through 2012 are, or were, covered by loss sharing agreements between the FDIC and the Bank which afford the Bank at least 80% protection from potential principal losses. Because of these loss sharing agreements, the composition of the loans acquired from the former TeamBank, Vantus Bank, Sun Security Bank and InterBank is shown below in tables separate from the legacy Great Southern portfolio. In addition, the composition of the loans acquired in 2014 from the former Valley Bank, which are not covered by a loss sharing agreement, is shown below in tables separate from the legacy Great Southern portfolio. All of these acquired loan portfolios were initially recorded at their fair values at the acquisition date and are recorded by the Company at their discounted value. The following tables reflect the loan balances excluding discounts.

Through December 31, 2015, gross loan balances (due from the borrower) related to TeamBank were reduced approximately $407.1 million since the transaction date because of $274.1 million of principal repayments, $61.7 million of transfers to foreclosed assets and $71.3 million of charge-downs to customer loan balances. Gross loan balances (due from the borrower) related to Vantus Bank were reduced approximately $299.7 million since the transaction date because of $253.8 million of principal repayments, $16.6 million of transfers to foreclosed assets and $29.3 million of charge-downs to customer loan balances. Gross loan balances (due from the borrower) related to Sun Security Bank were reduced approximately $190.6 million since the transaction date because of $130.8 million of principal repayments, $28.2 million of transfers to foreclosed assets and $31.6 million of charge-offs to customer loan balances. Gross loan balances (due from the borrower) related to InterBank were reduced approximately $199.7 million since the transaction date because of $163.9 million of principal repayments, $14.4 million of transfers to foreclosed assets and $21.4 million of charge-offs to customer loan balances. Gross loan balances (due from the borrower) related to Valley Bank were reduced approximately $83.4 million since the transaction date because of $75.6 million of principal repayments, $1.6 million of transfers to foreclosed assets and $6.2 million of charge-offs to customer loan balances. Based upon the collectability analyses performed at the time of the acquisitions, we expected certain levels of foreclosures and charge-offs and actual results through December 31, 2015, related to the TeamBank, Vantus Bank, Sun Security Bank, InterBank and Valley Bank portfolios, have been better than our expectations. As a result, cash flows expected to be received from the acquired loan pools have increased, resulting in adjustments that were made to the related accretable yield which are discussed in Note 4 of the accompanying audited financial statements, included in Item 8 of this Report.

As of December 31, 2015, loans due after December 31, 2016 with fixed interest rates totaled $38.3 million and loans due after December 31, 2016 with adjustable rates totaled $22.4 million.

At December 31, 2015, $146.1 million, or 4.3%, of total loans were secured by junior lien mortgages and $8.5 million, or 2.9% of residential real estate loans, were interest only residential real estate loans. At December 31, 2014, $159.8 million, or 5.0%, of total loans were secured by junior lien mortgages and $13.2 million, or 4.1% of residential real estate loans, were interest only residential real estate loans. While high loan-to-value ratio mortgage loans are occasionally originated and held, they are typically either considered low risk based on analyses performed or are required to have private mortgage insurance. The Company does not originate or hold option ARM loans or significant amounts of loans with initial teaser rates or subprime loans in its residential real estate portfolio.

To monitor and control risks related to concentrations of credit in the composition of the loan portfolio, management reviews the loan portfolio by loan types, industries and market areas on a monthly basis for credit quality and known and anticipated market conditions. Changes in loan portfolio composition may be made by management based on the performance of each area of business, known and anticipated market conditions, credit demands, the deposit structure of the Bank and the expertise and/or depth of the lending staff. Loan portfolio industry and market areas are monitored regularly for credit quality and trends. Reports detailed by industry and geography are provided to the Board of Directors on a monthly and quarterly basis.

In response to the economic recession that began in 2008, the composition of the Bank's loan portfolio has changed over the past several years; speculative construction and land development loan types have been limited to reduce the risk, commercial real estate loan types have been stabilized and diversified and emphasis has been placed on increasing our multi-family, commercial business and consumer loan portfolios.

Environmental Issues

Loans secured by real property, whether commercial, residential or other, may have a material, negative effect on the financial position and results of operations of the lender if the collateral is environmentally contaminated. The result can be, but is not necessarily limited to, liability for the cost of cleaning up the contamination imposed on the lender by certain federal and state laws, a reduction in the borrower's ability to pay because of the liability imposed upon it for any clean-up costs, a reduction in the value of the collateral because of the presence of contamination or a subordination of security interests in the collateral to a super priority lien securing the cleanup costs by certain state laws.

&#160;

&#160;

Management is aware of the risk that the Bank may be negatively affected by environmentally contaminated collateral and attempts to control this risk through commercially reasonable methods, consistent with guidelines arising from applicable government or regulatory rules and regulations, and to a more limited extent, publications of the lending industry. Management currently is unaware (without, in many circumstances, specific inquiry or investigation of existing collateral, some of which was accepted as collateral before risk controlling measures were implemented) of any environmental contamination of real property securing loans in the Bank's portfolio that would subject the Bank to any material risk. No assurance can be given, however, that the Bank will not be adversely affected by environmental contamination.

Residential Real Estate Lending

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, loans secured by residential real estate, excluding that which is under construction and excluding all FDIC-assisted acquired loans, totaled $692 million and $638 million, respectively, and represented approximately 18.1% and 18.7%, respectively, of the Bank's total loan portfolio. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, covered and non-covered FDIC-assisted acquired loans (net of fair value discounts) secured by residential real estate totaled $228 million and $270 million, respectively, and represented approximately 6.0% and 7.9%, respectively, of the Bank's total loan portfolio. The Bank's legacy one- to four-family residential real estate loan portfolio increased during 2015. Overall, mortgage rates remained historically low throughout 2015, consistent with the past few years. One-to four-family residential real estate loans increased significantly in 2012 with the FDIC-assisted acquisition of InterBank and in 2014 with the FDIC-assisted acquisition of Valley Bank. Since 2010, other residential real estate loan balances continued to increase as there was less competition to finance these projects by non-bank entities and the Bank has emphasized this type of loan. The Bank's legacy multi-family residential real estate loan portfolio grew by about 14% and 20% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2013, the Bank completed a non-FDIC-assisted acquisition of a portfolio of multi-family loans totaling $86 million.

The Bank currently is originating one- to four-family adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans primarily with one-year adjustment periods. Rate adjustments on loans originated prior to July 2001 are based upon changes in prevailing rates for one-year U.S. Treasury securities. Rate adjustments on loans originated since July 2001 are based upon changes in the average of interbank offered rates for twelve month U.S. Dollar-denominated deposits in the London Market (LIBOR) or changes in prevailing rates for one-year U.S. Treasury securities. Rate adjustments are generally limited to 2% maximum annually as well as a maximum aggregate adjustment over the life of the loan. Accordingly, the interest rates on these loans typically may not be as rate sensitive as is the Bank's cost of funds. Generally, the Bank's adjustable-rate mortgage loans are not convertible into fixed-rate loans, do not permit negative amortization of principal and carry no prepayment penalty. The Bank also currently is originating other residential (multi-family) mortgage loans with interest rates that are generally either adjustable with changes to the prime rate of interest or fixed for short periods of time (three to seven years).

The Bank's portfolio of adjustable-rate mortgage loans also includes a number of loans with different adjustment periods, without limitations on periodic rate increases and rate increases over the life of the loans, or which are tied to other short-term market indices. These loans were originated prior to the industry standardization of adjustable-rate loans. Since the adjustable-rate mortgage loans currently held in the Bank's portfolio have not been subject to an interest rate environment which causes them to adjust to the maximum, these loans entail unquantifiable risks resulting from potential increased payment obligations on the borrower as a result of upward repricing. The indices used by Great Southern for these types of loans have not increased significantly in the past three years. Compared to fixed-rate mortgage loans, these loans are subject to increased risk of delinquency or default if a higher, fully-indexed rate of interest subsequently comes into effect in replacement of a lower rate currently in effect. Prior to 2009, the Bank did not experience a significant increase in delinquencies in adjustable-rate mortgage loans due to a relatively low interest rate environment and favorable economic conditions. However, from 2009 through 2012, delinquencies on mortgage loans generally increased. In 2013 through 2015, these delinquencies have trended lower.

In underwriting one- to four-family residential real estate loans, Great Southern evaluates the borrower's ability to make monthly payments and the value of the property securing the loan. It is the policy of Great Southern that generally all one- to four-family residential loans in excess of 80% of the appraised value of the property be insured by a private mortgage insurance company approved by Great Southern for the amount of the loan in excess of 80% of the appraised value. In addition, Great Southern requires borrowers to obtain title and fire and casualty insurance in an amount not less than the amount of the loan. Real estate loans originated by the Bank generally contain a "due on sale" clause allowing the Bank to declare the unpaid principal balance due and payable upon the sale of the property securing the loan. The Bank may enforce these due on sale clauses to the extent permitted by law.

Commercial Real Estate and Construction Lending

Commercial real estate lending has been a significant part of Great Southern's business activities since the mid-1980s. Great Southern does commercial real estate lending in order to increase the potential yield on, and the proportion of interest rate sensitive loans in, its portfolio. At December 31, 2008, commercial real estate loans and commercial construction loans each made up about one fourth of 

&#160;

&#160;

the total loan portfolio. The economic recession that began in 2008 resulted in reduced activity in the market caused by the downturn in the economy and reduced real estate values. In response, Great Southern began limiting residential and commercial land development lending to reduce the risk in the portfolio and began originating an increased amount of commercial real estate loans. Since December 31, 2008, the commercial land development construction loan portfolio has decreased significantly and, overall, commercial real estate loans have trended upward. The increase in commercial real estate loans in 2014 and 2015 indicates some economic improvement with increased investor activity in sales, purchases and refinancing of these types of properties. Both commercial real estate occupancy and rental rates show improvement in the Bank's market areas. Excluding FDIC-assisted acquired loans, over the last three years, commercial real estate loans made up approximately 31-36% of the total loan portfolio while commercial construction loans were 10-16%. Great Southern expects to continue to limit lending on land development loans in 2016 with increases in commercial construction and commercial real estate anticipated as long as the economy continues to improve. See "Government Supervision and Regulation" below.

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, loans secured by commercial real estate, excluding that which is under construction and excluding all FDIC-assisted acquired loans, totaled $1.1 billion and $987 million, respectively, or approximately 28.3% and 28.9%, respectively, of the Bank's total loan portfolio. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, covered and non-covered acquired loans (net of fair value discounts) secured by commercial real estate totaled $73 million and $108 million, respectively, and represented approximately 1.9% and 3.2%, respectively, of the Bank's total loan portfolio. In addition, at December 31, 2015 and 2014, construction loans, excluding all acquired loans, secured by projects under construction and the land on which the projects are located aggregated $721 million and $514 million, respectively, or 19.0% and 15.0%, respectively, of the Bank's total loan portfolio. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, covered and non-covered acquired construction loans (net of fair value discounts) totaled $8 million and $15 million, respectively, and represented approximately 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively, of the Bank's total loan portfolio. A majority of the Bank's commercial real estate loans have been originated with adjustable rates of interest, most of which are tied to the national prime rate, or fixed rates of interest with short-term maturities. A large majority of the Bank's commercial real estate loans (both fixed and adjustable) mature in five years or less. Substantially all of these loans were originated with loan commitments which did not exceed 80% of the appraised value of the properties securing the loans.

The Bank's construction loans generally have a term of eighteen months or less. The construction loan agreements for one- to four-family projects generally require principal reductions as individual condominium units or single-family houses are built and sold to a third party. This insures that the remaining loan balance, as a proportion to the value of the remaining security, does not increase, assuming that the value of the remaining security does not decrease. Loan proceeds are disbursed in increments as construction progresses. Generally, the amount of each disbursement is based on the construction cost estimate with inspections of the project performed in connection with each disbursement request. Normally, Great Southern's commercial real estate and other residential construction loans are made either as the initial stage of a combination loan (i.e., with a commitment from the Bank to provide permanent financing upon completion of the project) or with a commitment from a third party to provide permanent financing.

The Bank's commercial real estate and construction loan portfolios consist of loans with diverse collateral types. The following table sets forth loans that were secured by certain types of collateral at December 31, 2015, excluding covered and non-covered FDIC-assisted acquired loans. These collateral types represent the five highest percentage concentrations of commercial real estate and construction loan types in the loan portfolio.

Commercial real estate lending and construction lending generally affords the Bank an opportunity to receive interest at rates higher than those obtainable from residential mortgage lending and to receive higher origination and other loan fees. In addition, commercial real estate loans and construction loans are generally made with adjustable rates of interest or, if made on a fixed-rate basis, for relatively short terms. Nevertheless, commercial real estate lending entails significant additional risks as compared with residential mortgage lending. Commercial real estate loans typically involve large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, the payment experience on loans secured by commercial properties is typically dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate project and thus may be subject, to a greater extent, to adverse conditions in the real estate market or in the economy generally.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Construction loans also involve additional risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are advanced upon the security of the project under construction, which is of uncertain value prior to the completion of construction. Moreover, because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, delays arising from labor problems, material shortages, and other unpredictable contingencies, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total loan funds required to complete a project, and the related loan-to-value ratios. See also the discussion under the headings "- Classified Assets" and "- Loan Delinquencies and Defaults" below.

The Company executes interest rate swaps with certain commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. The Company began offering this service during 2011. Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting interest rate swaps that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. As the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had 28 interest rate swaps totaling $123.0 million in notional amount with commercial customers, and 28 interest rate swaps with the same notional amount with third parties related to this program. As of December 31, 2014, the Company had 28 interest rate swaps totaling $125.1 million in notional amount with commercial customers, and 28 interest rate swaps with the same notional amount with third parties related to this program. As part of the Valley Bank FDIC-assisted acquisition, the Company acquired seven loans with related interest rate swaps. Valley's swap program differed from the Company's in that Valley did not have back to back swaps with the customer and a counterparty. Two of the seven acquired loans with interest rate swaps have paid off. The notional amount of the five remaining Valley swaps is $3.9 million at December 31, 2015. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company recognized net losses of $43,000 and $345,000, respectively, in noninterest income related to changes in the fair value of these swaps.

Other Commercial Lending

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, Great Southern had $358 million and $354 million, respectively, in other commercial loans outstanding, excluding all FDIC-assisted acquired loans, or 9.4% and 10.4%, respectively, of the Bank's total loan portfolio. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, covered and non-covered acquired other commercial loans (net of fair value discounts) totaled $10 million and $18 million, respectively, and represented approximately 0.3% and 0.5%, respectively, of the Bank's total loan portfolio. Great Southern's other commercial lending activities encompass loans with a variety of purposes and security, including loans to finance accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. &#160; Great Southern expects to continue to originate loans in this category subject to market conditions and applicable regulatory restrictions. See "Government Supervision and Regulation" below. 

Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from his or her employment and other income and which are secured by real property, the value of which tends to be more easily ascertainable, other commercial loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower's business. Commercial loans are generally secured by business assets, such as accounts receivable, equipment and inventory. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of other commercial loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself. Further, the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business.

The Bank's management recognizes the generally increased risks associated with other commercial lending. Great Southern's commercial lending policy emphasizes complete credit file documentation and analysis of the borrower's character, capacity to repay the loan, the adequacy of the borrower's capital and collateral as well as an evaluation of the industry conditions affecting the borrower. Review of the borrower's past, present and future cash flows is also an important aspect of Great Southern's credit analysis. In addition, the Bank generally obtains personal guarantees from the borrowers on these types of loans. Historically, the majority of Great Southern's commercial loans have been to borrowers in southwestern and central Missouri and the St. Louis, Mo. area. With the acquisitions in 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2014, geographic concentrations for commercial loans expanded to include the greater Kansas City, Mo. area, several areas in Iowa, and the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minn. area. Great Southern has continued its commercial lending in all of these geographic areas.

As part of its commercial lending activities, Great Southern issues letters of credit and receives fees averaging approximately 1% of the amount of the letter of credit per year. At December 31, 2015, Great Southern had 118 letters of credit outstanding in the aggregate amount of $32.1 million. Approximately 17% of the aggregate amount of these letters of credit was secured, including one $1.7 million letter of credit secured by real estate which was issued to enhance the issuance of housing revenue refunding bonds and was current.

Consumer Lending

Great Southern management views consumer lending as an important component of its business strategy. Specifically, consumer loans generally have short terms to maturity, thus reducing Great Southern's exposure to changes in interest rates, and carry higher rates of interest than do residential mortgage loans. In addition, Great Southern believes that the offering of consumer loan products helps to expand and create stronger ties to its existing customer base.

Great Southern offers a variety of secured consumer loans, including automobile loans, boat loans, home equity loans and loans secured by savings deposits. In addition, Great Southern also offers home improvement loans and unsecured consumer loans. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Consumer loans, excluding all FDIC-assisted acquired loans, totaled $599 million and $468 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, or 15.7% and 13.7%, respectively, of the Bank's total loan portfolio. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, covered and non-covered acquired consumer loans (net of fair value discounts) totaled $43 million and $48 million, respectively, and represented approximately 1.1% and 1.4%, respectively, of the Bank's total loan portfolio.

The underwriting standards employed by the Bank for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant's payment history on other debts and an assessment of ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security, if any, in relation to the proposed loan amount.

Beginning in 1998, the Bank implemented indirect lending relationships, primarily with automobile dealerships. Through these dealer relationships, the dealer completes the application with the consumer and then submits it to the Bank for credit approval. While the Bank's initial and ongoing concentrated effort was on automobiles, the program has evolved for use with other tangible products where financing of the product is provided through the seller, including, to a lesser extent, boats and manufactured homes. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Bank had $520 million and $409 million, respectively, of auto, boat, modular home and recreational vehicle loans in its portfolio, including acquired loans totaling $7 million and $9 million, respectively.

Indirect consumer loans increased significantly in 2015 and 2014 due to an increased number of lending relationships with automobile dealerships in our market areas and were $403.9 and $319.7 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The total indirect consumer loans at December 31, 2015 was made up of the following types of loans: $321.3 million of used auto loans, $40.3 million of manufactured home loans, $31.8 million of new auto loans, $6.8 million of new boat loans, and various other loans including loans for RVs, used boats, ATVs and motorcycles.

Consumer loans may entail greater risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciable assets such as automobiles. In such cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation. The remaining deficiency often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower's continuing financial strength, and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state consumer bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can be recovered on these loans. These loans may also give rise to claims and defenses by a consumer loan borrower against an assignee of these loans such as the Bank, and a borrower may be able to assert against the assignee claims and defenses which it has against the seller of the underlying collateral.

Originations, Purchases, Sales and Servicing of Loans

The Bank originates loans through internal loan production personnel located in the Bank's main and branch offices, as well as loan production offices. Walk-in customers and referrals from existing customers of the Company are also important sources of loan originations.

Great Southern may also purchase whole loans and participation interests in loans (generally without recourse, except in cases of breach of representation, warranty or covenant) from other banks, thrift institutions and life insurance companies (originators). The purchase transaction is governed by a participation agreement entered into by the originator and participant (Great Southern) containing guidelines as to ownership, control and servicing rights, among others. The originator may retain all rights with respect to enforcement, collection and administration of the loan. This may limit Great Southern's ability to control its credit risk when it purchases participations in these loans. For instance, the terms of participation agreements vary; however, generally Great Southern may not have direct access to the borrower, and the institution administering the loan may have some discretion in the administration of performing loans and the collection of non-performing loans.

Over the years, a number of banks, both locally and regionally, have sought to diversify the risk in their portfolios. In order to take advantage of this situation, Great Southern purchases participations in commercial real estate, commercial construction and other commercial loans. Great Southern subjects these loans to its normal underwriting standards used for originated loans and rejects any credits that do not meet those guidelines. The originating bank retains the servicing of these loans. Excluding all FDIC-assisted acquired loans, the Bank purchased $111.7 million and $29.1 million of these loans in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of the total $186.7 million of purchased participation loans outstanding at December 31, 2015, the largest aggregate amount outstanding purchased from one institution was $28.5 million. This total was comprised of three loans, each to unrelated borrowers, with the largest outstanding balance of $14.4 million secured by a student housing property in Nebraska. None of the loans in this relationship were non-performing at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, loans which were covered by loss sharing agreements with the FDIC included purchased and participation loans of $0.4 million and $-0-, respectively. At December 31, 2015, loans which were previously covered by loss sharing agreements with the FDIC but are no longer covered included purchased and participation loans of 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

$3.4 million. At December 31, 2015, acquired non-covered loans included purchased and participation loans of $12.1 million. These amounts represent the undiscounted balance of these loans.

In October 2013, the Bank purchased $86.1 million of multi-family residential loans, which were auctioned by an unrelated FDIC-insured financial institution. The Bank paid $87.9 million for the loans, which resulted in a 2.125% premium over the principal balances of the portfolio. This purchased loan portfolio totaled $51.8 million and $70.0 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively . There were no loans from this purchased loan portfolio included in non-performing loans at December 31, 2015.

In August 2014, the Bank purchased $21.1 million of commercial real estate loans (primarily retail projects with single tenants), which were auctioned by an unrelated FDIC-insured financial institution. The Bank paid $21.3 million for the loans, which resulted in a 1.15% premium over the principal balances of the portfolio. This purchased loan portfolio totaled $20.1 and $20.7 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. There were no loans from this purchased loan portfolio included in non-performing loans at December 31, 2015.

From time to time, Great Southern also sells non-residential loan participations generally without recourse to private investors, such as other banks, thrift institutions and life insurance companies (participants). The sales transaction is governed by a participation agreement entered into by the originator (Great Southern) and participant containing guidelines as to ownership, control and servicing rights, among others. Great Southern retains servicing rights for these participations sold. These participations are sold with a provision for repurchase upon breach of representation, warranty or covenant.

Great Southern also sells whole residential real estate loans without recourse to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae as well as to private investors, such as other banks, thrift institutions, mortgage companies and life insurance companies. Whole real estate loans are sold with a provision for repurchase upon breach of representation, warranty or covenant. These representations, warranties and covenants include those regarding the compliance of loan originations with all applicable legal requirements, mortgage title insurance policies when applicable, enforceable liens on collateral, collateral type, borrower credit worthiness, private mortgage insurance when required and compliance with all applicable federal regulations. A minimal number of repurchase requests have been received to date based on a breach of representations, warranties and covenants as outlined in the investor contracts. These loans are generally sold for cash in amounts equal to the unpaid principal amount of the loans adjusted for current market yields to the buyer. The sale amounts generally produce gains to the Bank and allow a margin for servicing income on loans when the servicing is retained by the Bank. However, residential real estate loans sold in recent years have primarily been with Great Southern releasing control of the servicing of the loans.

The Bank sold one- to four-family whole real estate loans and loan participations in aggregate amounts of $154.8 million, $152.5 million and $210.8 million during fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Sales of whole real estate loans and participations in real estate loans can be beneficial to the Bank since these sales generally generate income at the time of sale, produce future servicing income on loans where servicing is retained, provide funds for additional lending and other investments, and increase liquidity.

Gains, losses and transfer fees on sales of loans and loan participations are recognized at the time of the sale. When real estate loans and loan participations sold have an average contractual interest rate that differs from the agreed upon yield to the purchaser (less the agreed upon servicing fee), resulting gains or losses are recognized in an amount equal to the present value of the differential over the estimated remaining life of the loans. Any resulting discount or premium is accreted or amortized over the same estimated life using a method approximating the level yield interest method. When real estate loans and loan participations are sold with servicing released, as the Bank primarily does, an additional fee is received for the servicing rights. Net gains and transfer fees on sales of loans for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $3.9 million, $4.1 million and $4.9 million, respectively. These gains were from the sale of fixed-rate residential loans.

The Bank serviced loans owned by others totaling approximately $237.7 million and $266.4 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of the total loans serviced at December 31, 2015, $130.2 million related to commercial real estate, commercial business and construction loans, portions of which were sold to other parties. The remaining $107.5 million of loans serviced for others related to one- to four-family real estate loans which the Bank had originated and sold, but retained the obligation to service, or had acquired the servicing through various FDIC-assisted transactions. The servicing of these loans generated fees (net of amortization of the servicing rights) to the Bank for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, of $241,000, $253,000 and $350,000, respectively.

In addition to interest earned on loans and loan origination fees, the Bank receives fees for loan commitments, letters of credit, prepayments, modifications, late payments, transfers of loans due to changes of property ownership and other miscellaneous services. The fees vary from time to time, generally depending on the supply of funds and other competitive conditions in the market. Fees from prepayments, commitments, letters of credit and late payments totaled $2.3 million, $1.6 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Loan origination fees, net of related costs, are accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 310-20, Receivables &#8211; Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs . Loan fees and certain direct loan origination costs are 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

deferred, and the net fee or cost is recognized in interest income using the level-yield method over the contractual life of the loan. For further discussion of this matter, see Note 1 of the accompanying audited financial statements, included in Item 8 of this Report.

Loan Delinquencies and Defaults

For loans which have not been acquired in an FDIC-assisted transaction, when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan, the Bank attempts to cause the delinquency to be cured by contacting the borrower. In the case of loans secured by residential real estate, a late notice is sent 15 days after the due date. If the delinquency is not cured by the 30th day, a delinquent notice is sent to the borrower.

Additional written contacts are made with the borrower 45 and 60 days after the due date. If the delinquency continues for a period of 65 days, the Bank usually institutes appropriate action to foreclose on the collateral. The actual time it takes to foreclose on the collateral varies depending on the particular circumstances and the applicable governing law. If foreclosed upon, the property is sold at public auction and may be purchased by the Bank. Delinquent consumer loans are handled in a generally similar manner, except that initial contacts are made when the payment is five days past due and appropriate action may be taken to collect any loan payment that is delinquent for more than 15 days. The Bank's procedures for repossession and sale of consumer collateral are subject to various requirements under the applicable consumer protection laws as well as other applicable laws and the determination by the Bank that it would be beneficial from a cost basis.

Delinquent commercial business loans and loans secured by commercial real estate are initially handled by the loan officer in charge of the loan, who is responsible for contacting the borrower. The President and Chief Lending Officer also work with the commercial loan officers to see that necessary steps are taken to collect delinquent loans. In addition, the Bank has a Problem Loan Committee which meets at least quarterly and reviews all classified assets, as well as other loans which management feels may present possible collection problems. If an acceptable workout of a delinquent commercial loan cannot be agreed upon, the Bank may initiate foreclosure proceedings on any collateral securing the loan. However, in all cases, whether a commercial or other loan, the prevailing circumstances may be such that management may determine it is in the best interest of the Bank not to foreclose on the collateral.

These processes are generally the same for loans which have been acquired in an FDIC-assisted transaction, regardless of whether they are covered by loss sharing agreements.

Classified Assets

Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets such as debt and equity securities considered to be of lesser quality as "substandard," "doubtful" or "loss" assets. The regulations require insured institutions to classify their own assets and to establish prudent specific allocations for losses from assets classified "substandard" or "doubtful." "Substandard" assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as "doubtful," have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as "substandard" with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. For the portion of assets classified as "loss," an institution is required to either establish specific allowances of 100% of the amount classified or charge such amount off its books. Assets that do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess a potential weakness (referred to as "special mention" assets), are required to be listed on the Bank's watch list and monitored for further deterioration. In addition, a bank's regulators may require the establishment of a general allowance for losses based on the general quality of the asset portfolio of the bank. Following are the total classified assets at December 31, 2015 and 2014, per the Bank's internal asset classification list, excluding assets acquired 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

through FDIC-assisted transactions which are covered by loss sharing agreements. The allowances for loan losses reflected below are the portions of the Bank's total allowances for loan losses relating to these classified loans. There were no significant off-balance sheet items classified at December 31, 2015 and 2014.

Non-Performing Assets

The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of gross non-performing assets (classified loans which are not performing under regulatory guidelines and all foreclosed assets, including assets acquired in settlement of loans) in the Bank's loan portfolio as of the dates indicated. Loans generally are placed on non-accrual status when the loan becomes 90 days delinquent or when the collection of principal, interest, or both, otherwise becomes doubtful.

Former TeamBank, Vantus Bank, Sun Security Bank and InterBank non-performing assets, including foreclosed assets, are not included in the totals of non-performing assets below due to the respective loss sharing agreements with the FDIC, which substantially cover principal losses that may be incurred in these portfolios for the applicable terms under the agreements. At December 31, 2015, there were no material non-performing assets that were previously covered, and are now not covered, under the TeamBank or Vantus Bank non-single-family loss sharing agreements. In addition, these TeamBank, Vantus Bank, Sun Security Bank and InterBank assets were initially recorded at their estimated fair values as of their acquisition dates of March 20, 2009, September 4, 2009, October 7, 2011, and April 27, 2012, respectively. The overall performance of the FDIC-covered loan pools acquired in 2009, 2011 and 2012 has been better than original expectations as of the acquisition dates. Former Valley Bank loans are also excluded from the totals of non-performing assets below, although they are not covered by a loss sharing agreement. As in the previous FDIC-assisted acquisitions, former Valley Bank loans are accounted for in pools and were recorded at their fair value at the time of the acquisition as of June 20, 2014; therefore, these loan pools are analyzed rather than the individual loans.

The loss sharing agreement for the non-single-family portion of the loans acquired in the TeamBank transaction ended on March 31, 2014. Any additional losses in that non-single-family portfolio are not eligible for loss sharing coverage. At this time, the Company does not expect any material losses in this non-single-family loan portfolio, which totaled $16.2 million at December 31, 2015.

The loss sharing agreement for the non-single-family portion of the loans acquired in the Vantus Bank transaction ended on September 30, 2014. Any additional losses in that non-single-family portfolio are not eligible for loss sharing coverage. At this time, the Company does not expect any material losses in this non-single-family loan portfolio, which totaled $17.1 million, at December 31, 2015.

Gross impaired loans totaled $62.2 million at December 31, 2015 and $61.7 million at December 31, 2014. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. See Note 3 "Loans" of the accompanying audited financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information including further detail of non-accruing loans and impaired loans and details of troubled debt restructurings. See also Note 15 "Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments" of the accompanying audited financial statements included in Item 8 for additional information.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, gross interest income which would have been recorded had the non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms amounted to $1.0 million. No interest income was included on these loans for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2014, gross interest income which would have been recorded had the non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms amounted to $1.1 million. No interest income was included on these loans for the year ended December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2013, gross interest income which would have been recorded had the non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms amounted to $1.6 million. No interest income was included on these loans for the year ended December 31, 2013.

Allowances for Losses on Loans and Foreclosed Assets

Great Southern maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses known and inherent in the loan portfolio based upon ongoing, monthly assessments of the loan portfolio. Our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements, which include a formula allowance, specific allowances for identified problem loans and portfolio segments and economic conditions that may lead to a concern about the loan portfolio or segments of the loan portfolio.

The formula allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans based on the internal risk evaluation of such loans or pools of loans. Changes in risk evaluations of both performing and non-performing loans affect the amount of the formula allowance. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Loss factors are based both on our historical loss experience and on significant factors that, in management's judgment, affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date. Loan loss factors for portfolio segments are representative of the credit risks associated with loans in those segments. The greater the credit risks associated with a particular segment, the greater the loss factor.

The appropriateness of the allowance is reviewed by management based upon its evaluation of then-existing economic and business conditions affecting our key lending areas. Other conditions that management considers in determining the appropriateness of the allowance include, but are not limited to, changes to our underwriting standards (if any), credit quality trends (including changes in non-performing loans expected to result from existing economic and other market conditions), trends in collateral values, loan volumes and concentrations, and recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio that existed as of the balance sheet date and the impact that such conditions were believed to have had on the collectability of those loans.

Senior management reviews these conditions weekly in discussions with our credit officers. To the extent that any of these conditions are evident in a specifically identifiable problem loan or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date, management's estimate of the effect of such condition may be reflected as a specific allowance applicable to such loan or portfolio segment. Where any of these conditions are not evident in a specifically identifiable problem loan or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date, management's evaluation of the loss related to these conditions is reflected in the general allowance associated with our loan portfolio. The evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these conditions is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem loans or portfolio segments.

The amounts actually observed in respect of these losses can vary significantly from the estimated amounts. Our methodology permits adjustments to any loss factor used in the computation of the formula allowances in the event that, in management's judgment, significant factors which affect the collectability of the portfolio, as of the evaluation date, are not reflected in the current loss factors. By assessing the estimated losses inherent in our loan portfolio on a monthly basis, we can adjust specific and inherent loss estimates based upon more current information.

On a quarterly basis, senior management presents a formal assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses to Great Southern's board of directors for the board's approval of the allowance. Assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective as it requires making material estimates including the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans or changes in the market value of collateral securing loans that may be susceptible to significant change. In the opinion of management, the allowance when taken as a whole is adequate to absorb reasonable estimated loan losses inherent in Great Southern's loan portfolio.

Allowances for estimated losses on foreclosed assets (real estate and other assets acquired through foreclosure) are charged to expense, when in the opinion of management, any significant and permanent decline in the market value of the underlying asset reduces the market value to less than the carrying value of the asset. Senior management assesses the market value of each foreclosed asset individually.

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, Great Southern had an allowance for losses on loans of $38.1 million and $38.4 million, respectively, of which $6.1 million and $5.1 million, respectively, had been allocated for specific loans. All loans with specific allowances were considered to be impaired loans. The allowance and the activity within the allowance during 2015, 2014 and 2013 are discussed further in Note 3 "Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses" of the accompanying audited financial statements and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained in Item 8 and Item 7 of this Report, respectively.

On at least a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates the securities portfolio to determine if an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) needs to be recorded. For debt securities with fair values below carrying value, when the Company does not intend to sell a debt security, and it is more likely than not the Company will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis, it recognizes the credit component of an OTTI of a debt security in earnings and the remaining portion in other comprehensive income. For held-to-maturity debt securities, the amount of an OTTI recorded in other comprehensive income for the noncredit portion of a previous OTTI is amortized prospectively over the remaining life of the security on the basis of the timing of future estimated cash flows of the security.

&#160;

&#160;

The Company's consolidated statements of income as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, reflect the full impairment (that is, the difference between the security's amortized cost basis and fair value) on debt securities that the Company intends to sell or would more likely than not be required to sell before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis. For available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities that management has no intent to sell and believes that it more likely than not will not be required to sell prior to recovery, only the credit loss component of the impairment is recognized in earnings, while the noncredit loss is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. The credit loss component recognized in earnings is identified as the amount of principal cash flows not expected to be received over the remaining term of the security as projected based on cash flow projections.

For equity securities, if any, when the Company has decided to sell an impaired available-for-sale security and the Company does not expect the fair value of the security to fully recover before the expected time of sale, the security is deemed other-than-temporarily impaired in the period in which the decision to sell is made. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the impairment is deemed other than temporary even if a decision to sell has not been made.

Sources of Funds

General . Deposit accounts have traditionally been the principal source of the Bank's funds for use in lending and for other general business purposes. In addition to deposits, the Bank obtains funds through advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines ("FHLBank") and other borrowings, loan repayments, loan sales, and cash flows generated from operations. Scheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and the related costs of such funds have varied widely. Borrowings such as FHLBank advances may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for seasonal reductions in deposits or deposit inflows at less than projected levels and may be used on a longer-term basis to support expanded lending activities. The availability of funds from loan sales is influenced by general interest rates as well as the volume of originations.

Deposits . The Bank attracts both short-term and long-term deposits from the general public by offering a wide variety of accounts and rates and also purchases brokered deposits from time to time. The Bank offers regular savings accounts, checking accounts, various money market accounts, fixed-interest rate certificates with varying maturities, certificates of deposit in minimum amounts of $100,000 ("Jumbo" accounts), brokered certificates and individual retirement accounts. In 2013, total deposits decreased primarily as a result of decreases in time deposits generally and specifically related to the time deposits assumed in the 2012 FDIC-assisted transaction, as the Bank reduced rates paid on these types of deposits. In addition, interest-bearing demand and savings deposits also decreased. These transaction accounts decreased mainly due to planned reductions in certain account types, including accounts with collateralized deposit balances. Also, some deposit types which had previously paid a low rate of interest were switched to non-interest-bearing demand deposit types. In 2014, the Bank increased its deposits through internal growth and the assumption of deposits in another FDIC-assisted transaction and a branch acquisition. In 2015, the Bank again increased its deposits through internal growth, primarily in interest-bearing demand and savings deposits and non-interest-bearing demand accounts. Additionally in 2015, the Bank increased its brokered deposits by $110 million. The deposit growth and cash flows from payments on investment securities were used to fund the Bank's loan growth.

A table showing maturity information for the Bank's time deposits as of December 31, 2015, is presented in Note 8 of the accompanying audited financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Report.

The variety of deposit accounts offered by the Bank has allowed it to be competitive in obtaining funds and has allowed it to respond with flexibility to changes in consumer demand. The Bank has become more susceptible to short-term fluctuations in deposit flows, as customers have become more interest rate conscious and the Bank's deposit mix has changed to a smaller percentage of time deposits. The Bank manages the pricing of its deposits in keeping with its asset/liability management and profitability objectives. Based on its experience, management believes that its certificate accounts are relatively stable sources of deposits, while its checking accounts have proven to be more volatile. In the past three years, the Bank has focused on growing its checking accounts both internally and through acquisitions. The ability of the Bank to attract and maintain deposits, and the rates paid on these deposits, has been and will continue to be significantly affected by money market conditions.

The following table sets forth the time remaining until maturity of the Bank's time deposits as of December 31, 2015. The table is based on information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Brokered deposits . Brokered deposits are marketed through national brokerage firms to their customers in $1,000 increments. The Bank maintains only one account for the total deposit amount while the detailed records of owners are maintained by the Depository 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Trust Company under the name of CEDE &#38; Co. The deposits are transferable just like a stock or bond investment and the customer can open the account with only a phone call or an online request. This provides a large deposit for the Bank at a lower operating cost since the Bank only has one account to maintain versus several accounts with multiple interest and maturity dates. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Bank had approximately $283.7 million and $173.5 million in brokered deposits, respectively.

Included in the brokered deposits total at December 31, 2015 and 2014, was $12.2 million and $23.7 million, respectively in Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (CDARS) customer deposit accounts. CDARS customer deposit accounts are accounts that are just like any other deposit account on the Company's books, except that the account total exceeds the FDIC deposit insurance maximum. When a customer places a large deposit with a CDARS Network bank, that bank uses CDARS to place the funds into deposit accounts issued by other banks in the CDARS Network. This occurs in increments of less than the standard FDIC insurance maximum, so that both principal and interest are eligible for complete FDIC protection. Other Network members do the same thing with their customers' funds. Also included in the brokered deposits total at December 31, 2015, was $117.8 million in CDARS purchased funds accounts. There were no CDARS purchased funds at December 31, 2014. CDARS purchased funds transactions represent an easy, cost-effective source of funding without collateralization or credit limits for the Company. Purchased funds transactions help the Company obtain large blocks of funding while providing control over pricing and diversity of wholesale funding options. Purchased funds transactions are obtained through a bid process that occurs weekly, with varying maturity terms.

Unlike non-brokered deposits where the deposit amount can be withdrawn prior to maturity with a penalty for any reason, including increasing interest rates, a brokered deposit (excluding CDARS) can only be withdrawn in the event of the death, or court declared mental incompetence, of the depositor. This allows the Bank to better manage the maturity of its deposits. Currently, the rates offered by the Bank for brokered deposits are comparable to that offered for retail certificates of deposit of similar size and maturity. Because the Bank had kept higher levels of liquidity since the economic recession began in 2008, we had gradually reduced the amount of brokered deposits (excluding CDARS) utilized since December 31, 2008. As loan demand began to increase in 2013 through 2015, we began to gradually increase our usage of brokered deposits again.

The Company may use interest rate swaps from time to time to manage its interest rate risks from recorded financial liabilities. In the past, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements with the objective of economically hedging against the effects of changes in the fair value of its liabilities for fixed rate brokered certificates of deposit caused by changes in market interest rates. These interest rate swaps allowed the Company to create funding of varying maturities at a variable rate that in the past has approximated three-month LIBOR. The Company did not utilize these types of interest rate swaps in 2015, 2014 or 2013.

Borrowings . Great Southern's other sources of funds include advances from the FHLBank, a Qualified Loan Review ("QLR") arrangement with the FRB, customer repurchase agreements and other borrowings.

As a member of the FHLBank, the Bank is required to own capital stock in the FHLBank and is authorized to apply for advances from the FHLBank. Each FHLBank credit program has its own interest rate, which may be fixed or variable, and range of maturities. The FHLBank may prescribe the acceptable uses for these advances, as well as other risks on availability, limitations on the size of the advances and repayment provisions. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Bank's FHLBank advances outstanding were $263.5 million and $271.6 million, respectively. The Bank utilized FHLBank advances to fund loan growth during 2014 and 2015.

The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis ("FRBSL") has a QLR program where the Bank can borrow on a temporary basis using commercial loans pledged to the FRBSL. Under the QLR program, the Bank can borrow any amount up to a calculated collateral value of the commercial loans pledged, for virtually any reason that creates a temporary cash need. Examples of this could be: (1) the need to fund for late outgoing wires or cash letter settlements, (2) the need to disburse one or several loans but the permanent source of funds will not be available for a few days; (3) a temporary spike in interest rates on other funding sources that are being used; or (4) the need to purchase a security for collateral pledging purposes a few days prior to the funds becoming available on an existing security that is maturing. The Bank had commercial loans pledged to the FRBSL at December 31, 2015 that would have allowed approximately $633.7 million to be borrowed under the above arrangement. There were no outstanding borrowings from the FRBSL at December 31, 2015 or 2014 and the facility was not used during 2015 or 2014.

The Bank enters into sales of securities under agreements to repurchase (reverse repurchase agreements). Reverse repurchase agreements are treated as financings, and the obligations to repurchase securities sold are reflected as a liability in the statements of financial condition. The dollar amount of securities underlying the agreements remains in the asset accounts. Securities underlying the agreements are being held by the Bank during the agreement period. The agreements generally are written on a one-month or less term.

In September 2008, the Company entered into a structured repurchase borrowing transaction for $50 million. This borrowing bore interest at a fixed rate of 4.34%, was scheduled to mature September 15, 2015, and had a call provision that allowed the repurchase counterparty to call the borrowing quarterly. The Company pledged investment securities to collateralize this borrowing. In June 2014, the Company elected to repay this structured repurchase borrowing.

In November 2006, Great Southern Capital Trust II ("Trust II"), a statutory trust formed by the Company for the purpose of issuing the securities, issued $25.0 million aggregate liquidation amount of floating rate cumulative trust preferred securities. The Trust II securities bear a floating distribution rate equal to 90-day LIBOR plus 1.60%. The Trust II securities were redeemable at the Company's option beginning in February 2012, and if not sooner redeemed, mature on February 1, 2037. The Trust II securities were sold in a private transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The gross proceeds of the offering were used to purchase Junior Subordinated Debentures from the Company totaling $25.8 million and bearing an interest rate identical to the distribution rate on the Trust II securities. The initial interest rate on the Trust II debentures was 6.98%. The interest rate was 1.93% and 1.83% at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

In July 2007, Great Southern Capital Trust III ("Trust III"), a statutory trust formed by the Company for the purpose of issuing the securities, issued $5.0 million aggregate liquidation amount of floating rate cumulative trust preferred securities. The Trust III securities bore a floating distribution rate equal to 90-day LIBOR plus 1.40%. The Trust III securities were redeemable at the Company's option beginning in October 2012, and if not sooner redeemed, mature on October 1, 2037. The Trust III securities were sold in a private transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The gross proceeds of the offering were used to purchase Junior Subordinated Debentures from the Company totaling $5.2 million and bearing an interest rate identical to the distribution rate on the Trust III securities. The initial interest rate on the Trust III debentures was 6.76%. The interest rate was 1.64% at December 31, 2014.

In July 2015, the Company was the successful bidder in an auction of the $5.0 million aggregate liquidation amount of floating rate cumulative trust preferred securities issued in 2007 by Great Southern Capital Trust III. The Company purchased the trust preferred securities at a discount, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.1 million. Subsequent to the purchase, which resulted in the Company's ownership of all of the outstanding common and preferred securities of Great Southern Capital Trust III, such securities were canceled and the principal amount of the Company's related debentures, which had equaled the aggregate liquidation amount of the outstanding common and preferred securities of Great Southern Capital Trust III, was reduced to zero.

In 2013, the Company entered into two interest rate cap agreements for a portion of its Junior Subordinated Debentures associated with its trust preferred securities. Under the agreements, with notional amounts of $25.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively, the Company will pay interest on its Junior Subordinated Debentures in accordance with the original terms at a floating rate based on LIBOR. Should interest rise above a certain threshold, the counterparty will reimburse the Company for interest paid such that the Company will have an effective interest rate on the portion of its Junior Subordinated Debentures no higher than 2.37% for the first agreement and no higher than 2.17% on the second agreement. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The fair value of the interest rate caps at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $128,000 and $415,000, respectively. The $5.0 million notional interest rate cap agreement was terminated when the Company purchased the related trust preferred securities in July 2015.

Generally, the purpose of VFP II is to hold real estate assets which have been obtained through foreclosure by the Bank. The real estate assets obtained through foreclosure were formerly collateral for a participation loan sold by the Bank. The Bank has a 50 percent interest in VFP II and at December 31, 2015 its investment totaled $2.2 million. One other entity also has an interest in VFP II as a result of its participation in the loan sold by the Bank. VFP II had net income of $4,000 and $6,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Competition

The banking industry in the Company's market areas is highly competitive. In addition to competing with other commercial and savings banks and savings and loan associations, the Company competes with credit unions, finance companies, leasing companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms and many other financial service firms. Competition is based on a number of factors including, among others, customer service, quality and range of products and services offered, price, reputation, interest rates on loans and deposits, lending limits and customer convenience. Our ability to continue to compete effectively also depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees, while managing compensation and other costs.

A substantial number of the commercial banks operating in most of the Company's market areas are branches or subsidiaries of large organizations affiliated with statewide, regional or national banking companies and as a result they may have greater resources with which to compete. Additionally, the Company faces competition from a large number of community banks, many of which have senior management who were previously with other local banks or investor groups with strong local business and community ties.

The Company encounters strong competition in attracting deposits throughout its six-state retail footprint. The Company attracts a significant amount of deposits through its branch offices primarily from the communities in which those branch offices are located. Of our total 110 branch offices at the end of 2015, 66.2% of our deposit franchise dollars (based on FDIC market share deposits) were located in Missouri, where our total market share at June 30, 2015, was 1.4%, or eighth in the state. The financial institutions with the top three market share positions in Missouri at June 30, 2015, were U.S. Bank, Scottrade Bank, and Bank of America, which had a combined market share of 29.4%. We also have branch offices in the states of Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas, Nebraska and Arkansas which make up 17.1%, 7.5%, 7.1%, 1.7%, and 0.4% of our total franchise (based on our total deposits as of December 31, 2015). The Company's market share in its primary metropolitan statistical areas was as follows at June 30, 2015:

Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from other commercial banks, savings institutions and credit unions located in our market areas. The Bank competes for these deposits by offering a variety of deposit accounts at competitive rates, convenient business hours, and convenient branch, ATM and mobile services. In addition, some competitors located outside of our market areas conduct business primarily over the Internet, which may enable them to realize certain savings and offer certain deposit products and services at lower rates and with greater convenience to certain customers. Our ability to attract and retain customer deposits depends on our ability to generally provide a rate of return, liquidity and risk comparable to that offered by competing investment opportunities.

Competition in originating real estate loans comes primarily from other commercial banks, savings institutions and mortgage bankers making loans secured by real estate located in the Bank's market area. The specific institutions are similar to those discussed above in regards to deposit market share. Commercial banks and finance companies provide vigorous competition in commercial and consumer lending. The Bank competes for real estate and other loans principally on the basis of the interest rates and loan fees it charges, the types of loans it originates, the quality of services it provides to borrowers and the locations of our branch office network. 

Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources, name recognition and market presence, which benefit them in attracting business. In addition, larger competitors (including nationwide banks that have a significant presence in our market areas) may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do because of their greater economies of scale. Smaller and newer competitors may also be more aggressive than we are in terms of pricing loan and deposit products in order to obtain a larger share of the market. In addition, some competitors located outside of our market areas conduct business primarily over the Internet, which may enable them to realize certain savings and offer products and services at more favorable rates and with greater convenience to certain customers. 

We also depend, from time to time, on outside funding sources, including brokered deposits, where we experience nationwide competition, and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Some of the financial institutions and financial services organizations with which we compete are not subject to the same degree of regulation as is imposed on insured depositary institutions and their holding companies. As a result, these non-bank competitors have certain advantages over us in accessing funding and in providing various services.

Despite the highly competitive environment and the challenges it presents to us, management believes the Company will continue to be competitive because of its strong commitment to quality customer service, competitive products and pricing, convenient local branches, online and mobile capabilities, and active community involvement.

Employees

At December 31, 2015, the Bank and its affiliates had a total of 1,270 employees, including 316 part-time employees. None of the Bank's employees are represented by any collective bargaining agreement. Management considers its employee relations to be good.

Government Supervision and Regulation

General

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to supervision and examination by applicable federal and state banking agencies. The earnings of the Company's subsidiaries, and therefore the earnings of the Company, are affected by general economic conditions, management policies, federal and state legislation, and actions of various regulatory authorities, including the Federal Reserve Bank (the "FRB"), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") and the Missouri Division of Finance (the "MDF"). The 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

following is a brief summary of certain aspects of the regulation of the Company and the Bank and does not purport to fully discuss such regulation. Such regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund, and not for the protection of stockholders.

Significant Legislation Impacting the Financial Services Industry

On July 21, 2010, sweeping financial regulatory reform legislation entitled the "Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act" (the "Dodd-Frank Act") was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act implements far-reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape, including provisions that, among other things:

&#183;

Centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks. These laws are enforced by the Bureau for banks with more than $10 billion in assets and by the federal banking regulators for other banks.

&#183;

Require new capital rules and apply to bank holding companies the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions.

&#183;

Change the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated average assets less Tier 1 capital.

&#183;

Increase the minimum ratio of net worth to insured deposits of the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% to 1.35% and require the FDIC, in setting assessments, to offset the effect of the increase on institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. 

&#183;

Provide for new disclosure and other requirements relating to executive compensation and corporate governance and a prohibition on compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks or that could provide excessive compensation.

&#183;

Make permanent the $250 thousand limit for federal deposit insurance.

&#160; &#183;

Repeal the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts.

&#183;

Increase the authority of the FRB to examine the Company and its non-bank subsidiaries.

&#183;

Require all bank holding companies to serve as a source of financial strength to their depository institution subsidiaries in the event such subsidiaries suffer from financial distress.

Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the Company and the financial services industry more generally. Provisions in the legislation that affect deposit insurance assessments, and payment of interest on demand deposits could increase the costs associated with deposits. Revisions to the capital requirements of the Company and the Bank could require the Company and the Bank to seek additional sources of capital in the future. See "New Capital Rules" below.

Bank Holding Company Regulation

The Company is a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company by the FRB. Financial holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FRB under the Bank Holding Company Act and the regulations of the FRB. The Company is required to file reports with the FRB and such additional information as the FRB may require, and is subject to regular examinations by the FRB. The FRB also has extensive enforcement authority over financial holding companies, including, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to require that a holding company divest subsidiaries (including its bank subsidiaries). In general, enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of law and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices.

Under FRB policy and the Dodd-Frank Act, a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength for its subsidiary banks. Accordingly, the FRB may require, and has required in the past, that a bank holding company contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank.

Under the Bank Holding Company Act, a financial holding company must obtain FRB approval before: (i) acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company that is not a subsidiary if, after such acquisition, it would own or control more than 5% of such shares; (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank or financial holding company; or (iii) merging or consolidating with another bank or financial holding company.

The Bank Holding Company Act also prohibits a financial holding company generally from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those involving banking, activities closely related to banking that are permitted for a bank holding company, securities, insurance and merchant banking.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Volcker Rule 

The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations to implement the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act known as the Volcker Rule. Under the regulations, FDIC-insured depository institutions, their holding companies, subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, "banking entities"), are generally prohibited, subject to certain exemptions, from proprietary trading of securities and other financial instruments and from acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in a "covered fund." 

Trading in certain government obligations is not prohibited. These include, among others, obligations of or guaranteed by the United States or an agency or government-sponsored entity of the United States, obligations of a State of the United States or a political subdivision thereof, and municipal securities. Proprietary trading generally does not include transactions under repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions and purchases and sales for the purpose of liquidity management if the liquidity management plan meets specified criteria; nor does it generally include transactions undertaken in a fiduciary capacity. 

The term "covered fund" can include, in addition to many private equity and hedge funds and other entities, certain collateralized mortgage obligations, collateralized debt obligations and collateralized loan obligations, and other items, but it does not include wholly owned subsidiaries, certain joint ventures, or loan securitizations generally if the underlying assets are solely loans. The term "ownership interest" includes not only an equity interest or a partnership interest, but also an interest that has the right to participate in selection or removal of a general partner, managing member, director, trustee or investment manager or advisor; to receive a share of income, gains or profits of the fund; to receive underlying fund assets after all other interests have been redeemed; to receive all or a portion of excess spread; or to receive income on a pass-through basis or income determined by reference to the performance of fund assets. In addition, "ownership interest" includes an interest under which amounts payable can be reduced based on losses arising from underlying fund assets. 

Activities eligible for exemptions include, among others, certain brokerage, underwriting and marketing activities, and risk-mitigating hedging activities with respect to specific risks and subject to specified conditions.

Interstate Banking and Branching

Federal law allows the FRB to approve an application of a bank holding company to acquire control of, or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, a bank located in a state other than such holding company's home state, without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state. The FRB may not approve the acquisition of a bank that has not been in existence for the minimum time period (not exceeding five years) specified by the statutory law of the host state. Federal law also prohibits the FRB from approving such an application if the applicant (and its depository institution affiliates) controls or would control more than 10% of the insured deposits in the United States or if the applicant would control 30% or more of the deposits in any state in which the target bank maintains a branch and in which the applicant or any of its depository institution affiliates controls a depository institution or branch immediately prior to the acquisition of the target bank. Federal law does not affect the authority of states to limit the percentage of total insured deposits in the state which may be held or controlled by a bank or bank holding company to the extent such limitation does not discriminate against out-of-state banks or bank holding companies. Individual states may also waive the 30% state-wide concentration limit. Missouri law prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring a depository institution if total deposits would exceed 13% of statewide deposits excluding bank certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more.

The federal banking agencies are generally authorized to approve interstate bank merger transactions and de novo branching without regard to whether such transactions are prohibited by the law of any state. Interstate acquisitions of branches are generally permitted only if the law of the state in which the branch is located permits such acquisitions. 

As required by federal law, federal regulations prohibit any out-of-state bank from using the interstate branching authority primarily for the purpose of deposit production, including guidelines to ensure that interstate branches operated by an out-of-state bank in a host state reasonably help to meet the credit needs of the communities which they serve.

Certain Transactions with Affiliates and Other Persons

Transactions involving the Bank and its affiliates are subject to sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, and regulations thereunder, which impose certain quantitative limits and collateral requirements on such transactions, and require all such transactions to be on terms at least as favorable to the Bank as are available in transactions with non-affiliates.

All loans by the Bank to the principal stockholders, directors and executive officers of the Bank or any affiliate are subject to regulations restricting loans and other transactions with insiders of the Bank and its affiliates. Transactions involving such persons must be on terms and conditions comparable to those for similar transactions with non-insiders. A bank may allow favorable rate loans to insiders pursuant to an employee benefit program available to bank employees generally. The Bank has such a program.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Dividends

The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the FRB's view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that its net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the holding company's capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The FRB also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Furthermore, a bank holding company may be prohibited from paying any dividends if the holding company's bank subsidiary is not adequately capitalized.

A bank holding company is required to give the FRB prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company's consolidated net worth. The FRB may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, FRB order, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the FRB. This notification requirement does not apply to any company that meets the well-capitalized standard for bank holding companies, is well-managed, and is not subject to any unresolved supervisory issues. Under Missouri law, the Bank may pay dividends from certain undivided profits and may not pay dividends if its capital is impaired. Dividends of the Company and the Bank may also be restricted under the capital conservation buffer rules, which became effective January 1, 2016, as discussed below under "&#8212;Capital."

&#160;

Capital

Effective January 1, 2015 (with some changes transitioned into full effectiveness over two to four years), the Company and the Bank became subject to new capital regulations adopted by the FRB and the FDIC, which create a new required ratio for common equity Tier 1 ("CET1") capital, increase the minimum leverage and Tier 1 capital ratios, change the risk-weightings of certain assets for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios, create an additional capital conservation buffer over the required capital ratios, and change what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting the capital requirements.

Under the new capital regulations, the minimum capital ratios are: (1) a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets; (3) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets; and (4) a leverage ratio (the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total adjusted assets) of 4.0%. CET1 generally consists of common stock; retained earnings; accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") unless an institution elects to exclude AOCI from regulatory capital; and certain minority interests; all subject to applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions. Tier 1 capital generally consists of CET1 and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital generally consists of other preferred stock and subordinated debt meeting certain conditions plus an amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses up to 1.25% of assets. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.

A number of changes in what constitutes regulatory capital compared to the rules in effect prior to January 1, 2015 are subject to transition periods. These changes include the phasing-out of certain instruments as qualifying capital. Mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets over designated percentages of CET1 will be deducted from capital. In addition, Tier 1 capital includes AOCI, which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities . However, because of our asset size, we were eligible for the one-time option of permanently opting out of the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities in our capital calculations. We elected this option.

For purposes of determining risk-based capital, assets and certain off-balance sheet items are risk-weighted from 0% to 1,250%, depending on the risk characteristics of the asset or item. The new regulations make certain changes in the risk-weighting of assets to better reflect credit risk and other risk exposure compared to the earlier capital rules. These include a 150% risk weight (up from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and for non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise in nonaccrual status; a 20% (up from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable (currently set at 0%); and a 250% risk weight (up from 100%) for mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital.

In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and total capital ratios, the Company and the Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, repurchasing shares, and paying discretionary bonuses. The new capital conservation buffer requirement is to be phased in beginning on January 1, 2016, when a buffer greater than 0.625% of risk-weighted assets will be required, which amount will increase each year until the buffer requirement is fully implemented on January 1, 2019.

Under the FDIC's prompt corrective action standards, in order to be considered well-capitalized, the Bank must have a ratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.5% (new), a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 8% (increased from 6%), a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 10% (unchanged), and a leverage ratio of 5% (unchanged); and must not be subject to any 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. In order to be considered adequately capitalized, an institution must have the minimum capital ratios described above. As of December 15, 2015, the Bank was "well-capitalized." An institution that is not well-capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits and interest rates on deposits. 

The federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action if an institution fails to satisfy the requirements to qualify as adequately capitalized. All institutions, regardless of their capital levels, are restricted from making any capital distribution or paying any management fees that would cause the institution to fail to satisfy the requirements to qualify as adequately capitalized. An institution that is not at least adequately capitalized is: (i) subject to increased monitoring by the appropriate federal banking regulator; (ii) required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan (including certain guarantees by any company controlling the institution) within 45 days; (iii) subject to asset growth limits; and (iv) required to obtain prior regulatory approval for acquisitions, branching and new lines of business. Additional restrictions and appointment of a receiver or conservator, can apply, depending on the institution's capital level. The FDIC has jurisdiction over the Bank for purposes of prompt corrective action. When the FDIC as receiver liquidates an institution, the claims of depositors and the FDIC as their successor (for deposits covered by FDIC insurance) have priority over other unsecured claims against the institution, including claims of stockholders.

The federal banking agencies take into consideration concentrations of credit risk and risks from non-traditional activities, as well as an institution's ability to manage those risks, when determining the adequacy of an institution's capital. This evaluation is generally be made as part of the institution's regular safety and soundness examination. Under their regulations, the federal banking agencies also consider interest rate risk (when the interest rate sensitivity of an institution's assets does not match the sensitivity of its liabilities or its off-balance-sheet position) in the evaluation of a bank's capital adequacy. The banking agencies have issued guidance on evaluating interest rate risk.

The FRB's capital regulations for bank holding companies generally parallel the capital regulations for banks. To be considered "well capitalized," a bank holding company must have, on a consolidated basis, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater and must not be subject to an individual order, directive or agreement under which the FRB requires it to maintain a specific capital level. As of December 31, 2015, the Company was "well-capitalized." 

Although we continue to evaluate the impact that the new capital rules will have on the Company and the Bank, we anticipate that the Company and the Bank will remain well-capitalized under the new capital rules, and will meet the capital conservation buffer requirement.

Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC

Great Southern is a member of the DIF, which is administered by the FDIC. Deposits are insured up to the applicable limits by the FDIC, backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government. The general deposit insurance limit is $250,000. 

The FDIC assesses deposit insurance premiums on all FDIC-insured institutions quarterly based on annualized rates for four risk categories. Each institution is assigned to one of four risk categories based on its capital, supervisory ratings and other factors. Well capitalized institutions that are financially sound with only a few minor weaknesses are assigned to Risk Category I. Risk Categories II, III and IV present progressively greater risks to the DIF. 

FDIC insurance premium assessments are based on an institution's total assets minus its tangible equity. Under these rules, an institution with total assets of less than $10 billion will be assigned to a Risk Category as described above, and a range of initial base assessment rates will apply to each category, subject to adjustment downward based on unsecured debt issued by the institution and, except for an institution in Risk Category I, adjustment upward if the institution's brokered deposits exceed 10% of its domestic deposits, to produce total base assessment rates. Total base assessment rates range from 2.5 to 9 basis points for Risk Category I, 9 to 24 basis points for Risk Category II, 18 to 33 basis points for Risk Category III, and 30 to 45 basis points for Risk Category IV, all subject to further adjustment upward if the institution holds more than a de minimis amount of unsecured debt issued by another FDIC-insured institution. The FDIC may increase or decrease its rates by 2.0 basis points without further rulemaking. In an emergency, the FDIC may also impose a special assessment.

The FDIC also collects assessments against the assessable deposits of insured institutions to service the debt on bonds issued during the 1980s to resolve the thrift bailout. For the quarter ended December 31, 2015, the assessment rate was 0.60 basis points applied to the same assessment base as is used for deposit insurance assessments. For the first quarter of 2016, the rate is 0.58 basis points.

The Dodd-Frank Act establishes 1.35% as the minimum reserve ratio. The FDIC has adopted a plan under which it will meet this ratio by September 30, 2020, the deadline imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank requires the FDIC to offset the effect on institutions with assets less than $10 billion of the increase in the statutory minimum reserve ratio to 1.35% from the former statutory 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

minimum of 1.15%. The FDIC has not yet announced how it will implement this offset. In addition to the statutory minimum ratio, the FDIC must designate a reserve ratio, known as the designated reserve ratio or DRR, which may exceed the statutory minimum. The FDIC has established 2.0% as the DRR.

The FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by FDIC-insured institutions, and is the primary federal banking regulator of state banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve, such as the Bank. The FDIC examines the Bank regularly. The FDIC may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the DIF. The FDIC also has the authority to take enforcement actions against banks and savings associations.

Federal Reserve System

The FRB requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and Super NOW checking accounts) and non-personal time deposits. At December 31, 2015, the Bank was in compliance with these reserve requirements.

Banks are authorized to borrow from the FRB "discount window," but FRB regulations only allow this borrowing for short periods of time and generally require banks to exhaust other reasonable alternative sources of funds where practical, including FHLBank advances, before borrowing from the FRB. See "Sources of Funds Borrowings" above.

Federal Home Loan Bank System

The Bank is a member of the FHLBank of Des Moines, which is one of 11 regional FHLBanks.

&#160;

As a member, Great Southern is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLBank of Des Moines in an amount equal to the greater of 1% of its outstanding home loans or 5% of its outstanding FHLBank advances. At December 31, 2015, Great Southern had $15.3 million in FHLBank stock, which was in compliance with this requirement. In past years, the Bank has received dividends on its FHLBank stock. Over the past five years, such dividends have averaged 3.40% and were 3.50% for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Legislative and Regulatory Proposals

Any changes in the extensive regulatory scheme to which the Company or the Bank is and will be subject, whether by any of the federal banking agencies or Congress, or the Missouri legislature or MDF, could have a material effect on the Company or the Bank, and the Company and the Bank cannot predict what, if any, future actions may be taken by legislative or regulatory authorities or what impact such actions may have.

Federal and State Taxation

General

The following discussion contains a summary of certain federal and state income tax provisions applicable to the Company and the Bank. It is not a comprehensive description of the federal or state income tax laws that may affect the Company and the Bank. The following discussion is based upon current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") and Treasury and judicial interpretations thereof.

The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return using the accrual method of accounting, with the exception of GSB Two which files a separate return as a REIT. All corporations joining in the consolidated federal income tax return are jointly and severally liable for taxes due and payable by the consolidated group. The following discussion primarily focuses upon the taxation of the Bank, since the federal income tax law contains certain special provisions with respect to banks.

Financial institutions, such as the Bank, are subject, with certain exceptions, to the provisions of the Code generally applicable to corporations.

&#160;

Bad Debt Deduction

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, retained earnings included approximately $17.5 million for which no deferred income tax liability has been recognized. This amount represents an allocation of income to bad debt deductions for tax purposes only for tax years prior to 1988. If the Bank were to liquidate, the entire amount would have to be recaptured and would create income for tax purposes only, which would be subject to the then-current corporate income tax rate. The unrecorded deferred income tax liability on the above amount was approximately $6.5 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014.

The Bank is required to follow the specific charge-off method which only allows a bad debt deduction equal to actual charge-offs, net of recoveries, experienced during the fiscal year of the deduction. In a year where recoveries exceed charge-offs, the Bank would be required to include the net recoveries in taxable income.

Interest Deduction

In the case of a financial institution, such as the Bank, no deduction is allowed for the pro rata portion of its interest expense which is allocable to tax-exempt interest on obligations acquired after August 7, 1986. A limited class of tax-exempt obligations acquired after August 7, 1986 will not be subject to this complete disallowance rule. For certain tax exempt obligations issued in 2009 and 2010, an amount of tax-exempt obligations that are not generally considered part of the "limited class of tax-exempt obligations" noted above may be treated as part of the "limited class of tax-exempt obligations to the extent of two percent of a financial institutions total assets. For tax-exempt obligations acquired after December 31, 1982 and before August 8, 1986 and for obligations acquired after August 7, 1986 that are not subject to the complete disallowance rule, 80% of interest incurred to purchase or carry such obligations will be deductible. No portion of the interest expense allocable to tax-exempt obligations acquired by a financial institution before January 1, 1983, which is otherwise deductible, will be disallowed. There are two significant changes for bonds issued in 2009 and 2010 which include (1) the annual limit for bonds that may be designated as bank qualified is increased from $10 million to $30 million and (2) the annual limitation is considered at the organization level rather than the issuer level. The interest expense disallowance rules cited above have not significantly impacted the Bank.

FDIC-Assisted Bank Transactions

During 2009, 2011 and 2012, the Bank acquired assets and liabilities of four unrelated failed institutions in transactions with the FDIC. As part of these transactions, the Bank and the FDIC entered into loss sharing agreements whereby the FDIC agreed to share losses incurred associated with the assets purchased by the Bank. In 2014, the Bank acquired assets and liabilities of an unrelated failed institution in a transaction with the FDIC. The Bank and the FDIC did not enter into a loss sharing agreement on this transaction.

The Bank recognized financial statement gains associated with these transactions. The ultimate tax treatment of these transactions is similar to the financial statement treatment; however, the approaches to valuing the acquired assets and liabilities is different, and results in carrying value differences in the underlying assets and liabilities, for tax purposes. In addition, any gain recognized on the transactions for tax purposes is recognized over a six year period.

Alternative Minimum Tax

Corporations generally are subject to a 20% corporate alternative minimum tax ("AMT"). A corporation must pay the AMT to the extent it exceeds that corporation's regular federal income tax liability The AMT is imposed on "alternative minimum taxable income," defined as taxable income with certain adjustments and tax preference items, less any available exemption. Such adjustments and items include, but are not limited to, (i) net interest received on certain tax-exempt bonds issued after August 7, 1986; and (ii) 75% of the difference between adjusted current earnings and alternative minimum taxable income, as otherwise determined with certain adjustments. Net operating loss carryovers may be utilized, subject to adjustment, to offset up to 90% of the alternative minimum taxable income, as otherwise determined. Any AMT paid may be credited against future regular federal income tax liabilities to the extent the regular federal income tax liability exceeds the AMT liability. In addition, certain credits may be used to reduce AMT obligations. The Company has invested in certain partnerships that generate tax credits (low-income housing and rehabilitation tax credits) that may be used to reduce their AMT.

Examinations

The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have not been audited recently by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or the State of Missouri with respect to income or franchise tax returns, and as such, tax years through December 31, 2005, have been closed without audit.

As a result, the Company's 2006 and subsequent tax years remain open for examination. The examinations of the partnerships have been advanced during 2015.

The Company does not currently expect significant adjustments to its financial statements from these partnership examinations.
