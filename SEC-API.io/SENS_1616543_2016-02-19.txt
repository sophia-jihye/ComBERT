Overview 

&#160; 

We are a medical technology company focused on the design, development and commercialization of glucose monitoring systems to improve the lives of people with diabetes by enhancing their ability to manage their disease with relative ease and accuracy. Our first generation continuous glucose monitoring, or CGM, system, Eversense, is designed to be a reliable, long-term, implantable CGM system to continually and accurately measure glucose levels in people with diabetes for a period of up to 90 days, as compared to five to seven days for currently available CGM systems. We believe Eversense will provide people with diabetes with a more convenient method to monitor their glucose levels in comparison to the traditional method of self-monitoring of blood glucose, or SMBG, as well as currently available CGM systems. In our European pivotal clinical trial, we observed that Eversense measured glucose levels over 90 days with a degree of accuracy comparable or superior to that of other currently available CGM systems. In July 2015, we applied for a CE mark and, subject to regulatory approval, we expect to begin marketing Eversense in select European markets in the first half of 2016. We have also received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, of an investigational device exemption, or IDE, application to initiate clinical trials of Eversense in the United States, and we initiated a single pivotal clinical trial in the United States in the first quarter of 2016. If the results of the trial are favorable, we intend to apply as promptly as possible to market Eversense in the United States. We believe that we could file for U.S. marketing approval as early as the second half of 2016 and expect the pre-market approval, or PMA, process could take between six and 18 months. 

&#160; 

Diabetes is a chronic, life-threatening disease for which there is no known cure. The disease is caused by the body's inability to produce or effectively utilize the hormone insulin, which prevents the body from adequately regulating blood glucose levels. If diabetes is not managed properly, it can lead to serious health conditions and complications, including heart disease, limb amputations, loss of kidney function, blindness, seizures, coma and even death. According to the International Diabetes Federation, or IDF, an estimated 387 million people worldwide had diabetes in 2014. The number of people with diabetes worldwide is estimated to grow to 592 million by 2035 due to various reasons, including changes in dietary trends, an aging population and increased prevalence of the disease in younger people. Diabetes is typically classified into two primary types. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder that usually develops during childhood and is characterized by the inability of the body to produce insulin, resulting from destruction of the insulin producing beta cells of the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder that results when the body is unable to produce sufficient amounts of insulin or becomes insulin resistant. People with Type 1 diabetes must administer insulin, either by injection or insulin pump, to survive. People with Type 2 diabetes may require diet and nutrition management, exercise, oral medications or the administration of insulin to regulate blood glucose levels. 

&#160; 

In an attempt to maintain blood glucose levels within the normal range, many people with diabetes seek to actively monitor their blood glucose levels. The traditional SMBG method of glucose monitoring requires lancing the fingertips, commonly referred to as fingersticks, multiple times per day and night to obtain a blood drop to be applied to a test strip inside a blood glucose meter. This method of monitoring glucose levels is inconvenient and can be painful and, because each measurement represents a single blood glucose value at a single point in time, it provides limited information regarding trends in blood glucose levels. In contrast, CGM systems are generally less painful and involve the insertion of sensors into the body to measure glucose levels in the interstitial fluid throughout the day and night, providing real-time data that shows trends in glucose measurements. Since CGM measurements from interstitial tissue are inherently less accurate than test-strip measurements made directly from the blood, the FDA and other device regulators require that CGMs be labeled and marketed as "adjunctive" to test-strip measurements, with instructions that patients confirm CGM measurements with test-strip measurements using blood obtained from fingersticks prior to self-medicating. However, currently available CGM systems are often inconvenient, requiring frequent sensor replacement and an extra device, called a receiver, to monitor glucose readings, and have limited safety features. 

&#160; 

We have designed Eversense to continually and accurately measure glucose levels under the skin for up to 90 days, as compared to five to seven days for currently available CGM systems. Eversense also includes additional safety features that warn the user before the occurrence of adverse events and provide distinct on-body vibrations in a number of situations, such as when low or high glucose levels are reached. We believe that Eversense will provide a 

&#160;

more convenient method of continuous glucose monitoring, with longer duration and equal or superior accuracy, compared to other currently available CGM systems. 

&#160; 

According to estimates by Close Concerns, Inc., an independent diabetes information company, or Close Concerns, global sales for CGM systems and insulin pumps for people with intensively managed diabetes were $2.7 billion in 2014, of which $523 million represented sales of CGM systems, a 31% increase from 2013. United States sales for CGM systems and insulin pumps for people with intensively managed diabetes were $1.7 billion in 2014, of which $381 million represented sales of CGM systems, a 33% increase compared to 2013. In comparison, global SMBG sales were $6.7 billion in 2014, a decline of 7% compared to 2013, driven largely by downward pricing pressure. Based &#160; on &#160; industry &#160; sources &#160; and &#160; current &#160; industry &#160; trends, &#160; we &#160; estimate &#160; that &#160; U.S. &#160; sales &#160; of &#160; CGM &#160; systems &#160; will &#160; grow &#160; at &#160; a &#160; C A GR &#160; ranging &#160; from &#160; 35% &#160; to &#160; 40%, &#160; reaching &#160; approximately $3 &#160; billion &#160; to &#160; $3.7 &#160; billion &#160; by &#160; 2020 . We also estimate that by 2020 global sales for insulin pumps will increase to $3.5 billion, while global sales for SMBG will decline to $5.8 billion. We expect the growth in sales of CGM systems to be driven primarily by increased penetration of CGM in the Type 1 diabetic population, as it potentially becomes a standard of care, reaching up to 45% penetration of the Type 1 diabetic population in the United States by 2020, compared to 8% in 2014. We believe that the increased penetration of CGM will be driven by higher awareness of the clinical benefits of CGM by people with diabetes, healthcare providers and third-party payors, insulin pump integration, an improving coverage and reimbursement environment and additional product innovation, including increased convenience, accuracy and sensor duration. 

&#160; 

We conducted our European pivotal clinical trial in Germany, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands to evaluate the accuracy of Eversense, based on the mean absolute relative difference, or MARD, when compared with reference standard measurement. The 90-day accuracy and safety data for the first 44 subjects was previously compiled and used as the basis for our CE mark application, which we submitted in July 2015 to support initial labeling for 90 days of use. The average MARD of the first 44 subjects, over 90 days, was 11.4%. There were no device-related or procedure-related serious adverse events. 

&#160; 

While the protocol for this trial was designed to produce a finding of statistical significance with 44 subjects, and our CE mark application previously submitted was based on 90-day data for 44 subjects, we enrolled a total of 81 subjects in the trial. We followed 71 of those subjects who received the current configuration of Eversense for 180 days in order to gather additional data for two purposes. First, we intend to use this data to make a subsequent submission to EU regulators for CE mark approval to use our sensor for 180 days. Second, we intend to use this data to support our application for regulatory approval in the United States. 

&#160; 

The 90-day data for the 71 subjects reflected a MARD of 11.0%. We expect to report final 180-day accuracy and safety data for all subjects in the European pivotal trial in the first quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

Including our European pivotal trial, we have enrolled more than 350 subjects and tested over 700 sensors as of December 31, 2015. Throughout this experience, we have observed no device-related or procedure-related serious adverse events in any of our trials. However, we have limited clinical experience with repeated use of our system in the same patient or the same insertion site, and it is possible that there could be unforeseen complications from long-term use. 

&#160; 

In the first quarter of 2016, we initiated a single pivotal clinical trial in the United States. This trial will be conducted at seven to ten sites in the United States and enroll approximately 90 subjects. In the trial, we will measure the accuracy of Eversense measurements through 90 days after insertion. We will also assess safety through 90 days after insertion or sensor removal. If the results of the trial are favorable, we intend to apply for regulatory approval as promptly as possible to market our product in the United States. We believe that we could file for U.S. marketing approval as early as the second half of 2016 and expect that the PMA process could take between six and 18 months. 

&#160; 

From its inception in 1996 until 2010, Senseonics, Incorporated devoted substantially all of its resources to researching various sensor technologies and platforms. Beginning in 2010, the company narrowed its focus to designing, developing and refining a commercially viable glucose monitoring system. We are headquartered in Germantown, Maryland. The members of our management team have held senior leadership positions at a number of medical technology and biopharmaceutical companies, including Abbott Diabetes Care, TheraSense, LifeCell and Medtronic. 

&#160;

Members of our team have contributed to the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of several glucose monitoring systems and insulin pumps. Our largest stockholders are New Enterprise Associates, Delphi Ventures and Roche Finance, which is an affiliate of Roche Holding AG, a global pharmaceutical company that sells products, including insulin pumps and blood glucose monitoring systems, to the diabetes market. 

&#160; 

Diabetes Overview 

&#160; 

Diabetes is a chronic, life-threatening disease for which there is no known cure and arises as a result of the body's inability to produce or effectively utilize the hormone insulin. Insulin regulates blood glucose levels and allows cells to utilize glucose, the primary source of energy for cells. Glucose must be maintained at certain concentrations in the blood in order to permit optimal cell function and health. For people with diabetes, the inability to produce sufficient levels of insulin, or the failure to utilize insulin effectively, causes blood glucose levels to rise above the optimal range. If diabetes is not managed properly, it can lead to serious health conditions and complications, including heart disease, limb amputations, loss of kidney function, blindness, seizures, coma and even death. According to the most recent information available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2010, directly resulting in approximately 69,000 deaths and complications from diabetes contributed to approximately 234,000 deaths in the same year. 

&#160; 

According to the IDF, an estimated 387 million people worldwide had diabetes in 2014. The number of people with diabetes worldwide is estimated to grow to 592 million by 2035 due to a number of reasons including changes in dietary trends, an aging population and increased prevalence of the disease in younger people. Based on estimates by the IDF, diabetes is among the costliest chronic diseases and the total global economic cost of diagnosed diabetes in 2014 was approximately $612 billion. 

&#160; 

Diabetes is typically classified into two primary types: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder that usually develops during childhood or adolescence and is characterized by the inability of the body to produce insulin, resulting from destruction of the hormone producing beta cells in the pancreas. People with Type 1 diabetes must administer insulin, either by injection or insulin pump, to survive. There is no known way to prevent Type 1 diabetes. Based on the most recent information available from the CDC, there were in excess of one million people with Type 1 diagnosed diabetes in the United States in 2012. Based on the most recent information available from the IDF and the CDC, we estimate that there were in excess of 1.7 million people with Type 1 diagnosed diabetes in Europe in 2014. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder which generally develops in adults and results when the body is unable to produce sufficient amounts of insulin or becomes insulin resistant. Although it is not precisely known how Type 2 diabetes develops, genetics, family history and environmental factors, such as excess weight and physical inactivity, are viewed as contributing factors. As Type 2 diabetes progresses, individuals may require diet and nutrition management, exercise, oral medications or the administration of insulin to regulate blood glucose levels. Based on the most recent information from the CDC, we estimate there were approximately 20 million people with Type 2 diagnosed diabetes in the United States in 2012. We estimate that there were approximately 33 million people with Type 2 diagnosed diabetes in Europe in 2014. Of these people with Type 2 diagnosed diabetes, we estimate that approximately 5.7 million people in the United States utilize insulin, either by injection or insulin pump, to manage their diabetes. 

&#160; 

Importance of Glucose Monitoring 

&#160; 

If people with diabetes can maintain their blood glucose levels within normal limits, they can significantly mitigate the negative effects of diabetes. In the December 2005 edition of the New England Journal of Medicine , the authors of a peer-reviewed study concluded that intensive diabetes therapy, which included the use of multiple daily injections, or MDI, or an insulin pump, in combination with SMBG at least four times per day, with the goal of maintaining blood glucose levels within normal limits, has long-term beneficial effects on lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease in people with Type 1 diabetes. In the study, this intensive diabetes therapy reduced the risk of any cardiovascular disease event by 42% and the risk of non-fatal heart attack, stroke or death from cardiovascular 

&#160;

disease by 57%, as compared to less intensive diabetes therapy. Earlier studies also demonstrated benefits of intensive diabetes therapy in lowering the long-term risks of other complications of diabetes, including vision loss, kidney damage and nerve damage. 

&#160; 

Despite the clinically demonstrated benefits of maintaining blood glucose levels within the normal range, doing so can be challenging and inconvenient for people with diabetes. Blood glucose levels are affected by many factors, including the carbohydrate and fat content of meals, exercise, stress, illness or impending illness, hormonal releases, variability in insulin absorption rates and changes in the effects of insulin on the body. As a result, people with diabetes often experience unpredictable and significant fluctuations in their glucose levels above the normal range, which is referred to as hyperglycemia, or below the normal range, which is referred to as hypoglycemia. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Hyperglycemia occurs when blood glucose levels rise above the normal range, which generally occurs when the body does not produce sufficient levels of insulin or fails to effectively utilize insulin. If not effectively managed, hyperglycemia often results in chronic long-term complications, such as heart disease, limb amputations, loss of kidney function, blindness, seizures, coma and even death. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Hypoglycemia occurs when blood glucose levels fall below the normal range, which can be caused by a number of factors including excess insulin administration. In cases of severe hypoglycemia, people with diabetes risk acute complications, such as loss of consciousness, coma or death. 

&#160; 

In an attempt to maintain blood glucose levels within the normal range, people with diabetes must first accurately measure their blood glucose levels and, if necessary, make therapeutic and dietary adjustments. When blood glucose levels are high, people with diabetes often administer insulin in an effort to decrease blood glucose levels. In contrast, when blood glucose levels are low, people with diabetes often ingest carbohydrates in an effort to raise blood glucose levels. As these adjustments are made, additional blood glucose measurements may be necessary to gauge the individual's response to the adjustments. People with diabetes frequently overcorrect and fluctuate between hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic states, often multiple times during the same day. As a result, many people with diabetes are routinely outside the normal blood glucose range, and many are often unaware that their glucose levels are either too high or too low. The inability to effectively control and monitor blood glucose levels and the associated potential for serious complications from hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia can be frustrating, overwhelming and, at times, dangerous. 

&#160; 

Methods of Glucose Measurement 

&#160; 

The most accurate method of measuring blood glucose levels is through laboratory testing. Outside of laboratory testing, there are three primary methods to measure blood glucose levels: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Real-time in-hospital testing of blood glucose levels is performed by healthcare providers at the point of care, using in vitro analyzers, such as the YSI Inc., or YSI, glucose analyzer. Outside of laboratory testing, in-hospital testing is the most accurate method of measuring blood glucose levels. However, measurement of blood glucose through in-hospital testing is not a practical solution for the daily monitoring of glucose levels by people with diabetes. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Self-monitoring of blood glucose , or SMBG, is the traditional method that people with diabetes use to monitor their blood glucose levels. Although less accurate than in-hospital testing, SMBG systems are the prevalent method for the daily monitoring of glucose levels. SMBG requires people with diabetes to lance their fingertips to obtain a blood drop that is applied to a test strip inserted into a blood glucose meter. SMBG testing is generally done multiple times per day. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Continuous glucose monitoring , or CGM, is a way for people with diabetes to monitor glucose levels in real-time throughout the day or night. CGM systems involve the implantation of sensors into the body to measure glucose levels in the interstitial fluid, which is the fluid that surrounds tissues in the body, and typically relay the data, through a transmitter, to an external receiver every five minutes. While each individual CGM measurement is slightly less accurate than that of SMBG, the frequent, automatic measurements provided by 

&#160;

CGM help people with diabetes reduce the risk of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events by providing them with real-time glucose readings, glucose trend information and alerts. Current CGM systems require twice daily calibration using blood drawn through a fingerstick. Current regulatory policy requires that patients confirm CGM measurements with a real-time test-strip reading using blood obtained by a fingerstick prior to self-medicating with insulin. 

&#160; 

Benefits of Continuous Glucose Monitoring 

&#160; 

More frequent and accurate testing of blood glucose levels provides people with diabetes with a greater ability to maintain their blood glucose levels within normal limits allowing them to more effectively manage their diabetes. The American Diabetes Association, or the ADA, recommends that people with intensively managed diabetes test their blood glucose levels after eating, at bedtime, before exercise or critical tasks and after treating for low blood glucose. Significantly more frequent testing may be required to reach optimal blood glucose levels safely without falling into hypoglycemia. We use the term "intensively managed diabetes" to refer to people with Type 1 diabetes and those people with Type 2 diabetes who require insulin to be administered through an insulin pump or MDI. 

&#160; 

The ability of people with diabetes to realize the benefits of more frequent glucose testing using SMBG is inherently limited and inconvenient. SMBG generally requires people with diabetes to draw multiple blood samples over the course of a day and night. Lancing and interchange of the fingers or alternate sites, in order to draw blood samples, can sometimes be painful and is particularly difficult for children. Moreover, even if a person tests glucose levels with SMBG several times each day, each measurement represents a single blood glucose value at a single point in time, which limits the ability to detect trends in glucose levels. In contrast, CGM, due to its continuous and automatic monitoring, can provide significant data on trends in glucose levels. The ability to detect rising or falling glucose levels, and the rate at which such levels are rising or falling, is critical for people with diabetes, and their healthcare providers, to actively manage this condition. For instance, the risk of hypoglycemia is greatest when individuals are sleeping. CGM systems continue reading glucose levels during sleep, and even provide alerts, in contrast to SMBG, which does not allow for testing during sleep. 

&#160; 

The beneficial effects of CGM have been validated in multiple clinical trials. According to a study published in the November 2009 edition of Diabetes Care , people who intensively managed their diabetes consistently with CGM over a six-month period had lower A1C levels, a measure of the three-month average of glucose in the blood, than those who did not. More recently, two studies published in the April 2011 and January 2012 editions of Diabetes Care , showed improved glycemic control in people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes who use CGM systems, compared to people who use SMBG, further supporting the benefits of CGM in helping people with diabetes stay within a healthy glycemic range. 

&#160; 

In addition to the health benefits of continuous and automatic blood glucose measurements provided by CGM, CGM is generally considered to be more convenient than SMBG. People who intensively manage their diabetes will typically measure their blood glucose levels three to ten times per day, including during the night. For children with diabetes, this may necessitate a parent or caretaker waking the child multiple times during the night to take these measurements. People who use SMBG must carry a fully supplied kit that may include a spring-loaded needle, or lancet, disposable test strips, cleansing wipes, and the glucose meter, and then safely dispose of the used supplies, which can be inconvenient. In addition, at times, SMBG may require multiple finger pricks to obtain a sufficient blood sample for such tests, which can be further compounded by the fact that people with diabetes often experience decreased feeling in their fingers. 

&#160; 

The Market for CGM 

&#160; 

We estimate that, of the approximately 39 million people diagnosed with diabetes in the United States, Canada, Australia and the other select regions that we intend to target with Eversense (which include Scandinavia, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Israel, Finland and Slovenia), 35%, or approximately 13 million people, are insulin users. We believe that, of those 13 million insulin users, approximately 46%, or six million people, intensively manage their diabetes. According to estimates by Close Concerns, global sales for CGM systems and insulin pumps for people with intensively managed diabetes were $2.7 billion in 2014, of which $523 million represented sales 

&#160;

of CGM systems, a 31% increase compared to 2013. United States sales for CGM systems and insulin pumps for people with intensively managed diabetes were $1.7 billion in 2014, of which $381 million represented sales of CGM systems, a 33% increase compared to 2013. In comparison, global SMBG sales were $6.7 billion in 2014, a decline of 7% compared to 2013, driven largely by downward pricing pressure. 

&#160; 

Based &#160; on &#160; industry &#160; sources &#160; and &#160; current &#160; industry &#160; trends, &#160; we &#160; estimate &#160; that &#160; U.S. &#160; sales &#160; of &#160; CGM &#160; systems &#160; will &#160; grow &#160; at &#160; a &#160; C A GR &#160; ranging &#160; from &#160; 35% &#160; to &#160; 40%, &#160; reaching &#160; approximately $3 &#160; billion &#160; to &#160; $3.7 &#160; billion &#160; by &#160; 2020 . We also estimate that by 2020 global sales for insulin pumps will increase to $3.5 billion, while global sales for SMBG will decline to $5.8 billion. We expect the growth in sales of CGM systems to be driven primarily by increased penetration of CGM in the Type 1 diabetic population, as it potentially becomes a standard of care, reaching up to 45% penetration of the Type 1 diabetic population in the United States by 2020, compared to 8% in 2014. We believe that the increased penetration of CGM will be driven by higher awareness of the clinical benefits of CGM by people with diabetes, healthcare providers and third-party payors, insulin pump integration, an improving coverage and reimbursement environment and additional product innovation, including increased convenience, accuracy and sensor duration. 

&#160; 

Limitations of Currently Available CGM Systems 

&#160; 

There are a limited number of currently available CGM systems for people with diabetes to monitor their glucose levels. Although these CGM systems provide significant advantages to people with diabetes who are intensively managing their diabetes as compared to SMBG, they have certain inherent limitations and shortcomings that we believe limit their rate of user adoption and often lead to noncompliance and discontinuation. These limitations include: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Short sensor life and accuracy limitations: Currently available CGM systems generally rely on sensors that are labeled for use for between five and seven days, after which the sensor must be removed and a replacement sensor inserted. The accuracy of the CGM system may vary from sensor to sensor and over time, and generally declines when used beyond the labeled five or seven day time period. As a result, users who seek to avoid the inconvenience or the expense of changing the sensor regularly during such a short time interval may experience a decline in system performance unless a replacement sensor is inserted. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Inconvenience: Currently available CGM systems generally require the user to wear or carry an extra device to receive and view the glucose readings. This could be particularly inconvenient for people using an insulin pump as it adds to the number of devices they are required to carry. Additionally, because the sensors used in currently available CGM systems may not be reinserted once removed, users are often forced to choose between incurring the costly and inconvenient premature removal of a sensor and limiting certain physical activities, which increases the risks of non-compliance. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Limited safety features: Although most currently available CGM systems audibly alert the user when hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events occur, only some systems provide predictive warnings before such events occur. In addition, no currently available CGM system provides vibratory alerts. We believe that the limited safety features of existing CGM systems leave an unmet need in connection with providing peace of mind for users, specifically when the receiver is off-line or out of range. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Painful and frequent insertion process: All currently available CGM systems include a sensor that must be manually inserted transcutaneously by the user or, in the case of children, by a parent or other caregiver, generally into the abdomen, through a painful and inconvenient procedure. Because of the nature of the self-insertion process, the use of CGM systems requires significant education of the user and, in the case of children, a parent or other caregiver. These systems require people with diabetes to remove and reinsert a new sensor between 50 and 70 times per year. This frequency of required application can lead to a lack of compliance, as the user seeks to avoid the burden, pain and cost associated with replacing sensors. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our Solution 

&#160; 

As a result of the inherent limitations and inconvenience of existing SMBG and CGM systems, we believe that there is a significant unmet need among people with diabetes for an accurate, reliable, long-term, implantable CGM system. Consequently, we have focused our efforts on developing and designing a CGM system that we believe will provide people with diabetes a more convenient and discrete method of CGM, with significantly greater sensor duration, and equal or superior accuracy, than other currently available CGM systems. We believe that Eversense will allow people with diabetes to comply more effectively with their disease management therapies while living their lives with more freedom and greater peace of mind. Eversense is designed to be the first CGM system to continually and accurately measure glucose levels initially for up to 90 days and, in the future, for potentially up to 180 days. 

&#160; 

Eversense consists of three components: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

a small sensor inserted subcutaneously in the upper arm by a healthcare provider; 

&#183; 

an external removable smart transmitter that receives, assesses and relays the data from the sensor and also provides vibratory alerts; and 

&#183; 

a mobile app that receives data from the transmitter and provides real-time glucose readings, alerts and other data on the user's mobile device, such as a smartphone, Apple Watch or tablet. 

&#160; 

In comparison to currently available CGM systems, we believe Eversense will provide the following important advantages: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Best-in-class sensor duration and long-term accuracy &#8212;Eversense achieves continuous glucose readings for up to 90 days with an accuracy equal or superior to that of other currently available CGM systems while requiring fewer than four sensors per year. Currently available CGM sensors are labeled for use for five to seven days, requiring between 50 and 70 sensor insertions per year. We believe that the long-term accuracy and convenience of quarterly insertion and removal will significantly reduce the burden of glucose monitoring for people with diabetes using our system. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Enhanced convenience &#8212;The ability of Eversense to display glucose readings on mobile devices will allow people with diabetes to seamlessly blend the monitoring of their glucose levels with other uses of their mobile devices. People with diabetes will not need to carry a separate handheld receiver to display glucose readings, which is required by currently available CGM systems. In addition, our easily removable smart transmitter will allow people with diabetes to conveniently remove and reapply the transmitter at will without having to also remove the sensor. We believe these convenient features will greatly improve the quality of life and peace of mind for people with diabetes by enhancing their ability to effectively manage their condition across a wide range of activities, from sleeping to higher intensity activities, including sports. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Essential safety features &#8212;Eversense is designed to continuously and accurately monitor glucose levels and provide predictive warnings using a proprietary algorithm, based on the user's personalized alarm settings, before the occurrence of hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events. We believe the personalized alarm will allow the user to intervene and potentially avoid these events entirely. Additionally, our smart transmitter will provide distinct on-body vibrations in a number of alarm situations, including when low or high-glucose related readings are reached or when the transmitter is unable to communicate with the receiver. Unlike other currently available CGM systems, this vibration alert enables our system to warn users of a hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic event even when the user's mobile device is not available or nearby. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Quick and easy sensor insertion and removal &#8212;Our sensor is designed to be inserted and removed by a simple, relatively painless and straightforward five-minute in-office procedure performed by a trained healthcare provider. In a survey of 45 physicians and over 400 people with diabetes conducted by a prominent global strategy consulting firm that we commissioned in 2015, on average, people with diabetes rated the sensor insertion process as neutral to attractive, while a majority of physicians considered the 

&#160;

insertion to be fairly simple or feasible. We believe that the long-term implantable nature of the sensor will also contribute to greater user compliance. 

&#160; 

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

Our goal is to be the global leader in providing long-term, accurate and reliable implantable glucose monitoring systems. The key elements of our strategy include: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Obtain marketing approval of Eversense in Europe, followed by the United States. We have filed for regulatory approval for Eversense in Europe. In July 2015, we applied for a CE mark and, subject to regulatory approval, we expect to begin commercializing Eversense in select European markets in the first half of 2016. We also initiated a single pivotal clinical trial in the United States in the first quarter of 2016, and, if the results of the trial are favorable, we intend to apply for regulatory approval in the United States. We also intend to seek to commercialize our system in other international markets, including Canada, Australia and Israel. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Commercialize our products in Europe and other international markets through a third-party distributor network and in the United States through our own direct sales and marketing organization. In order to ensure broad access to our products for people with diabetes and healthcare providers, we intend to establish a strong third-party distributor network in Europe and other international markets, benefiting from distributors' local market knowledge and taking advantage of local resources while minimizing our infrastructure and capital requirements. We have entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Rubin Medical, or Rubin, to market and sell our products in the Scandinavian region. Rubin has experience in the area, including as the exclusive Scandinavian distributor for the insulin pump manufacturer Animas Corporation. For commercialization in the United States, we intend to establish our own trained, targeted sales force and marketing organization to reach as broad a section of the diabetes population as possible in the most efficient manner. We believe this strategy will ensure broader access to our products for people with diabetes and healthcare providers. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Educate and train healthcare providers and people with diabetes on the benefits of CGM and Eversense. We intend to communicate with and educate healthcare providers, including physicians, certified diabetes educators and nurses, and people with diabetes about the benefits of Eversense and how it can help improve the health and lives of people with diabetes. We have developed an insertion kit that is similar to that used in existing procedures that many healthcare providers are accustomed to performing, and we also intend to develop training programs to help them become comfortable and competent performing the sensor insertion and removal procedures. Finally, we intend to communicate on a regular basis with people with diabetes and their healthcare providers so that we can continue to understand their needs and demands, which will help us to serve them better. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Continuously innovate to introduce enhanced product offerings and pursue expanded indications to meet the needs of people with diabetes . Following our first approved version of Eversense, we intend to continue to expand our Eversense line of product offerings to benefit both people with diabetes and healthcare providers, including system modifications and next generation enhancements, with the goal of increasing the convenience and functionality of the Eversense system. Our planned initiatives include: extending the approved sensor life to up to 180 days; providing on-demand, swipe measurement technology that would permit people with Type 1 diabetes to perform real-time, single glucose readings by swiping their smartphone over our sensor; integrating with insulin pumps; reducing transmitter size; and improving accuracy leading to reduced, or eliminated, calibration. We intend to conduct clinical trials for pediatric indications and to seek approval to market to this part of the population. Additionally, we intend to pursue an on-demand, swipe measurement device targeted to people with Type 2 diabetes. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Establish reimbursement programs for coverage of Eversense to achieve the broadest possible acceptance of our products. Currently available CGM systems are generally reimbursed by a majority of third-party payors. In addition, we will seek to establish a reimbursement program specific to Eversense 

&#160;

insertion and removal in order to achieve reimbursement for these in-office sensor procedures. We believe that establishing such reimbursement will be important in achieving the broadest possible acceptance of our system by healthcare providers. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Focus on low cost manufacturing structure to enhance our profitability. We intend to continue focusing on product design and development, as opposed to investing in manufacturing facilities, by utilizing third-party manufacturers. We intend to reduce our product costs and drive operational efficiencies by employing this scalable, flexible manufacturing approach. 

&#160; 

Clinical Development and Regulatory Pathway 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

In support of our regulatory submissions, we have expended considerable resources designing, developing and refining a glucose monitoring system. Our clinical trials to date have consisted of 12 completed and two ongoing feasibility studies, in which we have tested multiple configurations of our CGM system, as well as our recently completed European pivotal clinical trial. In addition, we initiated a pivotal trial in the United States in the first quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

In total, including our ongoing and completed clinical trials involving the current and prior configurations of Eversense, we have enrolled more than 350 subjects and tested over 700 sensors as of December 31, 2015. To date, we have observed no device-related or procedure-related serious adverse events in any of our trials. The most common adverse events observed have been minor skin rashes related to the adhesive patch and minor infections related to the insertion procedure. 

&#160; 

As described above, a number of our trials are conducted as feasibility studies in which we evaluate various configurations of our CGM system. These studies are intended to assess the performance of different system configurations in a small population of subjects before enrolling a large clinical trial. The configuration changes that we have made to our CGM system over time have generally involved minor alterations to our technology, such as software modifications and algorithm adjustments, in order to enhance the performance of our system, such as extending sensor life and increasing accuracy. Our clinical experience, as of December 31, 2015, is summarized in the table below:

European Pivotal Trial 

&#160; 

We recently completed the 180-day observation period of a prospective, single-arm, multicenter European pivotal clinical trial, in which we enrolled 81 subjects across three sites in Germany, three sites in the United Kingdom and one site in the Netherlands. We began enrolling subjects in this clinical trial in May 2014. The trial was suspended in June 2014, after initially enrolling nine subjects, to allow for a configuration change involving a modification of the software controlling the brightness of the LED contained in the sensor. We filed an amendment to the clinical trial design in October 2014 and recommenced enrollment of the clinical trial, with the revised sensor configuration, in December 2014. Although all subjects in the trial have been assessed through 180 days, we based our CE mark application on the 90-day data from the first 44 subjects who received the revised sensor configuration, who we refer to as the 44 CE mark subjects. We expect to report final 180-day accuracy and safety data for all subjects in the European pivotal trial in the first quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

The subject clinical trial population consists of subjects at least 18 years of age who have a clinically confirmed diagnosis of diabetes and use insulin therapy to intensively manage their diabetes. Subjects who had a history of severe 

&#160;

hypoglycemia, defined as hypoglycemia resulting in loss of consciousness or seizure, or diabetic ketoacidosis, in the six months prior to trial were excluded from participation in the clinical trial. The evaluation period consists of 180 days after treatment. At the initial visit, our sensor was inserted and initial accuracy measurements were taken. Additional accuracy measurements were taken at 14 days and 30 days post-insertion, and on a monthly basis thereafter. These sensor measurements were continued through the earlier of the failure of the sensor or 180 days post-insertion. 

&#160; 

The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the accuracy of Eversense measurements, measured by the MARD, when compared with in vitro blood glucose measurements obtained using the YSI glucose analyzer over successive periods of 30 days through 180 days, as well as to assess the safety of Eversense. YSI in vitro analyzers are bed-side instruments used in hospitals and clinics to accurately measure blood glucose levels and are commonly used as comparators of glucose monitoring systems in clinical trials. MARD is a statistical calculation that measures the average absolute value of the differences, expressed as a percentage, between glucose measurements taken from interstitial fluid based on our CGM system and blood glucose measurements from YSI. The lower the MARD of a glucose monitoring system, the more accurate the system and, therefore, the more reliable the system's readings. A MARD of less than or equal to 20% is generally considered to be a threshold for regulatory approval of a CGM system, although currently available CGM systems generally report an average MARD of approximately 13%. 

&#160; 

Of the 44 CE mark subjects, 39 subjects, representing 89% of all devices, reached 90 days without experiencing a sensor failure. The five sensors that failed prior to day 90 reached days 69 to 85 and these sensors were factored into the MARD calculation described below only through their respective last measurements prior to sensor failure, which in all five instances was at day 60. Based on the 90-day data of the 44 CE mark subjects, we observed an average MARD of 11.4%, and we generally observed that the MARD was relatively consistent over the course of the 90-day observation period beginning with the second measurement. For the first measurement, which occurs on day 1, the MARD is higher due to the process of tissue regeneration shortly after insertion, which temporarily affects the sensor's accuracy. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We have also received 90-day accuracy and safety data for all 71 subjects who received the current configuration of Eversense in the trial. Based on this 90-day data for these 71 subjects, we observed an average MARD of 11.0%, with no device-related or procedure-related serious adverse events. 

&#160; 

We also assessed the accuracy of Eversense among the 44 CE mark subjects using a Clarke Error-Grid. A Clarke Error-Grid is a graphical scatter-plot that is commonly used for assessing the clinical accuracy of blood glucose measurements, as compared to a reference value, such as those measures obtained using YSI glucose analyzers. A Clarke 

&#160;

Error-Grid is categorized into five areas denoted A, B, C, D and E, with A and B being the most clinically desirable and D and E being the least clinically desirable: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Zone A reflects measurements within 20% of the reference and are considered to be accurate; 

&#183; 

Zone B reflects measurements that are outside of 20%, but would not lead to inappropriate treatment; 

&#183; 

Zone C reflects measurements that may lead to an overcorrection of therapy; 

&#183; 

Zone D reflects measurements that could potentially delay treatment for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia; and 

&#183; 

Zone E reflects measurements that are errors and could lead to inappropriate treatment of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. 

&#160; 

The Clarke Error-Grid plot below reflects the accuracy of the 90-day measurements of the 44 CE mark subjects. 

&#160;

In addition, we also assessed, as secondary endpoints in the clinical trial, reductions in A1C levels and the amount of time per day the patients wore the smart transmitter. For the 44 CE mark subjects, we observed an average reduction in A1C levels of 0.5% over the 90 day period. Additionally, on average, the 44 CE mark subjects wore the transmitter for 23.5 hours per day. 

&#160; 

Other Completed and Ongoing Clinical Trials 

&#160; 

To date, we have completed numerous feasibility studies to assess the accuracy and safety of various configurations of Eversense, including the current configuration of Eversense. In addition, we are conducting ongoing feasibility studies in which we are evaluating future potential configurations of Eversense. We conducted feasibility studies evaluating the current configuration of Eversense in Romania, India and South Africa in 2014. In each case, these studies involved the testing of Eversense over a 90-day measurement period with 90-day MARD results comparable to the results from our European clinical trial described above. 

&#160; 

&#160;

United States Pivotal Trial 

&#160; 

In July 2015, we applied for an IDE from the FDA, which was approved in November 2015, to initiate a single pivotal clinical trial in the United States, which we initiated in the United States in the first quarter of 2016. This trial will be conducted at seven to ten sites in the United States and enroll approximately 90 subjects. The 90-subject clinical trial population will consist of adult subjects at least 18 years of age who have a clinically confirmed diagnosis of diabetes for more than one year. We are excluding subjects from the clinical trial who have a history of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis in the six months prior to the trial. 

&#160; 

In the trial, we will measure the accuracy of Eversense measurements through 90 days after insertion. We will also assess safety through 90 days after insertion or sensor removal and measure the incidence of device-related and procedure-related serious adverse events. If the results of the trial are favorable, we intend to apply for regulatory approval as promptly as possible to market our product in the United States. We believe that we could file for U.S. marketing approval as early as the second half of 2016 and expect that the pre-market approval, or PMA, process could take between six and 18 months. 

&#160; 

Our Technology 

&#160; 

Eversense consists of three primary components: a small sensor inserted subcutaneously under the skin by a healthcare provider; an external removable smart transmitter that receives, assesses and relays data from the sensor and provides vibratory alerts; and a mobile app that receives data from the transmitter and provides real-time glucose readings, alerts and other data on the person's mobile device. All of these components work together to provide sensor glucose values, trends and alerts to a user's mobile device within 20 milliseconds. We have designed this reliable, long-term and implantable CGM system to continually and accurately measure a person's glucose levels for up to 180 days. As with currently available CGM systems, Eversense will initially require twice daily fingerstick calibrations. Further, upon receiving an alert from the CGM, a patient should confirm CGM measurements with test-strip measurements prior to self-medicating, as noted in the CGM's label and instructions. 

&#160; 

Smart Sensor 

&#160; 

The smart sensor is designed to be inserted under the skin, either in the back of the upper arm or in the abdomen, and measures the glucose in the interstitial fluid. These glucose levels are then communicated wirelessly to the smart transmitter. We have designed the sensor to last up to 180 days, as compared to other currently available CGM sensors labeled for use for between five and seven days. 

&#160; 

The sensor consists of an optical system, known as a micro-fluorometer, encased in a rigid, translucent polymer capsule, which is 3.3 mm in diameter and 15 mm in length. The capsule is coated with a glucose-indicating hydrogel that is bound to the surface of the capsule through polymerization. This hydrogel is energized, or excited, by a light-emitting diode, or LED, contained in the optical system of the sensor, causing the hydrogel to fluoresce, or glow. Two photodiodes within the optical system of the sensor measure the degree of fluorescence of the hydrogel, which is 

&#160;

proportional to the level of glucose present in the interstitial fluid. The sensor then communicates the amount of fluorescence via a near field communication, or NFC, interface to the transmitter. NFC is a high frequency wireless communication technology that enables the exchange of data and energy between devices over a short range. The entire capsule is coated by a glucose-permeable membrane for biocompatibility. 

&#160; 

The sensor does not contain a battery or other stored power source. Instead, it is remotely and discretely powered, as needed, by an inductive NFC link between the sensor and the transmitter. On power-up, the LED source is energized for approximately five milliseconds to excite the hydrogel. Between readings every five minutes, the sensor remains electrically dormant and fully powered down. 

&#160; 

Smart Transmitter 

&#160; 

The removable smart transmitter is a rechargeable, external device that is worn over the sensor implantation site using a daily adhesive patch or band, such as an armband or waistband. The transmitter supplies wireless power to the sensor through an inductive NFC link, which activates a measurement sequence every five minutes. The transmitter then receives data from the sensor and calculates glucose concentrations and trends. Based on these calculations and on the user's individual settings for glucose levels, the transmitter determines if an alert condition exists, in which case the transmitter communicates the condition to the user through on-body vibration. The information from the transmitter is also transmitted for display to the user's mobile device via Bluetooth. Our transmitter is functional for at least 72 hours without recharging and can be fully charged in ten minutes. 

&#160; 

Mobile App 

&#160; 

Our mobile app is a software application that runs on both iOS mobile devices, including iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches, and Android mobile devices. The mobile app receives information from the transmitter via Bluetooth and displays that information discreetly to the user. This user-friendly, intuitive app provides real-time glucose readings, trends, graphs and alarms. Within the mobile app, users can set alarms based on, among other things, glucose levels. The mobile app also allows for cloud-based storage. 

&#160; 

Future Product Development 

&#160; 

Following our first generation Eversense, we intend to continue to expand our line of product offerings to benefit both people with diabetes and healthcare providers. We expect these product development initiatives to include system modifications and next generation enhancements that we believe will further increase the convenience and appeal 

&#160;

of our products to people with diabetes and healthcare providers. Our ongoing and planned development initiatives include:

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

Our initial focus will be to commercialize our product in select European markets through third-party distributors. We plan to initially target markets where there is already an understanding and market acceptance of CGM, such as Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Germany. We plan to work with third-party distributors in Europe who are experienced or familiar with the regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction and with selling, marketing and supporting diabetes devices for the intensively-managed diabetic population. To date, we have entered into one European distribution agreement with Rubin to market, sell and distribute Eversense in Sweden, Norway and Denmark. 

&#160; 

Based on the size and maturity of the U.S. market, our plan is to invest in developing a direct sales force and infrastructure to support the launch of the product in the United States and target what we estimate to be approximately 2,100 endocrinologists in the United States who are clinically active and diabetes-focused. 

&#160; 

As people with diabetes often consult with their healthcare providers about treatment options, we believe that educating healthcare providers regarding the benefits of Eversense compared to SMBG and other currently available CGM systems is an important step in promoting its use in people with diabetes. In a survey of 45 physicians and over 400 people with diabetes conducted by a prominent global strategy consulting firm that we commissioned in 2015, healthcare providers highly valued the accuracy and sensor duration of our system and the majority of physicians surveyed considered the insertion process to be fairly simple or feasible. Approximately three out of four physicians preferred Eversense for their patients with intensively managed diabetes. In addition, approximately four out of five intensively managed non-CGM patients who preferred a CGM option over SMBG preferred Eversense over other currently available CGM systems. We intend to educate healthcare providers and people with diabetes on the advantages of Eversense compared to SMBG and other currently available CGM systems. We also intend to establish a customer care center to provide ongoing support to people with diabetes and healthcare providers. 

&#160; 

Rubin Medical 

&#160; 

In September 2015, we entered into a distribution agreement with Rubin, pursuant to which we granted Rubin the exclusive right to market, sell and distribute Eversense in Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Pursuant to the agreement, 

&#160;

Rubin is obligated to purchase from us specified minimum volumes of Eversense components at pre-determined prices, which are subject to potential amendment upon the occurrence of specified events. Rubin is responsible for the promotion, sale and distribution of Eversense in Sweden, Norway and Denmark at such prices as Rubin determines in its sole discretion, subject to specified exceptions. 

&#160; 

The distribution agreement has an initial term of five years and is subject to renewal for up to two additional five year periods if, at least 180 days prior to the expiration of a term, we and Rubin agree to minimum purchase requirements for the additional term and we do not increase the purchase price of Eversense components that are subject to existing publicly procured contracts unless Rubin can pass through the price increase to the customer. 

&#160; 

The distribution agreement is terminable by us upon 30 days' notice under a number of circumstances, including if Rubin fails to make required payments, Rubin competes with us or Rubin seeks to distribute Eversense outside of Sweden, Norway or Denmark. The agreement is terminable by Rubin upon 30 days' notice under a number of circumstances, including if we breach the warranties of the agreement, fail to obtain marketing approval or fail to satisfy our supply obligations. The agreement is terminable by either party if the other party fails to comply with marketing laws, violates the confidentiality or intellectual property protection provisions of the agreement, becomes insolvent, or becomes subject to specified convictions, injections or enforcement actions. The termination rights contained in the agreement generally are subject to an opportunity to cure. Further, we may terminate the agreement upon a change of control of our company that occurs after December 31, 2017, subject to us providing 180 days written notice and paying a specified termination fee to Rubin. 

&#160; 

Reimbursement 

&#160; 

Coverage in the United States 

&#160; 

Reimbursement from private third-party healthcare payors and, to a lesser extent, Medicare will be an important element of our success. Although the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, or CMS, established, effective 2008, Alpha-Numeric Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes that will be applicable to each of the components of Eversense, to date, Medicare has not adopted a national coverage determination with respect to CGM systems. It is not known when, if ever, Medicare will adopt such a national coverage determination. In addition, each of the Medicare contractors responsible for developing local coverage policies for medical equipment under Medicare Part B&#8212;the Durable Medical Equipment Medicare Administrative Contractors&#8212;have published non-coverage determinations for CGM systems, concluding that there was no available Medicare benefit for the products because they are "precautionary." As a result, CMS does not currently reimburse patients for the cost of a CGM system, like Eversense, although the cost of certain related medical services may be reimbursed. Until such time as adequate coverage is extended by CMS and/or its contractors, as applicable, reimbursement of our products will generally be limited to customers covered by those third-party payors that have adopted policies recognizing coverage and reimbursement for CGM devices. As of December 31, 2015, several of the largest private third-party payors, in terms of the number of covered lives, have issued coverage policies for the category of CGM devices. These policies include varied requirements regarding patient condition and characteristics. Many of these coverage policies reimburse for CGM systems under durable medical equipment benefits, which are restrictive in nature and require the healthcare provider or supplier to comply with extensive documentation and other requirements. We intend to seek coverage for Eversense as a medical benefit, which could avoid some of these restrictions, although we may not be successful in doing so. In addition, customers who are insured by payors that do not offer coverage for our devices will have to bear the financial cost of the products. 

&#160; 

Although we believe that our products will generally be covered by most third-party payors described above, current reimbursement codes for the insertion or removal procedures do not describe physician work and related resources required for Eversense. Therefore, we plan to pursue new Category III CPT codes for the insertion and removal procedures. We have applied for these codes and will seek to secure these codes in advance of the U.S. launch, with the goal that healthcare providers and third-party payors will be able to use these codes to cover the insertion and removal of Eversense immediately upon our product launch. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining these codes or that they will be recognized by payors. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We have employed a reimbursement consultant to assist us in securing reimbursement agreements with third-party payors and to assist in developing the optimal strategy for pursuing new reimbursement code approval. In addition, we intend to commence negotiations with third-party payors by the first quarter of 2017. However, unless third-party and government payors provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for Eversense and the related insertion and removal procedures, people with diabetes might choose not to use our products on a widespread basis. 

&#160; 

Medicare, Medicaid, health maintenance organizations and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new medical devices, and, as a result, their coverage policies may be restrictive, or they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our products. In order to obtain reimbursement arrangements, we may have to agree to a net sales price lower than the net sales price we might charge in other sales channels. Our revenue may be limited by the continuing efforts of government and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare through various increasingly sophisticated means, such as requiring prospective reimbursement and second opinions, purchasing in groups, or redesigning benefits. Our future dependence on the commercial success of Eversense makes us particularly susceptible to any cost containment or reduction efforts. Accordingly, unless government and other third-party payors provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products and the related insertion and removal procedures, our financial performance may be limited. 

&#160; 

Coverage Outside the United States 

&#160; 

In countries outside the United States, coverage for CGM systems is obtained from various sources, including governmental authorities, private health insurance plans, and labor unions. Coverage systems in international markets vary significantly by country and, within some countries, by region. Coverage approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country, region-by-region or, in some instances, a case-by case basis. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing and Quality Assurance 

&#160; 

We currently outsource the manufacture of all components of our system. We plan to continue with an outsourced manufacturing arrangement for the foreseeable future. Our contract manufacturers are all recognized in their field for their competency to manufacture the respective portions of our system and have quality systems established that meet FDA requirements. We believe the manufacturers we currently utilize have sufficient capacity to meet our launch requirements and are able to scale up their capacity relatively quickly with minimal capital investment. We believe that, as we increase our demand in the future, our per unit costs will decrease materially. 

&#160; 

We have received certification from T&#220;V S&#220;D, our Notified Body to the International Standards Organization, or ISO, for our quality system. This ISO 13485 certification includes design control requirements. As a medical device manufacturer, the facilities of our sterilization and other critical suppliers are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies. We believe that our quality systems and those of our suppliers are robust and achieve high product quality. 

&#160; 

Our suppliers are managed through our supplier management program that is focused on reducing supply chain risk. Key aspects of this program include managing component inventory at the supplier, contractual requirements for last time buy opportunities and second sourcing approaches for specific suppliers. Typically, our outside vendors produce the components to our specifications and in many instances to our designs. Our suppliers are audited periodically by our quality department to ensure conformity with the specifications, policies and procedures for our devices. We believe that, if necessary, alternative sources of supply would be available in a relatively short period of time and on commercially reasonable terms. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Our research and development team includes employees who specialize in chemistry, software engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and graphical user interface design, many of whom have considerable experience in diabetes-related medical devices. Our research and development team focuses on the products currently under development, including our clinical trials, as well as feasibility studies in which we are evaluating different design 

&#160;

configurations to enhance product functionality for future generations of Eversense. Our research and development expenses were $18.3 million and $12.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The market for CGM systems is developing and competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions. We expect to compete with well-capitalized companies, some of which are publicly-traded, that manufacture CGM systems including Dexcom, Medtronic and Abbott. Each of these three companies has received approval from the FDA to market their respective CGM system. Dexcom's Bluetooth-enabled CGM system is designed to be integrated with smartphones. 

&#160; 

As the industry evolves, we anticipate encountering increasing competition from companies that integrate CGM with insulin pumps. We are aware of three companies, Johnson &#38; Johnson, Medtronic and Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc., which have received FDA approval for CGM-integrated insulin pumps. Johnson &#38; Johnson's system integrates Dexcom's CGM sensor technology and smartphone compatibility. 

&#160; 

In addition to CGM providers, we will also compete with providers of traditional SMBG systems. Four companies currently account for substantially all of the worldwide sales of SMBG systems: Roche Diabetes Care, a division of Roche Diagnostics; LifeScan, Inc., a division of Johnson &#38; Johnson; Abbott; and Bayer Diabetes Care, which has agreed to merge with Panasonic Healthcare Holdings. 

&#160; 

We may also compete with companies, including Roche Diagnostics and Abbott, developing next generation real-time CGM or sensing devices and technologies, as well as several other companies that are evaluating non-invasive CGM products to measure a user's blood glucose level. For example, Abbott is developing its FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System, which has received the CE mark in Europe and eliminates the need for routine fingersticks by reading glucose levels through a transcutaneous sensor that can be worn for up to 14 days. There are also a number of academic and other institutions involved in various phases of our industry's technology development. 

&#160; 

Although we will face potential competition from many different sources, we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources will provide us with competitive advantages. The key competitive factors affecting the success of Eversense, if approved, are likely to be: the accuracy, sensor duration, safety, convenience and price of treatment; the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors; effective sales, marketing and distribution; brand awareness and acceptance by healthcare providers and people with diabetes; customer service and support and comprehensive education for people with diabetes and their healthcare providers; and rapid product innovation, including insulin pump integration. 

&#160; 

Many of the companies against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or earlier stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our development. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Protection of our intellectual property is a strategic priority for our business. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets as well as nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements, material transfer agreements, confidentiality agreements and other measures to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Patents 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we held a total of approximately 350 issued patents and pending patent applications that relate to our CGM system. Our intellectual property portfolio includes 37 issued United States patents, 202 patents issued in countries outside the United States and 111 pending patent applications worldwide. Our patents expire between 2015 and 2030, subject to any patent extensions that may be available for such patents. If patents are issued on our pending patent applications, the resulting patents are projected to expire on dates ranging from 2020 to 2035. 

&#160; 

Our patents and patent applications cover certain aspects of our core sensor technologies and our product concepts for CGM systems. However, our patent applications may not result in issued patents, and any patents that have been issued or may be issued in the future may not protect the commercially important aspects of our technology. Furthermore, the validity and enforceability of our issued patents may be challenged by third parties and our patents could be invalidated or modified by the issuing governmental authority. Third parties may independently develop technology that is not covered by our patents that is similar to or competes with our technology. In addition, our intellectual property may be infringed or misappropriated by third parties, particularly in foreign countries where the laws and governmental authorities may not protect our proprietary rights as effectively as those in the United States. 

&#160; 

The medical device industry in general, and the glucose testing sector of this industry in particular, are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on assertions of patent infringement. We are aware of numerous patents issued to third parties that may relate to the technology used in our business, including the design and manufacture of CGM sensors and CGM systems, as well as methods for continuous glucose monitoring. Each of these patents contains multiple claims, any one of which may be independently asserted against us. The owners of these patents may assert that the manufacture, use, sale or offer for sale of our CGM sensors or CGM systems infringes one or more claims of their patents. Furthermore, there may be additional patents issued to third parties of which we are presently unaware that may relate to aspects of our technology that such third parties could assert against us and materially and adversely affect our business. In addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be patent applications that are currently pending and unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that third parties could assert against us and materially and adversely affect our business. 

&#160; 

Any adverse determination in litigations, post grant trial proceedings, including interference proceedings, at the Patent Office relating to intellectual property to which we are or may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties, and result in the cancellation and/or invalidation of our intellectual property. Furthermore, if a court finds that we have willfully infringed a third party's intellectual property, we could be required to pay treble damages and/or attorney fees for the prevailing party, in addition to other penalties. Although intellectual property disputes in the medical device area are often settled through licensing or similar arrangements, costs associated with such arrangements can be substantial and often require ongoing royalty payments. We may be unable to obtain necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. If we do not obtain necessary licenses, we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement; if we are able to redesign our products to avoid infringement, we may not receive FDA approval in a timely manner. Adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products, which could have a significant adverse impact on our business. 

&#160; 

Trademarks 

&#160; 

We have 12 pending U.S. trademark applications, including applications for the "Eversense" trademark, and eight pending foreign trademark applications, as well as four foreign trademark registrations. 

&#160; 

Trade Secrets 

&#160; 

We also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect such intellectual property and proprietary information by generally requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement as the case may be. Our agreements with our employees prohibit them from providing us with any intellectual property or proprietary 

&#160;

information of third parties. We also generally require confidentiality agreements or material transfer agreements with third parties that receive or have access to our confidential information, data or other materials. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that our employees and third parties that have access to our confidential proprietary information will abide by the terms of their agreements. Despite the measures that we take to protect our intellectual property and confidential information, unauthorized third parties may copy aspects of our products or obtain and use our proprietary information. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Eversense is a medical device subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA, the U.S. Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, or CMS, the European Commission, and regulatory bodies in other countries. Regulations cover virtually every critical aspect of a medical device company's business operations, including research activities, product development, contracting, reimbursement, medical communications, and sales and marketing. In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the implementing regulations of the FDA govern product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, product manufacturing, import and export, product labeling, product storage, recalls and field safety corrective actions, advertising and promotion, product sales and distribution, and post-market clinical surveillance. Our business is subject to federal, state, local, and foreign regulations, such as ISO 13485, ISO 14971, FDA's Quality System Regulation, or QSR, contained in 21 CFR Part 820, and the European Commission's Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices and its amendments and Directive 90/385/EEC concerning active implantable medical devices, as amended. 

&#160; 

Regulation by the FDA 

&#160; 

The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in Class I or II. Class I devices are subject to general controls such as labeling, pre-market notification and adherence to the FDA's QSR, which cover manufacturers' methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of products, but are usually exempt from premarket notification requirements. Class II devices are subject to the same general controls, may be subject to special controls such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, FDA guidelines, or particularized labeling, and may also require clinical testing prior to clearance or approval. Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls, including devices that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury. 

&#160; 

Some Class I and Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the pre-market notification requirement under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, and the requirement of compliance with substantially all of the QSR. However, a pre-market approval, or PMA application, is required for devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or certain implantable devices, or those that are "not substantially equivalent" either to a device previously cleared through the 510(k) process or to a "preamendment" Class III device in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 when PMA applications were not required. The PMA approval process is more comprehensive than the 510(k) clearance process and typically takes several years to complete. Eversense is likely to be considered a Class III device, which is how other currently available CGM systems are also classified by the FDA. Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified CGM system we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either 510(k) clearance or approval from the FDA through the PMA process. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be expensive, lengthy and require payment of significant user fees. 

&#160; 

We held discussions with the FDA in the second quarter of 2015 regarding the appropriate regulatory requirements for obtaining approval and accordingly, we currently intend to file a PMA submission for this device. A PMA application must be supported by valid scientific evidence that typically includes extensive technical, pre-clinical, clinical, manufacturing and labeling data, to demonstrate to the FDA's satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device. A PMA application also must include a complete description of the device and its components, a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture the device, and proposed labeling. After a PMA application is submitted and found to be sufficiently complete, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information. 

&#160;

During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA. In addition, the FDA generally will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to evaluate compliance with QSR, which requires manufacturers to implement and follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. 

&#160; 

FDA review of a PMA application generally takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the device may not be safe, effective, reliable or accurate to the FDA's satisfaction; 

&#183; 

the data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support approval; 

&#183; 

the manufacturing process or facilities may not meet applicable requirements; and 

&#183; 

changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data. 

&#160; 

If an FDA evaluation of a PMA application is favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter, or approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of a device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA's evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA also may determine that additional tests or clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing. 

&#160; 

New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that has been approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. 

&#160; 

Clinical trials are typically required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for a 510(k) clearance. These trials generally require submission of an application for an IDE, to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for abbreviated IDE requirements. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. The FDA's approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward, but it does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product's safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria. All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA's IDE regulations that govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Clinical trials must further comply with the FDA's regulations for institutional review board approval and for informed consent and other human subject protections. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant approval or clearance of a product. The commencement or completion of any clinical trial may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application, for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

the FDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or place a clinical trial on hold; 

&#183; 

patients do not enroll in clinical trials at the rate expected; 

&#183; 

patients do not comply with trial protocols; 

&#160;

&#183; 

patient follow-up is not at the rate expected; 

&#183; 

patients experience adverse side effects; 

&#183; 

patients die during a clinical trial, even though their death may not be related to the products that are part of our trial; 

&#183; 

institutional review boards and third-party clinical investigators may delay or reject the trial protocol; 

&#183; 

third-party clinical investigators decline to participate in a trial or do not perform a trial on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, good clinical practices or other FDA requirements; 

&#183; 

we or third-party organizations do not perform data collection, monitoring and analysis in a timely or accurate manner or consistent with the clinical trial protocol or investigational or statistical plans; 

&#183; 

third-party clinical investigators have significant financial interests related to us or our study that the FDA deems to make the study results unreliable, or the company or investigators fail to disclose such interests; 

&#183; 

regulatory inspections of our clinical trials or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials; 

&#183; 

changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions; 

&#183; 

the interim or final results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or efficacy; and 

&#183; 

the FDA concludes that our trial design is inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy. 

&#160; 

International Regulation 

&#160; 

International sales of medical devices are subject to local government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval in another country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, and the requirements may differ. There is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the European Union, United States, Canada and various other industrialized countries. 

&#160; 

The primary regulatory body in Europe is that of the European Union, the European Commission, which includes most of the major countries in Europe. Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices. The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout Europe. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third party assessment by a "Notified Body." This third-party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer's quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer's product. An assessment by a Notified Body of one country within the European Union is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the European Union. Additional local requirements may apply on a country-by-country basis. Outside of the European Union, regulatory approval would need to be sought on a country-by-country basis in order for us to market our products. 

&#160; 

Other Regulatory Requirements 

&#160; 

Even after a device receives clearance or approval and is placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

establishment registration and device listing; 

&#183; 

QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; 

&#183; 

labeling regulations that prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or "off-label" uses, and impose other restrictions on labeling, advertising and promotion; 

&#183; 

MDR regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; 

&#160;

&#183; 

voluntary and mandatory device recalls to address problems when a device is defective and could be a risk to health; and 

&#183; 

corrections and removals reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health. 

&#160; 

Also, the FDA may require us to conduct post-market surveillance studies or establish and maintain a system for tracking our products through the chain of distribution to the patient level. The FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Health Services enforce regulatory requirements by conducting periodic, unannounced inspections and market surveillance. Inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. 

&#160; 

Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement actions by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. These may include any of the following sanctions or consequences: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

warning letters or untitled letters that require corrective action; 

&#183; 

fines and civil penalties; 

&#183; 

unanticipated expenditures; 

&#183; 

delays in approving or refusal to approve future products; 

&#183; 

FDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries; 

&#183; 

suspension or withdrawal of FDA clearance or approval; 

&#183; 

product recall or seizure; 

&#183; 

interruption of production; 

&#183; 

operating restrictions; 

&#183; 

injunctions; and 

&#183; 

criminal prosecution. 

&#160; 

Our contract manufacturers, specification developers and some suppliers of components or device accessories, also are required to manufacture our products in compliance with current good manufacturing practice requirements set forth in the QSR. The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and it includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components or services, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing, and record keeping. The FDA evaluates compliance with the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. If the FDA believes that any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers are not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down such manufacturing operations, require recall of our products, refuse to approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees. 

&#160; 

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and Similar Foreign and State Laws and Regulations Affecting the Transmission, Security and Privacy of Health Information 

&#160; 

We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA's security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as service providers of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from HIPAA and each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Foreign data privacy regulations, such as the EU Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC), and the country-specific regulations that implement Directive 95/46/EC, also govern the processing of personally identifiable data, and may be stricter than U.S. laws. 

&#160; 

Fraud and Abuse Laws 

&#160; 

In addition to FDA restrictions, there are numerous U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws. Our relationships with healthcare providers and other third parties are subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including the Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs. 

&#160; 

Federal Anti-Kickback and Self-Referral Laws 

&#160; 

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging of a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term "remuneration" has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including such items as gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, waiver of payments and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a review of all its relevant facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute's intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of (or purchases, or recommendations related to) federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been implicated and potentially violated. 

&#160; 

The penalties for violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include imprisonment for up to five years, fines of up to $25,000 per violation and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many states have adopted prohibitions similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which do not have the same exceptions and apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Further, the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA. Specifically, as noted above, under the Anti-Kickback Statute, the government must prove the defendant acted "knowingly" to prove a violation occurred. The PPACA added a provision to clarify that with respect to violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute, "a person need not have actual knowledge" of the statute or specific intent to commit a violation of the statute. This change effectively overturns case law interpretations that set a higher standard under which prosecutors had to prove the specific intent to violate the law. In addition, the PPACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. 

&#160; 

We plan to provide the initial training to patients necessary for appropriate use of our products either through our own diabetes educators or by contracting with outside diabetes educators that have completed an appropriate training course. Outside diabetes educators are reimbursed for their services at fair market value. 

&#160; 

Noncompliance with the federal anti-kickback legislation could result in our exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs, restrictions on our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions, and civil and criminal penalties. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Federal law also includes a provision commonly known as the "Stark Law," which prohibits a physician from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity providing "designated health services," including a company that furnishes durable medical equipment, in which the physician has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician has entered into a compensation arrangement. Violation of the Stark Law could result in denial of payment, disgorgement of reimbursements received under a noncompliant arrangement, civil penalties, and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. We believe that we have structured our provider arrangements to comply with current Stark Law requirements. 

&#160; 

Nevertheless, a determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions. 

&#160; 

Additionally, as some of these laws are still evolving, we lack definitive guidance as to the application of certain key aspects of these laws as they relate to our arrangements with providers with respect to patient training. We cannot predict the final form that these regulations will take or the effect that the final regulations will have on us. As a result, our provider and training arrangements may ultimately be found to be not in compliance with applicable federal law. 

&#160; 

Federal False Claims Act 

&#160; 

The Federal False Claims Act provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. In addition, amendments in 1986 to the Federal False Claims Act have made it easier for private parties to bring "qui tam" whistleblower lawsuits against companies under the Federal False Claims Act. Penalties include fines ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 for each false claim, plus three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act of that person. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a false claim action, pay fines or be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action. 

&#160; 

There are other federal anti-fraud laws that that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 

&#160; 

Additionally, HIPAA established two federal crimes in the healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment. 

&#160; 

Civil Monetary Penalties Law 

&#160; 

In addition to the Anti-Kickback Statute and the civil and criminal False Claims Acts, the federal government has the authority to seek civil monetary penalties, or CMPs, assessments, and exclusion against an individual or entity based on a wide variety of prohibited conduct. For example, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law authorizes the imposition of substantial CMPs against an entity that engages in activities including, but not limited to: (1) knowingly presenting or causing to be presented, a claim for services not provided as claimed or which is otherwise false or fraudulent in any way; (2) knowingly giving or causing to be given false or misleading information reasonably expected to i nfluence the decision to discharge a patient; (3) offering or giving remuneration to any beneficiary of a federal health care program likely to influence the receipt of reimbursable items or services; (4) arranging for reimbursable services with an entity 

&#160;

which is excluded from participation from a federal health care program; (5) knowingly or willfully soliciting or receiving remuneration for a referral of a federal health care program beneficiary; or (6) using a payment intended for a federal health care program beneficiary for another use. Noncompliance can result in civil money penalties of up to $10,000 for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the federal healthcare programs. 

&#160; 

State Fraud and Abuse Provisions 

&#160; 

Many states have also adopted some form of anti-kickback and anti-referral laws and a false claims act. We believe that we are in conformance to such laws. Nevertheless, a determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions. 

&#160; 

Physician Payment Sunshine Act 

&#160; 

Transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers and teaching hospitals may also impact our business practices. The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires most medical device manufacturers to report annually to the Secretary of Human Health Services financial arrangements, payments, or other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals. The payment information is made publicly available in a searchable format on a CMS website. Over the next several years, we will need to dedicate significant resources to establish and maintain systems and processes in order to comply with these regulations. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements can result in significant civil monetary penalties. Similar laws have been enacted or are under consideration in foreign jurisdictions. 

&#160; 

U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 

&#160; 

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making corrupt payments, gifts or transfers to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad.
